<span class="smaller">THE EMPEROR’S VISION</span></h3>

<p>It was at the time when Augustus was emperor in
Rome and Herod was king in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>It happened once upon a time that a very great
and holy night sank down over the earth. It was
the darkest night ever seen by man; it seemed as if
the whole earth had passed under a vault. It was
impossible to distinguish water from land, or to find
the way on the most familiar paths. And it could
not be otherwise, for not a ray of light came from
the sky. All the stars stayed in their houses, and
the fair moon kept her face turned away.</p>

<p>And just as intense as the darkness was the silence
and the calm. The rivers stood still in their course;
the wind did not stir, and even the leaves of the
aspen ceased to tremble. Any one walking by the
sea would have found that the waves no longer broke
on the shore, and the sand of the desert did not
crunch under the wanderer’s foot. Everything was
as if turned to stone and without motion, in order
not to disturb the holy night. The grass did not
dare to grow, the dew could not fall, and the flowers
feared to exhale their perfume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>During that night the beasts of prey did not hunt,
the serpents did not sting, the dogs did not bay.
And what was even more wonderful, none of the
inanimate things would have disturbed the holiness
of the night by lending themselves to an evil deed.
No false key could open a lock, and no knife could
shed blood.</p>

<p>In Rome, on that very night, a little group of
people came down from the emperor’s palace on the
Palatine and made their way over the Forum to the
Capitol. During the day just completed his councillors
had asked the emperor if they might not raise
a temple to him on Rome’s holy mountain. But
Augustus had not immediately given his consent.
He did not know if it would be pleasing to the
gods for him to possess a temple next to theirs, and
he had answered that he wished first to discover by
a nocturnal sacrifice to his genius what their wishes
were. Followed by a few faithful retainers, he was
now on his way to perform that sacrifice.</p>

<p>Augustus was carried in his litter, for he was
old, and the long stairs to the Capitol fatigued him.
He held the cage of doves which was his offering.
Neither priests, nor soldiers, nor councillors accompanied
him; only his nearest friends. Torch-bearers
walked in front of him, as if to force a way through
the darkness of the night, and behind him followed
slaves, carrying the tripod, the charcoal, the knives,
the holy fire, and everything needed for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>On the way the emperor chatted gayly with his
retainers, and none of them noticed the infinite
silence and calm of the night. It was only on reaching
the open place on the top of the Capitol, which
had been thought of for the new temple, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
was revealed to them that something unusual was
occurring.</p>

<p>It could not be a night like any other, for on the
edge of the cliff they saw the strangest being. They
thought at first that it was an old twisted olive
trunk; then they thought that an ancient statue
from the temple of Jupiter had wandered out on the
cliff. At last they saw that it could only be the old
sibyl.</p>

<p>They had never seen anything so old, so weather-beaten,
and so gigantic. If the emperor had not been
there, they would have all fled home to their beds.
“It is she,” they whispered to each other, “who
counts as many years as there are grains of sand on
her native shores. Why has she come out of her
cave to-night? What does she foretell to the
emperor and to the country, she who writes her
prophecies on the leaves of trees, and knows that the
wind carries the words of the oracle to him who
needs them?”</p>

<p>They were so terrified that all would have fallen
on their knees with their foreheads to the ground
had the sibyl made the slightest movement. But
she sat as still as if she had been without life.
Crouched on the very edge of the cliff, and shading
her eyes with her hand, she stared out into the
night. She sat there as if she had gone up on the
hill the better to see something happening far
away. She alone could see something in the black
night!</p>

<p>At the same moment the emperor and all his suite
perceived how intense the darkness was. Not one
of them could see a hand’s-breadth in front of him.
And what a calm, what silence! They could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
even hear the rippling murmur of the Tiber. The
air seemed to choke them; a cold sweat came out on
their foreheads, and their hands were stiff and powerless.
They thought that something dreadful must
be impending.</p>

<p>But no one liked to show that he was afraid, and
everybody told the emperor that it was a good omen;
nature herself held her breath to greet a new god.</p>

<p>They urged Augustus to hurry, and said that the
old sibyl had probably come up from her cave to
greet his genius.</p>

<p>But the truth was that the old sibyl, engrossed in
a vision, did not even know that Augustus had come
to the Capitol. She was transported in spirit to
a far distant land, where she thought she was wandering
over a great plain. In the darkness she kept
striking her foot against something, which she
thought to be tufts of grass. She bent down and
felt with her hand. No, they were not tufts of
grass, but sheep. She was walking among great
sleeping flocks of sheep.</p>

<p>Then she perceived the fire of the shepherds. It
was burning in the middle of the plain, and she
approached it. The shepherds were lying asleep by
the fire, and at their sides they had long, pointed
staves, with which they defended their flocks from
wild beasts. But the little animals with shining
eyes and bushy tails, which crept forward to the
fire, were they not jackals? And yet the shepherds
did not throw their staves at them; the dogs continued
to sleep; the sheep did not flee; and the wild
beasts lay down to rest beside the men.</p>

<p>All this the sibyl saw, but of what was going on
behind her on the mountain she knew nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
She did not know that people were raising an altar,
lighting charcoal, strewing incense, and that the
emperor was taking one of the doves out of the cage
to make a sacrifice to her. But his hands were so
benumbed that he could not hold the bird. With a
single flap of her wings the dove freed herself, and
disappeared into the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>When that happened, the courtiers looked suspiciously
at the old sibyl. They thought that it
was she who was the cause of the misfortune.</p>

<p>Could they know that the sibyl still thought she
was standing by the shepherds’ fire, and that she
was now listening to a faint sound which came vibrating
through the dead silence of the night? She had
heard it for a long time before she noticed that it
came from the sky, and not from the earth. At
last she raised her head, and saw bright, glistening
forms gliding about up in the darkness. They were
small bands of angels, who, singing, and apparently
searching, flew up and down the wide plain.</p>

<p>While the sibyl listened to the angels’ song, the
emperor was preparing for a new sacrifice. He
washed his hands, purified the altar, and grasped the
other dove. But although he now made a special
effort to hold it fast, the bird slipped through his
fingers, and swung itself up into the impenetrable
night.</p>

<p>The emperor was appalled. He fell on his knees
before the empty altar and prayed to his genius.
He called on him for strength to avert the misfortunes
which this night seemed to portend.</p>

<p>Nothing of all this had the sibyl heard. She was
listening with her whole soul to the angels’ song,
which was growing stronger and stronger. At last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
it became so loud that it wakened the shepherds.
They raised themselves on their elbows, and saw
shining hosts of silvery angels moving in the darkness
in long, fluttering lines, like birds of passage.
Some had lutes and violins in their hands; others
had zithers and harps, and their song sounded as gay
as children’s laughter, and as free from care as the
trilling of a lark. When the shepherds heard it
they rose up to go to the village which was their
home, to tell of the miracle.</p>

<p>They went by a narrow, winding path, and the
sibyl followed them. Suddenly it became light on
the mountain. A great, bright star kindled over it,
and the village on its top shone like silver in the
starlight. All the wandering bands of angels
hastened thither with cries of jubilation, and the
shepherds hurried on so fast that they almost ran.
When they had reached the town they found that
the angels had gathered over a low stable near the
gate. It was a wretched building, with roof of
straw, and the bare rock for one wall. Above it
hung the star, and more and more angels kept coming.
Some of them placed themselves on the straw
roof, or settled down on the steep cliff behind the
house; others hovered over it with fluttering wings.
High, high up, the air was lighted by their shining
wings.</p>

<p>At the moment when the star flamed out over the
mountain-village all nature awoke, and the men
who stood on the top of the Capitol were conscious
of it. They felt fresh, but caressing breezes; sweet
perfumes streamed up about them; the trees rustled;
the Tiber murmured, the stars shone, and the moon
stood high in the heaven and lighted the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
And out of the sky the two doves flew circling
down, and lighted on the emperor’s shoulders.</p>

<p>When this miracle took place Augustus rose up
with proud joy, but his friends and his slaves fell on
their knees. “Hail, Cæsar!” they cried. “Your
genius has answered you! You are the god who
shall be worshipped on the heights of the Capitol.”</p>

<p>And the tribute which the men in their transport
offered the emperor was so loud that the old sibyl
heard it. It waked her from her visions. She rose
from her place on the edge of the cliff, and came
forward toward the people. It seemed as if a dark
cloud had risen up from the abyss and sunk down
over the mountain. She was terrifying in her old
age. Coarse hair hung in thin tufts about her head,
her joints were thickened, and her dark skin, hard
as bark, covered her body with wrinkle upon
wrinkle.</p>

<p>Mighty and awe-inspiring, she advanced towards
the emperor. With one hand she seized his wrist,
with the other she pointed towards the distant east.</p>

<p>“Look,” she commanded, and the emperor raised
his eyes and saw. The heavens opened before his
eyes and he looked away to the far east. And he
saw a miserable stable by a steep cliff, and in the
open door some kneeling shepherds. Within the
stable he saw a young mother on her knees before a
little child, who lay on a bundle of straw on the
floor.</p>

<p>And the sibyl’s big, bony fingers pointed towards
that poor child.</p>

<p>“Hail, Cæsar!” said the sibyl, with a scornful
laugh. “There is the god who shall be worshipped
on the heights of the Capitol.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Augustus shrank back from her as if from a maniac.</p>

<p>But upon the sibyl fell the mighty spirit of the
prophetess. Her dim eyes began to burn, her hands
were stretched towards heaven, her voice did not
seem to be her own, but rang with such strength
that it could have been heard over the whole world.
And she spoke words which she seemed to have
read in the stars:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“On the heights of the Capitol the redeemer of the world shall be worshipped,</div>
<div class="verse">Christ or Antichrist, but no frail mortal.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When she had spoken she moved away between
the terrified men, went slowly down the mountain,
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Augustus, the next day, strictly forbade his people
to raise him any temple on the Capitol. In its place
he built a sanctuary to the new-born godchild and
called it “Heaven’s Altar,” Aracoeli.</p>

<h3 id="INTRO_II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">ROME’S HOLY CHILD</span></h3>

<p>On the summit of the Capitol stood a monastery
occupied by Franciscan monks. It was, however,
less a monastery than a fortress. It was like a
watch-tower by the seashore, where watch was kept
for an approaching foe.</p>

<p>Near the monastery stood the magnificent basilica
“Santa Maria in Aracoeli.” The basilica was built
because the sibyl had caused Augustus to see Christ.
But the monastery was built because they feared the
fulfilment of the sibyl’s prophecy; that Antichrist
should come to be worshipped on the Capitol.</p>

<p>And the monks felt like warriors. When they
went to church to sing and pray, they thought that
they were walking on ramparts, and sending showers
of arrows down on the assaulting Antichrist.</p>

<p>They lived always in terror of Antichrist, and
all their service was a struggle to keep him away
from the Capitolium.</p>

<p>They drew their hats down over their eyes and
sat and gazed out into the world. Their eyes grew
feverish with watching, and they continually thought
they discovered Antichrist. “He is here, he is
there!” they cried. And they fluttered up in their
brown robes and braced themselves for the struggle,
as crows gather on a crag when they catch a glimpse
of an eagle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>But some said: “What is the use of prayers and
penitence? The sibyl has said it. Antichrist must
come.”</p>

<p>Then others said, “God can work a miracle. If
it was of no avail to struggle, He would not have
let the sibyl warn us.”</p>

<p>Year after year the Franciscans defended the
Capitol by penitences, and works of charity, and the
promulgation of God’s word.</p>

<p>They protected it century after century, but as
time went on, men became more and more feeble
and lacking in force. The monks said among themselves:
“Soon the kingdoms of the earth can stand
no longer. A redeemer of the world is needed as in
the time of Augustus.”</p>

<p>They tore their hair and scourged themselves, for
they knew that he who was to be born again must
be the Antichrist, and that it would be a regeneration
of force and violence.</p>

<p>As a sick man is tormented by his pain, so were
they hunted by the thought of Antichrist. And
they saw him before them. He was as rich as
Christ had been poor, as wicked as Christ had been
good, as honored as Christ had been humiliated.</p>

<p>He bore powerful weapons and marched at the
head of bloody evil-doers. He overturned the
churches, murdered the priests, and armed people
for strife, so that brother fought against brother,
and each feared his neighbor, and there was no
peace.</p>

<p>And for every person of power and might who
made his way over the sea of time, they cried out
from the watch-tower on the Capitol: “Antichrist,
Antichrist!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>And for every one who disappeared, and went
under, the monks cried: “Hosanna!” and sang the
“Te Deum.” And they said: “It is because of
our prayers that the wicked fall before they succeed
in scaling the Capitol.”</p>

<p>It was a hard punishment that in that beautiful
monastery its monks could never feel at rest. Their
nights were heavier than their days. Then they saw
wild beasts come into their cells and stretch themselves
out beside them on their beds. And each
wild beast was Antichrist. But some of the monks
saw him as a dragon, and others as a griffin, and
others as a sphinx. When they got up from their
dreams they were as weak as after a severe illness.</p>

<p>The only comfort of these poor monks was the
miracle-working image of Christ, which was kept in
the basilica of Aracoeli. When a monk was frightened
to desperation, he went into the church to
seek consolation from it. He would go through the
whole basilica and into a well-guarded chapel at the
side of the great altar. There he lighted the consecrated
wax candles, and spoke a prayer, before
opening the altar shrine, which had double locks
and doors of iron. And as long as he gazed at the
image, he remained upon his knees.</p>

<p>The image represented a little babe, but he had a
gold crown upon his head, gold shoes upon his feet,
and his whole dress shone with jewels, which were
given to him by those in distress, who had called on
him for help. And the walls of the chapel were
covered with pictures, which showed how he had
saved from dangers of fire and shipwreck, how he
had cured the sick and helped all those who were in
trouble. When the monk saw it he rejoiced, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
said to himself: “Praise be to God! As yet it is
Christ who is worshipped on the Capitol.”</p>

<p>The monk saw the face of the image smile at him
with mysterious, conscious power, and his spirit
soared up into the holy realms of confidence.
“What can overthrow you in your might?” he said.
“What can overthrow you? To you the Eternal
City bends its knees. You are Rome’s Holy Child.
Yours is the crown which the people worship. You
come in your might with help and strength and
consolation. You alone shall be worshipped on the
Capitol.”</p>

<p>The monk saw the crown of the image turn into a
halo, which sent out rays over the whole world.
And in whatever direction he followed the rays he
saw the world full of churches, where Christ was
worshipped. It seemed as if a powerful conqueror
had shown him all the castles and fortresses which
defended his kingdom. “It is certain that you cannot
fall,” said the monk. “Your kingdom will be
everlasting.”</p>

<p>And every monk who saw the image had a few
hours of consolation and peace, until fear seized
him again. But had the monks not possessed the
image, their souls would not have found a moment’s
rest.</p>

<p>Thus had the monks of Aracoeli, by prayers and
struggles, worked their way through the centuries,
and there had never lacked for watchers; as soon as
one had been exhausted by terror and anxiety, others
had hurried forward to take his place.</p>

<p>And although most of those who entered the
monastery were struck down by madness or premature
death, the succession of monks never diminished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
for it was held a great honor before God to
wage the war on Aracoeli.</p>

<p>So it happened that sixty years ago this struggle
still went on, and in the degenerate times the monks
fought with greater eagerness than ever before, and
awaited the certain coming of Antichrist.</p>

<p>At that time a rich Englishwoman came to Rome.
She went up to the Aracoeli and saw the image,
and he charmed her so that she thought she could
not live if she did not possess him. She went again
and again up to Aracoeli to see the image, and at
last she asked the monks if she might buy him.</p>

<p>But even if she had covered the whole mosaic
floor in the great basilica with gold coins, the monks
would not have been willing to sell her that image,
which was their only consolation.</p>

<p>Still the Englishwoman was attracted beyond
measure by the image, and found no joy nor peace
without it. Unable to accomplish her object by any
other means, she determined to steal the image.
She did not think of the sin she was committing;
she felt only a strong compulsion and a burning
thirst, and preferred to risk her soul rather than to
deny her heart the joy of possessing the object
of her longing. And to accomplish her end, she
first had an image made exactly like the one on
Aracoeli.</p>

<p>The image on Aracoeli was carved from olive wood
from the gardens of Gethsemane; but the Englishwoman
dared to have an image carved from elm
wood, which was exactly like him. The image on
Aracoeli was not painted by mortal hand. When the
monk who had carved him had taken up his brushes
and colors, he fell asleep over his work. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
he awoke, the image was colored,&mdash;self-painted as a
sign that God loved him. But the Englishwoman
was bold enough to let an earthly painter paint her
elm image so that he was like the holy image.</p>

<p>For the false image she procured a crown and
shoes, but they were not of gold; they were only tin
and gilding. She ordered ornaments; she bought
rings, and necklaces, and chains, and bracelets, and
diamond suns&mdash;but they were all brass and glass;
and she dressed him as those seeking help had
dressed the true image. When the image was ready
she took a needle and scratched in the crown: “My
kingdom is only of this world.” It was as if she
was afraid that she herself would not be able to
distinguish one image from the other. And it was
as if she had wished to appease her own conscience.
“I have not wished to make a false Christ image.
I have written in his crown: ‘My kingdom is only
of this world.’”</p>

<p>Thereupon she wrapped herself in a big cloak,
hid the image under it, and went up to Aracoeli.
And she asked that she might be allowed to say her
prayers before the Christchild.</p>

<p>When she stood in the sanctuary, and the candles
were lighted, and the iron door opened, and the
image showed itself to her, she began to tremble
and shake and looked as if she were going to faint.
The monk who was with her hurried into the sacristy
after water and she was left alone in the chapel.
And when he came back she had committed the
sacrilege. She had exchanged the holy, miracle-working
image, and put the false and impotent one
in his place.</p>

<p>The monk saw nothing. He shut in the false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
image behind iron doors and double locks, and the
Englishwoman went home with the treasure of
Aracoeli. She placed him in her palace on a
pedestal of marble and was more happy than she
had ever been before.</p>

<p>Up on Aracoeli, where no one knew what injury
they had suffered, they worshipped the false Christ
image as they had worshipped the true one, and
when Christmas came they built for him in the
church, as was the custom, a most beautiful niche.
There he lay, shining like a jewel, on Maria’s
knees, and about him shepherds and angels and wise
men were arranged. And as long as he lay there
children came from Rome, and the Campagna, and
were lifted up on a little pulpit in the basilica of
Aracoeli, and they preached on the sweetness and
tenderness and nobleness and power of the little
Christchild.</p>

<p>But the Englishwoman lived in great terror that
some one would discover that she had stolen the
Christ image of Aracoeli. Therefore she confessed
to no one that the image she had was the real one.
“It is a copy,” she said; “it is as like the real one
as it can be, but it is only copied.”</p>

<p>Now it happened that she had a little Italian servant
girl. One day when the latter went through
the room she stopped before the image and spoke
to him. “You poor Christchild, who are no Christchild,”
she said, “if you only knew how the real
child lies in his glory in the niche in Aracoeli and
how Maria and San Giuseppe and the shepherds are
kneeling before him! And if you knew how the
children place themselves on a little pulpit just in
front of him, and how they courtesy, and kiss their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
fingers to him, and preach for him as beautifully as
they can!”</p>

<p>A few days after the little maid came again and
spoke to the image. “You poor Christchild, who
are no Christchild,” she said, “do you know that
to-day I have been up in Aracoeli and have seen
how the true child was carried in the procession?
They held a canopy over him, all the people fell on
their knees, and they sang and played before him.
Never will you see anything so wonderful!”</p>

<p>And mark that a few days later the little maid
came again and spoke to the image: “Do you know,
Christchild, who are not a real Christchild, that it
is better for you to stand where you are standing?
For the real child is called to the sick and is driven
to them in his gold-laced carriage, but <em>he</em> cannot
help them and they die in despair. And people
begin to say that Aracoeli’s holy child has lost his
power to do good, and that prayers and tears do not
move him. It is better for you to stand where you
are standing than to be called upon and not to be
able to help.”</p>

<p>But the next night a miracle came to pass. About
midnight a loud ringing was heard at the cloister
gate at Aracoeli. And when the gate-keeper did not
come quickly enough to open, some one began to
knock. It sounded clear, like ringing metal, and it
was heard through the whole monastery. All the
monks leaped from their beds. All who had been
tortured by terrible dreams rose at one time, and
believed that Antichrist was come.</p>

<p>But when they opened the door&mdash;when they
opened it! It was the little Christ image that stood
on the threshold. It was his little hand that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
pulled the bell-rope; it was his little, gold-shod foot
that had been stretched out to kick the door.</p>

<p>The gate-keeper instantly took the holy child up
in his arms. Then he saw that it had tears in its
eyes. Alas, the poor, holy child had wandered
through the town by night! What had it not seen?
So much poverty and so much want; so much wickedness
and so many crimes! It was terrible to think
what it must have experienced.</p>

<p>The gate-keeper went immediately to the prior
and showed him the image. And they wondered
how it had come out into the night.</p>

<p>Then the prior had the church bells rung to call
the monks to the service. And all the monks of
Aracoeli marched into the great, dim basilica in
order to place the image, with all solemnity, back
in its shrine.</p>

<p>Worn and suffering, they walked and trembled in
their heavy homespun robes. Several of them were
weeping, as if they had escaped from some terrible
danger. “What would have happened to us,” they
said, “if our only consolation had been taken from
us? Is it not Antichrist who has tempted out
Rome’s holy child from the sheltering sanctuary?”</p>

<p>But when they came to set the Christ image in
the shrine of the chapel, they found there the false
child; him who wore the inscription on his crown:
“My kingdom is only of this world.”</p>

<p>And when they examined the image more closely
they found the inscription.</p>

<p>Then the prior turned to the monks and spoke to
them:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Brothers, we will sing the ‘Te Deum,’ and
cover the pillars of the church with silk, and light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
all the wax candles, and all the hanging lamps, and
we will celebrate a great festival.</p>

<p>“As long as the monastery has stood it has been
a home of terror and a cursed dwelling; but for the
suffering of all those who have lived here, God has
been gracious. And now all danger is over.</p>

<p>“God has crowned the fight with victory, and this
that you have seen is the sign that Antichrist
shall not be worshipped on the Capitol.</p>

<p>“For in order that the sibyl’s words should be carried
out, God has sent this false image of Christ that
bears the words of Antichrist in its crown, and he
has allowed us to worship and adore him as if he had
been the great miracle-worker.</p>

<p>“But now we can rest in joy and peace, for the
sibyl’s mystic speech is fulfilled, and Antichrist has
been worshipped here.</p>

<p>“Great is God, the Almighty, who has let our
cruel fear be dispelled, and who has carried out
His will without the world needing to gaze upon
the false image made by man.</p>

<p>“Happy is the monastery of Aracoeli that rests
under the protection of God, and does His will, and
is blessed by His abounding grace.”</p>

<p>When the prior had said those words he took the
false image in his hands, went through the church,
and opened the great door. Thence he walked out
on the terrace. Below him lay the high and broad
stairway with its hundred and nineteen marble steps
that leads down from the Capitol as if into an abyss.
And he raised the image over his head and cried
aloud: “Anathema Antikristo!” and hurled him
from the summit of the Capitol down into the
world.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="INTRO_III">III<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE BARRICADE</span></h3>

<p>When the rich Englishwoman awoke in the morning
she missed the image and wondered where she
should look for him. She believed that no one but
the monks of Aracoeli could have taken him, and
she hurried towards the Capitol to spy and search.</p>

<p>She came to the great marble staircase that leads
up to the basilica of Aracoeli. And her heart beat
wildly with joy, for on the lowest step lay he whom
she sought. She seized the image, threw her cloak
about him, and hurried home. And she put him
back on his place of honor.</p>

<p>But as she now sank into contemplation of his
beauty, she found that the crown had been dented.
She lifted it off the image to see how great the
damage was, and at the same moment her eyes fell
on the inscription that she herself had scratched:
“My kingdom is only of this world.”</p>

<p>Then she knew that this was the false Christ
image, and that the right one had returned to
Aracoeli.</p>

<p>She despaired of ever again getting it into her
possession, and she decided to leave Rome the next
day, for she would not remain there when she no
longer had the image.</p>

<p>But when she left she took the forged image
with her, because he reminded her of the one she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
loved, and he followed her afterwards on all her
journeys.</p>

<p>She was never at rest and travelled continually,
and in that way the image was carried about over the
whole world.</p>

<p>And wherever the image came, the power of
Christ seemed to be diminished without any one
rightly understanding why. For nothing could
look more impotent than that poor image of elm
wood, dressed out in brass rings and glass beads.</p>

<p>When the rich Englishwoman who had first owned
the image was dead, he came as an inheritance to
another rich Englishwoman, who also travelled continually,
and from her to a third.</p>

<p>Once, and it was still in the time of the first
Englishwoman, the image came to Paris.</p>

<p>As he passed through the great city there was
an insurrection. Crowds rushed wildly screaming
through the streets and cried for bread. They
plundered the shops and threw stones at the houses
of the rich. Troops were called out against them,
and then they tore up the stones of the street,
dragged together carriages and furniture, and built
barricades.</p>

<p>As the rich Englishwoman came driving in her
great travelling-carriage, the mass of people rushed
towards it, forced her to leave it, and dragged the
carriage up to one of the barricades.</p>

<p>When they tried to roll the carriage up among all
the thousand things of which the barricade consisted,
one of the big trunks fell to the ground.
The cover sprang open, and among other things out
rolled the rejected Christ image.</p>

<p>The people threw themselves upon him to plunder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
but they soon saw that all his grandeur was imitation
and quite worthless, and they began to laugh at
him and mock him.</p>

<p>He went from hand to hand among the agitators,
until one of them bent forward to look at his crown.
His eyes were attracted by the words which stood
scratched there: “My kingdom is only of this
world.”</p>

<p>The man called this out quite loudly, and they
all screamed that the little image should be their
badge. They carried him up to the summit of the
barricade and placed him there like a banner.</p>

<p>Among those who defended the barricade was one
man who was not a poor working-man, but a man of
education, who had passed his whole life in study.
He knew all the want that tortured mankind, and
his heart was full of sympathy, so that he continually
sought means to better their lot. For thirty years
he had written and thought without finding any
remedy. Now on hearing the alarm bell he had
obeyed it and rushed into the streets.</p>

<p>He had seized a weapon and gone with the insurgents
with the thought that the riddle which he had
been unable to solve should now be made clear by
violence and force, and that the poor should be able
to fight their way to a better lot.</p>

<p>There he stood the whole day and fought; and
people fell about him, blood splashed up into his
face, and the misery of life seemed to him greater
and more deplorable than ever before.</p>

<p>But whenever the smoke cleared away, the little
image shone before his eyes; through all the tumult
of the fight it stood unmoved high up on the
barricade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Every time he saw the image the words “My
kingdom is only of this world” flashed through his
brain. At last he thought that the words wrote
themselves in the air and began to wave before his
eyes, now in fire, now in blood, now in smoke.</p>

<p>He stood still. He stood there with gun in hand,
but he had stopped fighting. Suddenly he knew
that this was the word that he had sought after all
his life. He knew what he would say to the people,
and it was the poor image that had given him the
solution.</p>

<p>He would go out into the whole world and proclaim:
“Your kingdom is only of this world.</p>

<p>“Therefore you must care for this life and live like
brothers. And you shall divide your property so
that no one is rich and no one poor. You shall all
work, and the earth shall be owned by all, and you
shall all be equal.</p>

<p>“No one shall hunger, no one shall be tempted
to luxury, and no one shall suffer want in his old
age.</p>

<p>“And you must think of increasing every one’s
happiness, for there is no compensation awaiting
you. Your kingdom is only of this world.”</p>

<p>All this passed through his brain while he stood
on the barricade, and when the thought became clear
to him, he laid down his weapon, and did not lift it
again for strife and the shedding of blood.</p>

<p>A moment later the barricade was stormed and
taken. The victorious troops dashed through and
quelled the insurrection, and before night order
and peace reigned in the great city.</p>

<p>The Englishwoman sent out her servants to look
for her lost possessions, and they found many, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
all. What they found first of all on the captured
barricade was the image ejected from Aracoeli.</p>

<p>But the man who had been taught during the fight
by the image began to proclaim to the world a new
doctrine, which is called Socialism, but which is an
Antichristianity.</p>

<p>And it loves, and renounces, and teaches, and
suffers like Christianity, so that it has every resemblance
to the latter, just as the false image from
Aracoeli has every resemblance to the real Christ
image.</p>

<p>And like the false image it says: “My kingdom
is only of this world.”</p>

<p>And although the image that has spread abroad
the teachings is unnoticed and unknown, the teachings
are not; they go through the world to save and
remodel it.</p>

<p>They are spreading from day to day. They go
out through all countries, and bear many names,
and they mislead because they promise earthly happiness
and enjoyment to all, and win followers more
than any doctrine that has gone through the world
since the time of Christ.</p>

<span class="smaller">MONGIBELLO</span></h3>

<p>Towards the end of the seventies there was in
Palermo a poor boy whose name was Gaetano Alagona.
That was lucky for him! If he had not been
one of the old Alagonas people would have let him
starve to death. He was only a child, and had
neither money nor parents. The Jesuits of Santa
Maria i Jesu had taken him out of charity into the
cloister school.</p>

<p>One day, when studying his lesson, a father came
and called him from the school-room, because a
cousin wished to see him. What, a cousin! He
had always heard that all his relatives were dead.
But Father Josef insisted that it was a real Signora,
who was his relative and wished to take him out of
the monastery. It became worse and worse. Did
she want to take him out of the monastery? That
she could never do! He was going to be a monk.</p>

<p>He did not at all wish to see the Signora. Could
not Father Josef tell her that Gaetano would never
leave the monastery, and that it was of no avail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
ask him? No, Father Josef said that he could not
let her depart without seeing him, and he half
dragged Gaetano into the reception-room. There
she stood by one of the windows. She had gray
hair; her skin was brown; her eyes were black and
as round as beads. She had a lace veil on her
head, and her black dress was smooth with wear,
and a little green, like Father Josef’s very oldest
cassock.</p>

<p>She made the sign of the cross when she saw
Gaetano. “God be praised, he is a true Alagona!”
she said, and kissed his hand.</p>

<p>She said that she was sorry that Gaetano had
reached his twelfth year without any of his family
asking after him; but she had not known that there
were any of the other branch alive. How had she
found it out now? Well, Luca had read the name in
a newspaper. It had stood among those who had
got a prize. It was a half-year ago now, but it was
a long journey to Palermo. She had had to save
and save to get the money for the journey. She
had not been able to come before. But she had to
come and see him. <i lang="it">Santissima madre</i>, she had been
so glad! It was she, Donna Elisa, who was an
Alagona. Her husband, who was dead, had been an
Antonelli. There was one other Alagona, that was
her brother. He, too, lived at Diamante. But
Gaetano probably did not know where Diamante
was. The boy drew his head back. No, she thought
as much, and she laughed.</p>

<p>“Diamante is on Monte Chiaro. Do you know
where Monte Chiaro is?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>She drew up her eyebrows and looked very roguish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Monte Chiaro is on Etna, if you know where
Etna is.”</p>

<p>It sounded so anxious, as if it were too much to
ask that Gaetano should know anything about Etna.
And they laughed, all three, she and Father Josef
and Gaetano.</p>

<p>She seemed a different person after she had made
them laugh. “Will you come and see Diamante
and Etna and Monte Chiaro?” she asked briskly.
“Etna you must see. It is the greatest mountain
in the world. Etna is a king, and the mountains
round about kneel before him, and do not dare to lift
their eyes to his face.”</p>

<p>Then she told many tales about Etna. She
thought perhaps that it would tempt him.</p>

<p>And it was really true that Gaetano had not
thought before what kind of a mountain Etna was.
He had not remembered that it had snow on its
head, oak forests in its beard, vineyards about its
waist, and that it stood in orange groves up to
its knees. And down it ran broad, black rivers.
Those streams were wonderful; they flowed without
a ripple; they heaved without a wind; the poorest
swimmer could cross them without a bridge. He
guessed that she meant lava. And she was glad
that he had guessed it. He was a clever boy. A
real Alagona!</p>

<p>And Etna was so big! Fancy that it took three
days to drive round it and three days to ride up to
the top and down again! And that there were fifty
towns beside Diamante on it, and fourteen great
forests, and two hundred small peaks, which were not
so small either, although Etna was so big that they
seemed as insignificant as a swarm of flies on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
church roof. And that there were caves which
could hold a whole army, and hollow old trees,
where a flock of sheep could find shelter from the
storm!</p>

<p>Everything wonderful was to be found on Etna.
There were rivers of which one must beware. The
water in them was so cold that any one who drank of
it would die. There were rivers which flowed only by
day, and others that flowed only in winter, and some
which ran deep under the earth. There were hot
springs, and sulphur springs, and mud-volcanoes.</p>

<p>It would be a pity for Gaetano not to see the
mountain, for it was so beautiful. It stood against
the sky like a great tent. It was as gayly colored
as a merry-go-round. He ought to see it in the
morning and evening, when it was red; he ought to
see it at night, when it was white. He ought also
to know that it truly could take every color; that it
could be blue, black, brown or violet; sometimes it
wore a veil of beauty, like a signora; sometimes
it was a table covered with velvet; sometimes it had
a tunic of gold brocade and a mantle of peacock’s-feathers.</p>

<p>He would also like to know how it could be that
old King Arthur was sitting there in a cave. Donna
Elisa said that it was quite certain that he still
lived on Etna, for once, when the bishop of Catania
was riding over the mountain, three of his mules ran
away, and the men who followed them found them in
the cave with King Arthur. Then the king asked
the guides to tell the bishop that when his wounds
were healed he would come with his knights of the
Round Table and right everything that was in disorder
in Sicily. And he who had eyes to see knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
well enough that King Arthur had not yet come out
of his cave.</p>

<p>Gaetano did not wish to let her tempt him, but he
thought that he might be a little friendly. She was
still standing, but now he fetched her a chair.
That would not make her think that he wanted to
go with her.</p>

<p>He really liked to hear her tell about her mountain.
It was so funny that it should have so many
tricks. It was not at all like Monte Pellegrino,
near Palermo, that only stood where it stood. Etna
could smoke like a chimney and blow out fire like
a gas jet. It could rumble, shake, vomit forth
lava, throw stones, scatter ashes, foretell the weather,
and collect rain. If Mongibello merely stirred, town
after town fell, as if the houses had been cards set
on end.</p>

<p>Mongibello, that was also a name for Etna. It
was called Mongibello because that meant the mountain
of mountains. It deserved to be called so.</p>

<p>Gaetano saw that she really believed that he would
not be able to resist. She had so many wrinkles
in her face, and when she laughed, they ran together
like a net. He stood and looked at it; it
seemed so strange. But he was not caught yet in
the net.</p>

<p>She wondered if Gaetano really would have the
courage to come to Etna. For inside the mountain
were many bound giants and a black castle, which
was guarded by a dog with many heads. There was
also a big forge and a lame smith with only one eye
in the middle of his forehead. And worst of all, in
the very heart of the mountain, there was a sulphur
sea which cooked like an oil kettle, and in it lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Lucifer and all the damned. No, he never would
have the courage to come there, she said.</p>

<p>Otherwise there was no danger in living there, for
the mountain feared the saints. Donna Elisa said
that it feared many saints, but most Santa Agata of
Catania. If the Catanians always were as they
should be to her, then neither earthquake nor lava
could do them any harm.</p>

<p>Gaetano stood quite close to her and he laughed
at everything she said. How had he come there and
why could he not stop laughing? It was a wonderful
signora.</p>

<p>Suddenly he said, in order not to deceive her,
“Donna Elisa, I am going to be a monk.”&mdash;“Oh,
are you?” she said. Then without anything more
she began again to tell about the mountain.</p>

<p>She said that now he must really listen; now she
was coming to the most important of all. He was
to fellow her to the south side of the mountain so far
down that they were near the castle of Catania, and
there he would see a valley, a quite big and wide
oval valley. But it was quite black; the lava streams
came from all directions flowing down into it.
There were only stones there, not a blade of grass.</p>

<p>But what had Gaetano believed about the lava?
Donna Elisa was sure that he believed that it lay as
even and smooth on Etna as it lies in the streets.
But on Etna there are so many surprises. Could he
understand that all the serpents and dragons and
witches that lay and boiled in the lava ran out with
it when there was an eruption? There they lay and
crawled and crept and twisted about each other, and
tried to creep up to the cold earth, and held each
other fast in misery until the lava hardened about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
them. And then they could never come free. No
indeed!</p>

<p>The lava was not unproductive, as he thought.
Although no grass grew, there was always something
to see. But he could never guess what it was.
It groped and fell; it tumbled and crept; it moved
on its knees, on its head, and on its elbows. It came
up the sides of the valley and down the sides of the
valley; it was all thorns and knots; it had a cloak
of spider’s-web and a wig of dust, and as many
joints as a worm. Could it be anything but the
cactus? Did he know that the cactus goes out on
the lava and breaks the ground like a peasant? Did
he know that nothing but the cactus can do anything
with the lava?</p>

<p>Now she looked at Father Josef and made a funny
face. The cactus was the best goblin to be found
on Etna; but goblins were goblins. The cactus
was a Turk, for it kept female slaves. No sooner
had the cactus taken root anywhere than it must
have almond trees near it. Almond trees are fine
and shining signoras. They hardly dare to go out
on the black surface, but that does not help them.
Out they must, and out they are. Oh, Gaetano
should see if he came there. When the almond
trees stand white with their blossoms in the spring
on the black field among the gray cacti, they are so
innocent and beautiful that one could weep over
them as over captive princesses.</p>

<p>Now he must know where Monte Chiaro lay. It
shot up from the bottom of that black valley. She
tried to make her umbrella stand on the floor. It
stood so. It stood right up. It had never thought
of either sitting or lying. And Monte Chiaro was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
as green as the valley was black. It was palm next
palm, vine upon vine. It was a gentleman in a
flowery dressing-gown. It was a king with a crown
on his head. It bore the whole of Diamante about
its temples.</p>

<p>Some time before Gaetano had a desire to take
her hand. If he only could do it. Yes, he could.
He drew her hand to him like a captured treasure.
But what should he do with it? Perhaps pat it. If
he tried quite gently with one finger, perhaps she
would not notice it. Perhaps she would not notice
if he took two fingers. Perhaps she would not even
notice if he should kiss her hand. She talked and
talked. She noticed nothing at all.</p>

<p>There was still so much she wished to say. And
nothing so droll as her story about Diamante!</p>

<p>She said that the town had once lain down on the
bottom of the valley. Then the lava came, and fiery
red looked over the edge of the valley. What, what!
was the last day come? The town in great haste
took its houses on its back, on its head, and under
its arms, and ran up Monte Chiaro, that lay close at
hand.</p>

<p>Zigzagging up the mountain the town ran. When
it was far enough up it threw down a town gate and
a piece of town wall. Then it ran round the mountain
in a spiral and dropped down houses. The
poor people’s houses tumbled as they could and
would. There was no time for anything else. No
one could ask anything better than crowding and
disorder and crooked streets. No, that you could
not. The chief street went in a spiral round the
mountain, just as the town had run, and along it had
set down here a church and there a palace. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
there had been that much order that the best came
highest up. When the town came to the top of the
mountain it had laid out a square, and there it had
placed the city hall and the Cathedral and the old
palazzo Geraci.</p>

<p>If he, Gaetano Alagona, would follow her to
Diamante, she would take him with her up to the
square on the top of the mountain, and show him
what stretches of land the old Alagonas had owned
on Etna, and on the plain of Catania, and where they
had raised their strongholds on the inland peaks.
For up there all that could be seen, and even more.
One could see the whole sea.</p>

<p>Gaetano had not thought that she had talked long,
but Father Josef seemed to be impatient. “Now
we have come to your own home, Donna Elisa,” he
said quite gently.</p>

<p>But she assured Father Josef that at her house
there was nothing to see. What she first of all
wished to show Gaetano was the big house on the
corso, that was called the summer palace. It was
not so beautiful as the palazzo Geraci, but it was
big; and when the old Alagonas were prosperous
they came there in summer to be nearer the snows
of Etna. Yes, as she said, towards the street it was
nothing to see, but it had a beautiful court-yard
with open porticos in both the stories. And on the
roof there was a terrace. It was paved with blue
and white tiles, and on every tile the coat of arms
of the Alagonas was burnt in. He would like to
come and see that?</p>

<p>It occurred to Gaetano that Donna Elisa must be
used to having children come and sit on her knees
when she was at home. Perhaps she would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
notice if he should also come. And he tried. And
so it was. She was used to it. She never noticed
it at all.</p>

<p>She only went on talking about the palace. There
was a great state suite, where the old Alagonas had
danced and played. There was a great hall with a
gallery for the music; there was old furniture and
clocks like small white alabaster temples that stood
on black ebony pedestals. In the state apartment
no one lived, but she would go there with him.
Perhaps he had thought that she lived in the summer
palace. Oh, no; her brother, Don Ferrante,
lived there. He was a merchant, and had his shop
on the lower floor; and as he had not yet brought
home a signora, everything stood up there as it had
stood.</p>

<p>Gaetano wondered if he could sit on her knees any
longer. It was wonderful that she did not notice
anything. And it was fortunate, for otherwise she
might have believed that he had changed his mind
about being a monk.</p>

<p>But she was just now more than ever occupied
with her own affairs. A little flush flamed up in
her cheeks under all the brown, and she made a few
of the funniest faces with her eyebrows. Then she
began to tell how she herself lived.</p>

<p>It seemed as if Donna Elisa must have the very
smallest house in the town. It lay opposite the
summer palace, but that was its only good point.
She had a little shop, where she sold medallions
and wax candles and everything that had to do with
divine service. But, with all respect to Father
Josef, there was not much profit in such a trade
now-a-days, however it may have been formerly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Behind the shop there was a little workshop. There
her husband had stood and carved images of the
saints, and rosary beads; for he had been an artist,
Signor Antonelli. And next to the workshop were
a couple of small rat-holes; it was impossible to
turn in them; one had to squat down, as in the cells
of the old kings. And up one flight were a couple
of small hen-coops. In one of them she had laid a
little straw and put up a few hooks. That would be
for Gaetano, if he would come to her.</p>

<p>Gaetano thought that he would like to pat her
cheek. She would be sorry when he could not go
with her. Perhaps he could permit himself to pat
her. He looked under his hair at Father Josef.
Father Josef sat and looked on the floor and sighed,
as he was in the habit of doing. He did not think
of Gaetano, and she, she noticed nothing at all.</p>

<p>She said that she had a maid, whose name was
Pacifica, and a man, whose name was Luca. She
did not get much help, however, for Pacifica was
old; and, since she had grown deaf, she had become
so irritable that she could not let her help
in the shop. And Luca, who really was to have
been a wood-carver, and carve saints that she could
sell, never gave himself time to stand still in the
workshop; he was always out in the garden, looking
after the flowers. Yes, they had a little garden
among the stones on Monte Chiaro. But he need
not think it was worth anything. She had nothing
like the one in the cloister, that Gaetano would
understand. But she wanted so much to have him,
because he was one of the old Alagonas. And there
at home she and Luca and Pacifica had said to one
another: “Do we ask whether we will have a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
more care, if we can only get him here?” No, the
Madonna knew that they had not done so. But now
the question was, whether he was willing to endure
anything to be with them.</p>

<p>And now she had finished, and Father Josef asked
what Gaetano thought of answering. It was the
prior’s wish, Father Josef said, that Gaetano should
decide for himself. And they had nothing against
his going out into the world, because he was the
last of his race.</p>

<p>Gaetano slid gently down from Donna Elisa’s lap.
But to answer! That was not such an easy thing to
answer. It was very hard to say no to the signora.</p>

<p>Father Josef came to his assistance. “Ask the
signora that you may be allowed to answer in a
couple of hours, Gaetano. The boy has never
thought of anything but being a monk,” he explained
to Donna Elisa.</p>

<p>She stood up, took her umbrella, and tried to look
glad, but there were tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>Of course, of course he must consider it, she said.
But if he had known Diamante he would not have
needed to. Now only peasants lived there, but once
there had been a bishop, and many priests, and a
multitude of monks. They were gone now, but they
were not forgotten. Ever since that time Diamante
was a holy town. More festival days were celebrated
there than anywhere else, and there were quantities
of saints; and even to-day crowds of pilgrims came
there. Whoever lived at Diamante could never
forget God. He was almost half a priest. So for
that reason he ought to come. But he should consider
it, if he so wished. She would come again
to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Gaetano behaved himself very badly. He turned
away from her and rushed to the door. He did not
say a word of thanks to her for coming. He knew
that Father Josef had expected it, but he could not.
When he thought of the great Mongibello that he
never would see, and of Donna Elisa, who would
never come again, and of the school, and of the
shut-in cloister garden, and of a whole restricted
life! Father Josef never could expect so much of
him; Gaetano had to run away.</p>

<p>It was high time too. When Gaetano was ten
steps from the door, he began to cry. It was too
bad about Donna Elisa. Oh, that she should be
obliged to travel home alone! That Gaetano could
not go with her!</p>

<p>He heard Father Josef coming, and he hid his
face against the wall. If he could only stop
sobbing!</p>

<p>Father Josef came sighing and murmuring to
himself, as he always did. When he came up to
Gaetano he stopped, and sighed more than ever.</p>

<p>“It is Mongibello, Mongibello,” said Father
Josef; “no one can resist Mongibello.”</p>

<p>Gaetano answered him by weeping more violently.</p>

<p>“It is the mountain calling,” murmured Father
Josef. “Mongibello is like the whole earth; it has
all the earth’s beauty and charm and vegetation and
expanses and wonders. The whole earth comes at
once and calls him.”</p>

<p>Gaetano felt that Father Josef spoke the truth.
He felt as if the earth stretched out strong arms to
catch him. He felt that he needed to bind himself
fast to the wall in order not to be torn away.</p>

<p>“It is better for him to see the earth,” said Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Josef. “He would only be longing for it if he
stayed in the monastery. If he is allowed to see
the earth perhaps he will begin again to long for
heaven.”</p>

<p>Gaetano did not understand what Father Josef
meant when he felt himself lifted into his arms,
carried back into the reception-room, and put down
on Donna Elisa’s knees.</p>

<p>“You shall take him, Donna Elisa, since you
have won him,” said Father Josef. “You shall
show him Mongibello, and you shall see if you can
keep him.”</p>

<p>But when Gaetano once more sat on Donna Elisa’s
lap he felt such happiness that it was impossible
for him to run away from her again. He was as
much captured as if he had gone into Mongibello
and the mountain walls had closed in on him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="I_II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">FRA GAETANO</span></h3>

<p>Gaetano had lived with Donna Elisa a month, and
had been as happy as a child can be. Merely to
travel with Donna Elisa had been like driving
behind gazelles and birds of paradise; but to live
with her was to be carried on a golden litter, screened
from the sun.</p>

<p>Then the famous Franciscan, Father Gondo, came
to Diamante, and Donna Elisa and Gaetano went up
to the square to listen to him. For Father Gondo
never preached in a church; he always gathered the
people about him by fountains or at the town gates.</p>

<p>The square was swarming with people; but Gaetano,
who sat on the railing of the court-house steps,
plainly saw Father Gondo where he stood on the
curb-stone. He wondered if it could be true that
the monk wore a horse-hair shirt under his robes,
and that the rope that he had about his waist was full
of knots and iron points to serve him as a scourge.</p>

<p>Gaetano could not understand what Father Gondo
said, but one shiver after another ran through him
at the thought that he was looking at a saint.</p>

<p>When the Father had spoken for about an hour, he
made a sign with his hand that he would like to rest
a moment. He stepped down from the steps of the
fountain, sat down, and rested his face in his hands.
While the monk was sitting so, Gaetano heard a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
gentle roaring. He had never before heard any
like it. He looked about him to discover what it
was. And it was all the people talking. “Blessed,
blessed, blessed!” they all said at once. Most of
them only whispered and murmured; none called
aloud, their devotion was too great. And every one
had found the same word. “Blessed, blessed!”
sounded over the whole market-place. “Blessings
on thy lips; blessings on thy tongue; blessings on
thy heart!”</p>

<p>The voices sounded soft, choked by weeping and
emotion, but it was as if a storm had passed by
through the air. It was like the murmuring of a
thousand shells.</p>

<p>That took much greater hold of Gaetano than the
monk’s sermon. He did not know what he wished
to do, for that gentle murmuring filled him with
emotion; it seemed almost to suffocate him. He
climbed up on the iron railing, raised himself above
all the others, and began to cry the same as they,
but much louder, so that his voice cut through all
the others.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa heard it and seemed to be displeased.
She drew Gaetano down and would not stay any
longer, but went home with him.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night Gaetano started up
from his bed. He put on his clothes, tied together
what he possessed in a bundle, set his hat on his
head and took his shoes under his arm. He was
going to run away. He could not bear to live with
Donna Elisa.</p>

<p>Since he had heard Father Gondo, Diamante and
Mongibello were nothing to him. Nothing was
anything compared to being like Father Gondo, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
being blessed by the people. Gaetano could not
live if he could not sit by the fountain in the square
and tell legends.</p>

<p>But if Gaetano went on living in Donna Elisa’s
garden, and eating peaches and mandarins, he would
never hear the great human sea roar about him. He
must go out and be a hermit on Etna; he must
dwell in one of the big caves, and live on roots and
fruits. He would never see a human being; he
would never cut his hair; and he would wear nothing
but a few dirty rags. But in ten or twenty years he
would come back to the world. Then he would look
like a beast and speak like an angel.</p>

<p>That would be another matter than wearing velvet
clothes and a glazed hat, as he did now. That would
be different from sitting in the shop with Donna
Elisa and taking saint after saint down from the
shelf and hearing her tell about what they had done.
Several times he had taken a knife and a piece of
wood and had tried to carve images of the saints.
It was very hard, but it would be worse to make
himself into a saint; much worse. However, he was
not afraid of difficulties and privations.</p>

<p>He crept out of his room, across the attic and
down the stair. It only remained to go through the
shop out to the street, but on the last step he
stopped. A faint light filtered through a crack in
the door to the left of the stairs.</p>

<p>It was the door to Donna Elisa’s room, and Gaetano
did not dare to go any further, since his foster
mother had her candle lighted. If she was not
asleep she would hear him when he drew the heavy
bolts on the shop door. He sat softly down on the
stairs to wait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly he happened to think that Donna Elisa
must sit up so long at night and work in order to get
him food and clothes. He was much touched that
she loved him so much as to want to do it. And
he understood what a grief it would be to her if
he should go.</p>

<p>When he thought of that he began to weep.</p>

<p>But at the same time he began to upbraid Donna
Elisa in his thoughts. How could she be so stupid
as to grieve because he went. It would be such a
joy for her when he should become a holy man.
That would be her reward for having gone to Palermo
and fetched him.</p>

<p>He cried more and more violently while he was
consoling Donna Elisa. It was hard that she did
not understand what a reward she would receive.</p>

<p>There was no need for her to be sad. For ten
years only would Gaetano live on the mountain, and
then he would come back as the famous hermit Fra
Gaetano. Then he would come walking through the
streets of Diamante, followed by a great crowd of
people, like Father Gondo. And there would be
flags, and the houses would be decorated with cloths
and wreaths. He would stop in front of Donna
Elisa’s shop, and Donna Elisa would not recognize
him and would be ready to fall on her knees before
him. But so should it not be; he would kneel to
Donna Elisa, and ask her forgiveness, because he
had run away from her ten years ago. “Gaetano,”
Donna Elisa would then answer, “you give me an
ocean of joy against a little brook of sorrow. Should
I not forgive you?”</p>

<p>Gaetano saw all this before him, and it was so
beautiful that he began to weep more violently. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was only afraid that Donna Elisa would hear how he
was sobbing and come out and find him. And then
she would not let him go.</p>

<p>He must talk sensibly with her. Would he ever
give her greater pleasure than if he went now?</p>

<p>It was not only Donna Elisa, there was also Luca
and Pacifica, who would be so glad when he came
back as a holy man.</p>

<p>They would all follow him up to the market-place.
There, there would be even more flags than in the
streets, and Gaetano would speak from the steps of
the town hall. And from all the streets and courts
people would come streaming.</p>

<p>Then Gaetano would speak, so that they should all
fall on their knees and cry: “Bless us, Fra Gaetano,
bless us!”</p>

<p>After that he would never leave Diamante again.
He would live under the great steps outside Donna
Elisa’s shop.</p>

<p>And they would come to him with their sick,
and those in trouble would make a pilgrimage to
him.</p>

<p>When the syndic of Diamante went by he would
kiss Gaetano’s hand.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa would sell Fra Gaetano’s image in
her shop.</p>

<p>And Donna Elisa’s god-daughter, Giannita, would
bow before Fra Gaetano and never again call him a
stupid monk-boy.</p>

<p>And Donna Elisa would be so happy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ah … Gaetano started up, and awoke. It was
bright daylight, and Donna Elisa and Pacifica stood
and looked at him. And Gaetano sat on the stairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
with his shoes under his arm, his hat on his head
and his bundle at his feet. But Donna Elisa and
Pacifica wept. “He has wished to run away from
us,” they said.</p>

<p>“Why are you sitting here, Gaetano?”</p>

<p>“Donna Elisa, I wanted to run away.”</p>

<p>Gaetano was in a good mood, and answered as
boldly as if it had been the most natural thing in
the world.</p>

<p>“Do you want to run away?” repeated Donna
Elisa.</p>

<p>“I wished to go off on Etna and be a hermit.”</p>

<p>“And why are you sitting here now?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, Donna Elisa; I must have fallen
asleep.”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa now showed how distressed she was.
She pressed her hands over her heart, as if she had
terrible pains, and she wept passionately.</p>

<p>“But now I shall stay, Donna Elisa,” said
Gaetano.</p>

<p>“You, stay!” cried Donna Elisa. “You might as
well go. Look at him, Pacifica, look at the ingrate!
He is no Alagona. He is an adventurer.”</p>

<p>The blood rose in Gaetano’s face and he sprang
to his feet and struck out with his hands in a way
which astonished Donna Elisa. So had all the men
of her race done. It was her father and her grandfather;
she recognized all the powerful lords of the
family of Alagona.</p>

<p>“You speak so because you know nothing about
it, Donna Elisa,” said the boy. “No, no, you do
not know anything; you do not know why I had to
serve God. But you shall know it now. Do you
see, it was long ago. My father and mother were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
poor, and we had nothing to eat; and so father went
to look for work, and he never came back, and
mother and we children were almost dead of starvation.
So mother said: ‘We will go and look for
your father.’ And we went. Night came and a
heavy rain, and in one place a river flowed over the
road. Mother asked in one house if we might pass
the night there. No, they showed us out. Mother
and children stood in the road and cried. Then
mother tucked up her dress and went down into the
stream that roared over the road. She had my little
sister on her arm and my big sister by the hand and
a big bundle on her head. I went after as near as I
could. I saw mother lose her footing. The bundle
she carried on her head fell into the stream, and
mother caught at it and dropped little sister. She
snatched at little sister and big sister was whirled
away. Mother threw herself after them, and the
river took her too. I was frightened and ran to the
shore. Father Josef has told me that I escaped
because I was to serve God for the dead, and pray
for them. And that was why it was first decided
that I was to be a monk, and why I now wish to go
away on Etna and become a hermit. There is nothing
else for me but to serve God, Donna Elisa.”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa was quite subdued. “Yes, yes,
Gaetano,” she said, “but it hurts me so. I do not
want you to go away from me.”</p>

<p>“No, I shall not go either,” said Gaetano. He
was in such a good mood that he felt a desire to
laugh. “I shall not go.”</p>

<p>“Shall I speak to the priest, so that you may be
sent to a seminary?” asked Donna Elisa, humbly.</p>

<p>“No; but you do not understand, Donna Elisa;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
you do not understand. I tell you that I will not
go away from you. I have thought of something
else.”</p>

<p>“What have you thought of?” she asked sadly.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose I was doing while I sat
there on the stairs? I was dreaming, Donna Elisa.
I dreamed that I was going to run away. Yes,
Donna Elisa, I stood in the shop, and I was going
to open the shop door, but I could not because there
were so many locks. I stood in the dark and unlocked
lock after lock, and always there were new
ones. I made a terrible noise, and I thought:
‘Now surely Donna Elisa will come.’ At last the
door opened, and I was going to rush out; but just
then I felt your hand on my neck, and you drew me
in, and I kicked, and I struck you because I was not
allowed to go. But, Donna Elisa, you had a candle
with you, and then I saw that it was not you, but my
mother. Then I did not dare to struggle any more,
and I was very frightened, for mother is dead. But
mother took the bundle I was carrying and began to
take out what was in it. Mother laughed and looked
so glad, and I grew glad that she was not angry with
me. It was so strange. What she drew out of the
bundle was all the little saints’ images that I had
carved while I sat with you in the shop, and they
were so pretty. ‘Can you carve such pretty images,
Gaetano?’ said mother. ‘Yes,’ I answered. ‘Then
you can serve God by it,’ said mother. ‘Do I not
need to leave Donna Elisa, then?’ ‘No,’ said
mother. And just as mother said that, you waked
me.”</p>

<p>Gaetano looked at Donna Elisa in triumph.</p>

<p>“What did mother mean by that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Donna Elisa only wondered.</p>

<p>Gaetano threw his head back and laughed.</p>

<p>“Mother meant that you should apprentice me,
so that I could serve God by carving beautiful images
of angels and saints, Donna Elisa.”</p>

<h3 id="I_III">III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GOD-SISTER</span></h3>

<p>In the noble island of Sicily, where there are more
old customs left than in any other place in the south,
it is always the habit of every one while yet a child
to choose a god-brother or god-sister, who shall
carry his or her children to be christened, if there
ever are any.</p>

<p>But this is not by any means the only use god-brothers
and sisters have of one another. God-brothers
and sisters must love one another, serve one
another, and revenge one another. In a god-brother’s
ear a man can bury his secrets. He can trust him
with both money and sweetheart, and not be deceived.
God-brothers and sisters are as faithful to each other
as if they were born of the same mother, because
their covenant is made before San Giovanni Battista,
who is the most feared of all the saints.</p>

<p>It is also the custom for the poor to take their
half-grown children to rich people and ask that they
may be god-brothers and sisters to their young sons
and daughters. What a glad sight it is on the holy
Baptist’s day to see all those little children in festival
array wandering through the great towns looking
for a god-brother or sister! If the parents
succeed in giving their son a rich god-brother, they
are as glad as if they were able to leave him a farm
as an inheritance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>When Gaetano first came to Diamante, there was
a little girl who was always coming in and out of
Donna Elisa’s shop. She had a red cloak and
pointed cap and eight heavy, black curls that stood
out under the cap. Her name was Giannita, and
she was daughter of Donna Olivia, who sold vegetables.
But Donna Elisa was her god-mother, and
therefore thought what she could do for her.</p>

<p>Well, when midsummer day came, Donna Elisa
ordered a carriage and drove down to Catania, which
lies full twenty miles from Diamante. She had
Giannita with her, and they were both dressed in
their best. Donna Elisa was dressed in black silk
with jet, and Giannita had a white tulle dress with
garlands of flowers. In her hand Giannita held a
basket of flowers, and among the flowers lay a
pomegranate.</p>

<p>The journey went well for Donna Elisa and
Giannita. When at last they reached the white
Catania, that lies and shines on the black lava background,
they drove up to the finest palace in the town.</p>

<p>It was lofty and wide, so that the poor little
Giannita felt quite terrified at the thought of going
into it. But Donna Elisa walked bravely in, and
she was taken to Cavaliere Palmeri and his wife
who owned the house.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa reminded Signora Palmeri that they
were friends from infancy, and asked that Giannita
might be her young daughter’s god-sister.</p>

<p>That was agreed upon, and the young signorina
was called in. She was a little marvel of rose-colored
silk, Venetian lace, big, black eyes, and
thick, bushy hair. Her little body was so small and
thin that one hardly noticed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Giannita offered her the basket of flowers, and
she graciously accepted it. She looked long and
thoughtfully at Giannita, walked round her, and was
fascinated by her smooth, even curls. When she
had seen them, she ran after a knife, cut the pomegranate
and gave Giannita half.</p>

<p>While they ate the fruit, they held each other’s
hand and both said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Sister, sister, sister mine!</div>
<div class="verse">Thou art mine, and I am thine,</div>
<div class="verse">Thine my house, my bread and wine,</div>
<div class="verse">Thine my joys, my sacrifice,</div>
<div class="verse">Thine my place in Paradise.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then they kissed each other and called each other
god-sister.</p>

<p>“You must never fail me, god-sister,” said the
little signorina, and both the children were very
serious and moved.</p>

<p>They had become such good friends in the short
time that they cried when they parted.</p>

<p>But then twelve years went by and the two god-sisters
lived each in her own world and never met.
During the whole time Giannita was quietly in her
home and never came to Catania.</p>

<p>But then something really strange happened.
Giannita sat one afternoon in the room back of the
shop embroidering. She was very skilful and was
often overwhelmed with work. But it is trying to
the eyes to embroider, and it was dark in Giannita’s
room. She had therefore half-opened the door into
the shop to get a little more light.</p>

<p>Just after the clock had struck four, the old
miller’s widow, Rosa Alfari, came walking by.
Donna Olivia’s shop was very attractive from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
street. The eyes fell through the half-open door on
great baskets with fresh vegetables and bright-colored
fruits, and far back in the background the outline of
Giannita’s pretty head. Rosa Alfari stopped and
began to talk to Donna Olivia, simply because her
shop looked so friendly.</p>

<p>Laments and complaints always followed old Rosa
Alfari. Now she was sad because she had to go to
Catania alone that night. “It is a misfortune that
the post-wagon does not reach Diamante before ten,”
she said. “I shall fall asleep on the way, and perhaps
they will then steal my money. And what shall
I do when I come to Catania at two o’clock at night?”</p>

<p>Then Giannita suddenly called out into the shop.
“Will you take me with you to Catania, Donna
Alfari?” she asked, half in joke, without expecting
an answer.</p>

<p>But Rosa Alfari said eagerly, “Lord, child, will
you go with me? Will you really?”</p>

<p>Giannita came out into the shop, red with pleasure.
“If I will!” she said. “I have not been in Catania
for twelve years.”</p>

<p>Rosa Alfari looked delightedly at her; Giannita
was tall and strong, her eyes gay, and she had a
careless smile on her lips. She was a splendid
travelling companion.</p>

<p>“Get ready,” said the old woman. “You will go
with me at ten o’clock; it is settled.”</p>

<p>The next day Giannita wandered about the streets
of Catania. She was thinking the whole time of
her god-sister. She was strangely moved to be so
near her again. She loved her god-sister, Giannita,
and she did it not only because San Giovanni has
commanded people to love their god-brothers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
sisters. She had adored the little child in the silk
dress; she was the most beautiful thing she had ever
seen. She had almost become her idol.</p>

<p>She knew this much about her sister, that she
was still unmarried and lived in Catania. Her
mother was dead, and she had not been willing to
leave her father, and had stayed as hostess in his
house. “I must manage to see her,” thought
Giannita.</p>

<p>Whenever Giannita met a well-appointed carriage
she thought: “Perhaps it is my god-sister
driving there.” And she stared at everybody to see
if any of them was like the little girl with the thick
hair and the big eyes.</p>

<p>Her heart began to beat wildly. She had always
longed for her god-sister. She herself was still
unmarried, because she liked a young wood-carver,
Gaetano Alagona, and he had never shown the
slightest desire to marry her. Giannita had often
been angry with him for that, and not least had it
irritated her never to be able to invite her god-sister
to her wedding.</p>

<p>She had been so proud of her, too. She had
thought herself finer than the others, because she
had such a god-sister. What if she should now go
to see her, since she was in the town? It would
give a lustre to the whole journey.</p>

<p>As she thought and thought of it, a newspaper-boy
came running. “<cite>Giornale da Sicilia</cite>,” he called.
“The Palmeri affair! Great embezzlements!”</p>

<p>Giannita seized the boy by the neck as he rushed
by. “What are you saying?” she screamed. “You
lie, you lie!” and she was ready to strike him.</p>

<p>“Buy my paper, signora, before you strike me,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
said the boy. Giannita bought the paper and began
to read. She found in it without difficulty the
Palmeri affair.</p>

<p>“Since this case is to be tried to-day in the
courts,” wrote the paper, “we will give an account
of it.”</p>

<p>Giannita read and read. She read it over and over
before she understood. There was not a muscle in
her body which did not begin to tremble with horror
when she at last comprehended it.</p>

<p>Her god-sister’s father, who had owned great
vineyards, had been ruined, because the blight had
laid them waste. And that was not the worst. He
had also dissipated a charitable fund which had
been intrusted to him. He was arrested, and to-day
he was to be tried.</p>

<p>Giannita crushed the newspaper together, threw
it into the street and trampled on it. It deserved
no better for bringing such news.</p>

<p>Then she stood quite crushed that this should
meet her when she came to Catania for the first
time in twelve years. “Lord God,” she said, “is
there any meaning in it?”</p>

<p>At home, in Diamante, no one would ever have
taken the trouble to tell her what was going on.
Was it not destiny that she should be here on the
very day of the trial?</p>

<p>“Listen, Donna Alfari,” she said; “you may do
as you like, but I must go to the court.”</p>

<p>There was a decision about Giannita. Nothing
could disturb her. “Do you not understand that it is
for this, and not for your sake, that God has induced
you to take me with you to Catania?” she said to
Rosa Alfari.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Giannita did not doubt for a moment that there
was something supernatural in it all.</p>

<p>Rosa Alfari must needs let her go, and she found
her way to the Palace of Justice. She stood among
the street boys and riff-raff, and saw Cavaliere
Palmeri on the bench of the accused. He was a fine
gentleman, with a white, pointed beard and moustache.
Giannita recognized him.</p>

<p>She heard that he was condemned to six months’
imprisonment, and Giannita thought she saw even
more plainly that she had come there as an emissary
from God. “Now my god-sister must need me,”
she thought.</p>

<p>She went out into the street again and asked her
way to the Palazzo Palmeri.</p>

<p>On the way a carriage drove by her. She looked
up, and her eyes met those of the lady who sat in
the carriage. At the same moment something told
her that this was her god-sister. She who was driving
was pale and bent and had beseeching eyes.
Giannita loved her from the first sight. “It is you
who have given me pleasure many times,” she said,
“because I expected pleasure from you. Now perhaps
I can pay you back.”</p>

<p>Giannita felt filled with devotion when she went
up the high, white marble steps to the Palazzo
Palmeri, but suddenly a doubt struck her. “What
can God wish me to do for one who has grown up
in such magnificence?” she thought. “Does our
Lord forget that I am only poor Giannita from
Diamante?”</p>

<p>She told a servant to greet Signorina Palmeri and
say to her that her god-sister wished to speak to
her. She was surprised when the servant came back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and said that she could not be received that day.
Should she be content with that? Oh, no; oh, no!</p>

<p>“Tell the signorina that I am going to wait here
the whole day, for I must speak to her.”</p>

<p>“The signorina is going to move out of the
palace in half an hour,” said the servant.</p>

<p>Giannita was beside herself. “But I am her god-sister,
her god-sister, do you not understand?” she
said to the man. “I must speak to her.” The servant
smiled, but did not move.</p>

<p>But Giannita would not be turned away. Was
she not sent by God? He must understand, understand,
she said, and raised her voice. She was from
Diamante and had not been in Catania for twelve
years. Until yesterday afternoon at four o’clock she
had not thought of coming here. He must understand,
not until yesterday afternoon at four o’clock.</p>

<p>The servant stood motionless. Giannita was ready
to tell him the whole story to move him, when the
door was thrown open. Her god-sister stood on the
threshold.</p>

<p>“Who is speaking of yesterday at four o’clock?”
she said.</p>

<p>“It is a stranger, Signorina Micaela.”</p>

<p>Then Giannita rushed forward. It was not at all
a stranger. It was her god-sister from Diamante,
who came here twelve years ago with Donna Elisa.
Did she not remember her? Did she not remember
that they had divided a pomegranate?</p>

<p>The signorina did not listen to that. “What was
it that happened yesterday at four o’clock?” she
asked, with great anxiety.</p>

<p>“I then got God’s command to go to you, god-sister,”
said Giannita.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The other looked at her in terror. “Come with
me,” she said, as if afraid that the servant should
hear what Giannita wished to say to her.</p>

<p>She went far into the apartment before she stopped.
Then she turned so quickly towards Giannita that
she was frightened. “Tell me instantly!” she said.
“Do not torture me; let me hear it instantly!”</p>

<p>She was as tall as Giannita, but very unlike her.
She was more delicately made, and she, the woman
of the world, had a much more wild and untamed
appearance than the country girl. Everything she
felt showed in her face. She did not try to conceal
it.</p>

<p>Giannita was so astonished at her violence that
she could not answer at first.</p>

<p>Then her god-sister lifted her arms in despair
over her head and the words streamed from her lips.
She said that she knew that Giannita had been
commanded by God to bring her word of new misfortunes.
God hated her, she knew it.</p>

<p>Giannita clasped her hands. God hate her! on
the contrary, on the contrary!</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Signorina Palmeri. “It is so.”
And as she was inwardly afraid of the message
Giannita had for her, she began to talk. She did
not let her speak; she interrupted her constantly.
She seemed to be so terrified by everything that had
happened to her during the last days that she could
not at all control herself.</p>

<p>Giannita must understand that God hated her, she
said. She had done something so terrible. She
had forsaken her father, failed her father. Giannita
must have read the last account. Then she burst
out again in passionate questionings. Why did she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
not tell her what she wished to tell her? She did not
expect anything but bad news. She was prepared.</p>

<p>But poor Giannita never got a chance to speak;
as soon as she began, the signorina became frightened
and interrupted her. She told her story as if
to induce Giannita not to be too hard to her.</p>

<p>Giannita must not think that her unhappiness
only came from the fact of her no longer having her
carriage, or a box at the theatre, or beautiful dresses,
or servants, or even a roof over her head. Neither
was it enough that she had now lost all her friends,
so that she did not at all know where she should ask
for shelter. Neither was it misfortune enough that
she felt such shame that she could not raise her eyes
to any one’s face.</p>

<p>But there was something else much worse.</p>

<p>She sat down, and was silent a moment, while
she rocked to and fro in agony. But when Giannita
began to speak, she interrupted her.</p>

<p>Giannita could not think how her father had loved
her. He had always had her live in splendor and
magnificence, like a princess.</p>

<p>She had not done much for him; only let him
think out delightful things to amuse her. It had
been no sacrifice to remain unmarried, for she had
never loved any one like her father, and her own
home had been finer than any one else’s.</p>

<p>But one day her father had come and said to her,
“They wish to arrest me. They are spreading the
report that I have stolen, but it is not true.” Then
she had believed him, and helped him to hide from
the <i lang="it">Carabinieri</i>. And they had looked for him in
vain in Catania, on Etna, over the whole of Sicily.</p>

<p>But when the police could not find Cavaliere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Palmeri, the people began to say: “He is a fine
gentleman, and they are fine gentlemen who help
him; otherwise they would have found him long
ago.” And the prefect in Catania had come to her.
She received him smiling, and the prefect came as
if to talk of roses, and the beautiful weather. Then
he said: “Will the signorina look at this little
paper? Will the signorina read this little letter?
Will the signorina observe this little signature?”
She read and read. And what did she see? Her
father was not innocent. Her father had taken the
money of others.</p>

<p>When the prefect had left her, she had gone to
her father. “You are guilty,” she said to him.
“You may do what you will, but I cannot help you
any more.” Oh, she had not known what she said!
She had always been very proud. She had not been
able to bear to have their name stamped with dishonor.
She had wished for a moment that her
father had been dead, rather than that this had
happened to her. Perhaps she had also said it to
him. She did not rightly know what she had said.</p>

<p>But after that God had forsaken her. The most
terrible things had happened. Her father had taken
her at her word. He had gone and given himself
up. And ever since he had been in prison he had
not been willing to see her. He did not answer her
letters, and the food that she sent him he sent back
untouched. That was the most dreadful thing of all.
He seemed to think that she wished to kill him.</p>

<p>She looked at Giannita as anxiously as if she
awaited her sentence of death.</p>

<p>“Why do you not say to me what you have to
say?” she exclaimed. “You are killing me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was impossible for her to force herself to
be silent.</p>

<p>“You must know,” she continued, “that this
palace is sold, and the purchaser has let it to an
English lady, who is to move in to-day. Some of
her things were brought in already yesterday, and
among them was a little image of Christ.</p>

<p>“I caught sight of it as I passed through the
vestibule, Giannita. They had taken it out of a
trunk, and it lay there on the floor. It had been so
neglected that no one took any trouble about it.
Its crown was dented, and its dress dirty, and all the
small ornaments which adorned it were rusty and
broken. But when I saw it lying on the floor, I
took it up and carried it into the room and placed
it on a table. And while I did so, it occurred to
me that I would ask its help. I knelt down before
it and prayed a long time. ‘Help me in my great
need!’ I said to the Christchild.</p>

<p>“While I prayed, it seemed to me that the image
wished to answer me. I lifted my head, and the
child stood there as dull as before, but a clock began
to strike just then. It struck four, and it was as if
it had said four words. It was as if the Christchild
had answered a fourfold <em>yes</em> to my prayer.</p>

<p>“That gave me courage, Giannita, so that to-day
I drove to the Palace of Justice to see my father.
But he never turned his eyes toward me during the
whole time he stood before his judges.</p>

<p>“I waited until they were about to lead him away,
and threw myself on my knees before him in one of
the narrow passages. Giannita, he let the soldiers
lead me away without giving me a word.</p>

<p>“So, you see, God hates me. When I heard you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
speak of yesterday afternoon at four o’clock, I was
so frightened. The Christchild sends me a new
misfortune, I thought. It hates me for having
failed my father.”</p>

<p>When she had said that, she was at last silent and
listened breathlessly for what Giannita should say.</p>

<p>And Giannita told her story to her.</p>

<p>“See, see, is it not wonderful?” she said at the
end. “I have not been in Catania for twelve years,
and then I come here quite unexpectedly. And I
know nothing at all; but as soon as I set my foot
on the street here, I hear your misfortune. God has
sent a message to me, I said to myself. He has
called me here to help my god-sister.”</p>

<p>Signorina Palmeri’s eyes were turned anxiously
questioning towards her. Now the new blow was
coming. She gathered all her courage to meet it.</p>

<p>“What do you wish me to do for you, god-sister?”
said Giannita. “Do you know what I thought as I
was walking through the streets? I will ask her if
she will go with me to Diamante, I thought. I
know an old house there, where we could live
cheaply. And I would embroider and sew, so that
we could support ourselves. When I was out in
the street I thought that it might be, but now I
understand that it is impossible, impossible. You
require something more of life; but tell me if I can
do anything for you. You shall not thrust me away,
for God has sent me.”</p>

<p>The signorina bent towards Giannita. “Well?”
she said anxiously.</p>

<p>“You shall let me do what I can for you, for I
love you,” said Giannita, and fell on her knees and
put her arms about her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you nothing else to say?” asked the
signorina.</p>

<p>“I wish I had,” said Giannita, “but I am only a
poor girl.”</p>

<p>It was wonderful to see how the features of the
young signorina’s face softened; how her color came
back and how her eyes began to shine. Now it was
plain that she had great beauty.</p>

<p>“Giannita,” she said, low and scarcely audibly,
“do you think that it is a miracle? Do you think
that God can let a miracle come to pass for my
sake?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” whispered Giannita back.</p>

<p>“I prayed the Christchild that he should help me,
and he sends you to me. Do you think that it was
the Christchild who sent you, Giannita?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was; it was!”</p>

<p>“Then God has not forsaken me, Giannita?”</p>

<p>“No, God has not forsaken you.”</p>

<p>The god-sisters sat and wept for a while. It was
quite quiet in the room. “When you came, Giannita,
I thought that nothing was left me but to kill myself,”
she said at last. “I did not know where to
turn, and God hated me.”</p>

<p>“But tell me now what I can do for you, god-sister,”
said Giannita.</p>

<p>As an answer the other drew her to her and
kissed her.</p>

<p>“But it is enough that you are sent by the little
Christchild,” she said. “It is enough that I know
that God has not forsaken me.”</p>

<span class="smaller">DIAMANTE</span></h3>

<p>Micaela Palmeri was on her way to Diamante with
Giannita.</p>

<p>They had taken their places in the post-carriage
at three o’clock in the morning, and had driven up
the beautiful road over the lower slopes of Etna,
circling round the mountain. But it had been quite
dark. They had not seen anything of the surrounding
country.</p>

<p>The young signorina by no means lamented over
that. She sat with closed eyes and buried herself
in her sorrow. Even when it began to grow light,
she would not lift her eyes to look out. It was not
until they were quite near Diamante that Giannita
could persuade her to look at the landscape.</p>

<p>“Look! Here is Diamante; this is to be your
home,” she said.</p>

<p>Then Micaela Palmeri, to the right of the road,
saw mighty Etna, that cut off a great piece of
the sky. Behind the mountain the sun was rising,
and when the upper edge of the sun’s disc appeared
above the line of the mountain, it looked as if the
white summit began to burn and send out sparks
and rays.</p>

<p>Giannita entreated her to look at the other side.</p>

<p>And on the other side she saw the whole jagged
mountain chain, which surrounds Etna like a towered
wall, glowing red in the sunrise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>But Giannita pointed in another direction. It
was not that she was to look at, not that.</p>

<p>Then she lowered her eyes and looked down into
the black valley. There the ground shone like
velvet, and the white Simeto foamed along in the
depths of the valley.</p>

<p>But still she did not turn her eyes in the right
direction.</p>

<p>At last she saw the steep Monte Chiaro rising
out of the black, velvet-lined valley, red in the
morning light and encircled by a crown of shady
palms. On its summit she saw a town flanked with
towers, and encompassed by a wall, and with all its
windows and weather-vanes glittering in the light.</p>

<p>At that sight she seized Giannita’s arm and asked
her if it was a real town, and if people lived there.</p>

<p>She believed that it was one of heaven’s cities,
and that it would disappear like a vision. She was
certain that no mortal had ever passed up the path
that from the edge of the valley went in great curves
over to Monte Chiaro and then zigzagged up the
mountain, disappearing through the dark gates of
the town.</p>

<p>But when she came nearer to Diamante, and saw
that it was of the earth, and real, tears rose to her
eyes. It moved her that the earth still held all this
beauty for her. She had believed that, since it had
been the scene of all her misfortunes, she would
always find it gray and withered and covered with
thistles and poisonous growths.</p>

<p>She entered poor Diamante with clasped hands, as
if it were a sanctuary. And it seemed to her as if this
town could offer her as much happiness as beauty.</p>

<h3 id="I_V">V<br />
<span class="smaller">DON FERRANTE</span></h3>

<p>A few days later Gaetano was standing in his workshop,
cutting grape-leaves on rosary beads. It was
Sunday, but Gaetano did not feel it on his conscience
that he was working, for it was a work in
God’s honor.</p>

<p>A great restlessness and anxiety had come over
him. It had come into his mind that the time he
had been living at peace with Donna Elisa was now
drawing to a close, and he thought that he must
soon start out into the world.</p>

<p>For great poverty had come to Sicily, and he saw
want wandering from town to town and from house
to house like the plague, and it had come to Diamante
also.</p>

<p>No one ever came now to Donna Elisa’s shop to
buy anything. The little images of the saints that
Gaetano made stood in close rows on the shelves,
and the rosaries hung in great bunches under the
counter. And Donna Elisa was in great want and
sorrow, because she could not earn anything.</p>

<p>That was a sign to Gaetano that he must leave
Diamante, go out into the world, emigrate if there
was no other way. For it could not be working to
the honor of God to carve images that never were
worshipped, and to turn rosary beads that never
glided through a petitioner’s fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed to him that, somewhere in the world,
there must be a beautiful, newly built cathedral,
with finished walls, but whose interior yet stood
shivering in nakedness. It awaited Gaetano’s coming
to carve the choir chairs, the altar-rail, the
pulpit, the lectern, and the shrine. His heart ached
with longing for that work which was waiting.</p>

<p>But there was no such cathedral in Sicily, for
there no one ever thought of building a new church;
it must be far away in such lands as Florida or
Argentina, where the earth is not yet overcrowded
with holy buildings.</p>

<p>He felt at the same time trembling and happy,
and had begun to work with redoubled zeal in order
that Donna Elisa should have something to sell
while he was away earning great fortunes for her.</p>

<p>Now he was waiting for but one more sign from
God before he decided on the journey. And this
was that he should have the strength to speak to
Donna Elisa of his longing to go. For he knew that
it would cause her such sorrow that he did not know
how he could bring himself to speak of it.</p>

<p>While he stood and thought Donna Elisa came
into the workshop. Then he said to himself that
this day he could not think of saying it to her, for
to-day Donna Elisa was happy. Her tongue wagged
and her face beamed.</p>

<p>Gaetano asked himself when he had seen her so.
Ever since the famine had come, it had been as if
they had lived without light in one of the caves of
Etna.</p>

<p>Why had Gaetano not been with her in the square
and heard the music? asked Donna Elisa. Why did
he never come to hear and see her brother, Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Ferrante? Gaetano, who only saw him when he
stood in the shop with his tufts of hair and his short
jacket, did not know what kind of a man he was.
He considered him an ugly old tradesman, who had
a wrinkled face and a rough beard. No one knew
Don Ferrante who had not seen him on Sunday,
when he conducted the music.</p>

<p>That day he had donned a new uniform. He
wore a three-cornered hat with green, red, and white
feathers, silver on his collar, silver-fringed epaulets,
silver braid on his breast, and a sword at his
side. And when he stepped up to the conductor’s
platform the wrinkles had been smoothed out of his
face and his figure had grown erect. He could
almost have been called handsome.</p>

<p>When he had led <i lang="it">Cavalleria</i>, people had hardly
been able to breathe. What had Gaetano to say to
that, that the big houses round the market-place had
sung too? From the black Palazzo Geraci, Donna
Elisa had distinctly heard a love song, and from the
convent, empty as it was, a beautiful hymn had
streamed out over the market-place.</p>

<p>And when there was a pause in the music the
handsome advocate Favara, who had been dressed in
a black velvet coat and a big broad-brimmed hat
and a bright red necktie, had gone up to Don
Ferrante, and had pointed out over the open side
of the square, where Etna and the sea lay. “Don
Ferrante,” he had said, “you lift us toward the skies,
just as Etna does, and you carry us away into the
eternal, like the infinite sea.”</p>

<p>If Gaetano had seen Don Ferrante to-day he
would have loved him. At least he would have
been obliged to acknowledge his stateliness. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
he laid down his baton for a while and took the
advocate’s arm, and walked forward and back with
him on the flat stones by the Roman gate and the
Palazzo Geraci, every one could see that he could
well measure himself against the handsome Favara.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa sat on the stone bench by the cathedral,
in company with the wife of the syndic. And
Signora Voltaro had said quite suddenly, after sitting
for a while, watching Don Ferrante: “Donna
Elisa, your brother is still a young man. He may
still be married, in spite of his fifty years.”</p>

<p>And she, Donna Elisa, had answered that she
prayed heaven for it every day.</p>

<p>But she had hardly said it, when a lady dressed
in mourning came into the square. Never had anything
so black been seen before. It was not enough
that dress and hat and gloves were black; her veil
was so thick that it was impossible to believe that
there was a face behind it. Santissimo Dio! it
looked as if she had hung a pall over herself. And
she had walked slowly, and with a stoop. People
had almost feared, believing that it was a ghost.</p>

<p>Alas, alas! the whole market-place had been so
full of gayety! The peasants, who were at home
over Sunday, had stood there in great crowds in
holiday dress, with red shawls wound round their
necks. The peasant women on their way to the
cathedral had glided by, dressed in green skirts and
yellow neckerchiefs. A couple of travellers had
stood by the balustrade and looked at Etna; they
had been dressed in white. And all the musicians
in uniform, who had been almost as fine as Don
Ferrante, and the shining instruments, and the
carved cathedral <i lang="fr">façade</i>! And the sunlight, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Mongibello’s snow top&mdash;so near to-day that one
could almost touch it&mdash;had all been so gay.</p>

<p>Now, when the poor black lady came into the
midst of it all, they had stared at her, and some had
made the sign of the cross. And the children had
rushed down from the steps of the town-hall, where
they were riding on the railing, and had followed
her at a few feet’s distance. And even the lazy
Piero, who had been asleep in the corner of the
balustrade, had raised himself on his elbow. It had
been a resurrection, as if the black Madonna from
the cathedral had come strolling by.</p>

<p>But had no one thought that it was unkind that
all stared at the black lady? Had no one been
moved when she came so slowly and painfully?</p>

<p>Yes, yes; one had been touched, and that had
been Don Ferrante. He had the music in his heart;
he was a good man and he thought: “Curses on all
those funds that are gathered together for the poor,
and that only bring people misfortune! Is not that
poor Signorina Palmeri, whose father has stolen
from a charitable fund, and who is now so ashamed
that she dares not show her face?” And, as he
thought of it, Don Ferrante went towards the black
lady and met her just by the church door.</p>

<p>There he made her a bow, and mentioned his
name. “If I am not mistaken,” Don Ferrante had
said, “you are Signorina Palmeri. I have a favor
to ask of you.”</p>

<p>Then she had started and taken a step backwards,
as if to flee, but she had waited.</p>

<p>“It concerns my sister, Donna Elisa,” he had
said. “She knew your mother, signorina, and she
is consumed with a desire to make your acquaintance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
She is sitting here by the Cathedral. Let me take
you to her!”</p>

<p>And then Don Ferrante put her hand on his arm
and led her over to Donna Elisa. And she made
no resistance. Donna Elisa would like to see who
could have resisted Don Ferrante to-day.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa rose and went to meet the black
lady, and throwing back her veil, kissed her on both
cheeks.</p>

<p>But what a face, what a face! Perhaps it was
not pretty, but it had eyes that spoke, eyes that
mourned and lamented, even when the whole face
smiled. Yes, Gaetano perhaps would not wish to
carve or paint a Madonna from that face, for it was
too thin and too pale; but it is to be supposed
that our Lord knew what he was doing when he
did not put those eyes in a face that was rosy and
round.</p>

<p>When Donna Elisa kissed her, she laid her head
down on her shoulder, and a few short sobs shook
her. Then she looked up with a smile, and the
smile seemed to say: “Ah, does the world look so?
Is it so beautiful? Let me see it and smile at it!
Can a poor unfortunate really dare to look at it?
And to be seen? Can I bear to be seen?”</p>

<p>All that she had said without a word, only with
a smile. What a face, what a face!</p>

<p>But here Gaetano interrupted Donna Elisa.
“Where is she now?” he said. “I too must see
her.”</p>

<p>Then Donna Elisa looked Gaetano in the eyes.
They were glowing and clear, as if they were filled
with fire, and a dark flush rose to his temples.</p>

<p>“You will see her all in good time,” she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
harshly. And she repented of every word she had
said.</p>

<p>Gaetano saw that she was afraid, and he understood
what she feared. It came into his mind to
tell her now that he meant to go away, to go all the
way to America.</p>

<p>Then he understood that the strange signorina
must be very dangerous. Donna Elisa was so sure
that Gaetano would fall in love with her that she
was almost glad to hear that he meant to go away.</p>

<p>For anything seemed better to her than a penniless
daughter-in-law, whose father was a thief.</p>

<h3 id="I_VI">VI<br />
<span class="smaller">DON MATTEO’S MISSION</span></h3>

<p>One afternoon the old priest, Don Matteo, inserted
his feet into newly polished shoes, put on a newly
brushed soutane, and laid his cloak in the most
effective folds. His face shone as he went up the
street, and when he distributed blessings to the old
women spinning by the doorposts, it was with gestures
as graceful as if he had scattered roses.</p>

<p>The street along which Don Matteo was walking
was spanned by at least seven arches, as if every
house wished to bind itself to a neighbor. It ran
small and narrow down the mountain; it was half
street and half staircase; the gutters were always
overflowing, and there were always plenty of orange-skins
and cabbage-leaves to slip on. Clothes hung
on the line, from the ground up to the sky. Wet
shirt-sleeves and apron-strings were carried by the
wind right into Don Matteo’s face. And it felt
horrid and wet, as if Don Matteo had been touched
by a corpse.</p>

<p>At the end of the street lay a little dark square,
and there Don Matteo saw an old house, before
which he stopped. It was big, and square, and
almost without windows. It had two enormous
flights of steps, and two big doors with heavy locks.
And it had walls of black lava, and a “loggia,”
where green slime grew over the tiled floor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
where the spider-webs were so thick that the nimble
lizards were almost held fast in them.</p>

<p>Don Matteo lifted the knocker, and knocked till
it thundered. All the women in the street began
to talk, and to question. All the washerwomen by
the fountain in the square dropped soap and wooden
clapper, and began to whisper, and ask, “What is
Don Matteo’s errand? Why does Don Matteo knock
on the door of an old, haunted house, where nobody
dares to live except the strange signorina, whose
father is in prison?”</p>

<p>But now Giannita opened the door for Don Matteo,
and conducted him through long passages, smelling
of mould and damp. In several places in the floor
the stones were loose, and Don Matteo could see
way down into the cellar, where great armies of rats
raced over the black earth floor.</p>

<p>As Don Matteo walked through the old house, he
lost his good-humor. He did not pass by a stairway
without suspiciously spying up it, and he could not
hear a rustle without starting. He was depressed
as before some misfortune. Don Matteo thought
of the little turbaned Moor who was said to show
himself in that house, and even if he did not see
him, he might be said to have felt him.</p>

<p>At last Giannita opened a door and showed the
priest into a room. The walls there were bare, as
in a stable; the bed was as narrow as a nun’s, and
over it hung a Madonna that was not worth three
soldi. The priest stood and stared at the little
Madonna till the tears rose to his eyes.</p>

<p>While he stood so Signorina Palmeri came into
the room. She kept her head bent and moved slowly,
as if wounded. When the priest saw her he wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to say to her: “You and I, Signorina Palmeri, have
met in a strange old house. Are you here to study
the old Moorish inscriptions or to look for mosaics
in the cellar?” For the old priest was confounded
when he saw Signorina Palmeri. He could not
understand that the noble lady was poor. He could
not comprehend that she was living in the house of
the little Moor.</p>

<p>He said to himself that he must save her from
this haunted house, and from poverty. He prayed
to the tender Madonna for power to save her.</p>

<p>Thereupon he said to the signorina that he had
come with a commission from Don Ferrante Alagona.
Don Ferrante had confided to him that she had
refused his proposal of marriage. Why was that?
Did she not know that, although Don Ferrante
seemed to be poor as he stood in his shop, he was
really the richest man in Diamante? And Don
Ferrante was of an old Spanish family of great consideration,
both in their native country and in Sicily.
And he still owned the big house on the Corso that
had belonged to his ancestors. She should not have
said no to him.</p>

<p>While Don Matteo was speaking, he saw how the
signorina’s face grew stiff and white. He was
almost afraid to go on. He feared that she was
going to faint.</p>

<p>It was only with the greatest effort that she was
able to answer him. The words would not pass her
lips. It seemed as if they were too loathsome to
utter. She quite understood, she said, that Don
Ferrante would like to know why she had refused
his proposal. She was infinitely touched and grateful
on account of it, but she could not be his wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
She could not marry, for she brought dishonor and
disgrace with her as a marriage portion.</p>

<p>“If you marry an Alagona, dear signorina,” said
Don Matteo, “you need not fear that any one will
ask of what family you are. It is an honorable old
name. Don Ferrante and his sister, Donna Elisa,
are considered the first people in Diamante, although
they have lost all the family riches, and have to
keep a shop. Don Ferrante knows well enough that
the glory of the old name would not be tarnished by
a marriage with you. Have no scruples for that,
signorina, if otherwise you may be willing to marry
Don Ferrante.”</p>

<p>But Signorina Palmeri repeated what she had said.
Don Ferrante should not marry the daughter of a
convict. She sat pale and despairing, as if wishing
to practise saying those terrible words. She said
that she did not wish to enter a family which would
despise her. She succeeded in saying it in a hard,
cold voice, without emotion.</p>

<p>But the more she said, the greater became Don
Matteo’s desire to help her. He felt as if he had
met a queen who had been torn from her throne. A
burning desire came over him to set the crown again
upon her head, and fasten the mantle about her
shoulders.</p>

<p>Therefore Don Matteo asked her if her father
were not soon coming out of prison, and he wondered
what he would live on.</p>

<p>The signorina answered that he would live on her
work.</p>

<p>Don Matteo asked her very seriously whether she
had thought how her father, who had always been
rich, could bear poverty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she was silent. She tried to move her lips
to answer, but could not utter a sound.</p>

<p>Don Matteo talked and talked. She looked more
and more frightened, but she did not yield.</p>

<p>At last he knew not what to do. How could he
save her from that haunted house, from poverty, and
from the burden of dishonor that weighed her down?
But then his eyes chanced to fall on the little image
of the Madonna over the bed. So the young signorina
was a believer.</p>

<p>The spirit of inspiration came to Don Matteo.
He felt that God had sent him to save this poor
woman. When he spoke again, there was a new
ring in his voice. He understood that it was not he
alone who spoke.</p>

<p>“My daughter,” he said, and rose, “you will
marry Don Ferrante for your father’s sake! It is
the Madonna’s will, my daughter.”</p>

<p>There was something impressive in Don Matteo’s
manner. No one had ever seen him so before.
The signorina trembled, as if a spirit voice had
spoken to her, and she clasped her hands.</p>

<p>“Be a good and faithful wife to Don Ferrante,”
said Don Matteo, “and the Madonna promises you
through me that your father will have an old age
free of care.”</p>

<p>Then the signorina saw that it was an inspiration
which guided Don Matteo. It was God speaking
through him. And she sank down on her knees,
and bent her head. “I shall do what you command,”
she said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But when the priest, Don Matteo, came out of the
house of the little Moor and went up the street, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
suddenly took out his breviary and began to read.
And although the wet clothes struck him on the
cheek, and the little children and the orange-peels
lay in wait for him, he only looked in his book. He
needed to hear the great words of God.</p>

<p>For within that black house everything had
seemed certain and sure, but when he came out into
the sunshine he began to worry about the promise
he had given in the name of the Madonna.</p>

<p>Don Matteo prayed and read, and read and prayed.
Might the great God in heaven protect the woman,
who had believed him and obeyed him as if he had
been a prophet!</p>

<p>Don Matteo turned the corner into the Corso.
He struck against donkeys on their way home, with
travelling signorinas on their backs; he walked
right into peasants coming home from their work,
and he pushed against the old women spinning, and
entangled their thread. At last he came to a little,
dark shop.</p>

<p>It was a shop without a window which was at the
corner of an old palace. The threshold was a foot
high; the floor was of trampled earth; the door
almost always stood open to let in the light. The
counter was besieged by peasants and mule-drivers.</p>

<p>And behind the counter stood Don Ferrante.
His beard grew in tufts; his face was in one wrinkle;
his voice was hoarse with rage. The peasants
demanded an immoderately high payment for the
loads that they had driven up from Catania.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="I_VII">VII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BELLS OF SAN PASQUALE</span></h3>

<p>The people of Diamante soon perceived that Don
Ferrante’s wife, Donna Micaela, was nothing but a
great child. She could never succeed in looking
like a woman of the world, and she really was nothing
but a child. And nothing else was to be expected,
after the life she had led.</p>

<p>Of the world she had seen nothing but its
theatres, museums, ball-rooms, promenades, and race
courses; and all such are only play places. She
had never been allowed to go alone on the street.
She had never worked. No one had ever spoken
seriously to her. She had not even been in love
with any one.</p>

<p>After she had moved into the summer palace she
forgot her cares as gayly and easily as a child would
have done. And it appeared that she had the playful
disposition of a child, and that she could transform
and change everything about her.</p>

<p>The old dirty Saracen town Diamante seemed
like a paradise to Donna Micaela. She said that
she had not been at all surprised when Don Ferrante
had spoken to her in the square, nor when he had
proposed to her. It seemed quite natural to her
that such things should happen in Diamante. She
had seen instantly that Diamante was a town where
rich men went and sought out poor, unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
signorinas to make them mistresses of their black
lava palaces.</p>

<p>She also liked the summer-palace. The faded
chintz, a hundred years old, that covered the furniture
told her stories. And she found a deep meaning
in all the love scenes between the shepherds
and shepherdesses on the walls.</p>

<p>She had soon found out the secret of Don Ferrante.
He was no ordinary shop-keeper in a side street.
He was a man of ambition, who was collecting
money in order to buy back the family estate on
Etna and the palace in Catania and the castle on the
mainland. And if he went in short jacket and
pointed cap, like a peasant, it was in order the
sooner to be able to appear as a grandee of Spain
and prince of Sicily.</p>

<p>After they were married Don Ferrante always
used every evening to put on a velvet coat, take
his guitar under his arm, and place himself on the
stairway to the gallery in the music-room in the
summer-palace and sing canzoni. While he sang,
Donna Micaela dreamed that she had been married
to the noblest man in beautiful Sicily.</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela had been married a few
months her father was released from prison and
came to live at the summer palace with his daughter.
He liked the life in Diamante and became friends
with every one. He liked to talk to the bee-raisers
and vineyard workers whom he met at the Café
Europa, and he amused himself every day by riding
about on the slopes of Etna to look for antiquities.</p>

<p>But he had by no means forgiven his daughter.
He lived under her roof, but he treated her like a
stranger, and never showed her affection. Donna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Micaela let him go on and pretended not to notice
it. She could not take his anger seriously any
longer. That old man, whom she loved, believed
that he would be able to go on hating her year after
year! He would live near her, hear her speak, see
her eyes, be encompassed by her love, and he could
continue to hate her! Ah, he knew neither her nor
himself. She used to sit and imagine how it would
be when he must acknowledge that he was conquered;
when he must come and show her that he
loved her.</p>

<p>One day Donna Micaela was standing on her
balcony waving her hand to her father, who rode
away on a small, dark-brown pony, when Don Ferrante
came up from the shop to speak to her. And
what Don Ferrante wished to say was that he had
succeeded in getting her father admitted to “The
Brotherhood of the Holy Heart” in Catania.</p>

<p>But although Don Ferrante spoke very distinctly,
Donna Micaela seemed not to understand him at all.</p>

<p>He had to repeat to her that he had been in Catania
the day before, and that he had succeeded in getting
Cavaliere Palmeri into a brotherhood. He was to
enter it in a month.</p>

<p>She only asked: “What does that mean? What
does that mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Don Ferrante, “can I not have wearied
of buying your father expensive wines from the
mainland, and may I not sometimes wish to ride
Domenico?”</p>

<p>When he had said that, he wished to go. There
was nothing more to say.</p>

<p>“But tell me first what kind of a brotherhood it
is,” she said.&mdash;“What it is! A lot of old men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
live there.”&mdash;“Poor old men?”&mdash;“Oh, well, not so
rich.”&mdash;“They do not have a room to themselves, I
suppose?”&mdash;“No, but very big dormitories.”&mdash;“And
they eat from tin basins on a table without
a cloth?”&mdash;“No, they must be china.”&mdash;“But
without a table-cloth?”&mdash;“Lord, if the table is
clean!”</p>

<p>He added, to silence her: “Very good people live
there. If you like to know it, it was not without
hesitation they would receive Cavaliere Palmeri.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Don Ferrante went. His wife was in
despair, but also very angry. She thought that he
had divested himself of rank and class and become
only a plain shop-keeper.</p>

<p>She said aloud, although no one heard her, that
the summer palace was only a big, ugly old house,
and Diamante a poor and miserable town.</p>

<p>Naturally, she would not allow her father to leave
her. Don Ferrante would see.</p>

<p>When they had eaten their dinner Don Ferrante
wished to go to the Café Europa and play dominoes,
and he looked about for his hat. Donna Micaela
took his hat and followed him out to the gallery
that ran round the court-yard. When they were far
enough from the dining-room for her father not to
be able to hear them, she said passionately:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Have you anything against my father?”&mdash;“He
is too expensive.”&mdash;“But you are rich.”&mdash;“Who
has given you such an idea? Do you not see how
I am struggling?”&mdash;“Save in some other way.”&mdash;“I
shall save in other ways. Giannita has had presents
enough.”&mdash;“No, economize on something for
me.”&mdash;“You! you are my wife; you shall have it
as you have it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>She stood silent a moment. She was thinking
what she could say to frighten him.</p>

<p>“If I am now your wife, do you know why it is?”&mdash;“Oh
yes.”&mdash;“Do you also know what the priest
promised me?”&mdash;“That is his affair, but I do what
I can.”&mdash;“You have heard, perhaps, that I broke
with all my friends in Catania when I heard that
my father had sought help from them and had not
got it.”&mdash;“I know it.”&mdash;“And that I came here to
Diamante that he might escape from seeing them
and being ashamed?”&mdash;“They will not be coming
to the brotherhood.”&mdash;“When you know all this,
are you not afraid to do anything against my father?”&mdash;“Afraid?
I am not afraid of my wife.”</p>

<p>“Have I not made you happy?” she asked.&mdash;“Yes,
of course,” he answered indifferently.&mdash;“Have
you not enjoyed singing to me? Have you
not liked me to have considered you the most
generous man in Sicily? Have you not been glad
that I was happy in the old palace? Why should it
all come to an end?”</p>

<p>He laid his hand on her shoulder and warned her.
“Remember that you are not married to a fine gentleman
from the Via Etnea!”&mdash;“Oh, no!”&mdash;“Up here
on the mountain the ways are different. Here wives
obey their husbands. And we do not care for fair
words. But if we want them we know how to get
them.”</p>

<p>She was frightened when he spoke so. In a
moment she was on her knees before him. It was
dark, but enough light came from the other rooms
for him to see her eyes. In burning prayer, glorious
as stars, they were fixed on him.</p>

<p>“Be merciful! You do not know how much I love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
him!” Don Ferrante laughed. “You ought to
have begun with that. Now you have made me
angry.” She still knelt and looked up at him.
“It is well,” he said, “for you hereafter to know
how you shall behave.” Still she knelt. Then he
asked: “Shall I tell him, or will you?”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela was ashamed that she had humbled
herself. She rose and answered imperiously: “I
shall tell him, but not till the last day. And you
<em>shall</em> not let him notice anything.”</p>

<p>“No, I <em>shall</em> not,” he said, and mimicked her.
“The less talk about it, the better for me.”</p>

<p>But when he was gone Donna Micaela laughed
at Don Ferrante for believing that he could do
what he liked with her father. She knew some one
who would help her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the Cathedral at Diamante there is a miracle-working
image of the Madonna, and this is its
story.</p>

<p>Long, long ago a holy hermit lived in a cave on
Monte Chiaro. And this hermit dreamed one night
that in the harbor of Catania lay a ship loaded with
images of the saints, and among these there was one
so holy that Englishmen, who are richer than anybody
else, would have paid its weight in gold for it.
As soon as the hermit awoke from this dream he
started for Catania. In the harbor lay a ship loaded
with images of the saints, and among the images
was one of the holy Madonna that was more holy
than all the others. The hermit begged the captain
not to carry that image away from Sicily, but to
give it to him. But the captain refused. “I shall
take it to England,” he said, “and the Englishmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
will pay its weight in gold.” The hermit renewed
his petitions. At last the captain had his men
drive him on shore, and hoisted his sail to depart.</p>

<p>It looked as if the holy image was to be lost to
Sicily; but the hermit knelt down on one of the
lava blocks on the shore and prayed to God that
it might not be. And what happened? The ship
could not go. The anchor was up, the sail hoisted,
and the wind fresh; but for three long days the
ship lay as motionless as if it had been a rock. On
the third day the captain took the Madonna image
and threw it to the hermit, who still lay on the
shore. And immediately the ship glided out of the
harbor. The hermit carried the image to Monte
Chiaro, and it is still in Diamante, where it has a
chapel and an altar in the Cathedral.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela was now going to this Madonna
to pray for her father.</p>

<p>She sought out the Madonna’s chapel, which was
built in a dark corner of the Cathedral. The walls
were covered with votive offerings, with silver hearts
and pictures that had been given by all those who
had been helped by the Madonna of Diamante.</p>

<p>The image was hewn in black marble, and when
Donna Micaela saw it standing in its niche, high
and dark, and almost hidden by a golden railing, it
seemed to her that its face was beautiful, and that
it shone with mildness. And her heart was filled
with hope.</p>

<p>Here was the powerful queen of heaven; here was
the good Mother Mary; here was the afflicted
mother who understood every sorrow; here was one
who would not allow her father to be taken from her.</p>

<p>Here she would find help. She would need only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to fall on her knees and tell her trouble, to have the
black Madonna come to her assistance.</p>

<p>While she prayed she felt certain that Don
Ferrante was even at that moment changing his
mind. When she came home he would come to
meet her and say to her that she might keep her
father.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a morning three weeks later.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela came out of the summer palace to
go to early mass; but before she set out to the
church, she went into Donna Elisa’s shop to buy a
wax candle. It was so early that she had been
afraid that the shop would not be open; but it was,
and she was glad to be able to take a gift with her
to the black Madonna.</p>

<p>The shop was empty when Donna Micaela came
in, and she pushed the door forward and back to
make the bell ring and call Donna Elisa in. At
last some one came, but it was not Donna Elisa; it
was a young man.</p>

<p>That young man was Gaetano, whom Donna
Micaela scarcely knew. For Gaetano had heard so
much about her that he was afraid to meet her, and
every time she had come over to Donna Elisa he had
shut himself into his workshop. Donna Micaela
knew no more about him than that he was to leave
Diamante, and that he was always carving holy
images for Donna Elisa to have something to sell
while he was earning great fortunes away in
Argentina.</p>

<p>When she now saw Gaetano, she found him so
handsome that it made her glad to look at him. She
was full of anxiety as a hunted animal, but no sorrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in the world could prevent her from feeling joy at
the sight of anything so beautiful.</p>

<p>She asked herself where she had seen him before,
and she remembered that she had seen his face in
her father’s wonderful collection of pictures in the
palace at Catania. There he had not been in working
blouse; he had had a black felt hat with long,
flowing, white feathers, and a broad lace collar over
a velvet coat. And he had been painted by the
great master Van Dyck.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela asked Gaetano for a wax candle,
and he began to look for one. And now, strangely
enough, Gaetano, who saw the little shop every day,
seemed to be quite strange there. He looked for
the wax candle in the drawers of rosaries and in the
little medallion boxes. He could not find anything,
and he grew so impatient that he turned out the
drawers and broke the boxes open. The destruction
and disorder were terrible. And it would be a real
grief to Donna Elisa when she came home.</p>

<p>But Donna Micaela liked to see how he shook the
thick hair back from his face, and how his gold-colored
eyes glowed like yellow wine when the sun
shines through it. It was a consolation to see any
one so beautiful.</p>

<p>Then Donna Micaela asked pardon of the noble
gentlemen whom the great Van Dyck had painted.
For she had often said to them: “Ah, signor, you
have been beautiful, but you never could have been
so dark and so pale and so melancholy. And you
did not possess such eyes of fire. All that the
master who painted you has put into your face.”
But when Donna Micaela saw Gaetano she found
that it all could be in a face, and that the master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
had not needed to add anything. Therefore she
asked the noble old gentlemen’s pardon.</p>

<p>At last Gaetano had found the long candle-boxes
that stood under the counter, where they had always
stood. And he gave her the candle, but he did not
know what it cost, and said that she could come in
and pay it later. When she asked him for something
to wrap it in he was in such trouble that she
had to help him to look.</p>

<p>It grieved her that such a man should think of
travelling to Argentina.</p>

<p>He let Donna Micaela wrap up the candle and
watched her while she did it. She wished she could
have asked him not to look at her now, when her
face reflected only hopelessness and misery.</p>

<p>Gaetano had not scrutinized her features more
than a moment before he sprang up on a little step-ladder,
took down an image from the topmost shelf,
and came back with it to her. It was a little gilded
and painted wooden angel, a little San Michele
fighting with the arch-fiend, which he had created
from paper and wadding.</p>

<p>He handed it to Donna Micaela and begged her to
accept it. He wished to give it to her, he said,
because it was the best he had ever carved. He
was so certain that it had greater power than his
other images that he had put it away on the top
shelf, so that no one might see and buy it. He
had forbidden Donna Elisa to sell it except to one
who had a great sorrow. And now Donna Micaela
was to take it.</p>

<p>She hesitated. She found him almost too daring.</p>

<p>But Gaetano begged her to look how well the
image was carved. She saw that the archangel’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
wings were ruffled with anger, and that Lucifer was
pressing his claws into the steel plate on his leg?
Did she see how San Michele was driving in his
spear, and how he was frowning and pressing his
lips together?</p>

<p>He wished to lay the little image in her hand, but
she gently pushed it away. She saw that it was
beautiful and spirited, she said, but she knew that
it could not help her. She thanked him for his
gift, but she would not accept it.</p>

<p>Then Gaetano seized the image and rolled it in
paper and put it back in its place.</p>

<p>And not until it was wrapped up and put away
did he speak to her.</p>

<p>But then he asked her why she came to buy wax
candles if she was not a believer. Did she mean to
say that she did not believe in San Michele? Did
she not know that he was the most powerful of the
angels, and that it was he who had vanquished
Lucifer and thrown him into Etna? Did she not
believe that it was true? Did she not know that
San Michele lost a wing-feather in the fight, and
that it was found in Caltanisetta? Did she know it
or not? Or what did she mean by San Michele not
being able to help her? Did she think that none of
the saints could help? And he, who was standing
in his workshop all day long, carving saints!&mdash;would
he do such a thing if there was no good in it?
Did she believe that he was an impostor?</p>

<p>But as Donna Micaela was just as strong a believer
as Gaetano, she thought that his speech was
unjust, and it irritated her to contradiction.</p>

<p>“It sometimes happens that the saints do not
help,” she said to him. And when Gaetano looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
unbelieving, she was seized by an uncontrollable
desire to convince him, and she said to him that
some one had promised her in the name of the
Madonna that, if she was a faithful wife to Don
Ferrante, her father should enjoy an old age free
of care. But now her husband wished to put her
father in a brotherhood, which was as wretched as a
poor-house and strict as a prison. And the Madonna
had not averted it; in eight days it would happen.</p>

<p>Gaetano listened to her with the greatest earnestness.
That was what induced her to confide the
whole story to him.</p>

<p>“Donna Micaela,” he said, “you must turn to the
black Madonna in the Cathedral.”</p>

<p>“So you think that I have not prayed to her?”</p>

<p>Gaetano flushed and said almost with anger: “You
will not say that you have turned in vain to the
black Madonna?”</p>

<p>“I have prayed to her in vain these last three
weeks&mdash;prayed to her, prayed to her.”</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela spoke of it she could scarcely
breathe. She wanted to weep over herself because
she had awaited help each day, and each day been
disappointed; and yet had known nothing better to
do than begin again with her prayers. And it was
visible on her face that her soul lived over and over
again what she had suffered, when each day she had
awaited an answer to her prayer, while the days
slipped by.</p>

<p>But Gaetano was unmoved; he stood smiling, and
drummed on one of the glass cases that stood on the
counter.</p>

<p>“Have you only <em>prayed</em> to the Madonna?” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Only prayed, only prayed! But she had also
promised her to lay aside all sins. She had gone to
the street where she had lived first, and nursed the
sick woman with the ulcerated leg. She never
passed a beggar without giving alms.</p>

<p>Only prayed! And she told him that if the
Madonna had had the power to help her, she ought
to have been satisfied with her prayers. She had
spent her days in the Cathedral. And the anguish,
the anguish that tortured her, should not that be
counted?</p>

<p>He only shrugged his shoulders. Had she not
tried anything else?</p>

<p>Anything else! But there was nothing in the
world that she had not tried. She had given silver
hearts and wax candles. Her rosary was never out
of her hand.</p>

<p>Gaetano irritated her. He would not count anything
that she had done; he only asked: “Nothing
else? Nothing else?”</p>

<p>“But you ought to understand,” she said. “Don
Ferrante does not give me so much money. I cannot
do more. At last I have succeeded in getting
some silk and cloth for an altar cloth. You ought
to understand!”</p>

<p>But Gaetano, who had daily intercourse with the
saints, and who knew the power and wildness of
enthusiasm that had filled them when they had
compelled God to obey their prayers, smiled scornfully
at Donna Micaela, who thought she could subjugate
the Madonna with wax candles and altar-cloths.</p>

<p>He understood very well, he answered. The
whole was clear to him. It was always so with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
those miserable saints. Everybody called to them
for help, but few understood what they ought to do
to get their prayers granted. And then people said
that the saints had no power. All were helped who
knew how they ought to pray.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela looked up in eager expectation.
There was such strength and conviction in Gaetano’s
words that she began to believe that he would teach
her the right words of salvation.</p>

<p>Gaetano took the candle lying in front of her on
the counter and threw it down into the box again,
and told her what she had to do. He forbade her
to give the Madonna any gifts, or to pray to her, or
to do anything for the poor. He told her that he
would tear her altar-cloth to pieces if she sewed
another stitch on it.</p>

<p>“Show her, Donna Micaela, that it means something
to you,” he said, and fixed his eyes on her
with compelling force. “Good Lord, you must be
able to find something to do, to show her that it is
serious, and not play. You must be able to show
her that you will not live if you are not helped.
Do you mean to continue to be faithful to Don
Ferrante, if he sends your father away? I know
you do. If the Madonna has no need to fear what
you are going to do, why should she help you?”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela drew back. He came swiftly out
from behind the counter and seized her coat sleeve.</p>

<p>“Do you understand? You shall show her that
you can throw yourself away if you do not get help.
You shall throw yourself into sin and death if you
do not get what you want. That is the way to force
the saints.”</p>

<p>She tore herself from him and went without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
word. She hurried up the spiral street, came to
the Cathedral, and threw herself down in terror
before the altar of the black Madonna.</p>

<p>That happened one Saturday morning, and on
Sunday evening Donna Micaela saw Gaetano again.
For it was beautiful moonlight, and in Diamante it
is the custom on moonlight nights for all to leave
their homes and go out into the streets. As soon
as the inhabitants of the summer palace had come
outside their door they had met acquaintances.
Donna Elisa had taken Cavaliere Palmeri’s arm,
and the syndic Voltaro had joined Don Ferrante to
discuss the elections; but Gaetano came up to
Donna Micaela because he wished to hear if she had
followed his advice.</p>

<p>“Have you stopped sewing on that altar-cloth?”
he said.</p>

<p>But Donna Micaela answered that all day yesterday
she had sewn on it.</p>

<p>“Then it is you who understand what you are
doing, Donna Micaela.”</p>

<p>“Yes, now there is no help for it, Don Gaetano.”</p>

<p>She managed to keep them away from the others,
for there was something she wished to speak to him
about. And when they came to Porta Etnea, she
turned out through the gate, and they went along
the paths that wind under Monte Chiaro’s palm
groves.</p>

<p>They could not have walked on the streets filled
with people. Donna Micaela spoke so the people
in Diamante would have stoned her if they had
heard her.</p>

<p>She asked Gaetano if he had ever seen the black
Madonna in the Cathedral. She had not seen her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
till yesterday. The Madonna perhaps had placed
herself in such a dark corner of the Cathedral so that
no one should be able to see her. She was so black,
and had a railing in front of her. No one could see
her.</p>

<p>But to-day Donna Micaela had seen her. To-day
the Madonna had had a festival, and she had been
moved from her niche. The floor and walls of her
chapel had been covered with white almond-blossoms,
and she herself had stood down on the altar, dark
and high, surrounded by the white glory.</p>

<p>But when Donna Micaela had seen the image she
had been filled with despair; for the image was no
Madonna. No, she had prayed to no Madonna.
Oh, a shame, a shame! It was plainly an old heathen
goddess. She had a helmet, not a crown; she had
no child on her arm; she had a shield. It was a
Pallas Athene. It was no Madonna. Oh, no; oh, no!</p>

<p>It was like the people of Diamante to worship
such an image. It was like them to set up such a
blasphemy and worship it! Did he know what was
the worst misfortune? Their Madonna was so ugly.
She was disfigured, and she had never been a work
of art. She was so ugly that one could not bear to
look at her.</p>

<p>And to have been deceived by all the thousand
votive offerings that hung in the chapel; to have
been fooled by all the legends about her! To have
wasted three weeks in praying to her! Why had
she not been helped? She was no Madonna, she
was no Madonna.</p>

<p>They walked along the path on the town wall
running around Monte Chiaro. The whole world
was white about them. A white mist wreathed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
base of the mountain, and the almond-trees on Etna
were quite white. Sometimes they passed under an
almond-tree, which arched them over with its glistening
branches, as thickly covered with flowers as if
they had been dipped in a bath of silver. The
moonlight shone so bright on the earth that everything
was divested of its color, and became white.
It seemed almost strange that it could not be felt,
that it did not warm, that it did not dazzle the eyes.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela wondered if it was the moonlight
that subdued Gaetano, so that he did not seize her,
and throw her down into Simeto, when she cursed
the black Madonna.</p>

<p>He walked silent and quiet at her side, but she
was afraid of what he might do. In spite of her
fear, she could not be silent.</p>

<p>What she had still to say was the most dreadful
of all. She said that she had tried all day long to
think of the real Madonna, and that she had recalled
to her mind all the images of her she had ever seen.
But it had all been in vain, because as soon as she
thought of the shining queen of heaven, the old
black goddess came and placed herself between
them. She saw her come like a dried-up and
officious old maid, and stand in front of the great
queen of heaven, so that now no Madonna existed
for her any longer. She believed that the latter was
angry with her because she had done so much for
the other, and that she hid her face and her grace
from her. And, on account of the false Madonna,
her father was now to suffer misfortune. Now she
would never be allowed to keep him in her home.
Now she would never win his forgiveness. Oh,
God! oh, God!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>And all this she said to Gaetano, who honored the
black Madonna of Diamante more than anything else
in the world.</p>

<p>He now came close up to Donna Micaela, and she
feared that it was her last hour. She said in a faint
voice, as if to excuse herself: “I am mad. Grief is
driving me mad. I never sleep.”</p>

<p>But Gaetano’s only thought had been what a child
she was, and that she did not at all understand how
to meet life.</p>

<p>He hardly knew himself what he was doing when
he gently drew her to him and kissed her, because
she had gone so astray and was such a helpless
child.</p>

<p>She was so overcome with astonishment that she
did not even think of avoiding it. And she neither
screamed nor ran away. She understood instantly
that he had kissed her as he would a child. She
only walked quickly on and began to cry. That kiss
had made her feel how helpless and forsaken she
was, and how much she longed for some one strong
and good to take care of her.</p>

<p>It was terrible that, although she had both father
and husband, she should be so forsaken that this
stranger should need to feel sympathy for her.</p>

<p>When Gaetano saw her trembling with silent sobs,
he felt that he too began to shake. A strong and
violent emotion took possession of him.</p>

<p>He came close to her once more and laid his hand
on her arm. And his voice, when he spoke, was
not clear and loud; it was thick and choked with
emotion.</p>

<p>“Will you go with me to Argentina if the
Madonna does not help you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Donna Micaela shook him off. She felt
suddenly that he no longer talked to her as to a
child. She turned and went back into the town.
Gaetano did not follow her; he remained standing
in the path where he had kissed her, and it seemed
as if never again could he leave that place.</p>

<p>For two days Gaetano dreamed of Donna Micaela,
but on the third he came to the summer palace to
speak to her.</p>

<p>He found her on the roof-garden, and instantly told
her that she must flee with him.</p>

<p>He had thought it out since they parted. He had
stood in his workshop and considered everything
that had happened, and now it was all clear to
him.</p>

<p>She was a rose which the strong sirocco had torn
from its stem and roughly whirled through the air,
that she might find so much the better rest and
protection in a heart which loved her. She must
understand that God and all the saints wished and
desired that they should love one another, otherwise
these great misfortunes would not have brought her
near to him. If the Madonna refused to help her,
it was because she wished to set her free from
her promise of faithfulness to Don Ferrante. For
all the saints knew that she was his, Gaetano’s.
She was created for him; for him she had grown up;
for him she was alive. When he kissed her in the
path in the moonlight he had been like a lost child
who had wandered long in the desert and now at last
had come to the gate of his home. He possessed
nothing; but she was his home and his hearth; she
was the inheritance God had apportioned to him,
the only thing in the world that was his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore he could not leave her behind. She
must go with him; she must, she must!</p>

<p>He did not kneel before her. He stood and talked
to her with clenched hands and blazing eyes. He
did not ask her, he commanded her to go with him,
because she was his.</p>

<p>It was no sin to take her away; it was his duty.
What would become of her if he deserted her?</p>

<p>Donna Micaela listened to him without moving.
She sat silent a long time, even after he had ceased
speaking.</p>

<p>“When are you going?” she asked at length.</p>

<p>“I leave Diamante on Saturday.”</p>

<p>“And when does the steamer go?”</p>

<p>“It goes on Sunday evening from Messina.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela rose and walked away towards the
terrace stairs.</p>

<p>“My father is to go to Catania on Saturday,” she
said. “I shall ask Don Ferrante to be allowed to
go with him.” She went down a few steps, as if
she did not mean to say anything more. Then she
stopped. “If you meet me in Catania, I will go
with you whither you will.”</p>

<p>She hurried down the steps. Gaetano did not try
to detain her. A time would come when she would
not run away from him. He knew that she could
not help loving him.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela passed the whole of Friday afternoon
in the Cathedral. She had come to the
Madonna and thrown herself down before her in
despair. “Oh, Madonna mia, Madonna mia! Shall
I be to-morrow a fugitive wife? Will the world
have the right to say all possible evil of me?”
Everything seemed equally terrible to her. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
appalled at the thought of fleeing with Gaetano, and
she did not know how she could stay with Don Ferrante.
She hated the one as much as the other.
Neither of them seemed able to offer her anything
but unhappiness.</p>

<p>She saw that the Madonna would not help. And
now she asked herself if it really would not be a
greater misery to go with Gaetano than to remain
with Don Ferrante. Was it worth while to ruin
herself to be revenged on her husband?</p>

<p>She suffered great anguish. She had been driven
on by a devouring restlessness the whole week.
Worst of all, she could not sleep. She no longer
thought clearly or soundly.</p>

<p>Time and time again she returned to her prayers.
But then she thought: “The Madonna cannot help
me.” And so she stopped.</p>

<p>Then she came to think of the days of her former
sorrows, and remembered the little image that once
had helped her, when she had been in despair as
great as this.</p>

<p>She turned with passionate eagerness to the poor
little child. “Help me, help me! Help my old
father, and help me myself that I may not be
tempted to anger and revenge!”</p>

<p>When she went to bed that night, she was still
tormented and distressed. “If I could sleep only one
hour,” she said, “I should know what I wanted.”</p>

<p>Gaetano was to start on his travels early the next
morning. She came at last to the decision to speak
to him before he left, and tell him that she could
not go with him. She could not bear to be considered
a fallen woman.</p>

<p>She had hardly decided that before she fell asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
She did not wake till the clock struck nine the next
morning. And then Gaetano was already gone.
She could not tell him that she had changed her
mind.</p>

<p>But she did not think of it either. During her
sleep something new and strange had come over her.
It seemed to her that in the night she had lived in
heaven and was filled with bliss.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What saint is there who does more for man than
San Pasquale? Does it not sometimes happen to
you to stand and talk in some lonely place in the
woods or plains, and either to speak ill of some one
or to make plans for something foolish? Now please
notice that just as you are talking and talking you
hear a rustling near by, and look round in wonder to
see if some one has thrown a stone. It is useless to
look about long for the thrower of the stone. It
comes from San Pasquale. As surely as there is
justice in heaven, it was San Pasquale who heard
you talking evil, and threw one of his stones in
warning.</p>

<p>And any one who does not like to be disturbed in
his evil schemes may not console himself with the
thought that San Pasquale’s stones will soon come
to an end. They will not come to an end at all.
There are so many of them that they will hold out
till the last day of the world. For when San Pasquale
lived here on the earth, do you know by chance
what he did, do you know what he thought about
more than anything else? San Pasquale gave heed
to all the little flint-stones that lay in his path, and
gathered them up into his bag. You, signor, you
will scarcely stoop to pick up a soldo, but San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Pasquale picked up every little flint-stone, and when
he died, he took them all with him up to heaven,
and there he sits now, and throws them at everybody
who thinks of doing anything foolish.</p>

<p>But that is not by any means the only use that San
Pasquale is to man. It is he, also, who gives warning
if any one is to be married, or if any one is to
die; and he even gives the sign with something
besides stones. Old Mother Saraedda at Randazzo
sat by her daughter’s sick bed one night and fell
asleep. The daughter lay unconscious and was about
to die, and no one could summon the priest. How
was the mother waked in time? How was she
waked, so that she could send her husband to the
priest’s house? By nothing else than a chair, which
began to rock forward and back, and to crack and
creak, until she awoke. And it was San Pasquale
who did it. Who else but San Pasquale is there to
think of such a thing?</p>

<p>There is one thing more to tell about San Pasquale.
It was of big Cristoforo from Tre Castagni. He
was not a bad man, but he had a bad habit. He
could not open his mouth without swearing. He could
not say two words without one of them being an
oath. And do you think that it did any good for
his wife and neighbors to admonish him? But over
his bed he had a little picture representing San
Pasquale, and the little picture succeeded in helping
him. Every night it swung forward and back in its
frame, swung fast or slow, as he had sworn that day.
And he discovered that he could not sleep a single
night until he stopped swearing.</p>

<p>In Diamante San Pasquale has a church, which
lies outside the Porta Etnea, a little way down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
mountain. It is quite small and poor, but the white
walls and the red roof stand beautifully embedded
in a grove of almond-trees.</p>

<p>Therefore, as soon as the almond-trees bloom in
the spring, San Pasquale’s church becomes the most
beautiful in Diamante. For the blossoming branches
arch over it, thickly covered with white, glistening
flowers, like the most gorgeous garment.</p>

<p>San Pasquale’s church is very miserable and deserted,
because no service can be held there. For
when the Garibaldists, who freed Sicily, came to
Diamante, they camped in San Pasquale’s church
and in the Franciscan monastery beside it. And in
the church itself they stabled brute beasts, and led
such a wild life with women and with gambling
that ever since it has been considered unhallowed
and unclean, and has never been opened for divine
service from that time.</p>

<p>Therefore it is only when the almond-trees are in
bloom that strangers and fine people pay attention
to San Pasquale. For although the whole of the
slopes of Etna are white then with almond-blossoms,
still the biggest and the most luxuriant trees stand
about the old, condemned church.</p>

<p>But the poor people of Diamante come to San
Pasquale the whole year round. For although the
church is always closed, people go there to get
advice from the saint. There is an image of him
under a big stone canopy just by the entrance, and
people come to ask him about the future. No one
can foretell the future better than San Pasquale.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the very morning when
Gaetano left Diamante the clouds had come rolling
down from Etna, as thick as if they had been dust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
from innumerable hosts, and they filled the air like
dark-winged dragons, and vomited forth rain, and
breathed mists and darkness. It grew so thick
over Diamante that one could scarcely see across
the street. The dampness dripped from everything;
the floor was as wet as the roof, the doorposts
and balustrades were covered with drops, the
fog stood and quivered in the passage-ways and
rooms, until one would have thought them full of
smoke.</p>

<p>That very morning, at an early hour, before the
rain had begun, a rich English lady started in her
big travelling-carriage to make the trip round Etna.
But when she had driven a few hours a terrible
rain began, and everything was wrapped in mist.
As she did not wish to miss seeing any of the beautiful
district through which she was travelling, she
determined to drive to the nearest town and to stay
there until the storm was over. That town was
Diamante.</p>

<p>The Englishwoman was a Miss Tottenham, and
it was she who had moved into the Palazzo Palmeri
at Catania. Among all the other things she brought
with her in her trunks was the Christ image, upon
which Donna Micaela had called the evening before.
For that image, which was now both old and mishandled,
she always carried with her, in memory of
an old friend who had left her her wealth.</p>

<p>It seemed as if San Pasquale had known what a
great miracle-worker the image was, for it was as if
he wished to greet him. Just as Miss Tottenham’s
travelling-carriage drove in through Porta Etnea,
the bells began to ring on San Pasquale’s church.</p>

<p>They rang afterwards all day quite by themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>San Pasquale’s bells are not much bigger than
those that are used on farms to call the work people
home; and like them, they are hung under the roof
in a little frame, and set in motion by pulling a rope
that hangs down by the church wall.</p>

<p>It is not heavy work to make the bells ring,
but nevertheless they are not so light that they
can swing quite by themselves. Whoever has
seen old Fra Felice from the Franciscan monastery
put his foot in the loop of the rope and tread
up and down to start them going, knows well
enough that the bells cannot begin to ring without
assistance.</p>

<p>But that was just what they were doing that morning.
The rope was fastened to a cleat in the wall,
and there was no one touching it. Nor did any one
sit crouching on the roof to set them going. People
plainly saw how the bells swung backwards and
forwards, and how the tongues hit against the brazen
throats. It could not be explained.</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela awoke, the bells were
already ringing, and she lay quiet for a long time,
and listened, and listened. She had never heard
anything more beautiful. She did not know that it
was a miracle, but she lay and thought how beautiful
it was. She lay and wondered if real bronze bells
could sound like that.</p>

<p>No one will ever know what the metal was that
rang in San Pasquale’s bells that day.</p>

<p>She thought that the bells said to her that now
she was to be glad; now she was to live and love;
now she was to go to meet something great and
beautiful; now she was never again to have regrets
and never be sad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Then her heart began to dance in a kind of
stately measure, and she marched solemnly to the
sound of bells into a great castle. And to whom
could the castle belong, who could be lord of such
a beautiful place, if not love?</p>

<p>It can be hidden no longer: when Donna Micaela
awoke she felt that she loved Gaetano, and that she
desired nothing better than to go with him.</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela drew back the curtain from
the window and saw the gray morning, she kissed
her hand to it and whispered: “You, who are morning
to the day when I am going away, you are the
most beautiful morning I have ever seen; and gray
as you are, I will caress and kiss you.”</p>

<p>But she still liked the bells best.</p>

<p>By that you may know that her love was strong,
for to all the others it was torture to hear those
bells, that would not stop ringing. No one asked
about them during the first half-hour. During the
first half-hour people hardly heard any ringing, but
during the second and the third!!!</p>

<p>No one need believe that San Pasquale’s little
bells could not make themselves heard. They are
always loud and their clang seemed now to grow
and grow. It soon sounded as if the fog were filled
with bells; as if the sky hung full of them, although
no one could see them for the clouds.</p>

<p>When Donna Elisa first heard the ringing she
thought that it was San Giuseppe’s little bell, and
then that it was the bell of the Cathedral itself.
Then she thought she heard the bell of the Dominican
monastery chime in, and at last she was certain that
all the bells in the town rang and rang all they
could, all the bells in the five monasteries and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
seven churches. She thought that she recognized
them all, until finally she asked, and heard that it
was only San Pasquale’s little bells that were
ringing.</p>

<p>During the first hours, and before people generally
knew that the bells were ringing all by themselves,
they noticed that the raindrops fell in time to the
sound of the bells, and that every one spoke with a
metallic voice. People also noticed that it was
impossible to play on mandolin and guitar, because
the bells blended with the music and made it ear-splitting;
neither could any one read, because the
letters swung to and fro like bell-clappers, and the
words acquired a voice, and read themselves out
quite audibly.</p>

<p>Soon the people could not bear to see flowers on
long stalks, because they thought that they swung
to and fro. And they complained that sound came
from them, instead of fragrance.</p>

<p>Others insisted that the mist floating through the
air moved in time with the sound of the bells, and
they said that all the pendulums conformed to it,
and that every one who went by in the rain tried to
do likewise.</p>

<p>And that was when the bells had only rung a
couple of hours, and when the people still laughed
at them.</p>

<p>But at the third hour the ringing seemed to
increase even more, and then some stuffed cotton
into their ears, while others buried themselves under
pillows. But they felt just as distinctly how the
air quivered with the strokes, and they thought that
they perceived how everything moved in time.
Those who fled up to the dark attic found the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of the bells clear and ringing there, as if they came
from the sky; and those who fled down into the
cellar heard them as loud and deafening there as if
San Pasquale’s church stood under ground.</p>

<p>Every one in Diamante began to be terrified except
Donna Micaela, whom love protected from
fear.</p>

<p>And now people began to think that it must mean
something, because it was San Pasquale’s bells that
rang. Every one began to ask himself what the saint
foretold. Each had his own dread, and believed that
San Pasquale gave warning to him of what he least
wished. Each had a deed on his conscience to remember,
and now thought that San Pasquale was
ringing down a punishment for him.</p>

<p>Toward noon, when the bells still rang, everybody
was sure that San Pasquale was ringing such
a misfortune upon Diamante that they might all
expect to die within the year.</p>

<p>Pretty Giannita came terrified and weeping to
Donna Micaela, and lamented that it was San
Pasquale who was ringing. “God, God, if it had
been any other than San Pasquale!”</p>

<p>“He sees that something terrible is coming to
us,” said Giannita. “The mist does not prevent
him from seeing as far as he will. He sees that an
enemy’s fleet is approaching in the bay! He sees
that a cloud of ashes is rising out of Etna which
will fall over us and bury us!”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela smiled, and thought that she
knew of what San Pasquale was thinking. “He is
tolling a passing-bell for the beautiful almond-blossoms,
that are destroyed by the rain,” she said
to Giannita.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>She let no one frighten her, for she believed that
the bells were ringing for her alone. They rocked
her to dream. She sat quite still in the music-room
and let joy reign in her. But in the whole world
about her was fear and anxiety and restlessness.</p>

<p>No one could sit at his work. No one could think
of anything but the great horror that San Pasquale
foretold.</p>

<p>People began to give the beggars more gifts than
they had ever had; but the beggars did not rejoice,
because they did not believe they would survive the
morrow. And the priests could not rejoice, although
they had so many penitents that they had to sit in
the confessional all day long, and although gift upon
gift was piled up on the altar of the saint.</p>

<p>Not even Vicenzo da Lozzo, the letter-writer, was
glad of the day, although people besieged his desk
under the court-house loggia, and were more than
willing to pay him a soldo a word, if they only
might write a line of farewell on this their last day
to their dear ones far away.</p>

<p>It was not possible to keep school that day, for the
children cried the whole time. At noon the mothers
came, their faces stiff with terror, and took their
little ones home with them, so that they might at
least be together in misfortune.</p>

<p>The apprentices at the tailors and shoe-makers
had a holiday. But the poor boys did not dare to
enjoy it; they preferred to sit in their places in the
workshops, and wait.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the ringing still continued.</p>

<p>Then the old gate-keeper of the palazzo Geraci,
where now no one lives but beggars, and who is
himself a beggar, and goes dressed in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
miserable rags, went and put on the light-green
velvet livery that he wears only on saints’ days and
on the king’s birthday. And no one could see him
sitting in the gateway dressed in that array without
being chilled with fear, for people understood that
the old man expected that no other than destruction
would march in through the gate he was guarding.</p>

<p>It was dreadful how people frightened one another.</p>

<p>Poor Torino, who had once been a man of means,
went from house to house and cried that now the
time had come when every one who had cheated and
beggared him would get his punishment. He went
into all the little shops along the Corso and struck
the counter with his hand, saying that now every
one in the town would get his sentence, because all
had connived to cheat him.</p>

<p>It was also terrifying to hear of the game of cards
at the Café Europa. There the same four had
played year after year at the same table, and no one
had ever thought that they could do anything else.
But now they suddenly let their cards fall, and
promised each other that if they survived the
horror of this day they would never touch them
again.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa’s shop was packed with people; to
propitiate the saints and to avert the menace, they
bought all the sacred things that she had to sell.
But Donna Elisa thought only of Gaetano, who was
away, and believed that San Pasquale was warning
her that he would be lost during the voyage. And
she took no pleasure in all the money that she was
earning.</p>

<p>When San Pasquale’s bells went on ringing the
whole afternoon people could hardly hold out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>For now they knew that it was an earthquake
which they foretold, and that all Diamante would
be wrecked.</p>

<p>In the alleys, where the very houses seemed afraid
of earthquakes, and huddled together to support one
another, people moved their miserable old furniture
out on the street into the rain, and spread tents of
bed-quilts over them. And they even carried out
their little children in their cradles, and piled up
boxes over them.</p>

<p>In spite of the rain, there was such a crowd on the
Corso that it was almost impossible to pass through.
For every one was trying to go out through Porta
Etnea to see the bells swinging and swinging, and to
convince themselves that no one was touching the
rope,&mdash;that it was firmly tied. And all who came
out there fell on their knees in the road, where the
water ran in streams, and the mud was bottomless.</p>

<p>The doors to San Pasquale’s church were shut,
as always, but outside the old gray-brother, Fra
Felice, went about with a brass plate, among those
who prayed, and received their gifts.</p>

<p>In their turn the frightened people went forward
to the image of San Pasquale beneath the stone
canopy, and kissed his hand. An old woman came
carefully carrying something under a green umbrella.
It was a glass with water and oil, in which floated
a little wick burning with a faint flame. She placed
it in front of the image and knelt before it.</p>

<p>Though many thought that they ought to try to
tie up the bells, no one dared to propose it. For no
one dared to silence God’s voice.</p>

<p>Nor did any one dare to say that it might be a
device of old Fra Felice to collect money. Fra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Felice was beloved. It would fare badly with whoever
said such things as that.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela also came out to San Pasquale
and took her father with her. She walked with her
head high and quite without fear. She came to
thank him for having rung a great passion into
her soul. “My life begins this day,” she said to
herself.</p>

<p>Don Ferrante did not seem to be afraid either, but
he was grim and angry. For every one had to go in
to him in his shop, and tell him what they thought,
and hear his opinion, because he was one of the
Alagonas, who had governed the town for so many
years.</p>

<p>All day terrified, trembling people came into his
shop. And they all came up to him and said:
“This is a terrible ringing, Don Ferrante. What
is to become of us, Don Ferrante?”</p>

<p>Even Ugo Favara, the splenetic advocate, came
into the shop, and took a chair, and sat down behind
the counter. And Don Ferrante had him sitting
there all day, quite livid, quite motionless, suffering
the most inconceivable anguish without uttering a
word.</p>

<p>Every five minutes Torino-il-Martello came in
and struck the counter, saying that the hour had come
in which Don Ferrante was to get his punishment.</p>

<p>Don Ferrante was a hard man, but he could no
more escape the bells than any other. And the
longer he heard them, the more he began to wonder
why everybody streamed into his shop. It seemed
as if they meant something special. It seemed as
if they wished to make him responsible for the ringing,
and the evil it portended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>He had not spoken of it to any one, but his wife
must have spread it about. He began to believe that
everybody was thinking the same, although they
did not dare to say it. He thought that the advocate
was sitting and waiting for him to yield. He
believed that the whole town came in to see if he
would really dare to send his father-in-law away.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa, who had so much to do in her own
shop that she could not come herself, sent old Pacifica
continually to him to ask what he thought of the
bell-ringing. And the priest too came to the shop
for a moment and said, like all the others: “Did you
ever hear such a terrible ringing, Don Ferrante?”</p>

<p>Don Ferrante would have liked to know if the
advocate and Don Matteo and all the others came
only to reproach him because he wished to send
Cavaliere Palmeri away.</p>

<p>The blood began to throb in his temples. The
room swam now and then before his eyes. People
came in continually and asked: “Have you ever
heard such a terrible ringing?” But one never
came and asked, and that was Donna Micaela. She
could not come when she felt no fear. She was
merely delighted and proud that the passion which
was to fill her whole life had come. “My life is
to be great and glorious,” she said. And she was
appalled that till now she had been only a child.</p>

<p>She would travel with the post-carriage that went
by Diamante at ten o’clock at night. Towards four,
she thought, she must tell her father everything,
and begin his packing.</p>

<p>But that did not seem hard to her. Her father
would soon come to her in Argentina. She would
beg him to be patient for a few months, until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
could have a home to offer him. And she was
sure that he would be glad to have her leave Don
Ferrante.</p>

<p>She moved in a delicious trance. Everything
that had seemed dreadful appeared so no longer.
There was no shame, no danger; no, none at all.</p>

<p>She only longed to hear the rattling of the post-carriage.</p>

<p>Then she heard many voices on the stairs leading
from the court-yard to the second floor. She heard
a multitude of heavy feet tramping. She saw
people passing through the open portico that ran
round the court-yard, and through which one had to
go to come into the rooms. She saw that they were
carrying something heavy between them, but she
could not see what it was, because there was such a
crowd.</p>

<p>The pale-faced advocate walked before the others.
He came and said to her that Don Ferrante had
wished to drive Torino out of his shop; Torino had
cut him with his knife. It was nothing dangerous.
He was already bandaged and would be well in a
fortnight.</p>

<p>Don Ferrante was carried in, and his eyes wandered
about the room, not in search of Donna
Micaela, but of Cavaliere Palmeri. When he saw
him, he let his wife know without a word, only by a
few gestures, that her father never would need to
leave his house; never, never.</p>

<p>Then she pressed her hands against her eyes.
What, what! her father need not go? She was saved.
A miracle had come to pass to help her!</p>

<p>Ah, now she must be glad, be content! But she
was not. She felt the most terrible pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>She could not go. Her father was allowed to
remain, and so she must be faithful to Don Ferrante.
She struggled to understand. It was so. She could
not go.</p>

<p>She tried to change it in some way. Perhaps it
was a false conclusion. She had been so confused.
No, no, it was so, she could not.</p>

<p>Then she became tired unto death. She had
travelled and travelled the whole day. She had
been so long on the way. And she would never get
there. She sank down. A torpor and faintness
came over her. There was nothing to do but to rest
after the endless journey she had made. But that
she could never do. She began to weep because she
would never reach her journey’s end. Her whole
life long she would travel, travel, travel, and never
reach the end of her journey.</p>

<h3 id="I_VIII">VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">TWO SONGS</span></h3>

<p>It was the morning after the day when San Pasquale’s
bells had rung; and Donna Elisa sat in her shop and
counted her money. The day before, when everyone
had been afraid, there had been an incredible
sale in the shop, and the next morning, when she
had come down, she had at first been almost frightened.
For the whole shop was desolate and empty;
the medallions were gone, the wax candles were
gone, and so were all the great bunches of rosaries.
All Gaetano’s beautiful images had been taken down
from the shelves and sold, and it was a real grief to
Donna Elisa not to see the host of holy men and
women about her.</p>

<p>She opened the money-drawer, and it was so full
that she could hardly pull it out. And while she
counted her money she wept over it as if it had all
been false. For what good did it do her to possess
all those dirty lire and those big copper coins when
she had lost Gaetano!</p>

<p>Alas! she thought that if he had stopped at home
one day more he would not have needed to go, for
now she was laden down with money.</p>

<p>While she was counting she heard the post-carriage
stop outside her door. But she did not even look
up; she did not care what happened, since Gaetano<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
was gone. Then the door opened, and the bell rang
violently. She only wept and counted. Then some
one said: “Donna Elisa, Donna Elisa!” And it
was Gaetano!</p>

<p>“But heavens! how can you be at home?” she
cried.&mdash;“You have sold all your images. I had to
come home to carve new ones for you.”&mdash;“But how
did you find out about it?”&mdash;“I met the post-carriage
at two o’clock in the night. Rosa Alfari
was in it, and she told me everything.”&mdash;“What
luck that you went down to the post-carriage!
What luck that you happened to think of going
down to the post-carriage!”&mdash;“Yes; was it not
good fortune?” said Gaetano.</p>

<p>In less than an hour Gaetano was again standing
in his workshop; and Donna Elisa, who had
nothing at all to do in her empty shop, came incessantly
to the door to look at him. No, was he
really standing there and carving? She could not
let five minutes pass without coming to look at
him.</p>

<p>But when Donna Micaela heard that he was back
she felt no joy, rather anger and despair. For she
was afraid that Gaetano would come to tempt her.</p>

<p>She had heard that a rich Englishwoman had
come to Diamante the day the bells rang. She was
deeply affected when she heard that it was the lady
with the Christ image. He had therefore come as
soon as she had called on him. The rain and the
bell-ringing were his work!</p>

<p>She tried to rejoice her soul with the thought that
there had been a miracle for her sake. It would be
more to her than all earthly happiness and love to
feel that she was surrounded by God’s grace. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
did not wish anything earthly to come and drag her
down from that blessed rapture.</p>

<p>But when she met Gaetano on the street he
hardly looked at her; and when she met him at
Donna Elisa’s he did not take her hand and did not
speak to her at all.</p>

<p>For the truth was that, although Gaetano had
come home because it had been too hard to go without
Donna Micaela, he did not wish to tempt or to
persuade her. He saw that she was under the protection
of the saints, and she had become so sacred
to him that he scarcely dared to dream of her.</p>

<p>He wished to be near her, not in order to love
her, but because he believed that her life would
blossom with holy deeds. Gaetano longed for miracles,
as a gardener longs for the first rose in the
spring.</p>

<p>But when weeks went by and Gaetano never tried
to approach Donna Micaela, she began to doubt,
and to think that he had never loved her. She said
to herself that he had won the promise from her to
flee with him only in order to show her that the
Madonna could work a miracle.</p>

<p>If that were true, she did not know why he had
not continued his journey without turning back.</p>

<p>That caused her anxiety. She thought that she
could conquer her love better if she knew whether
Gaetano loved her. She weighed the pros and cons,
and she was more and more sure that he had never
loved her.</p>

<p>While Donna Micaela was thinking of this, she
had to sit and keep Don Ferrante company. He
had lain sick a long time. He had had two strokes
of paralysis, and had risen from his sick-bed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
broken man. All at once he had become old and
dull and afraid, so that he never dared to be alone.
He never worked in the shop; he was in every way
a changed man.</p>

<p>He had been seized with a great desire to be aristocratic
and fashionable. It looked as if poor Don
Ferrante’s head was turned with pride.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela was very good to him, and sat
hour after hour and chatted with him.</p>

<p>“Who could it be,” she used to ask, “who once
stood in the market-place with plumes on his hat,
and braid on his coat, and sword at his side, and
who played so that people said that his music was
as uplifting as Etna, and as strong as the sea? And
who caught sight of a poor signorina dressed in
black, who did not dare to show her face to the
world, and went forward to her and offered his arm?
Who could it be? Could it be Don Ferrante, who
stands the whole week in his shop and wears a
pointed cap and a short jacket? No; that cannot
be possible. No old merchant could have done such
a thing.”</p>

<p>Don Ferrante laughed. That was just the way
he liked to have her talk to him. She would also
tell him how it would be when he came to court.
The king would say this, and the queen would say
that. “The old Alagonas have come up again,”
they would say at court. And who has brought up
the race? People will wonder and wonder. The
Don Ferrante, who is a Sicilian prince and Spanish
grandee, is that the same man who stood in a shop
in Diamante and shouted at the teamsters? No,
people will say, it cannot be the same. It is impossible
for it to be the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Don Ferrante liked that, and wished to hear her
talk so day in and day out. He was never tired
of listening, and Donna Micaela was very patient
with him.</p>

<p>But one day while she was chatting, Donna Elisa
came in. “Sister-in-law, if you happen to own the
‘Legend of the Holy Virgin of Pompeii,’ will you
lend it to me?” she asked.&mdash;“What, are you going
to begin to read?” asked Donna Micaela.&mdash;“The
saints preserve us! you know very well that I cannot
read. Gaetano is asking for it.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela did not own the “Legend of the
Holy Virgin at Pompeii.” But she did not say so
to Donna Elisa; she went to her book-shelf and
took a little book, a collection of Sicilian love-songs,
and gave it to Donna Elisa, who carried the
little book over to Gaetano.</p>

<p>But Donna Micaela had no sooner done so before
a lively regret seized her. And she asked herself
what she had meant by behaving so,&mdash;she who had
been helped by the little Christchild?</p>

<p>She blushed with shame as she thought that she
had marked one of the little songs, one that ran
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“For one single question’s answer longing,</div>
<div class="verse">Night I asked, and asked the daytime’s burning;</div>
<div class="verse">Watched the flight of birds, and swift clouds thronging,</div>
<div class="verse">In water strove to read the hot lead’s turning;</div>
<div class="verse">Leaves I counted plucked from many flowers,</div>
<div class="verse">Lured dark prophets forth, and sought their powers,</div>
<div class="verse">Till at last I called on Heaven above me:</div>
<div class="verse">‘Doth he love me still, as once he loved me?’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">She had hoped to get an answer to it. But it would
serve her right if no answer came. It would serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
her right if Gaetano despised her and thought her
forward.</p>

<p>Yet she had meant no harm. The only thing she
had desired had been to find out if Gaetano loved
her.</p>

<p>Several weeks again passed and Donna Micaela
still sat with Don Ferrante.</p>

<p>But one day Donna Elisa had tempted her out.
“Come with me into my garden, sister-in-law, and
see my big magnolia-tree. You have never seen
anything so beautiful.”</p>

<p>She had gone with Donna Elisa across the street
and had come into her court-yard. And Donna
Elisa’s magnolia was like the shining sun, so that
people were aware of it even before they saw it.
At a great distance the fragrance lay and rocked in
the air, and there was a murmuring of bees, and a
twittering of birds.</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela saw the tree she could
hardly breathe. It was very high and broad, with
a beautifully even growth, and its large, firm leaves
were of a fresh, dark green. But now it was entirely
covered with great, bright flowers, that lighted and
adorned it so that it looked as if dressed for a feast,
and one felt an intoxicating joy streaming forth
from the tree. Donna Micaela almost lost consciousness,
and a new and irresistible power took
possession of her. She drew down one of the stiff
branches, and without breaking it spread out the
flower that it bore, took a needle and began to prick
letters on the flower leaf. “What are you doing,
sister-in-law?” asked Donna Elisa.&mdash;“Nothing,
nothing.”&mdash;“In my time young girls used to prick
love-letters on the magnolia-blossoms.”&mdash;“Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
they do it still.”&mdash;“Take care; I shall look at what
you have written when you are gone.”&mdash;“But you
cannot read.”&mdash;“I have Gaetano.”&mdash;“And Luca;
you had better ask Luca.”</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela came home, she repented of
what she had done. Would Donna Elisa really
show the flower to Gaetano? No, no; Donna Elisa
was too sensible. But if he had seen her from the
window of his workshop? Well, he would not
answer. She had made herself ridiculous.</p>

<p>No, never, never again would she do such a thing.
It was best for her not to know. It was best for her
that Gaetano did not ask after her.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she wondered what answer she would
get. But none came.</p>

<p>So another week passed. Then it came into Don
Ferrante’s mind that he would like to go out for a
drive in the afternoon.</p>

<p>In the carriage-house of the summer palace there
was an ancient state carriage, which was certainly
more than a hundred years old. It was very high;
it had a small, narrow body, which swung on leather
straps between the back wheels, which were as big
as the water-wheels of a mill. It was painted white,
with gilding; it was lined with red velvet, and had
a coat of arms on its doors.</p>

<p>Once it had been a great honor to ride in that
carriage; and when the old Alagonas had passed in
it along the Corso, people had stood on their thresholds,
and crowded to their doors, and hung over
balconies to see them. But then it had been drawn
by spirited barbs; then the coachman had worn a
wig, and the footman gold braid, and it had been
driven with embroidered silk reins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Don Ferrante wished to harness his old
horses before the gala carriage and have his old
shopman take the place of coachman.</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela told him that it could not
be, Don Ferrante began to weep. What would
people think of him if he did not show himself on
the Corso in the afternoon? That was the last thing
a man of position denied himself. How could anyone
know that he was a nobleman, if he did not
drive up and down the street in the carriage of the
old Alagonas?</p>

<p>The happiest hour Don Ferrante had enjoyed
since his illness was when he drove out for the first
time. He sat erect and nodded and waved very
graciously to every one he met. And the people of
Diamante bowed, and took off their hats, so that
they swept the street. Why should they not give
Don Ferrante this pleasure?</p>

<p>Donna Micaela was with him, for Don Ferrante
did not dare to drive alone. She had not wished
to go, but Don Ferrante had wept, and reminded
her that he had married her when she was despised
and penniless. She ought not to be ungrateful; she
ought not to forget what he had done for her, and
ought to come with him. Why did she not wish to
drive with him in his carriage? It was the finest
old carriage in Sicily.</p>

<p>“Why will you not come with me?” said Don
Ferrante. “Remember that I am the only one who
loves you. Do you not see that not even your father
loves you? You must not be ungrateful.”</p>

<p>In this way he had forced Donna Micaela to take
her place in the gala carriage.</p>

<p>But it was not at all as she had expected. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
one laughed. The women courtesied, and the men
bowed as solemnly as if the carriage had been a
hundred years younger. And Donna Micaela could
not detect a smile on any face.</p>

<p>No one in all Diamante would have wished to
laugh; for every one knew how Don Ferrante treated
Donna Micaela. They knew how he loved her, and
how he wept if she left him for a single minute.
They knew, too, that he tormented her with jealousy,
and that he trampled her hats to pieces, if they
became her, and never gave her money for new
dresses, because no other was to find her beautiful,
and love her. But all the time he told her that she
was so ugly that no one but he could bear to look at
her face. And because every one in Diamante knew
it all, no one laughed. Laugh at her, sitting and
chatting with a sick man! They are pious Christians
in Diamante, and not barbarians.</p>

<p>So the gala-carriage in its faded glory drove up
and down the Corso in Diamante during the hour
between five and six. And in Diamante it drove
quite alone, for there were no other fine carriages
there; but people knew that at that same time all
the carriages in Rome drove to Monte Pincio, all
those in Naples to the Via Nazionale, and all in
Florence to the Cascine, and all in Palermo to La
Favorita.</p>

<p>But when the carriage approached the Porta Etnea
for the third time, a merry sound of horns was heard
from the road outside.</p>

<p>And through the gate swung a big, high coach in
the English style.</p>

<p>It was meant to look old-fashioned also. The
postilion riding on the off leader had leather trousers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and a wig tied in a pig-tail. The coach was like an
old diligence, with the body behind the coach box
and seats on the roof.</p>

<p>But everything was new; the horses were magnificent,
powerful animals, carriage and harness
shone, and the passengers were some young gentlemen
and ladies from Catania, who were making an
excursion up Etna. And they could not help laughing
as they drove by the old gala-carriage. They
leaned over from where they sat on the high roof to
look at it, and their laughter sounded very loud and
echoed between the high, silent houses of Diamante.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela was very unhappy. They were
some of her old circle of friends. What would they
not say when they came home? “We have seen
Micaela Palmeri in Diamante.” And they would
laugh and talk, laugh and talk.</p>

<p>Her life seemed so squalid. She was nothing but
the slave of a fool. Her whole life long she would
never do anything but chat with Don Ferrante.</p>

<p>When she came home she was quite exhausted.
She was so tired and weak that she could scarcely
drag herself up the steps.</p>

<p>And all the time Don Ferrante was rejoicing in
his good fortune at having met all those fine people,
and having been seen in his state. He told her
that now no one would ask whether she was ugly, or
whether her father had stolen. Now people knew
that she was the wife of a man of rank.</p>

<p>After dinner Donna Micaela sat quite silent, and
let her father talk to Don Ferrante. Then a mandolin
began to sound quite softly in the street under
the window of the summer palace. It was a single
mandolin with no accompaniment of guitar or violin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Nothing could be more light and airy; nothing more
captivating and affecting. No one could think that
human hands were touching the strings. It was as
if bees and crickets and grasshoppers were giving a
concert.</p>

<p>“There is some one again who has fallen in love
with Giannita,” said Don Ferrante. “That is a
woman, Giannita. Any one can see that she is
pretty. If I were young I should fall in love with
Giannita. She knows how to love.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela started. He was right, she thought.
The mandolin-player meant Giannita. That evening
Giannita was at home with her mother, but otherwise
she always lived at the summer palace. Donna
Micaela had arranged it so since Don Ferrante had
been ill.</p>

<p>But Donna Micaela liked the mandolin playing,
for whomever it might be meant. It came sweet,
and soft, and comforting. She went gently into her
room to listen better in the dark and loneliness.</p>

<p>A sweet, strong fragrance met her there. What
was it? Her hands began to tremble before she
found a candle and a match. On her work-table lay
a big, widely opened magnolia-blossom.</p>

<p>On one of the flower petals was pricked: “Who
loves me?” And now stood under it: “Gaetano.”</p>

<p>Beside the flower lay a little white book full of
love-songs. And there was a mark against one of
the little verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“None have known the love that I have brought thee,</div>
<div class="verse">Silent, secret, born in midnight’s measure.</div>
<div class="verse">All my dreams have stolen forth and sought thee;</div>
<div class="verse">Miser-like, the while, I watched my treasure:</div>
<div class="verse">Tho’ the priest shall seek to shrive me, dying,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Silent I, nor needing him to speed me,</div>
<div class="verse">Bar the door, fling forth the key, and lying</div>
<div class="verse">Thus unshriven, go where death shall lead me.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The mandolin continued to play. There is something
of open air and sunlight in a mandolin; something
soothing and calming; something of the
cheering carelessness of beautiful nature.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="I_IX">IX<br />
<span class="smaller">FLIGHT</span></h3>

<p>At that time the little image from Aracoeli was still
in Diamante.</p>

<p>The Englishwoman who owned it had been fascinated
by Diamante. She had not been able to
bring herself to leave it.</p>

<p>She had hired the whole first floor of the hotel,
and had established herself there as in a home. She
bought for large sums everything she could find in
the way of old pots and old coins. She bought
mosaics, and altar-pictures, and holy images. She
thought that she would like to make a collection of
all the saints of the church.</p>

<p>She heard of Gaetano, and sent him a message to
come to her at the hotel.</p>

<p>Gaetano collected what he had carved during the
last few days and took them with him to Miss
Tottenham. She was much pleased with his little
images, and wished to buy them all.</p>

<p>But the rich Englishwoman’s rooms were like the
lumber-rooms of a museum. They were filled with
every conceivable thing, and there was confusion
and disorder everywhere. Here stood half-empty
trunks; there hung cloaks and hats; here lay
paintings and engravings; there were guide-books,
railway time-tables, tea-sets, and alcohol lamps;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
elsewhere halberds, prayer-books, mandolins, and
escutcheons.</p>

<p>And that opened Gaetano’s eyes. He flushed
suddenly, bit his lips, and began to repack his
images.</p>

<p>He had caught sight of an image of the Christchild.
It was the outcast, who was standing there
in the midst of all the disorder, with his wretched
crown on his head and brass shoes on his feet. The
color was worn off his face; the rings and ornaments
hanging on him were tarnished, and his dress was
yellowed with age.</p>

<p>When Gaetano saw that, he would not sell his
images to Miss Tottenham; he meant simply to go
his way.</p>

<p>When she asked him what was the matter with
him he stormed at her, and scolded her.</p>

<p>Did she know that many of the things she had
about her were sacred?</p>

<p>Did she know, or did she not know, that that was
the holy Christchild himself? And she had let him
lose three fingers on one hand, and let the jewels
fall out of his crown, and let him lie dirty, and
tarnished, and dishonored! And if she had so
treated the image of God’s own son, how would she
let everything else fare? He would not sell anything
to her.</p>

<p>When Gaetano burst out at her in that way Miss
Tottenham was enraptured, enchanted.</p>

<p>Here was the true faith and the righteous, holy
wrath. This young man must become an artist.
To England, he should go to England! She wished
to send him to the great master, her friend, who was
trying to reform art; to him who wished to teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
people to make beautiful house-furnishings, beautiful
church-fittings, who wished to create a whole
beautiful world.</p>

<p>She decided and arranged, and Gaetano let her go
on, because he would rather now go away from
Diamante.</p>

<p>He saw that he could no longer endure to live
there. He believed that it was God leading him
out of temptation.</p>

<p>He went away quite unobserved. Donna Micaela
scarcely knew anything of it until he was gone. He
had not dared to come and bid her good-bye.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="I_X">X<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SIROCCO</span></h3>

<p>After that two years passed quietly. The only
thing that happened at Diamante and in all Sicily
was that the people grew ever poorer and poorer.</p>

<p>Then there came an autumn, and it was about the
time when the wine was to be harvested.</p>

<p>At that time songs generally rise full-fledged to
the lips; at that time new and beautiful melodies
stream from the mandolins.</p>

<p>Then crowds of young people go out to the vineyards,
and there is work and laughter all day, dance
and laughter all night, and no one knows what
sleep is.</p>

<p>Then the bright ocean of air over the mountain
is more beautiful than at any other time. Then the
air is full of wit; sparkling glances flash through
it; it gets warmth not only from the sun, but also
from the glowing faces of the young women of
Etna.</p>

<p>But that autumn all the vineyards were devastated
by the phylloxera. No grape-pickers pushed their
way between the vines; no long lines of women
carrying heaped-up baskets on their heads wound up
to the presses, and at night there was no dancing on
the flat roofs.</p>

<p>That autumn no clear, light October air lay over
the Etna region. As if it had been in league with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the famine, the heavy, weakening wind from the
Sahara came over from Africa, and brought with it
dust and exhalations that darkened the sky.</p>

<p>Never, as long as that autumn lasted, was there a
fresh mountain breeze. The baleful Sirocco blew
incessantly.</p>

<p>Sometimes it came dry and heavy with sand, and
so hot that they had to shut doors and windows, and
keep in their rooms, not to faint away.</p>

<p>But oftener it came warm and damp and enervating.
And the people felt no rest; trouble left them
neither by day nor by night, and cares piled upon
them like snow-drifts on the high mountains.</p>

<p>And the restlessness reached Donna Micaela as
she sat and watched with her old husband, Don
Ferrante.</p>

<p>During that autumn she never heard any one laugh,
nor heard a song. People crept by one another, so
full of anger and despair that they were almost
choked. And she said to herself that they were
certainly dreaming of an insurrection. She saw
that they had to revolt. It would help no one, but
they had no other resource.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the autumn, sitting on her
balcony, she heard the people talk in the street.
They always talked of the famine: We have blight
in wheat and wine; there is a crisis in sulphur and
oranges; all Sicily’s yellow gold has failed. How
shall we live?</p>

<p>And Donna Micaela understood that it was terrible.
Wheat, wine, oranges, and sulphur, all their yellow
gold!</p>

<p>She began to understand, too, that the misery
was greater than men could bear long, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
grieved that life should be made so hard. She asked
why the people should be forced to bear such enormous
taxes. Why should the salt tax exist, so that
a poor woman could not go down to the shore and
get a pail of salt water, but must buy costly salt in
the government shops? Why should there be a tax
on palm-trees? The peasants, with anger in their
hearts, were felling the old trees that had waved so
long over the noble isle. And why should a tax be
put on windows? What did they want? Was it
that the poor should take away their windows, move
out of their rooms, and live in cellars?</p>

<p>In the sulphur-mines there were strikes and turbulence,
and the government was sending troops to
force the people back to work. Donna Micaela
wondered if the government did not know that there
was no machinery in those mines. Perhaps it had
never heard that children dragged the ore up from
the deep shafts. It did not know that these children
were slaves; it could not imagine that parents had
sold them to overseers. Or if the government did
know it, why did it wish to help the mine-owners?</p>

<p>At one time she heard of a terrible number of
crimes. And she began again with her questions.
Why did they let the people become so criminal?
And why did they let them be so poor and so ragged?
Why must they all be so ragged? She knew that
any one living in Palermo or Catania did not need to
ask. But he who lived in Diamante could not help
fearing and asking. Why did they let the people
be so poor that they died of hunger?</p>

<p>As yet the summer was hardly over; it was no
later in the autumn than the end of October, and
already Donna Micaela began to see the day when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the insurrection would break out. She saw the
starved people come rushing along the street. They
would plunder the shops and they would plunder
the few rich men there were in the town. Outside
the summer palace the wild horde would stop, and
they would climb up to the balcony and the glass
doors. “Bring out the jewels of the old Alagonas;
bring out Don Ferrante’s millions!” That was
their dream,&mdash;the summer palace! They believed
that it was as full of gold as a fairy palace.</p>

<p>But when they found nothing, they would put a
dagger to her throat, to make her give up the
treasures that she had never possessed, and she
would be killed by the bloodthirsty crowds.</p>

<p>Why could not the great land-owners stop at home?
Why must they irritate the poor by living in grand
style in Rome and Paris? The people would not
be so bitter against them if they stayed at home;
they would not swear such a solemn and sacred oath
to kill all the rich when the time should come.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela wished that she could have escaped
to one of the big towns. But both her father and
Don Ferrante fell ill that autumn, and for their sakes
she was forced to remain where she was. And she
knew that she would be killed as an atonement for
the sins of the rich against the poor.</p>

<p>For many years misfortunes had been gathering
over Sicily, and now they could no longer be held
back. Etna itself began to menace an eruption.
At night sulphurous smoke floated red as fire, and
rumblings were heard as far away as Diamante.
The end of everything was coming. Everything
was to be destroyed at once.</p>

<p>Did not the government know of the discontent?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Ah, the government had at last heard of it, and it
had appointed a committee. It was a great comfort
to see the members of the committee come driving
one fine day along the Corso in Diamante. If only
the people had understood that they wished them
well! If the women had not stood in their doorways
and spat at the fine gentlemen from the mainland;
if the children had not run beside the carriages
and cried: “Thief, thief!”</p>

<p>Everything they did only stirred up the revolt,
and there was no one who could control the people
and quiet them. They trusted no officials. They
despised those least who only took bribes. But
people said that many belonged to the society of
Mafia; they said that their one thought was to extort
money and acquire power.</p>

<p>As time went on, several signs showed that something
terrible was impending. In the papers they
wrote that crowds of working-men were gathering in
the larger towns and wandering about the streets.
People read also in the papers how the socialist
leaders were going through the country, and making
seditious speeches. All at once it became clear to
Donna Micaela whence all the trouble came. The
socialists were inciting the revolt. It was their firebrand
speeches that set the blood of the people boiling.
How could they let them do it? Who was
king in Sicily? Was his name Don Felice, or
Umberto?</p>

<p>Donna Micaela felt a horror which she could not
shake off. It was as if they had conspired especially
against her. And the more she heard of the socialists,
the more she feared them.</p>

<p>Giannita tried to calm her. “We have not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
single socialist in Diamante,” she said. “In
Diamante no one is thinking of revolt.” Donna
Micaela asked her if she did not know what it meant
when the old distaff spinners sat in their dark
corners, and told of the great brigands and of the
famous Palermo fisherman, Giuseppe Alesi, whom
they called the Masaniello of Sicily.</p>

<p>If the socialists could once get the revolt started,
Diamante would also join in. All Diamante knew
already that something dreadful was impending.
They had seen the ghost of the big, black monk on
the balcony of the Palazzo Geraci; they heard the
owls scream through the night, and some declared
that the cocks crowed at sunset, and were silent at
daybreak.</p>

<p>One day in November Diamante was suddenly
filled with terrible people. They were men with
the faces of wild beasts, with bushy beards, and with
big hands set on enormously long arms. Several of
them wore wide, fluttering linen garments, and the
people thought that they recognized in them famous
bandits and newly freed galley-slaves.</p>

<p>Giannita related that all these wild people lived
in the mountain wastes inland and had crossed
Simeto and come to Diamante, because a rumor had
gone about that revolt had already broken out. But
when they had found everything quiet, and the
barracks full of soldiers, they had gone away.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela thought incessantly of those people,
and expected them to be her murderers. She saw
before her their fluttering linen garments and their
brute faces. She knew that they were lurking
in their mountain holes, and waiting for the day
when they should hear shots and the noise of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
outbreak in Diamante. Then they would fall upon
the town with fire and murder, and march at the
head of all the starving people as the generals and
leaders in the plundering.</p>

<p>All that autumn Donna Micaela had to nurse both
her father and Don Ferrante; for they lay sick
month after month. People had told her, however,
that their lives were in no danger.</p>

<p>She was very glad to be able to keep Don Ferrante
alive, for it was her only hope that at the last the
people would spare him, who was of such an old and
venerated race.</p>

<p>As she sat by their sick-beds, her thoughts went
often in longing to Gaetano, and many were the
times when she wished that he were at home. She
would not feel such terror and fear of death if he
stood once more in his workshop. Then she would
have felt nothing but security and peace.</p>

<p>Even now, when he was so far away, it was to him
her thoughts turned when fear was driving her mad.
Not a single letter had come from him since he had
gone away, so that sometimes she believed that he
had forgotten her entirely. At other times she was
quite sure that he loved her, for she felt herself
compelled to think of him, and knew that he was near
her in thought, and was calling to her.</p>

<p>That autumn she at last received a letter from
Gaetano. Alas, such a letter! Donna Micaela’s
first thought was to burn it.</p>

<p>She had gone up to the roof-garden in order to be
alone when she read the letter. She had once
heard Gaetano’s declaration of love there. That
had not moved her. It had neither warmed her nor
frightened her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>But this letter was different. He prayed that she
would come to him, be his, give him her life.
When she read it she was frightened at herself.
She felt how she longed to cry out into the air, “I
am coming, I am coming,” and set out. It drew
her, carried her away.</p>

<p>“Let us be happy!” he wrote. “We are losing
time; the years are passing. Let us be happy!”</p>

<p>He described to her how they would live. He told
her of other women who had obeyed love and been
happy. He wrote as temptingly as convincingly.</p>

<p>But it was not the contents; it was the love that
glowed and burned in the letter which overcame
her. It rose from the paper like an intoxicating
incense, and she felt it penetrate her. It was burning,
longing, speaking, in every word.</p>

<p>Now she was no longer a saint to him, as she had
been before. It came so unexpectedly, after two
years’ silence, that she was stunned. And she was
troubled because it delighted her.</p>

<p>She had never thought that love was like this.
Should she really like it? She found with dismay
that she did like it.</p>

<p>And so she punished both herself and him by
writing a severe reply. It was moral, moral; it was
nothing but moral! She was proud when she had
written it. She did not deny that she loved him,
but perhaps Gaetano would not be able to find the
words of love, they were so buried in admonitions.
He could not have found them, for he wrote no
more letters.</p>

<p>But now Donna Micaela could no longer think of
Gaetano as a shelter and a support. Now he was
more dangerous than the men from the mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Every day graver news came to Diamante. Everybody
began to get out their weapons. And although
it was forbidden, they were carried secretly by
every one.</p>

<p>All travellers left the island, and in their place one
regiment after another was sent over from Italy.</p>

<p>The socialists talked and talked. They were
possessed by evil spirits; they could not rest until
they had brought on the disaster!</p>

<p>At last the ringleaders had decided on the day
on which the storm was to break loose. All Sicily,
all Italy, was to rise. It was no longer menace; it
was reality.</p>

<p>More and more troops came from the mainland.
Most of them were Neapolitans, who live in constant
feud with the Sicilians. And now the news came
that the island had been declared in a state of siege.
There were to be no more courts of justice; only
court-martials. And the people said that the soldiers
would be free to plunder and murder as they
pleased.</p>

<p>No one knew what was to happen. Terror seemed
to make every one mad. The peasants raised ramparts
in the hills. In Diamante men stood in great
groups on the market-place, stood there day after
day, without going to their work. There was
something terrible in those groups of men dressed
in dark cloaks and slouch hats. They were all
probably dreaming of the hour when they should
plunder the summer palace.</p>

<p>The nearer the day approached when the insurrection
was to break out, the sicker Don Ferrante
became; and Donna Micaela began to fear that he
would die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed to her a sign that she was predestined
to destruction, that she was also losing Don Ferrante.
Who would have any regard for her when
he was no longer alive?</p>

<p>She watched over him. She and all the women
of the quarter sat in silent prayer about his bed.</p>

<p>One morning, towards six o’clock, Don Ferrante
died. And Donna Micaela mourned him, because
he had been her only protector, and the only one
who could have saved her from destruction; and she
wished to honor the dead, as is still the custom in
Diamante.</p>

<p>She had them drape the room where the body was
lying with black, and close all the shutters, so that
the glad sunlight should not enter. She had all the
fires put out on the hearths, and sent for a blind
singer to come to the palace every day and sing
dirges.</p>

<p>She let Giannita care for Cavaliere Palmeri, so
that she herself might sit quiet in the death-room,
among the other women.</p>

<p>It was evening on the day of death before all
preparations were completed, and they were waiting
only for the White Brotherhood to come and take
away the corpse. In the death-chamber there was
the silence of the grave. All the women of the
quarter sat there motionless with dismal faces.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela sat pale with her great fear, and
stared involuntarily at the pall that was spread over
the body. It was a pall which belonged to the
family; their coat of arms was heavily and gorgeously
embroidered on the centre, and it had silver fringes
and thick tassels. The pall had never been spread
over any one but an Alagona. It seemed to lie there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
so that Donna Micaela should not for a moment
forget that her last support had fallen, and that she
was now alone, and without protection from the
infuriated people.</p>

<p>Some one came in and announced that old
Assunta had come. Old Assunta; what did old
Assunta want? Yes, it was she who came to sing
the praises of the dead.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela let Assunta come into the room.
She appeared just as she looked every day, when she
sat and begged on the Cathedral steps; the same
patched dress, the same faded headcloth, and the
same crutch.</p>

<p>Little and bent, she limped forward to the coffin.
She had a shrivelled face, a sunken mouth, and dull
eyes. Donna Micaela said to herself that it was
incarnate helplessness and feebleness who had come
into the room.</p>

<p>The old woman raised her voice and began to
speak in the wife’s name.</p>

<p>“My lord is dead, and I am alone! He who
raised me to his side is dead! Is it not terrible that
my home has lost its master?&mdash;Why are the shutters
of your windows closed? say the passers-by.&mdash;I
answer, I cannot bear to see the light, because my
sorrow is so great; my grief is three-fold.&mdash;What,
are so many of your race carried away by the White
Brethren?&mdash;No, none of my race is dead, but I have
lost my husband, my husband, my husband!”</p>

<p>Old Assunta needed to say no more. Donna
Micaela burst into lamentations. The whole room
was filled with the sound of weeping from the sympathetic
women; for there is no grief like losing a
husband. Those who were widows thought of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
they had lost, and those who were not as yet widows
thought of the time when they would not be able to
go on the street, because no husband would be with
them; when they would be left to loneliness, poverty,
oblivion; when they would be nothing, mean nothing;
when they would be the world’s outcast children
because they no longer had a husband; because
nothing any longer gave them the right to live.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was late in December, the days between Christmas
and the New Year.</p>

<p>There was still the same danger of insurrection,
and people still heard terrifying rumors. It was
said that Falco Falcone had gathered together a
band of brigands in the quarries, and that he was
only waiting for the appointed day to break into
Diamante and plunder it.</p>

<p>It was also whispered that the people in several of
the small mountain towns had risen, torn down the
custom’s offices at the town-gates, and driven away
the officials.</p>

<p>People said too that troops were passing from
town to town, arresting all suspicious people, and
shooting them down by hundreds.</p>

<p>Every one said that they must fight. They could
not let themselves be murdered by those Italians
without trying to make some resistance.</p>

<p>During all this, Donna Micaela sat tied to her
father’s sick-bed, just as she had sat before by Don
Ferrante’s. She could not escape from Diamante,
and terror so grew within her that she was nothing
but one trembling fear.</p>

<p>The last and worst of all the messages of terror
that reached her had been about Gaetano.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>For when Don Ferrante had been dead a week
Gaetano had come home. And that had not caused
her dismay; it had only made her glad. She had
rejoiced in at last having some one near her who
could protect her.</p>

<p>At the same time she decided that she could not
receive Gaetano if he came to see her. She felt
that she still belonged to the dead. She would
rather not see Gaetano until after a year.</p>

<p>But when Gaetano had been at home a week without
coming to the summer palace, she asked Giannita
about him. “Where is Gaetano? Has he perhaps
gone away again, since no one speaks of him?”</p>

<p>“Alas, Micaela,” answered Giannita, “the less
people speak of Gaetano, the better for him.”</p>

<p>She told Donna Micaela, as if she was telling of
a great shame, that Gaetano had become a socialist.</p>

<p>“He has been quite transformed over there, in
England,” she said. “He no longer worships either
God or the saints. He does not kiss the priest’s
hand when he meets him. He says to every one that
they shall pay no more duties at the town-gates.
He encourages the peasants not to pay their rent.
He carries weapons. He has come home to start a
rebellion, to help the bandits.”</p>

<p>She needed to say no more to chill Donna Micaela
with a greater terror than she had ever felt before.</p>

<p>It was this that the sultry days of the autumn had
portended. It would be he who would shake the
bolt from the clouds. Why had she not understood
it long ago?</p>

<p>It was a punishment and a revenge. It would be
he who would bring the misfortune!</p>

<p>During those last days she had been calmer. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
had heard that all the socialists on the island had
been put in prison, and all the little insurrection
fires lighted in the mountain towns had been quickly
choked. It looked almost as if the rebellion would
come to nothing!</p>

<p>But now the last Alagona was come, and him the
people would follow. Life would enter into those
black groups on the market-place. The men in the
linen garments would climb up out of the quarries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next evening Gaetano spoke in the market-place.
He had sat by the fountain, and had seen
how the people came to get water. For two years
he had foregone the pleasure of seeing the slender
girls lift the heavy water-jars to their heads and
walk away with firm, slow step.</p>

<p>But it was not only the young girls who came to
the fountain; there were people of all ages. And
when he saw how poor and unhappy most of them
were, he began to talk to them of the future.</p>

<p>He promised them better times soon. He said
to old Assunta that she hereafter should get her
daily bread without needing to ask alms of any one.
And when she said that she did not understand how
that could be, he asked her almost with anger if she
did not know that now the time had come when no
old people and no children should be without care
and shelter.</p>

<p>He pointed to the old chair-maker, who was as
poor as Assunta, and moreover very sick, and he
asked if she believed that the people would endure
much longer having no support for the poor, and no
hospitals. Could she not understand that it was
impossible for such things to continue? Could they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
not all understand that hereafter the old and the
sick should be cared for?</p>

<p>He also saw some children who, as he knew, lived
on cresses and sorrel, which they gathered on the
river-banks and by the roadside, and he promised
that henceforward no one should need to starve.
He laid his hand on the children’s heads, and swore
as solemnly as if he were prince of Diamante, that
they should never again want for bread.</p>

<p>They knew nothing in Diamante, he said; they
were ignorant; they did not understand that a new
and blessed time had come; they believed that this
old misery would continue forever.</p>

<p>While he was thus consoling the poor, more and
more had gathered about him, and he suddenly
sprang up, placed himself on the steps of the fountain,
and began to speak.</p>

<p>How could they, he said, be so foolish as to
believe that nothing better would come? Should
the people, who possessed the whole earth, be content
to let their parents starve, and their children
grow up to be good-for-nothings and criminals?</p>

<p>Did they not know that there were treasures in
the mountains, and in the sea, and in the ground?
Had they never heard that the earth was rich? Did
they think that it could not feed its children?</p>

<p>They should not murmur among themselves, and
say that it was impossible to arrange matters differently.
They should not think that there must be
rich and poor. Alas, they understood nothing!
They did not know their Mother Earth. Did they
think that she hated any of them? They had lain
down on the ground and heard the earth speak?
Perhaps they had seen her make laws? They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
heard her pass sentence? She had commanded some
to starve, and some to die of luxury?</p>

<p>Why did they not open their ears and listen to
the new teachings pouring through the world?
Would they not like to have a better life? Did they
like their rags? Were they satisfied with sorrel
and cresses? Did they not wish to possess a roof
over their heads?</p>

<p>And he told them that it made no difference, no
difference, if they refused to believe in the new
times that were coming. They would come in spite
of it. They did not need to lift the sun up from the
sea in the morning. The new times would come to
them as the sun came, but why would they not be
ready to meet them? Why did they shut themselves
in, and fear the new light?</p>

<p>He spoke long in the same strain, and more and
more of the poor people of Diamante gathered about
him.</p>

<p>The longer he continued, the more beautiful became
his speech and the clearer grew his voice.</p>

<p>His eyes were full of fire, and to the people looking
up at him, he seemed as beautiful as a young
prince.</p>

<p>He was one of the race of once powerful lords,
who had possessed means to shower happiness and
gold on everybody within their wide lands. They
believed him when he said that he had happiness to
give them. They felt comforted, and rejoiced that
their young lord loved them.</p>

<p>When he had finished speaking they began to
shout, and call to him that they wished to follow
him and do what he commanded.</p>

<p>He had gained ascendency over them in a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
He was so beautiful and so glorious that they
could not resist him. And his faith seized and
subdued.</p>

<p>That night there was not one poor person in
Diamante who did not believe that Gaetano would
give him happy days, free from care. That night
they called down blessings on him, all those who
lived in sheds and out-houses. That night the
hungry lay down with the sure belief that the next
day tables groaning under many dishes would stand
spread for them when they awoke.</p>

<p>For when Gaetano spoke, his power was so great
that he could convince an old man that he was
young, and a freezing man that he was warm. And
people felt that what he promised must come.</p>

<p>He was the prince of the coming times. His
hands were generous, and miracles and blessings
would stream down over Diamante, now that he had
come again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day, towards sunset, Giannita came into
the sick-room and whispered to Donna Micaela:
“There is an insurrection in Paternó. They have
been shooting for several hours, and you can hear
them as far away as here. Orders for troops have
already gone to Catania. And Gaetano says that it
will break out here, too. He says that it will break
out in all the towns of Etna at one time.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela made a sign to Giannita to stay
with her father, and she herself went across the
street and into Donna Elisa’s shop.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa sat behind the counter with her
frame, but she was not working. The tears fell so
heavy and fast that she had ceased to embroider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where is Gaetano?” said Donna Micaela, without
any preamble. “I must speak to him.”</p>

<p>“God give you strength to talk to him,” answered
Donna Elisa. “He is in the garden.”</p>

<p>She went out across the court-yard and into the
walled garden.</p>

<p>In the garden there were many narrow paths
winding from terrace to terrace. There was also a
number of arbors and grottos and benches. And
it was so thick with stiff agaves, and close-growing
dwarf palms, and thick-leaved rubber-plants, and
rhododendrons, that it was impossible to see two
feet in front of one. Donna Micaela walked for a
long time on those innumerable paths before she
could find Gaetano. The longer she walked, the
more impatient she became.</p>

<p>At last she found him at the farther end of the
garden. She caught sight of him on the lowest
terrace, built out on one of the bastions of the wall
of the town. There sat Gaetano at ease, and worked
with chisel and hammer on a statuette. When he
saw Donna Micaela, he came towards her with outstretched
hands.</p>

<p>She hardly gave herself time to greet him. “Is
it true,” she said, “that you have come home to be
our ruin?” He began to laugh. “The syndic has
been here,” he said. “The priest has been here.
Are you coming too?”</p>

<p>It wounded her that he laughed, and that he spoke
of the priest and the syndic. It was something
different, and more, that she came.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she said, stiffly, “if it is true that
we are to have an uprising this evening.”&mdash;“Oh,
no,” he answered; “we shall have no uprising.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
And he said it in such a voice that it almost made
her sorry for him.</p>

<p>“You cause Donna Elisa great grief,” she burst
out.&mdash;“And you too, do I not?” he said, with a
slight sneer. “I cause you all sorrow. I am the
lost son; I am Judas. I am the angel of justice
who is driving you from that paradise where people
eat grass.”</p>

<p>She answered: “Perhaps we think that what we
have is better than being shot by the soldiers.”&mdash;“Yes,
of course; it is better to starve to death. We
are used to that.”&mdash;“Nor is it pleasant to be murdered
by bandits.”&mdash;“But why for Heaven’s sake
have any bandits, if you do not want to be murdered
by them?”&mdash;“Yes, I know,” she said, more passionately,
“that you want all the rich to perish.”</p>

<p>He did not answer immediately; he stood and bit
his lips, so as not to lose his temper. “Let me
talk with you, Donna Micaela!” he said at last.
“Let me explain it to you!”</p>

<p>At the same time he put on a patient expression.
He talked socialism with her, so clear and simple
that a child could have understood.</p>

<p>But she was far from being able to follow it.
Perhaps she could have, but she did not wish to.
She did not wish just then to hear of socialism.</p>

<p>It had been so wonderful to her to see him. The
ground had rocked under her; and something glorious
and blessed had passed through and quite overcome
her. “God, it is he whom I love!” she said to
herself. “It is really he.”</p>

<p>Before she had seen him she had known very well
what she would say to him. She would have led
him back to the faith of his childhood. She would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
have shown him that those new teachings were
detestable and dangerous. But then love came. It
made her confused and stupid. She could not
answer him. She only sat and wondered that he
could talk.</p>

<p>She wondered if he was much handsomer now
than formerly. Formerly she had not been confused
at all when she saw him. She had never been
attracted to that extent. Or was it that he had
become a free, strong man? She was frightened
when she felt how he subdued her.</p>

<p>She dared not contradict him. She dared not
even speak, for fear of bursting into tears. Had she
dared to speak, she would not have talked of public
affairs. She would have told him what she had felt
the day the bells rang. Or she would have prayed
to be allowed to kiss his hand. She would have
told him how she had dreamed of him. She would
have said that if she had not had him to dream of
she could not have borne her life. She would have
begged to be allowed to kiss his hand in gratitude,
because he had given her life all these years.</p>

<p>If there was to be no uprising, why did he talk
socialism? What had socialism to do with them,
sitting alone in Donna Elisa’s garden? She sat
and looked along one of the paths. Luca had put
up wooden arches on both sides of it, and up these
climbed garlands of light rose-shoots, full of little
buds and flowers. One always wondered whither
one was coming when one went along that path.
And one came to a little weather-beaten cupid. Old
Luca understood things better than Gaetano.</p>

<p>While they sat there the sun set, and Etna grew
rosy-red. It was as if Etna flushed with anger at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
what was going on in Donna Elisa’s garden. It was
at sunset, when Etna glowed red, that she had
always thought of Gaetano. It seemed as if they
both had been waiting for it. And they had both
arranged how it would be when Gaetano came. She
had only feared that he would be too fiery, and too
passionately wild. And he talked only of those
dreadful Socialists, whom she detested and feared.</p>

<p>He talked a long time. She saw Etna grow pale
and become bronze-brown, and then the darkness
came. She knew that there would be moonlight.
There she sat quite still, and hoped for help from
the moonlight. She herself could do nothing. She
was entirely in his power. But when the moonlight
came, it did not help either. He continued to
talk of capitalists and working-men.</p>

<p>Then it seemed to her as if there could be but one
explanation for all this. He must have ceased to
love her.</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered something. It was a
week ago. It was the same day that Gaetano had
come home. She had come into Giannita’s room,
but she had walked so softly that Giannita had not
heard her. She had seen Giannita stand as if in
ecstasy, with up-stretched arms and up-turned face.
And in her hands she held a picture. First she
carried it to her lips and kissed it, then she lifted
it up over her head and looked up to it in rapture.
And the picture had been of Gaetano.</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela had seen that, she had
gone away as silently as she had come. She had
only thought then that Giannita was to be pitied if
she loved Gaetano. But now, when Gaetano only
talked socialism, now she remembered it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Now she began to think that Gaetano also loved
Giannita. She remembered that they were friends
from childhood. He had perhaps loved her a long
time. Perhaps he had come home to marry her.
Donna Micaela could say nothing; she had nothing
to complain of. It was scarcely a month since she
wrote to Gaetano that it was not right of him to
love her.</p>

<p>He now leaned towards her, enchained her glance,
and actually compelled her to listen to what he was
saying.</p>

<p>“You shall understand; you shall see and understand,
Donna Micaela! What we need here in the
South is a regeneration, a pulling up by the roots,
such as Christianity was in its time. Up with the
slaves; down with the masters! A plow which
turns up new social furrows! We must sow in new
earth; the old earth is impoverished. The old
surface furrows bear only weak, miserable growth.
Let the deep earth come up to the light, and we
shall see something different!</p>

<p>“See, Donna Micaela, why does socialism live;
why has it not gone under? Because it comes with
a new word. ‘Think of the earth,’ it says, just as
Christianity came with the word, ‘Think of heaven.’
Look about you! Look at the earth; is it not all
that we possess? Let us therefore establish ourselves
here so that we shall be happy. Why, why,
has no one thought of it before? Because we have
been so busy with that Hereafter. Let us leave the
Hereafter! The earth, the earth, Donna Micaela!
Ah, we socialists, we love her! We worship the
sacred earth,&mdash;the poor, despised mother, who wears
mourning because her children yearn for heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Believe me, Donna Micaela,” he said, “it will
be accomplished in less than seven years. In the
year nineteen hundred it will be ready. Then
martyrs will have bled; then apostles will have
spoken; then shall crowds upon crowds have been
won over! We, the rightful sons of the earth,
shall have the victory! And she shall lie before
us in all her loveliness; she shall bring us beauty,
bring us pleasure, bring us knowledge, bring us
health!”</p>

<p>Gaetano’s voice began to tremble, and tears quivered
in his eyes. He went forward to the edge of
the terrace, and he stretched out his arms as if to
embrace the moonlit earth. “You are so dazzlingly
beautiful,” he said, “so dazzlingly beautiful!”</p>

<p>And Donna Micaela for a moment thought she
felt his grief over all the sorrow that lay under the
surface of beauty. She saw life full of vice and
suffering, like a dirty river filled with the stench of
uncleanliness, wind through the glistening world
of beauty.</p>

<p>“And no one can enjoy you,” said Gaetano; “no
one can dare to enjoy you. You are untamed, and
full of whims and anger. You are uncertainty and
peril; you are sorrow and pain; you are want and
shame; you are the force that grinds; you are everything
terrible that can be named, because the people
have not wished to make you better.</p>

<p>“But your day will come,” he said, triumphantly.
“Some day they will turn to you with all their love;
they will not turn to a dream, which gives nothing
and is good for nothing.”</p>

<p>She interrupted him roughly. She began to fear
him more and more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“So it is true that you have had no success in
England?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“People say that the great master, to whom Miss
Tottenham sent you, has said that you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What has he said?”</p>

<p>“That you and your images suited Diamante, but
nowhere else.”</p>

<p>“Who says such things?”</p>

<p>“People think so, because you are so changed.”</p>

<p>“Since I am a socialist.”</p>

<p>“Why should you be one if you had been successful?”</p>

<p>“Ah, why&mdash;? You do not know,” he continued,
with a laugh, “that my master in England himself
was a socialist. You do not know that it was he
who taught me these opinions&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused, and did not go on with the controversy.
He went over to the bench where he had been sitting
when she came, and brought back a statuette.
He handed it to Donna Micaela. He seemed to
wish to say: “See for yourself if you are right.”</p>

<p>She took it, and held it up in the moonlight. It
was a Mater Dolorosa in black marble. She could
see it quite plainly.</p>

<p>She could also recognize it. The image had her
own features. It intoxicated her for a moment. In
the next she was filled with horror. He, a socialist;
he, an unbeliever; he dared to create a Madonna!
And he had given the image her features! He
entangled her in his sin!</p>

<p>“I have done it for you, Donna Micaela,” he said.</p>

<p>Ah, since it was hers! She threw it out over the
balustrade. It struck against the steep mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
side; fell deeper and deeper; broke loose stones,
and certainly shattered itself to pieces. At last a
splash was heard down in Simeto.</p>

<p>“What right have you to carve Madonnas?” she
asked Gaetano.</p>

<p>He stood silent. He had never seen Donna
Micaela thus.</p>

<p>In the moment when she rose up before him she
had become tall and stately. The beauty that always
came and went in her, like an uneasy guest, was
enthroned in her face. She looked cold and inflexible;
a woman to win and conquer.</p>

<p>“Then you still believe in God, since you carve
Madonnas?” she said.</p>

<p>He breathed hurriedly. Now it was he who was
paralyzed. He had been a believer himself. He
knew how he had wounded her. He saw that he
had forfeited her love. He had made a terrible,
infinite chasm between them.</p>

<p>He must speak, must win her over to his side.</p>

<p>He began again, but feebly and falteringly.</p>

<p>She listened quietly for a while. Then she interrupted
him almost compassionately.</p>

<p>“How did you become so?”</p>

<p>“I thought of Sicily,” he said submissively.</p>

<p>“You thought of Sicily,” she repeated thoughtfully.
“And why did you come home?”</p>

<p>“I came home to cause an insurrection.”</p>

<p>It was as if they had spoken of an illness, a chill,
that he had contracted, and that could quite easily
be cured.</p>

<p>“You came home to be our ruin,” she said,
sternly.</p>

<p>“As you will; as you will,” he said, complying.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
“You can call it so. As everything is going now,
you are certainly right to call it so. Ah, if they
had not given me false information; if I had not
come a week too late! Is it not like us Sicilians to
let the government anticipate us? When I came
the leaders were already arrested, the island garrisoned
with forty thousand men. Everything lost!”</p>

<p>It sounded strangely blank when he said that
“everything lost.” And for that which never could
be anything, he had lost happiness. His opinions
and principles seemed to him now to be dry cobwebs,
which had captured him. He wished to tear
himself away to come to her. She was the only
reality, the only thing that was his. So he had felt
before. It came back now. She was the only
thing in the world.</p>

<p>“They are, however, fighting to-day in Paternó.”</p>

<p>“There has been a disagreement by the town-gate,”
he said. “It is nothing. If I had been able
to inflame all Etna, the whole circle of towns round
about Etna! Then they would have understood us!
they would have listened to us! Now they are shooting
down a few hungry peasants to make a few hungry
mouths the less. They do not yield an inch to us.”</p>

<p>He strove to break through his cobwebs. Could
he venture to go up to her, to tell her that all that
was of no importance? He did not need to think of
politics. He was an artist; he was free! And he
wanted to possess her!</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed as if the air trembled. A
shot echoed through the night, then another and
another.</p>

<p>She came forward to him and grasped his wrist.
“Is that the uprising?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Shot upon shot came thundering. Then were
heard the cries and din of a crowd rushing down the
street.</p>

<p>“It is the uprising; it must be the uprising!
Ah, long live socialism!”</p>

<p>He was filled with joy. Entire faith in his belief
came back to him. He would win her too. Women
have never refused to belong to the victor.</p>

<p>They both hurried without another word through
the garden to the door. There Gaetano began to
swear and call. He could not get out. There was
no key in the lock. He was shut into the garden.</p>

<p>He looked about. There were high walls on three
sides, and on the fourth an abyss. There was no
way out for him. But from the town came a terrible
noise. The people were rushing up and down;
there were shots and cries. And they heard them
yell: “Long live freedom! Long live socialism!”
He threw himself against the door, and almost
shrieked. He was imprisoned; he could not take
part.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela came up to him as quickly as she
could. Now, since she had heard him, she no
longer thought of keeping him back.</p>

<p>“Wait, wait!” she said. “I took the key.”</p>

<p>“You, you!” he said.</p>

<p>“I took it when I came. It occurred to me that
I could keep you shut in here if you should want to
cause an uprising. I wished to save you.”</p>

<p>“What folly!” he said, and snatched the key
from her.</p>

<p>While he stood and fumbled to find the key-hole,
he still had time to say something.</p>

<p>“Why do you not want to save me now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so that your God may have a chance to
destroy me.”</p>

<p>She was still silent.</p>

<p>“Do you not dare to save me from His wrath?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not dare,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>“You believers are terrible!” he said.</p>

<p>He felt that she threw him aside. It froze him,
and took away his courage, that she did not make a
single attempt to persuade him to stay. He turned
the key forward and back without being able to open
the door, paralyzed by her standing there pale and
cold behind him.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly felt her arms about his neck
and her lips seeking his.</p>

<p>At the same moment the door flew open and he
rushed away. He would not have her kisses, which
only consecrated him to death. She was as terrible
as a spectre to him with her ancient faith. He
rushed away like a fugitive.</p>

<h3 id="I_XI">XI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FEAST OF SAN SEBASTIANO</span></h3>

<p>When Gaetano rushed away, Donna Micaela stood
for a long time in Donna Elisa’s garden. She stood
there as if turned to stone, and could neither feel
nor think.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the thought came that Gaetano
and she were not alone in the world. She remembered
her father lying sick, whom she had forgotten
for so many hours.</p>

<p>She went through the gate of the court-yard out
to the Corso, which lay deserted and empty. Tumult
and shots were still audible far away, and she said
to herself that they must be fighting down by Porta
Etnea.</p>

<p>The moon shed its clear light on the façade of the
summer-palace, and it amazed her that at such an
hour, and on such a night, the balcony doors stood
open, and the window shutters were not closed.
She was still more surprised that the gate was
standing ajar, and that the shop-door was wide
open.</p>

<p>As she went in through the gate, she did not see
the old gate-keeper, Piero, there. The lanterns in
the court-yard were not lighted, and there was not a
soul to be seen anywhere.</p>

<p>She went up the steps to the gallery, and her
foot struck against something hard. It was a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
bronze vase, which belonged in the music-room.
A few steps higher up she found a knife. It
was a sheath-knife, with a long, dagger-like blade.
When she lifted it up a couple of dark drops rolled
down from its edge. She knew that it must be
blood.</p>

<p>And she understood too that what she had feared
all the autumn had now happened. Bandits had
been in the summer-palace for plunder. And everyone
who could run away had run away; but her
father, who could not leave his bed, must be
murdered.</p>

<p>She could not tell whether the brigands were not
still in the house. But now, in the midst of danger,
her fears vanished; and she hurried on, unheeding
that she was alone and defenceless.</p>

<p>She went along the gallery into the music-room.
Broad rays of moonlight fell upon the floor, and
in one of those rays lay a human form stretched
motionless.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela bent down over that motionless
body. It was Giannita. She was murdered; she
had a deep, gaping wound in her neck.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela laid the body straight, crossed the
hands over the breast, and closed the eyes. In so
doing, her hands were wet with the blood; and when
she felt that warm, sticky blood, she began to weep.
“Alas, my dear, beloved sister,” she said aloud, “it
is your young life that has ebbed away with this
blood. All your life you have loved me, and now
you have shed your blood defending my house. Is
it to punish my hardness that God has taken you
from me? Is it because I did not allow you to love
him whom I loved that you have gone from me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Alas, sister, sister, could you not have punished me
less severely?”</p>

<p>She bent down and kissed the dead girl’s forehead.
“You do not believe it,” she said. “You know
that I have always been faithful to you. You know
that I have loved you.”</p>

<p>She remembered that the dead was severed from
everything earthly, that it was not grief and assurances
of friendship she needed. She said a prayer
over the body, since the only thing she could do for
her sister was to support with pious thoughts the
flight of the soul soaring up to God.</p>

<p>Then she went on, no longer afraid of anything
that could happen to herself, but in inexpressible
terror of what might have happened to her father.</p>

<p>When she had at last passed through the long
halls in the state apartment and stood by the door
to the sick-room, her hands groped a long time for
the latch; and when she had found it, she had not
the strength to turn the key.</p>

<p>Then her father called from his room and asked
who was there. When she heard his voice and knew
that he was alive, everything in her trembled, and
burst, and lost its power to serve her. Brain and
heart failed her at once, and her muscles could no
longer hold her upright. She had still time to
think that she had been living in terrible suspense.
And with a feeling of relief, she sank down in a
long swoon.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela regained consciousness towards
morning. In the meantime much had happened.
The servants had come out of their hiding-places,
and had gone for Donna Elisa. She had taken
charge of the deserted palace, had summoned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
police, and sent a message to the White Brotherhood.
And the latter had carried Giannita’s body
to her mother’s house.</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela awoke, she found herself
lying on the sofa in a room next her father’s. No
one was with her, but in her father’s room she heard
Donna Elisa talking.</p>

<p>“My son and my daughter,” said Donna Elisa,
sobbing; “I have lost both my son and my daughter.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela tried to raise herself, but she
could not. Her body still lay in a stupor, although
her soul was awake.</p>

<p>“Cavaliere, Cavaliere,” said Donna Elisa, “can
you understand? The bandits come here from Etna,
creeping down to Diamante. The bandits attack
the custom-house and shout: ‘Long live Socialism!’
They do it only to frighten people away from the
streets and to draw the Carabiniere down to Porta
Etnea. There is not a single man from Diamante
who has anything to do with it. It is the
bandits who arrange it all, to be able to plunder
Miss Tottenham and Donna Micaela, two women,
Cavaliere! What did those officers think at the
court-martial? Did they believe that Gaetano was
in league with the bandits? Did they not see that
he was a nobleman, a true Alagona, an artist? How
could they have sentenced him?”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela listened with horror, but she tried
to imagine that she was still dreaming. She thought
she heard Gaetano ask if she was sacrificing him to
God. She thought she answered that she did. Now
she was dreaming of how it would be in case he
really had been captured. It could be nothing else.</p>

<p>“What a night of misfortune!” said Donna Elisa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
“What is flying about in the air, and making people
mad and confused? You have seen Gaetano, Cavaliere.
He has always been passionate and fiery, but
it has not been without intelligence; he has not
been without sense and judgment. But to-night he
throws himself right into the arms of the troops.
You know that he wanted to cause an uprising; you
know that he came home for that. And when he
hears the shooting, and some one shouting, ‘Long
live Socialism!’ he becomes wild, and beside himself.
He says to himself, ‘That is the insurrection!’
and he rushes down the street to join it. And he
shouts the whole time, ‘Long live Socialism!’ as
loud as he can. And so he meets a great crowd of
soldiers, a whole host. For they were on their way
to Paternó, and heard the shooting as they passed
by, and marched in to see what was going on. And
Gaetano can no longer recognize a soldier’s cap.
He thinks that they are the rebels; he thinks that
they are angels from heaven, and he rushes in among
them and lets them capture him. And they, who
have already caught all the bandits sneaking away
with their booty, now lay hands on Gaetano too.
They go through the town and find everything
quiet; but before they leave, they pass sentence on
their prisoners. And they condemn Gaetano like
the others, condemn him like those who have broken
in and murdered women. Have they not lost their
senses, Cavaliere?”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela could not hear what her father
answered. She wished to ask a thousand questions,
but she was still paralyzed and could not move.
She wondered if Gaetano had been shot.</p>

<p>“What do they mean by sentencing him to twenty-nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
years’ imprisonment?” said Donna Elisa. “Do
you think that he can live so long, or that any one
who loves him can live so long? He is dead,
Cavaliere; as dead for me as Giannita.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela felt as if strong fetters bound her
beyond escape. It was worse, she thought, than to
be tied to a pillory and whipped.</p>

<p>“All the joy of my old age is taken from me,” said
Donna Elisa. “Both Giannita and Gaetano! I have
always expected them to marry each other. It
would have been so suitable, because they were both
my children, and loved me. For what shall I live
now, when I have no young people about me? I
was often poor when Gaetano first came to me, and
people said to me that I should have been better off
alone. But I answered: ‘It makes no difference,
none, if only I have young people about me.’ And
I thought that when he grew up he would find a
young wife, and then they would have little children,
and I would never need to sit a lonely and
useless old woman.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela lay thinking that she could have
saved Gaetano, but had not wished to do so. But
why had she not wished? It seemed to her quite
incomprehensible. She began to count up to herself
all her reasons for permitting him to rush to
destruction. He was an atheist; a socialist; he
wished to cause a revolt. That had outweighed
everything else when she opened the garden gate for
him. It had crushed her love also. She could not
now understand it. It was as if a scale full of
feathers had weighed down a scale full of gold.</p>

<p>“My beautiful boy!” said Donna Elisa, “my beautiful
boy! He was already a great man over there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
in England, and he came home to help us poor
Sicilians. And now they have sentenced him like
a bandit. People say that they were ready to shoot
him, as they shot the others. Perhaps it would
have been better if they had done so, Cavaliere. It
had been better to have laid him in the church-yard
than to know that he was in prison. How will he
be able to endure all his suffering? He will not
be able to bear it; he will fall ill; he will soon be
dead.”</p>

<p>At these words, Donna Micaela roused herself
from her stupor, and got up from the sofa. She
staggered across the room and came in to her
father and Donna Elisa, as pale as poor murdered
Giannita. She was so weak that she did not dare to
cross the floor; she stood at the door and leaned
against the door-post.</p>

<p>“It is I,” she said; “Donna Elisa, it is I&mdash;”</p>

<p>The words would not come to her lips. She
wrung her hands in despair that she could not
speak.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa was instantly at her side. She put
her arm about her to support her, without paying
any attention to Donna Micaela’s attempt to push
her away.</p>

<p>“You must forgive me, Donna Elisa,” she said,
with an almost inaudible voice. “I did it.”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa did not heed much what she was
saying. She saw that she had fever, and thought
that she was delirious.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela’s lips worked; she plainly wished
to say something, but only a few words were audible.
It was impossible to understand what she meant.
“Against him, as against my father,” she said, over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and over. And then she said something about
bringing misfortune on all who loved her.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa had got her down on a chair, and
Donna Micaela sat there and kissed her old, wrinkled
hands, and asked her to forgive her what she had
done.</p>

<p>Yes, of course, of course, Donna Elisa forgave her.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela looked her sharply in the face
with great, feverish eyes, and asked if it were true.</p>

<p>It was really true.</p>

<p>Then she laid her head on Donna Elisa’s shoulder
and sobbed, thanked her, and said that she could not
live if she did not obtain her forgiveness. She had
sinned against no one so much as against her.
Could she forgive her?</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Donna Elisa again and again,
and thought that the other was out of her head from
fever and fright.</p>

<p>“There is something I ought to tell you,” said
Donna Micaela. “I know it, but you do not know
it. You will not forgive me if you hear it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I forgive you,” said Donna Elisa.</p>

<p>They talked in that way for a long time without
understanding each other; but it was good for old
Donna Elisa to have some one that night to put to
bed, comforted and dosed with strengthening herbs
and drops. It was good for her to still have some
one to come and lay her head on her shoulder and
cry away her grief.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Donna Micaela, who had loved Gaetano for nearly
three years without a thought that they could ever
belong to each other, had accustomed herself to a
strange kind of love. It was enough for her to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
that Gaetano loved her. When she thought of it, a
tender feeling of security and happiness stole through
her. “What does it matter; what does it matter?”
she said, when she suffered adversity. “Gaetano
loves me.” He was always with her, cheering and
comforting her. He took part in all her thoughts
and undertakings. He was the soul of her life.</p>

<p>As soon as Donna Micaela could get his address,
she wrote to him. She acknowledged to him that
she had firmly believed that he had gone to misfortune.
But she had been so much afraid of what he
proposed to accomplish in the world that she had
not dared to save him.</p>

<p>She also wrote how she detested his teachings.
She did not dissemble at all to him. She said that
even if he were free she could not be his.</p>

<p>She feared him. He had such power over her
that, if they were united, he would make her a
socialist and an atheist. Therefore she must always
live apart from him, for the salvation of her soul.</p>

<p>But she begged and prayed that in spite of everything
he would not cease to love her. He must not;
he must not! He might punish her in any way he
pleased, if only he did not cease to love her.</p>

<p>He must not do as her father had. He had perhaps
reason to close his heart to her now, but he must
not. He must be merciful.</p>

<p>If he knew how she loved him! If he knew how
she dreamed of him!</p>

<p>She told him that he was nothing less than life
itself to her.</p>

<p>“Must I die, Gaetano?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Is it not enough that those opinions and teachings
part us? Is it not enough that they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
carried you to prison? Will you also cease to love
me, because we do not think alike?</p>

<p>“Ah, Gaetano, love me! It leads to nothing;
there is no hope in your love, but love me; I die if
you do not love me.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela had hardly sent off the letter
before she began to wait for the answer. She
expected a stormy and angry reply, but she hoped
that there would be one single word to show her
that he still loved her.</p>

<p>But she waited several weeks without receiving
any letter from Gaetano.</p>

<p>It did not help her to stand and wait every morning
for the letter-carrier out on the gallery, and
almost break his heart because he was always obliged
to say that he did not have anything for her.</p>

<p>One day she went herself to the post-office, and
asked them, with the most beseeching eyes, to give
her the letter she was expecting. It must be there,
she said. But perhaps they had not been able to
read the address; perhaps it had been put into the
wrong box? And her soft, imploring eyes so touched
the postmaster that she was allowed to look through
piles of old, unclaimed letters, and to turn all the
drawers in the post-office upside down. But it was
all in vain.</p>

<p>She wrote new letters to Gaetano; but no answer
came.</p>

<p>Then she tried to believe what seemed impossible.
She tried to make her soul realize that Gaetano had
ceased to love her.</p>

<p>As her conviction increased, she began to shut
herself into her room. She was afraid of people,
and preferred to sit alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Day by day she became more feeble. She walked
deeply bent, and even her beautiful eyes seemed to
lose their life and light.</p>

<p>After a few weeks she was so weak that she could
no longer keep up, but lay all day on her sofa.
She was prey to a suffering that gradually deprived
her of all vital power. She knew that she was failing,
and she was afraid to die. But she could do
nothing. There was only one remedy for her, but
that never came. While Donna Micaela seemed to
be thus quietly gliding out of life, the people of
Diamante were preparing to celebrate the feast of
San Sebastiano, that comes at the end of January.</p>

<p>It was the greatest festival of Diamante, but in
the last few years it had not been kept with customary
splendor, because want and gloom had weighed
too heavily on their souls.</p>

<p>But this year, just after the revolt had failed, and
while Sicily was still filled with troops, and while
the beloved heroes of the people languished in
prison, they determined to celebrate the festival
with all the old-time pomp; for now, they said, was
not the time to neglect the saint.</p>

<p>And the pious people of Diamante determined
that the festival should be held for a week, and that
San Sebastiano should be honored with flags and
decorations, and with races and biblical processions,
illuminations, and singing contests.</p>

<p>The people bestirred themselves with great haste
and eagerness. There was polishing and scrubbing
in every house. They brought out the old costumes,
and they prepared to receive strangers from all
Etna.</p>

<p>The summer-palace was the only house in Diamante<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
where no preparations were made. Donna
Elisa was deeply grieved at it, but she could not
induce Donna Micaela to have her house decorated.
“How can you ask me to trim a house of mourning
with flowers and leaves?” she said. “The roses
would shed their petals if I tried to use them to
mask the misery that reigns here.”</p>

<p>But Donna Elisa was very eager for the festival,
and expected much good to result from honoring the
saint as in the old days. She could talk of nothing
but of how the priests had decorated the façade of
the Cathedral in the old Sicilian way, with silver
flowers and mirrors. And she described the procession:
how many riders there were to be, and what
high plumes they were to have in their hats, and
what long, garlanded staves, with wax candles at
the end, they were to carry in their hands.</p>

<p>When the first festival day came, Donna Elisa’s
house was the most gorgeously decorated. The
green, red, and white standard of Italy waved from
the roof, and red cloths, fringed with gold, bearing
the saint’s initials, were spread over the window-sills
and balcony railings. Up and down the wall
ran garlands of holly, shaped into stars and arches,
and round the windows crept wreaths made of the
little pink roses from Donna Elisa’s garden. Just
over the entrance stood the saint’s image, framed
in lilies, and on the threshold lay cypress-branches.
And if one had entered the house, one would have
found it as much adorned on the inside as on the
outside. From the cellar to the attic it was scoured
and covered with flowers, and on the shelves in
the shop no saint was too small or insignificant to
have an everlasting or a harebell in his hand. Like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Donna Elisa, every one in penniless Diamante had
decorated along the whole street. In the street
above the house of the little Moor there was such an
array of flags that it looked like clothes hung out to
dry from the earth to the sky. Every house and
every arch carried flags, and across the streets were
hung ropes, from which fluttered pennant after
pennant.</p>

<p>At every tenth step the people of Diamante had
raised triumphal arches over the street. And over
every door stood the image of the saint, framed in
wreaths of yellow everlastings. The balconies were
covered with red quilts and bright-colored table-cloths,
and stiff garlands wound up the walls.</p>

<p>There were so many flowers and leaves that no
one could understand how they had been able to get
them all in January. Everything was crowned and
wreathed with flowers. The brooms had crowns of
crocuses, and each door-knocker a bunch of hyacinths.
In windows stood pictures with monograms, and
inscriptions of blood-red anemones.</p>

<p>And between those decorated houses the stream of
people rolled as mighty as a rising river. It was
not the inhabitants of Diamante alone who were
honoring San Sebastiano. From all Etna came
yellow carts, beautifully ornamented and painted,
drawn by horses in shining harness, and loaded
down with people. The sick, the beggars, the blind
singers came in great crowds. There were whole
trains of pilgrims, unhappy people, who now, after
their misfortunes, had some one to pray to.</p>

<p>Such numbers came that the people wondered how
they all would ever find room within the town walls.
There were people in the streets, people in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
windows, people on the balconies. On the high
stone steps sat people, and the shops were full of
them. The big street-doors were thrown wide, and
in the openings chairs were arranged in a half-circle,
as in a theatre. There the house-owners sat with
their guests and looked at the passers-by.</p>

<p>The whole street was filled with an intoxicating
noise. It was not only the talking and laughter of
the people. There were also organ-grinders standing
and turning hand-organs big as pianos. There
were street-singers, and there were men and women
who declaimed Tasso in cracked, worn-out voices.
There were all kinds of criers, the sound of organs
streamed from all the churches, and in the square on
the summit of the mountain the town band played so
that it could be heard over all Diamante.</p>

<p>The joyous noise, and the fragrance of the flowers,
and the flapping of the flags outside Donna Micaela’s
window had power to wake her from her stupor.
She rose up, as if life had sent for her. “I will not
die,” she said to herself. “I will try to live.”</p>

<p>She took her father’s arm and went out into the
street. She hoped that the life there would mount
to her head so that she might forget her sorrow.
“If I do not succeed,” she thought, “if I can find
no distraction, I must die.”</p>

<p>Now in Diamante there was a poor old stone-cutter,
who had thought of earning a few soldi during
the festival. He had made a couple of small
busts out of lava, of San Sebastiano and of Pope Leo
XIII. And as he knew that many in Diamante
loved Gaetano, and grieved over his fate, he also
made a few portraits of him.</p>

<p>Just as Donna Micaela came out into the street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
she met the man, and he offered her his wretched
little images.</p>

<p>“Buy Don Gaetano Alagona, Donna Micaela,”
said the man; “buy Don Gaetano, whom the government
has put in prison because he wished to
help Sicily.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela pressed her father’s arm hard and
went hurriedly on.</p>

<p>In the Café Europa the son of the innkeeper
stood and sang canzoni. He had composed a few
new ones for the festival, and among others some
about Gaetano. For he could not know that people
did not care to hear of him.</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela passed by the café and
heard the singing, she stopped and listened.</p>

<p>“Alas, Gaetano Alagona!” sang the young man.
“Songs are mighty. I shall sing you free with
my songs. First I will send you the slender canzone.
He shall glide in between your prison-gratings, and
break them. Then I will send you the sonnet, that
is fair as a woman, and which will corrupt your
guards. I will compose a glorious ode to you, which
will shake the walls of your prison with its lofty
rhythms. But if none of these help you, I will burst
out in the glorious epos, that has hosts of words.
Oh, Gaetano, mighty as an army it marches on!
All the legions of ancient Rome would not have
had the strength to stop it!”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela hung convulsively on her father’s
arm, but she did not speak, and went on.</p>

<p>Then Cavaliere Palmeri began to speak of Gaetano.
“I did not know that he was so beloved,” he said.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” murmured Donna Micaela.</p>

<p>“To-day I saw some strangers coming into Donna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Elisa’s shop, and begging her to be allowed to buy
something that he had carved. She had left only a
couple of old rosaries, and I saw her break them to
pieces and give them out bead by bead.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela looked at her father like a beseeching
child. But he did not know whether she wished
him to be silent or to go on speaking.</p>

<p>“Donna Elisa’s old friends go about in the garden
with Luca,” he said, “and Luca shows them Gaetano’s
favorite places and the garden beds that he used to
plant. And Pacifica sits in the workshop beside
the joiner’s-bench, and relates all sorts of things
about him, ever since he was&mdash;so big.”</p>

<p>He could tell no more; the crush and the noise
became so great about him that he had to stop.</p>

<p>They meant to go to the Cathedral. On the
Cathedral steps sat old Assunta, as usual. She held
a rosary in her hands and mumbled the same prayer
round the whole rosary. She asked the saint that
Gaetano, who had promised to help all the poor,
might come back to Diamante.</p>

<p>As Donna Micaela walked by her, she distinctly
heard: “San Sebastiano, give us Gaetano! Ah, in
your mercy; ah, in our misery, San Sebastiano,
give us Gaetano!”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela had meant to go into the church,
but she turned on the steps.</p>

<p>“There is such a crowd there,” she said, “I do
not dare to go in.”</p>

<p>She went home again. But while she had been
away, Donna Elisa had watched her opportunity.
She had hoisted a flag on the roof of the summer-palace;
she had spread draperies on the balconies,
and as Donna Micaela came home, she was fastening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
up a garland in the gateway. For Donna Elisa
could not bear to have the summer-palace underrated.
She wished no honor to San Sebastiano
omitted at this time. And she feared that the saint
would not help Diamante and Gaetano if the palace
of the old Alagonas did not honor him.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela was pale as if she had received her
death warrant, and bent like an old woman of eighty
years.</p>

<p>She murmured to herself: “I make no busts of
him; I sing no songs about him; I dare not pray to
God for him; I buy none of his beads. How can he
believe that I love him? He must love all these
others, who worship him, but not me. I do not
belong to his world, he can love me no longer.”</p>

<p>And when she saw that they wished to adorn her
house with flowers, it seemed to her so piteously
cruel that she snatched the wreath from Donna Elisa
and threw it at her feet, asking if she wished to kill
her.</p>

<p>Then she went past her up the stairs to her room.
She threw herself on the sofa and buried her face in
the cushions.</p>

<p>She now first understood how far apart she and
Gaetano were. The idol of the people could not
love her.</p>

<p>She felt as if she had prevented him from helping
all those poor people.</p>

<p>How he must detest her; how he must hate her!</p>

<p>Then her illness came creeping back over her.
That illness which consisted of not being loved!
It would kill her. She thought, as she lay there,
that it was all over.</p>

<p>While she lay there, suddenly the little Christchild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
stood before her inward eye. He seemed to
have entered the room in all his wretched splendor.
She saw him plainly.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela began to call on the Christchild
for help. And she was amazed at herself for not
having turned before to that good helper. It was
probably because the image did not stand in a
church, but was carried about as a museum-piece by
Miss Tottenham, that she remembered him only in
her deepest need.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was late in the evening of the same day. After
dinner Donna Micaela had given all her servants
permission to go to the festival, so that she and her
father were alone in the big house. But towards ten
o’clock her father rose and said he wished to hear
the singing-contest in the square. And as Donna
Micaela did not dare to sit alone, she was obliged
to go with him.</p>

<p>When they came to the square they saw that it
was turned into a theatre, with lines upon lines of
chairs. Every corner was filled with people, and it
was with difficulty that they found places.</p>

<p>“Diamante is glorious this evening, Micaela,”
said Cavaliere Palmeri. The charm of the night
seemed to have softened him. He spoke more
simply and tenderly to his daughter than he had
done for a long time.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela felt instantly that he spoke the
truth. She felt as she had done when she first
came to Diamante. It was a town of miracles, a
town of beauty, a little sanctuary of God.</p>

<p>Directly in front of her stood a high and stately
building made of shining diamonds. She had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
think for a moment before she could understand what
it was.</p>

<p>Yet it was nothing but the front of the Cathedral,
covered with flowers of stiff silver and gold paper
and with thousands of little mirrors stuck in between
the flowers. And in every flower was hung a little
lamp with a flame as big as a fire-fly. It was the
most enchanting illumination that Donna Micaela
had ever seen.</p>

<p>There was no other light in the market-place, nor
was any needed. That great wall of diamonds
shone quite sufficiently. The black Palazzo Geraci
was flaming red, as if it had been lighted by a
conflagration.</p>

<p>Nothing of the world outside of the square was
visible. Everything below it was in the deepest
darkness, and that made her think again that she
saw the old enchanted Diamante that was not of the
earth, but was a holy city on one of the mounts of
heaven. The town-hall with its heavy balconies
and high steps, the long convent and the Roman
gate were again glorious and wonderful. And she
could hardly believe it was in that town that she
had suffered such terrible pain.</p>

<p>In the midst of the great crowd of people, no
chill was felt. The winter night was mild as a
spring morning; and Donna Micaela began to feel
something of spring in her. It began to stir and
tremble in her in a way which was both sweet and
terrible. It must feel so in the snow-masses on
Etna when the sun melts them into sparkling
brooks.</p>

<p>She looked at the people who filled the market-place,
and was amazed at herself that she had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
so tortured by them in the forenoon. She was glad
that they loved Gaetano. Alas, if he had only continued
to love her, she would have been unspeakably
proud and happy in their love. Then she could
have kissed those old callous hands that made images
of him and were clasped in prayers for him.</p>

<p>As she was thinking this, the church-door was
thrown open and a big, flat wagon rolled out of the
church. Highest on the red-covered wagon stood
San Sebastiano by his stake, and below the image
sat the four singers, who were to contest.</p>

<p>There was an old blind man from Nicolosi; a
cooper from Catania, who was considered to be the
best improvisatore in all Sicily; a smith from
Termini, and little Gandolfo, who was son to the
watchman in the town-hall of Diamante.</p>

<p>Everybody was surprised that Gandolfo dared to
appear in such a difficult contest. Did he do it
perhaps to please his betrothed, little Rosalia? No
one had ever heard that he could improvise. He
had never done anything in his whole life but eat
mandarins and stare at Etna.</p>

<p>The first thing was to draw lots among the competitors,
and the lots fell so that the cooper should
come first and Gandolfo last. When it fell so
Gandolfo turned pale. It was terrible to come last,
when they all were to speak on the same subject.</p>

<p>The cooper elected to speak of San Sebastiano,
when he was a soldier of the legion in ancient
Rome, and for his faith’s sake was bound to a stake
and used as a target for his comrades. After him
came the blind man, who told how a pious Roman
matron found the martyr bleeding and pierced with
arrows, and succeeded in bringing him back to life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Then came the smith, who related all the miracles
San Sebastiano had worked in Sicily during the
pest in the fifteenth century. They were all much
applauded. They spoke many strong words of blood
and death, and the people rejoiced in them. But
every one from Diamante was anxious for little
Gandolfo.</p>

<p>“The smith takes all the words from him. He
must fail,” they said.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said others, “little Rosalia will not take
the engagement ribbon out of her hair for that.”</p>

<p>Gandolfo shrunk together in his corner of the
wagon. He grew smaller and smaller. Those sitting
near could hear how his teeth chattered with
fright.</p>

<p>When his turn came at last, and he rose and began
to improvise, he was very bad. He was worse than
any one had expected. He faltered out a couple of
verses, but they were only a repetition of what the
others had said.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly stopped and gasped for breath.
In that moment the strength of despair came to
him. He straightened himself up, and a slight
flush rose to his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Oh, signori,” said little Gandolfo, “let me speak
of that of which I am always thinking! Let me
speak of what I always see before me!”</p>

<p>And he began unopposed and with wonderful
power to tell what he himself had seen.</p>

<p>He told how he who was son to the watchman of
the town-hall had crept through dark attics and had
lain hidden in one of the galleries of the court-room
the night the court-martial had been held to pass
sentence on the insurgents in Diamante.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he had seen Don Gaetano Alagona on the
bench of the accused with a lot of wild fellows who
were worse than brutes.</p>

<p>He told how beautiful Gaetano had been. He
had seemed like a god to little Gandolfo beside
those terrible people about him. And he described
those bandits with their wild-beast faces, their
coarse hair, their clumsy limbs. He said that no
one could look into their eyes without a quiver of
the heart.</p>

<p>Yet, in all his beauty, Don Gaetano was more
terrible than those people. Gandolfo did not know
how they dared to sit beside him on the bench.
Under his frowning brows his eyes flashed at his
fellow-prisoners with a look which would have killed
their souls, if they like others had possessed such a
thing.</p>

<p>“‘Who are you,’ he seemed to ask, ‘who dare
to turn to plundering and murder while you call on
sacred liberty? Do you know what you have done?
Do you know that on account of your devices I am
now a prisoner? And it was I who would have
saved Sicily!’” And every glance he cast at them
was a death warrant.</p>

<p>His eyes fell on all the things that the bandits
had stolen and that were now piled up on a table.
He recognized them. Could he help knowing the
clocks and the silver dishes from the summer-palace?
could he help knowing the relics and coins
that had been stolen from his English patroness?
And when he had recognized the things, he turned
to his fellow-prisoners with a terrible smile. “‘You
heroes! you heroes!’ said the smile; ‘you have
stolen from two women!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>His noble face was constantly changing. Once
Gandolfo had seen it contracted by a sudden terror.
It was when the man sitting nearest to him stretched
out a hand covered with blood. Had he perhaps had
a sudden idea of the truth? Did he think that those
men had broken into the house where his beloved
lived?</p>

<p>Gandolfo told how the officers who were to be the
judges had come in, silent and grave, and sat down
in their places. But he said when he had seen
those noble gentlemen his anxiety had diminished.
He had said to himself that they knew that Gaetano
was of good birth, and that they would not sentence
him. They would not mix him up with the bandits.
No one could possibly believe that he had wished to
rob two women.</p>

<p>And see, when the judge called up Gaetano
Alagona his voice was without hardness. He spoke
to him as to an equal.</p>

<p>“But,” said Gandolfo, “when Don Gaetano rose,
he stood so that he could see out over the square.
And through the square, through this same square,
where now so many people are sitting in happiness
and pleasure, a funeral procession was passing.</p>

<p>“It was the White Brotherhood carrying the body
of the murdered Giannita to her mother’s house.
They walked with torches, and the bier, carried on
the bearers’ shoulders, was plainly visible. As the
procession passed slowly across the market-place,
one could recognize the pall spread over the corpse.
It was the pall of the Alagonas adorned with
a gorgeous coat of arms and rich silver fringes.
When Gaetano saw it, he understood that the corpse
was of the house of Alagona. His face became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
ashy gray, and he reeled as if he were going to
fall.</p>

<p>“At that moment the judge asked him: ‘Do you
know the murdered woman?’ And he answered:
‘Yes.’ Then the judge, who was a merciful man,
continued: ‘Was she near to you?’ And then Don
Gaetano answered: ‘I love her.’”</p>

<p>When Gandolfo had come so far in his story,
people saw Donna Micaela suddenly rise, as if she
had wished to contradict him, but Cavaliere Palmeri
drew her quickly down beside him.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, be quiet,” he said to her.</p>

<p>And she sat quiet with her face hidden in her
hands. Now and then her body rocked and she
wailed softly.</p>

<p>Gandolfo told how the judge, when Gaetano had
acknowledged that, had shown him his fellow-prisoners
and asked him: “‘If you loved that woman,
how can you have anything in common with the
men who have murdered her?’”</p>

<p>Then Don Gaetano had turned towards the bandits.
He had raised his clenched hand and shaken it at
them. And he had looked as if he had longed for a
dagger, to be able to strike them down one after
another.</p>

<p>“‘With those!’” he had shouted. “‘Should I
have anything in common with those?’”</p>

<p>And he had certainly meant to say that he had
nothing to do with robbers and murderers. The
judge had smiled kindly at him, as if he had only
waited for that answer to set him free.</p>

<p>But then a divine miracle had happened.</p>

<p>And Gandolfo told, how among all the stolen
things that lay on the table, there had also been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
little Christ image. It was a yard high, richly
covered with jewels and adorned with a gold crown
and gold shoes. Just at that moment one of the
officers bent down to draw the image to him; and as
he did so, the crown fell to the floor and rolled all
the way to Don Gaetano.</p>

<p>Don Gaetano picked up the Christ-crown, held it
a moment in his hands and looked at it carefully.
It seemed as if he had read something in it.</p>

<p>He did not hold it more than one minute. In the
next the guard took it from him.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela looked up almost frightened. The
Christ image! He was there already! Should she
so soon get an answer to her prayer?</p>

<p>Gandolfo continued: “But when Don Gaetano
looked up, every one trembled as at a miracle, for
the man was transformed.</p>

<p>“Ah, signori, he was so white that his face seemed
to shine, and his eyes were calm and tender. And
there was no more anger in him.</p>

<p>“And he began to pray for his fellow-prisoners;
he began to pray for their lives.</p>

<p>“He prayed that they should not kill those poor
fellow-creatures. He prayed that the noble judges
should do something for them that they might some
day live like others. ‘We have only this life to live,’
he said. ‘Our kingdom is only of this world.’</p>

<p>“He began to tell how those men had lived. He
spoke as if he could read their souls. He pictured
their life, gloomy and unhappy as it had been. He
spoke so that several of the judges wept.</p>

<p>“The words came strong and commanding, so that
it sounded as if Don Gaetano had been judge and
the judges the criminals. ‘See,’ he said, ‘whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
fault is it that these poor men have gone to destruction?
Is it not you who have the power who ought
to have taken care of them?’</p>

<p>“And they were all dismayed at the responsibility
he forced upon them.</p>

<p>“But suddenly the judge had interrupted him.</p>

<p>“‘Speak in your own defence, Gaetano Alagona,’
he said; ‘do not speak in that of others!’</p>

<p>“Then Don Gaetano had smiled. ‘Signor,’ he
said, ‘I have not much more than you with which
to defend myself. But still I have something. I
have left my career in England to make a revolt in
Sicily. I have brought over weapons. I have made
seditious speeches. I have something, although not
much.’</p>

<p>“The judge had almost begged him. ‘Do not
speak so, Don Gaetano,’ he had said. ‘Think of
what you are saying!’</p>

<p>“But he had made confessions that compelled
them to sentence him.</p>

<p>“When they told him that he was to sit for
twenty-nine years in prison, he had cried out:
‘Now may her will be done, who was just carried
by. May I be as she wished!’</p>

<p>“And I saw no more of him,” said little Gandolfo,
“for the guards placed him between them and led
him away.</p>

<p>“But I, who heard him pray for those who had
murdered his beloved, made a vow that I would do
something for him.</p>

<p>“I vowed to recite a beautiful improvisation to
San Sebastiano to induce him to help him. But I
have not succeeded. I am no improvisatore; I could
not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Here he broke off and threw himself down, weeping
aloud before the image. “Forgive me that I
could not,” he cried, “and help him in spite of it.
You know that when they sentenced him I promised
to do it for his sake that you might save him. But
now I have not been able to speak of you, and you
will not help him.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela hardly knew how it happened, but
she and little Rosalia, who loved Gandolfo, were
beside him at almost the same moment. They drew
him to them, and both kissed him, and said that no
one had spoken like him; no one, no one. Did he
not see that they were weeping? San Sebastiano
was pleased with him. Donna Micaela put a ring
on the boy’s finger and round about him the people
were waving many-colored silk handkerchiefs, that
glistened like waves of the sea in the strong light
from the Cathedral.</p>

<p>“Viva Gaetano! viva Gandolfo!” cried the people.</p>

<p>And flowers and fruits and silk handkerchiefs and
jewels came raining down about little Gandolfo.
Donna Micaela was crowded away from him almost
with violence. But it never occurred to her to be
frightened. She stood among the surging people
and wept. The tears streamed down her face, and
she wept for joy that she could weep. That was the
greatest blessing.</p>

<p>She wished to force her way to Gandolfo; she
could not thank him enough. He had told her that
Gaetano loved her. When he had quoted the words,
“Now may her will be done who was just carried
by,” she had suddenly understood that Gaetano had
believed that it was she lying under the pall of the
Alagonas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>And of that dead woman he had said: “I love
her.”</p>

<p>The blood flowed once more in her veins; her
heart beat again; her tears fell. “It is life, life,”
she said to herself, while she let herself be carried
to and fro by the crowd. “Life has come again to
me. I shall not die.”</p>

<p>They all had to come up to little Gandolfo to
thank him, because he had given them some one
to love, to trust in, to long for in those days of
dejection, when everything seemed lost.</p>

<span class="smaller">A GREAT MAN’S WIFE</span></h3>

<p>It was in February, and the almond-trees were
beginning to blossom on the black lava about
Diamante.</p>

<p>Cavaliere Palmeri had taken a walk up Etna and
had brought home a big almond branch, full of buds
and flowers and put it in a vase in the music-room.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela started when she saw it. So they
had already come, the almond-blossoms. And for a
whole month, for six long weeks, they would be
everywhere.</p>

<p>They would stand on the altar in the church;
they would lie on the graves, and they would be
worn on the breast, on the hat, in the hair. They
would blossom over the roads, in the heaps of ruins,
on the black lava. And every almond-flower would
remind her of the day when the bells rang, when
Gaetano was free and happy, and when she dreamed
of passing her whole life with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed to her as if she never before fully
understood what it meant that he was shut in and
gone, that she should never see him again.</p>

<p>She had to sit down in order not to fall; her heart
seemed to stop, and she shut her eyes.</p>

<p>While she was sitting thus she had a strange
experience.</p>

<p>She is all at once at home in the palace in Catania.
She is sitting in the lofty hall reading, and she is a
happy young girl, Signorina Palmeri. A servant
brings in a wandering salesman to her. He is a
handsome young fellow with a sprig of almond-blossoms
in his button-hole; on his head he carries
a board full of little images of the saints, carved in
wood.</p>

<p>She buys some of the images, while the young
man’s eyes drink in all the works of art in the hall.
She asks him if he would like to see their collections.
Yes, that he would. And she herself goes
with him and shows him.</p>

<p>He is so delighted with what he sees that she
thinks that he must be a real artist, and she says to
herself that she will not forget him. She asks
where his home is. He answers: “In Diamante.”&mdash;“Is
that far away?”&mdash;“Four hours in the post-carriage.”&mdash;“And
with the railway?”&mdash;“There is
no railway to Diamante, signorina.”&mdash;“You must
build one.”&mdash;“We! we are too poor. Ask the
rich men in Catania to build us a railway!”</p>

<p>When he has said that he starts to go, but he
turns at the door and comes and gives her his
almond-blossoms. It is in gratitude for all the
beautiful things she has let him see.</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela opened her eyes she did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
not know whether she had been dreaming or whether
perhaps once some such thing had really happened.
Gaetano could really have been some time in the
Palazzo Palmeri to sell his images, although she had
forgotten it; but now the almond-blossoms had
recalled it.</p>

<p>But it was no matter, no matter. The important
thing was that the young wood-carver was Gaetano.
She felt as if she had been talking to him. She
thought she heard the door close behind him.</p>

<p>And it was after that that it occurred to her to
build a railway between Catania and Diamante.</p>

<p>Gaetano had surely come to her to ask her to do
it. It was a command from him, and she felt that
she must obey.</p>

<p>She made no attempt to struggle against it. She
was certain that Diamante needed a railway more
than anything else. She had once heard Gaetano
say that if Diamante only possessed a railway, so
that it could easily send away its oranges and its
wine and its honey and its almonds, and so that
travellers could come there conveniently, it would
soon be a rich town.</p>

<p>She was also quite certain that she could succeed
with the railway. She must try at all events. It
never occurred to her not to. When Gaetano wished
it, she must obey.</p>

<p>She began to think how much money she herself
could give. It would not go very far. She must
get more money. That was the first thing she had
to do.</p>

<p>Within the hour she was at Donna Elisa’s, and
begged her to help her arrange a bazaar. Donna
Elisa lifted her eyes from her embroidery. “Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
do you want to arrange a bazaar?”&mdash;“I mean to
collect money for a railway.”&mdash;“That is like you,
Donna Micaela; no one else would have thought of
such a thing.”&mdash;“What, Donna Elisa? What do
you mean?”&mdash;“Oh, nothing.”</p>

<p>And Donna Elisa went on embroidering.</p>

<p>“You will not help me, then, with my bazaar?”&mdash;“No,
I will not.”&mdash;“And you will not give a
little contribution towards it?”&mdash;“One who has
so lately lost her husband,” answered Donna Elisa,
“ought not to trifle.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela saw that Donna Elisa was angry
with her for some reason or other, and that she
therefore would not help her. But there must be
others who would understand; and it was a beautiful
plan, which would save Diamante.</p>

<p>But Donna Micaela wandered in vain from door
to door. However much she talked and begged, she
gained no partisans.</p>

<p>She tried to explain, she used all her eloquence
to persuade. No one was interested in her plans.</p>

<p>Wherever she came, people answered her that they
were too poor, too poor.</p>

<p>The syndic’s wife answered no. Her daughters
were not allowed to sell at the bazaar. Don Antonio
Greco, who had the marionette theatre, would not
come with his dolls. The town-band would not
play. None of the shop-keepers would give any of
their wares. When Donna Micaela was gone they
laughed at her.</p>

<p>A railroad, a railroad! She did not know what
she was thinking of. There would have to be a
company, shares, statutes, concessions. How should
a woman manage such things?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>While some were content to laugh at Donna
Micaela, some were angry with her.</p>

<p>She went to the cellar-like shop near the old
Benedictine monastery, where Master Pamphilio
related romances of chivalry. She came to ask him
if he would come to her bazaar and entertain the
public with Charlemagne and his paladins; but as
he was in the midst of a story, she had to sit down
on a bench and wait.</p>

<p>Then she noticed Donna Concetta, Master Pamphilio’s
wife, who was sitting on the platform at
his feet knitting a stocking. As long as Master
Pamphilio was speaking, Donna Concetta’s lips
moved. She had heard his romances so many times
that she knew them by heart, and said the words
before they had passed Master Pamphilio’s lips.
But it was always the same pleasure to her to hear
him, and she wept, and she laughed, as she had
done when she heard him for the first time.</p>

<p>Master Pamphilio was an old man, who had spoken
much in his day, so that his voice sometimes failed
him in the big battle-scenes, when he had to speak
loud and fast. But Donna Concetta, who knew it
all by heart, never took the word from Master
Pamphilio. She only made a sign to the audience
to wait until his voice came back. But if his
memory failed him, Donna Concetta pretended that
she had dropped a stitch, raised the stocking to her
eyes, and threw him the word behind it, so that no
one noticed it. And every one knew that although
Donna Concetta perhaps could have told the romances
better than Master Pamphilio, she would never have
been willing to do such a thing, not only because
it was not fitting for a woman, but also because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
would not give her half so much pleasure as to listen
to dear Master Pamphilio.</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela saw Donna Concetta, she
fell to dreaming. Oh, to sit so on the platform,
where her beloved was speaking; to sit so day in
and day out and worship. She knew whom that
would have suited.</p>

<p>When Master Pamphilio had finished speaking
Donna Micaela went forward and asked him to help
her. It was hard for him to say no, on account
of the thousand prayers that were written in her
eyes. But Donna Concetta came to his rescue.
“Master Pamphilio,” she said, “tell Donna Micaela
of Guglielmo the Wicked.” And Master Pamphilio
began.</p>

<p>“Donna Micaela,” he said, “do you know that
once there was a king in Sicily whose name was
Guglielmo the Wicked? He was so covetous that he
took all his subjects’ money. He commanded that
every one possessing gold coins should give them to
him. And he was so severe and so cruel that they
all had to obey him.</p>

<p>“Well, Donna Micaela, Guglielmo the Wicked
wished to know if any one had gold hidden in his
house. Therefore he sent one of his servants along
the Corso in Palermo with a beautiful horse. And
the man offered the horse for sale, and cried loudly:
‘Will be sold for a piece of gold; will be sold for
a piece of gold!’ But there was no one who could
buy the horse.</p>

<p>“Yet it was a very beautiful horse, and a young
nobleman, the Duke of Montefiascone, was much
taken by him. ‘There is no joy for me if I cannot
buy the horse,’ said he to his steward. ‘Signor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Duca,’ answered his steward, ‘I can tell you where
you can find a piece of gold. When your noble
father died and was carried away by the Capucins,
according to the ancient custom I put a piece of
gold in his mouth. You can take that, signor.’</p>

<p>“For you must know, Donna Micaela, that in
Palermo they do not bury the dead in the ground.
They carry them to the monastery of the Capucins,
and the monks hang them up in their vaults. Ah,
there are so many hanging in those vaults!&mdash;so
many ladies, dressed in silk and cloth of silver; so
many noble gentlemen, with orders on their breasts;
and so many priests, with cloak and cap over skeleton
and skull.</p>

<p>“The young duke followed his advice. He went
to the Capucin monastery, took the piece of gold
from his father’s mouth and bought the horse
with it.</p>

<p>“But you understand that the king had only sent
his servant with the horse in order to find out if
any one still had any money. And now the duke
was taken before the king. ‘How does it happen
that you still have gold pieces?’ said Guglielmo
the Wicked.&mdash;‘Sire, it was not mine; it was my
father’s.’ And he told how he had got the piece of
gold. ‘It is true,’ said the king. ‘I had forgotten
that the dead still had money.’ And he sent his
servants to the Capucins and had them take all the
gold pieces out of the mouths of the dead.”</p>

<p>Here old Master Pamphilio finished his story.
And now Donna Concetta turned to Donna Micaela
with wrathful eyes. “It is you who are out with the
horse,” she said.</p>

<p>“Am I? am I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“You, you, Donna Micaela! The government
will say: ‘They are building a railway in Diamante.
They must be rich.’ And they will increase our
taxes. And God knows that we cannot pay the tax
with which we are already loaded down, even if we
should go and plunder our ancestors.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela tried to calm her.</p>

<p>“They have sent you out to find out if we still
have any money. You are spying for the rich; you
are in league with the government. Those bloodsuckers
in Rome have paid you.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela turned away from her.</p>

<p>“I came to talk to you, Master Pamphilio,” she
said to the old man.</p>

<p>“But I shall answer you,” replied Donna Concetta;
“for this is a disagreeable matter, and such
things are my affair. I know what is the duty of
the wife of a great man, Donna Micaela.”</p>

<p>Donna Concetta became silent, for the fine lady
gave her a look which was so full of jealous longing
that it made her sorry for her. Heavens, yes, there
had been a difference in their husbands; Don Ferrante
and Master Pamphilio!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">PANEM ET CIRCENSES</span></h3>

<p>In Diamante travellers are often shown two palaces
that are falling into ruins without ever having been
completed. They have big window-openings without
frames, high walls without a roof, and wide doors
closed with boards and straw. The two palaces
stand opposite each other on the street, both equally
unfinished and equally in ruins. There are no scaffoldings
about them, and no one can enter them.
They seem to be only built for the doves.</p>

<p>Listen to what is told of them.</p>

<p>What is a woman, O signore? Her foot is so
little that she goes through the world without leaving
a trace behind her. For man she is like his
shadow. She has followed him through his whole
life without his having noticed her.</p>

<p>Not much can be expected of a woman. She has
to sit all day shut in like a prisoner. She cannot
even learn to spell a love-letter correctly. She
cannot do anything of permanence. When she is
dead there is nothing to write on her tombstone.
All women are of the same height.</p>

<p>But once a woman came to Diamante who was as
much above all other women as the century-old palm
is above the grass. She possessed lire by thousands,
and could give them away or keep them, as
she pleased. She turned aside for no one. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
was not afraid of being hated. She was the greatest
marvel that had ever been seen.</p>

<p>Of course she was not a Sicilian. She was an
Englishwoman. And the first thing she did when
she came was to take the whole first floor of the
hotel for herself alone. What was that for her?
All Diamante would not have been enough for her.</p>

<p>No, all Diamante was not enough for her. But
as soon as she had come she began to govern the
town like a queen. The syndic had to obey her.
Was it not she who made him put stone benches in
the square? Was it not at her command that the
streets were swept every day?</p>

<p>When she woke in the morning all the young
men of Diamante stood waiting outside her door, to
be allowed to accompany her on some excursion.
They had left shoemaker’s awl and stone-cutter’s
chisel to act as guides to her. Each had sold his
mother’s silk dress to buy a side-saddle for his
donkey, so that <em>she</em> might ride on it to the castle or
to Tre Castagni. They had divested themselves of
house and home in order to buy a horse and carriage
to drive her to Randazzo and Nicolosi.</p>

<p>We were all her slaves. The children began to
beg in English, and the old blind women at the
hotel door, Donna Pepa and Donna Tura, draped
themselves in dazzlingly white veils to please her.</p>

<p>Everything moved round her; industries and
trades grew up about her. Those who could do
nothing else dug in the earth for coins and pottery
to offer her. Photographers moved to the town and
began to work for her. Coral merchants and hawkers
of tortoise-shell grew out of the earth about her.
The priests of Santa Agnese dug up the old Dionysius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
theatre, that lay hidden behind their church, for her
sake; and every one who owned a ruined villa unearthed
in the darkness of the cellar remains of
mosaic floors and invited her by big posters to come
and see.</p>

<p>There had been foreigners before in Diamante,
but they had come and gone, and no one had enjoyed
such power. There was soon not a man in the town
who did not put all his trust in the English signorina.
She even succeeded in putting a little life into Ugo
Favara. You know Ugo Favara, the advocate, who
was to have been a great man, but had reverses and
came home quite broken. She employed him to take
care of her affairs. She needed him, and she took
him.</p>

<p>There has never been a woman in Diamante who
has done so much business as she. She spread out
like green-weed in the spring. One day no one
knows that there is any, and the next it is a great
clump. Soon it was impossible to go anywhere
in Diamante without coming on her traces. She
bought country houses and town houses; she bought
almond-groves and lava-streams. The best places
on Etna to see the view were hers as well as the
thirsting earth on the plain. And in town she began
to build two big palaces. She was to live in them
and rule her kingdom.</p>

<p>We shall never see a woman like her again. She
was not content with all that. She wished also to
fight the fight with poverty, O signore, with Sicilian
poverty! How much she gave out each day, and
how much she gave away on feast-days! Wagons,
drawn by two pairs of oxen, went down to Catania
and came back piled up with all sorts of clothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
She was determined that they should have whole
clothes in the town where she reigned.</p>

<p>But listen to what happened to her; how the
struggle with poverty ended and what became of the
kingdom and the palace.</p>

<p>She gave a banquet for the poor people of Diamante,
and after the banquet an entertainment in
the Grecian theatre. It was what an old emperor
might have done. But who has ever before heard of
a woman doing such a thing?</p>

<p>She invited all the poor people. There were the
two blind women from the hotel-door, and old Assunta
from the Cathedral steps. There was the man from
the post-house, who had his chin bound up in a red
cloth on account of cancer of the face; and there was
the idiot who opens the iron doors of the Grecian
theatre. All the donkey-boys were there, and the
handless brothers, who exploded a bomb in their
childhood and lost their fingers; and the man with
the wooden leg, and the old chair-maker who had
grown too old to work, both were there.</p>

<p>It was strange to see them creep out of their
holes, all the poor in Diamante. The old women
who sit and spin with distaffs in the dark alleys were
there, and the organ-grinder, who has an instrument
as big as a church-organ, a wandering young mandolinist
from Naples with a body full of all possible
deviltries. All those with diseased eyes and all the
decrepit; those without a roof over their heads;
those who used to collect sorrel by the roadside for
dinner; the stone-cutter, who earned one lira a day
and had six children to provide for,&mdash;they had all
been invited and were present at the feast.</p>

<p>It was poverty marshalling its troops for the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
signorina. Who has such an army as poverty?
But for once the English signorina could conquer it.</p>

<p>She had something to fight with too and to conquer
with. She filled the whole square with loaded
tables. She had wine-skins arranged along the
stone bench that lines the wall of the Cathedral.
She had turned the deserted convent into a larder
and kitchen. She had all the foreign colony in
Diamante dressed in white aprons, to serve the
courses. She had all of Diamante who are used to
eating their fill, wandering to and fro as spectators.</p>

<p>Ah, spectators, what did she not have for spectators?
She had great Etna and the dazzling sun.
She had the red peaks of the inland mountains and
the old temple of Vulcan, that was now consecrated
to San Pasquale. And none of them had ever seen
a satisfied Diamante. None of them had ever before
happened to think how much more beautiful they
themselves would be if the people could look at
them without hunger hissing in their ears and trampling
on their heels.</p>

<p>But mark one thing! Although that signorina
was so wonderful and so great, she was not beautiful.
And in spite of all her power, she was neither
charming nor attractive. She did not rule with
jests, and she did not reward with smiles. She
had a heavy, clumsy body, and a heavy, clumsy
disposition.</p>

<p>The day she gave food to the poor she became a
different person. A chivalrous people live in our
noble island. Among all those poor people there
was not one who let her feel that she was exercising
charity. They worshipped her, but they worshipped
her as a woman. They sat down at the table as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
with an equal. They behaved to her as guests to
their hostess. “To-day I do you the honor to come
to you; to-morrow you do me the honor to come to
me. So and not otherwise.” She stood on the high
steps of the town-hall and looked down at all the
tables. And when the old chair-maker, who sat at
the head of the table, had got his glass filled, he
rose, bowed to her and said: “I drink to your prosperity,
signorina.”</p>

<p>So did they all. They laid their hands on their
hearts and bowed to her. It would have perhaps
been good for her if she had met with such chivalry
earlier in life. Why had the men in her native land
let her forget that women exist to be worshipped?</p>

<p>Here they all looked as if they were burning with
a quiet adoration. Thus are women treated in our
noble island. What did they not give in return for
the food and the wine that she had offered them?
They gave youth and light-heartedness and all the
dignity of being worth coveting. They made
speeches for her. “Noble-hearted signorina, you
who have come to us from over the sea, you who
love Sicily,” and so on, and so on. She showed
that she could blush. She no longer hid her power
to smile. When they had finished speaking, the
lips of the English signorina began to tremble.
She became twenty years younger. It was what she
needed.</p>

<p>The donkey-boy was there, who carries the English
ladies up to Tre Castagni, and who always falls
in love with them before he parts from them. Now
his eyes were suddenly opened to the great benefactress.
It is not only a slender, delicate body
and a soft cheek that are worthy to be adored, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
also strength and force. The donkey-boy suddenly
dropped knife and fork, leaned his elbows on the
table, and sat and looked at her. And all the other
donkey-boys did the same. It spread like a contagion.
It grew hot with burning glances about the
English signorina.</p>

<p>It was not only the poor people who adored her.
The advocate, Ugo Favara, came and whispered to
her that she had come as a providence to his poor
land and to him. “If only I had met such a woman
as you before,” he said.</p>

<p>Fancy an old bird which has sat in a cage for
many years and become rough and lost all the gloss
of his feathers. And then some one comes and
straightens them out and smooths them back. Think
of it, signore!</p>

<p>There was that boy from Naples. He took his
mandolin and began to sing his very best. You
know how he sings; he pouts with his big mouth
and says ugly words. He usually is like a grinning
mask. But have you seen the angel in his eyes?
An angel which seems to weep over his fall and is
filled with a holy frenzy. That evening he was only
an angel. He raised his head like one inspired by
God, and his drooping body became elastic and full
of proud vitality. Color came into his livid cheeks.
And he sang; he sang so that the notes seemed to
fly like fireflies from his lips and fill the air with
joy and dance.</p>

<p>When it grew dark they all went over to the
Grecian theatre. That was the finishing touch to
the entertainment. What did she not have to offer
there!</p>

<p>She had the Russian singer and the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
variété artists. She had the English wrestlers and
the American magician. But what was that compared
to all the rest: the silvery moonlight and the
place and its memories? Those poor people seemed
to feel like the Greeks and leaders of fashion when
they once more took their places on the stone-benches
of their own old theatre and from between
the tottering pillars looked out at the most beautiful
panorama.</p>

<p>Those poor people did not stint; they shared all
the pleasure they received. They did not spare jubilation;
there was no stopping their hand-clapping.
The performers left the platform with a wealth of
praise.</p>

<p>Some one begged the English signorina to appear.
All the adoration was meant for her. She ought to
stand face to face with it and feel it. And they
told her how intoxicating it was, how elevating,
how inflaming.</p>

<p>She liked the proposal. She immediately agreed.
She had sung in her youth, and the English never
seem to be afraid to sing. She would not have done
it if she had not been in a good mood, and she
wished to sing for those who loved her.</p>

<p>She came as the last number. Fancy what it was
to stand on such an old stage! It was where Antigone
had been buried alive and Iphigenia had been
sacrificed. The English signorina stepped forward
there to receive every conceivable honor.</p>

<p>It stormed to meet her as soon as she showed herself.
They seemed to wish to stamp the earth to
pieces to honor her.</p>

<p>It was a proud moment. She stood there with
Etna as a background and the Mediterranean as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
wings. Before her on the grass-grown benches was
sitting conquered poverty, and she felt that she had
all Diamante at her feet.</p>

<p>She chose “Bellini,” our own “Bellini.” She too
wished to be amiable and so she sang “Bellini,”
who was born here under Etna; “Bellini” whom we
know by heart, note for note.</p>

<p>Of course, O signore, of course she could not
sing. She had mounted the tribune only to receive
homage. She had come in order to let the
love of the people find an outlet. And now she
sang false and feebly. And the people knew every
note.</p>

<p>It was that mandolinista from Naples. He was
the first to grimace and to take a note as false as
that of the English signorina. Then it was the
man with the cancer, who laughed till he laughed
his neckcloth off. Then it was the donkey-boy,
who began to clap his hands.</p>

<p>Then they all began. It was madness, but that
they did not understand. It is not in the land of
the old Greeks that people can bear barbarians who
sing false. Donna Pepa and Donna Tura laughed
as they had never done before in their lives. “Not
one true note! By the Madonna and San Pasquale,
not one true note!”</p>

<p>They had eaten their fill for once in their lives.
It was natural that intoxication and madness should
take hold of them. And why should they not laugh?
She had not given them food in order to torture
their ears with files and saws. Why should they
not defend themselves by laughing? Why should
they not mimic and hiss and scream? Why should
they not lean backward and split their sides with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
laughter? They were not the English signorina’s
slaves, I suppose.</p>

<p>It was a terrible blow to her. It was too great a
blow for her to understand. Were they hissing her?
It must be something happening among them;
something that she could not see. She sang the
aria to its end. She was convinced that the laughter
was for something with which she had nothing to
do.</p>

<p>When she had finished a sort of storm of applause
roared over her. At last she understood.
Torches and the moonlight made the night so bright
that she could see the rows of people twisting with
laughter. She heard the scoffs and the jests now,
when she was not singing. They were for her.
Then she fled from the stage. It seemed to her that
Etna itself heaved with laughter, and that the sea
sparkled with merriment.</p>

<p>But it grew worse and worse. They had had such
a good time, those poor people; they had never had
such a good time before, and they wished to hear
her once again. They called for her; they cried:
“Bravo! Bis! Da capo!” They could not lose such
a pleasure. She, she was almost unconscious.
There was a storm about her. They screamed; they
roared to get her in. She saw them lift their arms
and threaten her to get her in. All at once it was
all turned into an old circus. She had to go in to
be devoured by monsters.</p>

<p>It went on; it went on; it became wilder and
wilder. The other performers were frightened and
begged her to yield. And she herself was frightened.
It looked as if they would have killed her if she did
not do what they wished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>She dragged herself on the stage and stood face
to face with the crowd. There was no pity. She
sang because they all wished to be amused. That
was the worst. She sang because she was afraid of
them and did not dare not to. She was a foreigner
and alone, and she had no one to protect her, and
she was afraid. And they laughed and laughed.</p>

<p>Screams and cries, crowing and whistling accompanied
the whole aria. No one had mercy on her.
For the first time in her life she felt the need of
mercy.</p>

<p>Well, the next day she resolved to depart. She
could not endure Diamante any longer. But when
she told the advocate, Favara, he implored her to
stay for his sake and made her an offer of marriage.</p>

<p>He had chosen his time well. She said yes, and
was married to him. But after that time she built
no more on her palaces; she made no struggle
against poverty; she cared nothing to be queen in
Diamante. Would you believe it? She never
showed herself on the street; she lived indoors like
a Sicilian.</p>

<p>Her little house stood hidden away behind a big
building, and of herself no one knew anything.
They only knew that she was quite changed. No
one knew whether she was happy or unhappy;
whether she shut herself in because she hated the
people, or because she wished to be as a Sicilian
wife ought to be.</p>

<p>Does it not always end so with a woman? When
they build their palaces they are never finished.
Women can do nothing that has permanence.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE OUTCAST</span></h3>

<p>When Donna Micaela heard how the poor people
had hooted Miss Tottenham out, she hurried to the
hotel to express her condolence. She wished to beg
her not to judge those poor creatures by what they
had done when they had been put out of their heads
with pleasure and wine. She would beg her not to
take her hand from Diamante. She herself did not
care very much for Miss Tottenham, but for the
sake of the poor&mdash;She would say anything to
pacify her.</p>

<p>When she came to the hotel Etna, she saw the
whole street filled with baggage-wagons. So there
was no hope. The great benefactress was going away.</p>

<p>Outside the hotel there was much sorrow and
despair. The two old blind women, Donna Pepa
and Donna Tura, who had always sat in the hotel
court-yard, were now shut out, and they were kneeling
before the door. The young donkey-driver, who
loved all young English ladies, stood with his face
pressed against the wall and wept.</p>

<p>Inside the hotel the landlord walked up and down
the long corridor, raging at Providence for sending
him this misfortune. “Signor Dio,” he mumbled,
“I am beggared. If you let this happen, I will take
my wife by the hand and my children in my arms
and throw myself with them down into Etna.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>The landlady was very pale and humble. She
scarcely dared to lift her eyes from the ground.
She would have liked to creep about on her knees
to prevail upon the rich signorina to remain.</p>

<p>“Do you dare to speak to her, Donna Micaela?”
she said. “May God help you to speak to her!
Alas! tell her that the Neapolitan boy, who was the
cause of the whole misfortune, has been turned out
of the town. Tell her that they all wish to make
amends. Speak to her, signora!”</p>

<p>The landlady took Donna Micaela to the Englishwoman’s
drawing-room and went in with her card.
She came back immediately and asked her to wait
a few minutes. Signorina Tottenham was having a
business talk with Signor Favara.</p>

<p>It was the very moment when the advocate Favara
asked Miss Tottenham’s hand in marriage; and
while Donna Micaela waited she heard him say
quite loud: “You must not go away, signorina!
What will become of me if you go away? I love
you; I cannot let you go. I should not have dared
to speak if you had not threatened to go away.
But now&mdash;”</p>

<p>He lowered his voice again, but Donna Micaela
would hear no more and went away. She saw that
she was superfluous. If Signor Favara could not
succeed in keeping the great benefactress, no one
could.</p>

<p>When she went out again through the gateway the
landlord was standing there quarrelling with the old
Franciscan, Fra Felice. He was so irritated that
he not only quarrelled with Fra Felice, he also
drove him from his house.</p>

<p>“Fra Felice,” he cried, “you come to make more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
trouble with our great benefactress. You will only
make her more angry. Go away, I tell you! You
wolf, you man-eater, go away!”</p>

<p>Fra Felice was quite as enraged as the landlord,
and tried to force his way past him. But then the
latter took him by the arm, and without further
notice marched him down the steps.</p>

<p>Fra Felice was a man who had received a great
gift from his Creator. In Sicily, where everybody
plays in the lottery, there are people who have the
power to foretell what numbers will win at the next
drawing. He who has such second sight is called
“polacco,” and is most often found in some old
begging monk. Fra Felice was such a monk. He
was the greatest polacco in the neighborhood of
Etna.</p>

<p>As every one wished him to tell them a winning
tern or quartern, he was always treated with great
consideration. He was not used to be taken by the
arm and be thrown into the street, Fra Felice.</p>

<p>He was nearly eighty years old and quite dried-up
and infirm. As he staggered away between the
wagons, he stumbled, trod on his cloak, and almost
fell. But none of the porters and drivers that stood
by the door talking and lamenting had time that day
to think of Fra Felice.</p>

<p>The old man tottered along in his heavy homespun
cloak. He was so thin and dry that there seemed
to be more stiffness in the cloak than in the monk.
It seemed to be the old cloak that held him up.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela caught up with him and gently
drew the old man’s arm through her own. She
could not bear to see how he struck against the
lamp-posts and fell over steps. But Fra Felice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
never noticed that she was looking after him. He
walked and mumbled and cursed, and did not know
but that he was as much alone as if he sat in his
cell.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela wondered why Fra Felice was so
angry with Miss Tottenham. Had she been out to
his monastery and taken down frescos from the
walls, or what had she done?</p>

<p>Fra Felice had lived for sixty years in the big
Franciscan monastery outside the Porta Etnea, wall
to wall with the old church San Pasquale.</p>

<p>Fra Felice had been monk there for thirty years,
when the monastery was given up and sold to a
layman. The other monks moved away, but Fra
Felice remained because he could not understand
what selling the house of San Francisco could
mean.</p>

<p>If laymen were to come there, it seemed to Fra
Felice almost more essential that at least one monk
should remain. Who else would attend to the bell-ringing,
or prepare medicines for the peasant women,
or give bread to the poor of the monastery? And
Fra Felice chose a cell in a retired corner of the
monastery, and continued to go in and out as he had
always done.</p>

<p>The merchant who owned the monastery never
visited it. He did not care about the old building;
he only wanted the vineyards belonging to it. So
Fra Felice still reigned in the old monastery, and
fastened up the fallen cornices and whitewashed
the walls. As many poor people as had received
food at the monastery in former days, still received
it. For his gift of prophecy Fra Felice got such
large alms as he wandered through the towns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Etna that he could have been a rich man; but every
bit of it went to the monastery.</p>

<p>Fra Felice had suffered an even greater grief than
for the monastery on account of the monastery
church. It had been desecrated during war, with
bloody fights and other atrocities, so that mass could
never be held there. But that he could not understand
either. The church, where he had made his
vows, was always holy to Fra Felice.</p>

<p>It was his greatest sorrow that his church had
fallen entirely into ruin. He had looked on when
Englishmen had come and bought pulpit and lectern
and choir chairs. He had not been able to prevent
collectors from Palermo coming and taking the
chandeliers and pictures and brass hooks. However
much he had wished it, he had not been able to
do anything to save his church. But he hated those
church-pillagers; and when Donna Micaela saw him
so angry, she thought that Miss Tottenham had
wished to take some of his treasures from him.</p>

<p>But the fact was that now, when Fra Felice’s
church was emptied, and no one came any more to
plunder there, he had begun to think of doing something
to embellish it once more, and he had had his
eye on the collection of images of the saints in the
possession of the rich English lady. At her entertainment,
when she had been kind and gentle towards
every one, he had dared to ask her for her beautiful
Madonna, who had a dress of velvet and eyes like
the sky. And his request had been granted.</p>

<p>That morning Fra Felice had swept and dusted
the church, and put flowers on the altar, before he
went to fetch the image. But when he came to the
hotel, the Englishwoman had changed her mind;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
she had not been at all willing to give him the
valuable Madonna. In its stead she had given him
a little ragged, dirty image of the Christchild, which
she thought she could spare without regret.</p>

<p>Ah, what joy and expectation old Fra Felice had
felt, and then had been so disappointed! He could
not be satisfied; he came back time after time to
beg for the other image. It was such a valuable
image that he could not have bought it with all that
he begged in a whole year. At last the great benefactress
had dismissed him; and it was then that
Donna Micaela had found him.</p>

<p>As they went along the street, she began to talk
to the old man and won his story from him. He
had the image with him, and right in the street he
stopped, showed it to her, and asked her if she had
ever seen a more miserable object.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela looked at the image for a moment
with stupefaction. Then she smiled and said: “Lend
me the image for a few days, Fra Felice!”</p>

<p>“You can take it and keep it,” said the old man.
“May it never come before my eyes again!”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela took the image home and worked
on it for two days. When she then sent it to Fra
Felice it shone with newly polished shoes; it had
a fresh, clean dress; it was painted, and in its crown
shone bright stones of many colors.</p>

<p>He was so beautiful, the outcast, that Fra Felice
placed him on the empty altar in his church.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was very early one morning. The sun had not
risen, and the broad sea was scarcely visible. It
was really very early. The cats were still roaming
about the roofs; no smoke rose from the chimneys;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and the mists lay and rolled about in the low valley
round the steep Monte Chiaro.</p>

<p>Old Fra Felice came running towards the town.
He ran so fast that he thought he felt the mountain
tremble beneath him. He ran so fast that the
blades of grass by the roadside had no time to
sprinkle his cloak with dew; so fast that the scorpions
had no time to lift their tails and sting him.</p>

<p>As the old man ran, his cloak flapped unfastened
about him, and his rope swung unknotted behind.
His wide sleeves waved like wings, and his heavy
hood pounded up and down on his back, as if it
wished to urge him on.</p>

<p>The man in the custom-office, who was still asleep,
woke and rubbed his eyes as Fra Felice rushed by,
but he had no time to recognize him. The pavements
were slippery with dampness; beggars lay
and slept by the high stone steps with their legs
heedlessly stretched out into the street; exhausted
domino-players were going home from the Café
reeling with sleep. But Fra Felice hastened onward
regardless of all obstructions.</p>

<p>Houses and gateways, squares and arched-over
alleys disappeared behind old Fra Felice. He ran
half-way up the Corso before he stopped.</p>

<p>He stopped in front of a big house with many
heavy balconies. He seized the door-knocker and
pounded until a servant awoke. He would not be
quiet till the servant called up a maid, and the maid
waked the signora.</p>

<p>“Donna Micaela, Fra Felice is downstairs. He
insists on speaking to you.”</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela at last came down to Fra
Felice, he was still panting and breathless, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
there was a fire in his eyes, and little pale roses in
his cheeks.</p>

<p>It was the image, the image. When Fra Felice
had rung the four-o’clock matins that morning he
had gone into the church to look at him.</p>

<p>Then he had discovered that big stones had loosened
from the dome just over the image. They had
fallen on the altar and broken it to pieces, but the
image had stood untouched. And none of the plaster
and dust that had tumbled down had fallen on the
image; it was quite uninjured.</p>

<p>Fra Felice took Donna Micaela’s hand and told
her that she must go with him to the church and
see the miracle. She should see it before any one,
because she had taken care of the image.</p>

<p>And Donna Micaela went with him through the
gray, chilly morning to his monastery, while her
heart throbbed with eagerness and expectation.</p>

<p>When she arrived and saw that Fra Felice had
told the truth, she said to him that she had recognized
the image as soon as she had caught sight of
it, and that she knew that it could work miracles.
“He is the greatest and gentlest of miracle-workers,”
she said.</p>

<p>Fra Felice went up to the image and looked into
its eyes. For there is a great difference in images,
and the wisdom of an old monk is needed to understand
which has power and which has not. Now
Fra Felice saw that this image’s eyes were deep and
glowing, as if they had life; and that on its lips
hovered a mysterious smile.</p>

<p>Then old Fra Felice fell on his knees and stretched
his clasped hands towards the image, and his old
shrivelled face was lighted by a great joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed to Fra Felice all at once as if the walls
of his church were covered with pictures and purple
hangings; candles shone on the altar; song sounded
from the gallery; and the whole floor was covered
with kneeling, praying people.</p>

<p>All imaginary glory would fall to the lot of his
poor old church, now that it possessed one of the
great miracle-working images.</p>

<h3 id="II_IV">IV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE OLD MARTYRDOM</span></h3>

<p>From the summer-palace in Diamante many letters
were sent during that time to Gaetano Alagona, who
was in prison in Como. But the letter-carrier never
had a letter in his bag from Gaetano addressed to the
summer-palace.</p>

<p>For Gaetano had gone into his life-long imprisonment
as if it had been a grave. The only thing he
asked or desired was that it should give him the
grave’s forgetfulness and peace.</p>

<p>He felt as if he were dead; and he said to himself
that he did not wish to hear the laments and wails
of the survivors. Nor did he wish to be deceived
with hopes, or be tempted by tender words to long
for family and friends. Nor did he wish to hear
anything of what was happening in the world, when
he had no power to take part and to lead.</p>

<p>He found work in the prison, and carved beautiful
works of art, as he had always done. But he never
would receive a letter, nor a visitor. He thought
that in that way he could cease to feel the bitterness
of his misfortunes. He believed that he would be
able to teach himself to live a whole life within four
narrow walls.</p>

<p>And for that reason Donna Micaela never had a
word of answer from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally she wrote to the director of the prison
and asked if Gaetano was still alive. He answered
that the prisoner she asked about never read a letter.
He had asked to be spared all communications from
the outside world.</p>

<p>So she wrote no more. Instead she continued to
work for her railway. She hardly dared to speak of
it in Diamante, but nevertheless she thought of nothing
else. She herself sewed and embroidered, and
she had all her servants make little cheap things
that she could sell at her bazaar. In the shop she
looked up old wares for the tombola. She had
Piero, the gate-keeper, prepare colored lanterns; she
persuaded her father to paint signs and placards;
and she had her maid, Lucia, who was from Capri,
arrange coral necklaces and shell boxes.</p>

<p>She was not at all sure that even one person would
come to her entertainment. Every one was against
her; no one would help her. They did not even
like her to show herself on the streets or to talk
business. It was not fitting for a well-born lady.</p>

<p>Old Fra Felice tried to assist her, for he loved
her because she had helped him with the image.</p>

<p>One day, when Donna Micaela was lamenting that
she could not persuade any one that the people
ought to build the railway, he lifted his cap from
his head and pointed to his bald temples.</p>

<p>“Look at me, Donna Micaela,” he said. “So
bald will that railway make your head if you go on
as you have begun.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Fra Felice?”</p>

<p>“Donna Micaela,” said the old man, “would it
not be folly to start on a dangerous undertaking
without having a friend and helper?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have tried enough to find friends, Fra Felice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, men!” said the old man. “But how do
men help? If any one is going fishing, Donna
Micaela, he knows that he must call on San Pietro;
if any one wishes to buy a horse, he can ask help of
San Antonio Abbate. But if I want to pray for
your railway, I do not know to whom I shall turn.”</p>

<p>Fra Felice meant that the trouble was that she
had chosen no patron saint for her railway. He
wished her to choose the crowned child that stood
out in his old church as its first friend and promoter.
He told her that if she only did that she would certainly
be helped.</p>

<p>She was so touched that any one was willing to
stand by her that she instantly promised to pray for
her railway to the child at San Pasquale.</p>

<p>Fra Felice got a big collection-box and painted
on it in bright, distinct letters: “Gifts for the Etna
Railway,” and he hung it in his church beside the
altar.</p>

<p>It was not more than a day after that that Don
Antonio Greco’s wife, Donna Emilia, came out to
the old, deserted church to consult San Pasquale,
who is the wisest of all the saints.</p>

<p>During the autumn Don Antonio’s theatre had
begun to fare ill, as was to be expected when no
one had any money.</p>

<p>Don Antonio thought to run the theatre with less
expense than before. He had cut off a couple of
lamps and did not have such big and gorgeously
painted play-bills.</p>

<p>But that had been great folly. It is not at the
moment when people are losing their desire to go to
the theatre that it will answer to shorten the princesses’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
silk trains and economize on the gilding of
the king’s crowns.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not so dangerous at another theatre,
but at a marionette theatre it is a risk to make any
changes, because it is chiefly half-grown boys who
go to the marionette theatre. Big people can understand
that sometimes it is necessary to economize,
but children always wish to have things in the same
way.</p>

<p>Fewer and fewer spectators came to Don Antonio,
and he went on economizing and saving. Then it
occurred to him that he could dispense with the
two blind violin-players, Father Elia and Brother
Tommaso, who also used to play during the interludes
and in the battle-scenes.</p>

<p>Those blind men, who earned so much by singing
in houses of mourning, and who took in vast sums
on feast-days, were expensive. Don Antonio dismissed
them and got a hand-organ.</p>

<p>That caused his ruin. All the apprentices and
shop-boys in Diamante ceased to go to the theatre.
They would not sit and listen to a hand-organ. They
promised one another not to go to the theatre till
Don Antonio had taken back the fiddlers, and they
kept their promise. Don Antonio’s dolls had to
perform to empty walls.</p>

<p>The young boys who otherwise would rather go
without their supper than the theatre, stayed away
night after night. They were convinced that they
could force Don Antonio to arrange everything as
before.</p>

<p>But Don Antonio comes of a family of artists.
His father and his brother have marionette theatres;
his brothers-in-law, all his relations are of the profession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
And Don Antonio understands his art.
He can change his voice indefinitely; he can manœuvre
at the same time a whole army of dolls; and he
knows by heart the whole cycle of plays founded on
the chronicles of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>And now Don Antonio’s artistic feelings were hurt.
He would not be forced to take back the blind men.
He wished to have the people come to his theatre
for his sake, and not for that of the musicians.</p>

<p>He changed his tactics and began to play big
dramas with elaborate mountings. But it was futile.</p>

<p>There is a play called “The Death of the Paladin,”
which treats of Roland’s fight at Ronceval. It
requires so much machinery that a puppet theatre
has to be kept shut for two days for it to be set up.
It is so dear to the public that it is generally played
for double price and to full houses for a whole month.
Don Antonio now had that play mounted, but he
did not need to play it; he had no spectators.</p>

<p>After that his spirit was broken. He tried to
get Father Elia and Brother Tommaso back, but
they now knew what their value was to him.</p>

<p>They demanded such a price that it would have
been ruin to pay them. It was impossible to come
to any agreement.</p>

<p>In the small rooms back of the marionette theatre
they lived as in a besieged fortress. They had
nothing else to do but to starve.</p>

<p>Donna Emilia and Don Antonio were both gay
young people, but now they never laughed. They
were in great want, but Don Antonio was a proud
man, and he could not bear to think that his art no
longer had the power to draw.</p>

<p>So, as I said, Donna Emilia went down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
church of San Pasquale to ask the saint for good
advice. It had been her intention to repeat nine
prayers to the great stone-image standing outside of
the church, and then to go; but before she had
begun to pray she had noticed that the church-door
stood open. “Why is San Pasquale’s church-door
open?” said Donna Emilia. “That has never happened
in my time,”&mdash;and she went into the church.</p>

<p>The only thing to be seen there was Fra Felice’s
beloved image and the big collection-box. The
image looked so beautiful in his crown and his
rings that Donna Emilia was tempted forward to
him, but when she came near enough to look into
his eyes, he seemed to her so tender and so cheering
that she knelt down before him and prayed.
She promised that if he would help her and Don
Antonio in their need, she would put the receipts
of a whole evening in the big box that hung beside
him.</p>

<p>After her prayers were over, Donna Emilia concealed
herself behind the church-door, and tried to
catch what the passers-by were saying. For if the
image was willing to help her, he would let her hear
a word which would tell her what to do.</p>

<p>She had not stood there two minutes before old
Assunta of the Cathedral steps passed by with
Donna Pepa and Donna Tura. And she heard
Assunta say in her solemn voice: “That was the
year when I heard ‘The Old Martyrdom’ for the
first time.” Donna Emilia heard quite distinctly.
Assunta really said “The Old Martyrdom.”</p>

<p>Donna Emilia thought that she would never
reach her home. It was as if her legs could not
carry her fast enough, and the distance increased as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
she ran. When she finally saw the corner of the
theatre with the red lanterns under the roof and the
big illustrated play-bills, she felt as if she had gone
many miles.</p>

<p>When she came in to Don Antonio, he sat with
his big head leaning on his hand and stared at the
table. It was terrible to see Don Antonio. In
those last weeks he had begun to lose his hair; on
the very top of his head it was so thin that the skin
shone through. Was it strange, when he was in
such trouble? While she had been away he had
taken all his puppets out and inspected them. He
did that now every day. He used to sit and look at
the puppet that played Armida. Was she no longer
beautiful and beguiling? he would ask. And he
tried to polish up Roland’s sword and Charlemagne’s
crown. Donna Emilia saw that he had gilded the
emperor’s crown again; it was for at least the fifth
time. But then he had stopped in the midst of his
work and had sat down to brood. He had noticed it
himself. It was not gilding that was lacking; it
was an idea.</p>

<p>As Donna Emilia came into the room, she
stretched out her hands to her husband.</p>

<p>“Look at me, Don Antonio Greco,” she said.
“I bear in my hands golden bowls full of ripe figs!”</p>

<p>And she told how she had prayed, and what she
had vowed, and what she had been advised.</p>

<p>When she said that to Don Antonio, he sprang
up. His arms fell stiffly beside his body, and his
hair raised itself from his head. He was seized
with an unspeakable terror. “‘The Old Martyrdom’!”
he screamed, “‘The Old Martyrdom’!”</p>

<p>For “The Old Martyrdom” is a miracle-play,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
which in its time was given in all Sicily. It drove
out all other oratorios and mysteries, and was played
every year in every town for two centuries. It was
the greatest day of the year, when “The Old
Martyrdom” was performed. But now it is never
played; now it only lives in the people’s memory as
a legend.</p>

<p>In the old days it was also played in the marionette
theatres. But now it has come to be considered
old-fashioned and out-of-date. It has probably not
been played for thirty years.</p>

<p>Don Antonio began to roar and scream at Donna
Emilia, because she tortured him with such folly.
He struggled with her as with a demon, who had
come to seize him. It was amazing; it was heartrending,
he said. How could she get hold of such
a word? But Donna Emilia stood quiet and let him
rave. She only said that what she had heard was
God’s will.</p>

<p>Soon Don Antonio began to be uncertain. The
great idea gradually took possession of him. Nothing
had ever been so loved and played in Sicily,
and did not the same people still live on the noble
isle? Did they not love the same earth, the same
mountains, the same skies as their forefathers had
loved? Why should they not also love “The Old
Martyrdom”?</p>

<p>He resisted as long as he could. He said to
Donna Emilia that it would cost too much. Where
could he get apostles with long hair and beards?
He had no table for the Last Supper; he had none of
the machinery required for the entry, and carrying of
the cross.</p>

<p>But Donna Emilia saw that he was going to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
in, and before night he actually went to Fra Felice
and renewed her vow to put the receipts of one
evening in the box of the little image, if it proved
to be good advice.</p>

<p>Fra Felice told Donna Micaela about the vow,
and she was glad, and at the same time anxious how
it would turn out.</p>

<p>Through all the town it was known that Don
Antonio was mounting “The Old Martyrdom,” and
every one laughed at him. Don Antonio had lost
his mind.</p>

<p>The people would have liked well enough to see
“The Old Martyrdom,” if they could have seen it as
it was played in former days. They would have
liked to see it given as in Aci, where the noblemen
of the town played the kings and the servants,
and the artisans took the parts of the Jews
and the apostles; and where so many scenes from
the Old Testament were added that the spectacle
lasted the whole day.</p>

<p>They would have also liked to see those wonderful
days in Castelbuoco, when the whole town was
transformed into Jerusalem. There the mystery
was given so that Jesus came riding to the town,
and was met with palms at the town-gate. There
the church represented the temple at Jerusalem and
the town-hall Pilate’s palace. There Peter warmed
himself at a fire in the priest’s court-yard; the crucifixion
took place on a mountain above the town; and
Mary looked for the body of her son in the grottoes
of the syndic’s garden.</p>

<p>When the people had such things in their memory
how could they be content to see the great mystery
in Don Antonio’s theatre?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>But in spite of everything, Don Antonio worked
with the greatest eagerness to prepare the actors and
to arrange the elaborate machinery.</p>

<p>And behold, in a few days came Master Battista,
who painted placards, and presented him with a
play-bill. He had been glad to hear that Don
Antonio was going to play “The Old Martyrdom;”
he had seen it in his youth, and had great pleasure
in it.</p>

<p>So there now stood in large letters on the corner
of the theatre: “‘The Old Martyrdom’ or ‘The
Resurrected Adam,’ tragedy in three acts by Cavaliere
Filippo Orioles.”</p>

<p>Don Antonio wondered and wondered what the
people’s mood would be. The donkey-boys and
apprentices who passed by his theatre read the
notice with scoffs and derision. It looked very
black for Don Antonio, but in spite of it he went
on faithfully with his work.</p>

<p>When the appointed evening came, and the
“Martyrdom” was to be played, no one was more
anxious than Donna Micaela. “Is the little image
going to help me?” she asked herself incessantly.</p>

<p>She sent out her maid, Lucia, to look about.
Were there any groups of boys in front of the
theatre? Did it look as if there were going to be a
crowd? Lucia might go to Donna Emilia, sitting
in the ticket-office, and ask her if it looked hopeful.</p>

<p>But when Lucia came back she had not the
slightest hope to offer. There was no crowd outside
the theatre. The boys had resolved to crush
Don Antonio.</p>

<p>Towards eight o’clock Donna Micaela could no
longer endure sitting at home and waiting. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
persuaded her father to go with her to the theatre.
She knew well that a signora had never set her foot
in Don Antonio’s theatre, but she needed to see
how it was going to be. It would be such a dizzily
great success for her railway if Don Antonio
succeeded.</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela came to the theatre it was
a few minutes before eight, and Donna Emilia had
not sold a ticket.</p>

<p>But she was not depressed; “Go in, Donna Micaela!”
she said; “we shall play at any rate, it is
so beautiful. Don Antonio will play it for you and
your father and me. It is the most beautiful thing
he has ever performed.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela came into the little hall. It was
hung with black, as the big theatres always were in
the old days when “The Old Martyrdom” was given.
There were dark, silver-fringed curtains on the
stage, and the little benches were covered with
black.</p>

<p>Immediately after Donna Micaela came in, Don
Antonio’s bushy eyebrows appeared in a little hole
in the curtain. “Donna Micaela,” he cried, as
Donna Emilia had done, “we shall play at any rate.
It is so beautiful, it needs no spectators.”</p>

<p>Just then came Donna Emilia herself, and opened
the door, and courtesying, held it back. It was the
priest, Don Matteo, who entered.</p>

<p>“What do you say to me, Donna Micaela?” he
said, laughing. “But you understand; it is ‘The
Old Martyrdom.’ I saw it in my youth at the big
opera in Palermo; and I believe that it was that old
play that made me become a priest.”</p>

<p>The next time the door opened it was Father Elia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and Brother Tommaso, who came with their violins
under their arms and felt their way to their usual
places, as quietly as if they had never had any disagreement
with Don Antonio.</p>

<p>The door opened again. It was an old woman
from the alley above the house of the little Moor.
She was dressed in black, and made the sign of the
cross as she came in.</p>

<p>After her came four, five other old women; and
Donna Micaela looked at them almost resentfully,
as they gradually filled the theatre. She knew that
Don Antonio would not be satisfied till he had his
own public back again,&mdash;till he had his self-willed,
beloved boys to play for.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a hurricane or thunder. The
doors flew open,&mdash;all at the same time! It was the
boys. They threw themselves down in their usual
places, as if they had come back to their home.</p>

<p>They looked at one another, a little ashamed.
But it had been impossible for them to see one old
woman after another go into their theatre to see
what was being played for them. It had been quite
impossible to see the whole street full of old distaff-spinners
in slow procession toward the theatre, and
so they had rushed in.</p>

<p>But hardly had the gay young people reached their
places before they noticed that they had come under
a severe master. Ah, “The Old Martyrdom,” “The
Old Martyrdom!”</p>

<p>It was not given as in Aci and in Castelbuoco;
it was not played as at the opera in Palermo; it was
only played with miserable marionettes with immovable
faces and stiff bodies; but the old play had not
lost its power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Donna Micaela noticed it already in the second
act during the Last Supper. The boys began to
hate Judas. They shouted threats and insults at
him.</p>

<p>As the story of the Passion went on, they laid
aside their hats and clasped their hands. They sat
quite still, with their beautiful brown eyes turned
towards the stage. Now and then a few tears
dropped. Now and then a fist was clenched in
indignation.</p>

<p>Don Antonio spoke with tears in his voice; Donna
Emilia was on her knees at the entrance. Don
Matteo looked with a gentle smile at the little puppets
and remembered the wonderful spectacle in
Palermo that had made him a priest.</p>

<p>But when Jesus was cast into prison and tortured,
the young people were ashamed of themselves.
They too had hated and persecuted. They were
like those pharisees, like those Romans. It was a
shame to think of it. Could Don Antonio forgive
them?</p>

<h3 id="II_V">V<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LADY WITH THE IRON RING</span></h3>

<p>Donna Micaela often thought of a poor little
dressmaker whom she had seen in her youth in
Catania. She dwelt in the house next to the Palazzo
Palmeri, sitting always in the gateway with her
work, so that Donna Micaela had seen her a thousand
times. She always sat and sang, and she had
certainly only known a single canzone. Always,
always she sang the same song.</p>

<p>“I have cut a curl from my black hair,” she had
sung. “I have unfastened my black, shining braids,
and cut a curl from my hair. I have done it to
gladden my friend, who is in trouble. Alas, my
beloved is sitting in prison; my beloved will never
again twine my hair about his fingers. I have sent
him a lock of my hair to remind him of the silken
chains that never more will bind him.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela remembered the song well. It
seemed as if it had sounded through all her childhood
to warn her of the suffering that awaited
her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Donna Micaela often sat at that time on the stone
steps of the church of San Pasquale. She saw wonderful
events take place far off on that Etna so rich
in legends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Over the black lava glided a railway train on
newly laid shining rails. It was a festival train;
flags waved along the road; there were wreaths
on the carriages; the seats were covered with purple
cushions. At the stations the people stood and
shouted: “Long live the king! long live the queen!
long live the new railway!”</p>

<p>She heard it so well; she herself was on the train.
Ah, how honored, how honored she was! She was
summoned before the king and queen; and they
thanked her for the new railway. “Ask a favor of
us, princess!” said the king, giving her the title
that the ladies of the race of Alagona had formerly
borne.</p>

<p>“Sire,” she answered, as people answer in stories,
“give freedom to the last Alagona!”</p>

<p>And it was granted to her. The king could not
say no to a prayer from her who had built that fine
railway, which was to give riches to all Etna.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Donna Micaela lifted her arm so that her
dress-sleeve slid up, one saw that she wore as a
bracelet a ring of rusty iron. She had found it in
the street, forced it over her hand, and now she
always wore it. Whenever she happened to see
or touch it, she grew pale, and her eyes no longer
saw anything of the world about her. She saw a
prison like that of Foscari in the doge’s palace in
Venice. It was a dark, narrow, cellar-like hole;
light filtered in through a grated aperture; and from
the wall hung a great bunch of chains, which wound
like serpents round the prisoner’s legs and arms and
neck.</p>

<p>May the saint work a miracle! May the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
work! May she herself soon have such praise that
she can beg freedom for her prisoner! He will
die if she does not hurry. May the iron ring eat
incessantly into her arm, so that she shall not forget
him for a second.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_VI">VI<br />
<span class="smaller">FRA FELICE’S LEGACY</span></h3>

<p>When Donna Emilia opened the ticket-office to sell
tickets for the second performance of “The Old
Martyrdom,” the people stood in line to get places;
the second evening the theatre was so overcrowded
that people fainted in the crush, and the third evening
people came from both Adernó and Paternó to
see the beloved tragedy. Don Antonio foresaw
that he would be able to play it a whole month
for double price, and with two performances every
evening.</p>

<p>How happy they were, he and Donna Emilia,
and with what joy and gratitude they laid twenty-five
lire in the collection-box of the little image!</p>

<p>In Diamante the incident caused great surprise,
and many came to Donna Elisa to find out if she
believed that the saint wished them to support
Donna Micaela.</p>

<p>“Have you heard, Donna Elisa,” they said, “that
Don Antonio Greco has been helped by the Christchild
in San Pasquale, because he promised to give
the receipts of one evening to Donna Micaela’s
railway?”</p>

<p>But when they asked Donna Elisa about it, she
shut her mouth and looked as if she could not think
of anything but her embroidery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Fra Felice himself came in and told her of the
two miracles the image had already worked.</p>

<p>“Signorina Tottenham was very stupid to let the
image go, if it is such a miracle-worker,” said Donna
Elisa.</p>

<p>So they all thought. Signorina Tottenham had
owned the image many years, and she had not
noticed anything. It probably could not work
miracles; it was only a coincidence.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that Donna Elisa would not
believe. She was the only one of the old Alagonas
left in Diamante, and the people followed her, more
than they themselves knew. If Donna Elisa had
believed, the whole town would have helped Donna
Micaela.</p>

<p>But Donna Elisa could not believe that God and
the saints wished to aid her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>She had watched her since the festival of San
Sebastiano. Whenever any one spoke of Gaetano,
she turned pale, and looked very troubled. Her
features became like those of a sinful man, when he
is racked with the pangs of conscience.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa sat and thought of it one morning,
and it was so engrossing that she let her needle rest.
“Donna Micaela is no Etna woman,” she said to
herself. “She is on the side of the government;
she is glad that Gaetano is in prison.”</p>

<p>Out in the street at that same moment people
came carrying a great stretcher. On it lay heaped
up a mass of church ornaments; chandeliers and
shrines and reliquaries. Donna Elisa looked up
for a moment, then returned to her thoughts.</p>

<p>“She would not let me adorn the house of the
Alagonas on the festival of San Sebastiano,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
thought. “She did not wish the saint to help
Gaetano.”</p>

<p>Two men came by dragging a rattling dray on
which lay a mountain of red hangings, richly embroidered
stoles, and altar pictures in broad, gilded
frames.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa struck out with her hand as if to
push away all doubts. It could not be an actual
miracle which had happened. The saint must
know that Diamante could not afford to build a
railway.</p>

<p>People now came past driving a yellow cart,
packed full of music-stands, prayer-books, praying-desks
and confessionals.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa woke up. She looked out between
the rosaries that hung in garlands over the window
panes. That was the third load of church furnishings
that had passed. Was Diamante being plundered?
Had the Saracens come to the town?</p>

<p>She went to the door to see better. Again came
a stretcher, and on it lay mourning-wreaths of tin,
tablets with long inscriptions, and coats of arms,
such as are hung up in churches in memory of the
dead.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa asked the bearers, and learned what
was happening. They were clearing out the church
of Santa Lucia in Gesù. The syndic and the town
council had ordered it turned into a theatre.</p>

<p>After the uprising there had been a new syndic
in Diamante. He was a young man from Rome,
who did not know the town, but nevertheless wished
to do something for it. He had proposed to the
town-council that Diamante should have a theatre
like Taormina and other towns. They could quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
easily fit up one of the churches as a play-house.
They certainly had more than enough, with five
town churches and seven monastery churches; they
could easily spare one of them.</p>

<p>There was for instance the Jesuits’ church, Santa
Lucia in Gesù. The monastery surrounding it was
already changed to a barracks, and the church was
practically deserted. It would make an excellent
theatre.</p>

<p>That was what the new syndic had proposed, and
the town-council had agreed to it.</p>

<p>When Donna Elisa heard what was going on she
threw on her mantilla and veil, and hurried to the
Lucia church, with the same haste with which one
hurries to the house where one knows that some one
is dying.</p>

<p>“What will become of the blind?” thought Donna
Elisa. “How can they live without Santa Lucia in
Gesù?”</p>

<p>When Donna Elisa reached the silent little
square, round which the Jesuits’ long, ugly monastery
is built, she saw on the broad stone steps that
extend the whole length of the church front, a row
of ragged children and rough-haired dogs. All of
them were leaders of the blind, and they cried and
whined as loud as they could.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you all?” asked Donna
Elisa. “They want to take our church away from
us,” wailed the children. And thereupon all the
dogs howled more piteously than ever, for the dogs
of the blind are almost human.</p>

<p>At the church-door Donna Elisa met Master
Pamphilio’s wife, Donna Concetta. “Ah, Donna
Elisa,” she said, “never in all your life have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
seen anything so terrible. You had better not
go in.”</p>

<p>But Donna Elisa went on.</p>

<p>In the church at first she saw nothing but a white
cloud of dust. But hammer-strokes thundered
through the cloud, for some workmen were busy
breaking away a big stone knight, lying in a window
niche.</p>

<p>“Lord God!” said Donna Elisa, and clasped her
hands together; “they are tearing down Sor Arrigo!”
And she thought how tranquilly he had lain in his
niche. Every time she had seen him she had wished
that she might be as remote from disturbance and
change as old Sor Arrigo.</p>

<p>In the church of Lucia there was still another big
monument. It represented an old Jesuit, lying on
a black marble sarcophagus with a scourge in his
hand and his cap drawn far down over his forehead.
He was called Father Succi, and the people used to
frighten their children with him in Diamante.</p>

<p>“Would they also dare to touch Father Succi?”
thought Donna Elisa. She felt her way through the
plaster dust to the choir, where the sarcophagus
stood, in order to see if they had dared to move the
old Jesuit.</p>

<p>Father Succi still lay on his stone bed. He lay
there dark and hard, as he had been in life; and one
could almost believe that he was still alive. Had
there been doctors and tables with medicine-bottles
and burning candles beside the bed, one would have
believed that Father Succi lay sick in the choir of
his church, waiting for his last hour.</p>

<p>The blind sat round about him, like members of
the family who gather round a dying man, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
rocked their bodies in silent grief. There were both
the women from the hotel court-yard, Donna Pepa
and Donna Tura; there was old Mother Saraedda,
who ate the bread of charity at the house of the
Syndic Voltaro; there were blind beggars, blind
singers, blind of all ages and conditions. All the
blind of Diamante were there, and in Diamante
there is an incredible number who no longer see the
light of the sun.</p>

<p>They all sat silent most of the time, but every
now and then one of them burst into a wail. Sometimes
one of them felt his way forward to the monk,
Father Succi, and threw himself weeping aloud
across him.</p>

<p>It made it all the more like a death-bed that the
priest and Father Rossi from the Franciscan monastery
were there and were trying to comfort the
despairing people.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa was much moved. Ah, so often she
had seen those people happy in her garden, and
now to meet them in such misery! They had won
pleasant tears from her when they had sung mourning-songs
over her husband, Signor Antonelli, and
over her brother, Don Ferrante. She could not bear
to see them in such need.</p>

<p>Old Mother Saraedda began to speak to Donna
Elisa.</p>

<p>“I knew nothing when I came, Donna Elisa,” said
the old woman. “I left my dog outside on the
steps and went in through the church door. Then
I stretched out my arm to push aside the curtain
over the door, but the curtain was gone. I put
my foot down as if there were a step to mount before
the threshold, but there was no step. I stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
out my hand to take the holy water; I courtesied as I
went by the high altar; and I listened for the little
bell that always rings when Father Rossi comes to
the mass. Donna Elisa, there was no holy water,
no altar, no bell; there was nothing!”</p>

<p>“Poor thing, poor thing,” said Donna Elisa.</p>

<p>“Then I hear how they are hammering and pounding
up in a window. ‘What are you doing with
Sor Arrigo?’ I cry, for I hear instantly that it is
in Sor Arrigo’s window.</p>

<p>“‘We are going to carry him away,’ they answer
me.</p>

<p>“Just then the priest, Don Matteo, comes to me,
takes me by the hand, and explains everything.
And I am almost angry with the priest when he says
that it is for a theatre. They want our church for
a theatre!</p>

<p>“‘Where is Father Succi?’ I say instantly. ‘Is
Father Succi still here?’ And he leads me to
Father Succi. He has to lead me, for I cannot find
my way. Since they have taken away all the chairs
and praying-desks and carpets and platforms and
folding steps, I cannot find my way. Before, I
found my way about here as well as you.”</p>

<p>“The priest will find you another church,” said
Donna Elisa. “Donna Elisa,” said the old woman,
“what are you saying? You might as well say
that the priest can give us sight. Can Don Matteo
give us a church where we see, as we saw in
this? None of us needed a guide here. There,
Donna Elisa, stood an altar; the flowers on it
were red as Etna at sunset, and we saw it. We
counted sixteen wax-lights over the high altar on
Sundays, and thirty on festival days. We could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
when Father Rossi held the mass here. What shall
we do in another church, Donna Elisa? There we
shall not be able to see anything. They have extinguished
the light of our eyes anew.”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa’s heart grew as warm as if molten
lava had run over it. It was certainly a great wrong
they were doing to those blind unfortunates.</p>

<p>So Donna Elisa went over to Don Matteo.</p>

<p>“Your Reverence,” she said, “have you spoken
to the syndic?”</p>

<p>“Alas, alas, Donna Elisa,” said Don Matteo, “it
is better for you to try to talk to him than for me.”</p>

<p>“Your Reverence, the syndic is a stranger; perhaps
he has not heard of the blind.”</p>

<p>“Signor Voltaro has been to him; Father Rossi
has been to him; and I too, I too. He answers
nothing but that he cannot change what is decided
in the town Junta. We all know, Donna Elisa,
that the town Junta cannot take back anything. If
it has decided that your cat shall hold mass in the
Cathedral, it cannot change it.”</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a movement in the church.
A large blind man came in. “Father Elia!” the
people whispered, “Father Elia!”</p>

<p>Father Elia was the head man of the company of
blind singers, who always collected there. He had
long white hair and beard, and was beautiful as one
of the holy patriarchs.</p>

<p>He, like all the others, went forward to Father
Succi. He sat down beside him, and leaned his
head against the coffin.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa went up to Father Elia and spoke to
him. “Father Elia,” she said, “<em>you</em> ought to go to
the syndic.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man recognized Donna Elisa’s voice, and
he answered her, in his thick, old-man’s tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that I have waited to have you
say that to me? Don’t you know that my first
thought was to go to the syndic?”</p>

<p>He spoke with such a hard and distinct voice that
the workmen stopped hammering and listened,
thinking some one had begun to preach.</p>

<p>“I told him that we blind singers are a company,
and that the Jesuits opened their church for us more
than three hundred years ago, and gave us the right
to gather here to select new members and try new
songs.</p>

<p>“And I said to him that there are thirty of us in
the company; and that the holy Lucia is our patroness;
and that we never sing in the streets, only in
courts and in rooms; and that we sing legends of
the saints and mourning-songs, but never a wanton
song; and that the Jesuit, Father Succi, opened
the church for us, because the blind are Our Lord’s
singers.</p>

<p>“I told him that some of us are <i lang="it">recitatori</i>, who
can sing the old songs, but others are <i lang="it">trovatori</i>, who
compose new ones. I said to him that we give
pleasure to many on the noble isle. I asked him
why he wished to deprive us of life. For the homeless
cannot live.</p>

<p>“I said to him that we wander from town to town
through all Etna, but the church of Lucia is our
home, and mass is held here for us every morning.
Why should he refuse us the comfort of God’s word?</p>

<p>“I told him that the Jesuits once changed their
attitude towards us and wished to drive us away
from their church, but they did not succeed. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
received a letter from the Viceroy that we might
hold our meetings in perpetuity in Santa Lucia in
Gesù. And I showed him the letter.”</p>

<p>“What did he answer?”</p>

<p>“He laughed at me.”</p>

<p>“Can none of the other gentlemen help you?”</p>

<p>“I have been to them, Donna Elisa. All the
morning I have been sent from Herod to Pilatus.”</p>

<p>“Father Elia,” said Donna Elisa with lowered
voice, “have you forgotten to call on the saints?”</p>

<p>“I have called on both the black Madonna and
San Sebastiano and Santa Lucia. I have prayed to
as many as I could name.”</p>

<p>“Do you think, Father Elia,” said Donna Elisa,
and lowered her voice still more, “that Don Antonio
Greco was helped, because he promised money to
Donna Micaela’s railway?”</p>

<p>“I have no money to give,” said the old man,
disconsolately.</p>

<p>“Still, you ought to think of it, Father Elia,”
said Donna Elisa, “since you are in such straits.
You ought to try if, by promising the Christ-image
that you yourself and all who belong to your company
will speak and sing of the railway, and persuade
people to give contributions to it, you may
keep your church. We do not know if it can help,
but one ought to try every possible thing, Father
Elia. It costs nothing to promise.”</p>

<p>“I will promise anything for your sake,” said the
old man.</p>

<p>He laid his old blind head again against the black
coffin, and Donna Elisa understood that he had
given the promise in his desire to be left in peace
with his sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shall I present your vow to the Christ-image?”
she said.</p>

<p>“Do as you will, Donna Elisa,” said the old
man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That same day old Fra Felice had risen at five
o’clock in the morning and begun to sweep out his
church. He felt quite active and well; but while
he was working it seemed as if San Pasquale, sitting
with his bag of stones outside the church-door,
had something to say to him. He went out, but
there was nothing the matter with San Pasquale;
quite the contrary. Just then the sun glided up from
behind Etna, and down the dark mountain-sides the
rays came hurrying, many-colored as harp-strings.
When the rays reached Fra Felice’s old church
they turned it rosy red; rosy red were also the old
barbaric pillars that held up the canopy over the
image, and San Pasquale with his bag of stones,
and Fra Felice himself. “We look like young
boys,” thought the old man; “we have still long
years to live.”</p>

<p>But as he was going back into the church, he
felt a sharp pressure at his heart, and it came into
his mind that San Pasquale had called him out to
say farewell. At the same time his legs became so
heavy that he could hardly move them. He felt no
pain, but a weariness which could mean nothing
but death. He was scarcely able to put his broom
away behind the door of the sacristy; then he
dragged himself up the choir, lay down on the platform
in front of the high altar, and wrapped his
cloak about him.</p>

<p>The Christ-image seemed to nod to him and say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
“Now I need you, Fra Felice.” He lay and nodded
back: “I am ready; I shall not fail you.”</p>

<p>It was only to lie and wait; and it was beautiful,
Fra Felice thought. He had never before in all his
life had time to feel how tired he was. Now at last
he might rest. The image would keep up the church
and the monastery without him.</p>

<p>He lay and smiled at the thought that old San Pasquale
had called him out to say good-morning to him.</p>

<p>Fra Felice lay thus till late in the day, and dozed
most of the time. No one was with him, and a feeling
came over him that it would not do to creep in
this way out of life. It was as if he had cheated
somebody of something. That woke him time after
time. He ought of course to get the priests, but he
had no one to send for them.</p>

<p>While he lay there he thought that he shrank
together more and more. Every time he awoke he
thought that he had grown smaller. He felt as if
he were quite disappearing. Now he could certainly
wind his cloak four times about him.</p>

<p>He would have died quite by himself if Donna
Elisa had not come to ask help for the blind of the
little image. She was in a strange mood when she
came, for she wished of course to get help for the
blind, but yet she did not wish Donna Micaela’s
plans to be promoted.</p>

<p>When she came into the church she saw Fra
Felice lying on the platform under the altar, and
she went forward and knelt beside him.</p>

<p>Fra Felice turned his eyes towards her and smiled
quietly. “I am going to die,” he said, hoarsely;
but he corrected himself and said: “I am permitted
to die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Donna Elisa asked what the matter was, and said
that she would fetch help.</p>

<p>“Sit down here,” he said, and made a feeble
attempt to wipe away the dust on the platform with
his sleeve.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa said that she wished to fetch the
priests and sisters of charity.</p>

<p>He seized her skirt and held her back.</p>

<p>“I want to speak to you first, Donna Elisa.”</p>

<p>It was hard for him to talk, and he breathed
heavily after each word. Donna Elisa sat down
beside him and waited.</p>

<p>He lay for a while and panted; then a flush rose
to his cheeks; his eyes began to shine, and he spoke
with ease and eagerness.</p>

<p>“Donna Elisa,” said Fra Felice, “I have a legacy
to give away. It has troubled me all day. I do
not know to whom I shall give it.”</p>

<p>“Fra Felice,” said Donna Elisa, “do not concern
yourself with such a thing. There is no one who
does not need a good gift.”</p>

<p>But now when Fra Felice’s strength had returned,
he wished, before he made up his mind about the
legacy, to tell Donna Elisa how good God had been
to him.</p>

<p>“Has not God been great in his grace to make
me a <i lang="it">polacco</i>?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a great gift,” said Donna Elisa.</p>

<p>“Only to be a little, little <i lang="it">polacco</i> is a great gift,”
said Fra Felice; “it is especially useful since the
monastery has been given up, and when my comrades
are gone or dead. It means having a bag full
of bread before one even stretches out one’s hand to
beg. It means always seeing bright faces, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
being greeted with deep reverences. I know no
greater gift for a poor monk, Donna Elisa.”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa thought how revered and loved Fra
Felice had been, because he had been able to predict
what numbers would come out in the lottery.
And she could not help agreeing with him.</p>

<p>“If I came wandering along the road in the heat,”
said Fra Felice, “the shepherd came to me and
went with me a long way, and held his umbrella
over me as shelter against the sun. And when I
came to the laborers in the cool stone-quarries, they
shared their bread and their bean-soup with me. I
have never been afraid of brigands nor of <i lang="it">carabinieri</i>.
The official at the custom-house has shut his eyes
when I went by with my bag. It has been a good
gift, Donna Elisa.”</p>

<p>“True, true,” said Donna Elisa.</p>

<p>“It has not been an arduous profession,” said
Fra Felice. “They spoke to me, and I answered
them; that was all. They knew that every word
has its number, and they noticed what I said and
played accordingly. I never knew how it happened,
Donna Elisa; it was a gift from God.”</p>

<p>“You will be a great loss to the poor people, Fra
Felice,” said Donna Elisa.</p>

<p>Fra Felice smiled. “They care nothing for me
on Sunday and Monday, when there has just been a
drawing,” he said. “But they come on Thursday
and Friday and on Saturday morning, because there
is a drawing every Saturday.”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa began to be anxious, because the
dying man thought of nothing but that. Suddenly
there flashed across her memory thoughts of one and
another who had lost in the lottery, and she remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
several who had played away all their prosperity.
She wished to turn his thoughts from that
sinful lottery business.</p>

<p>“You said that you wished to speak of your will,
Fra Felice.”</p>

<p>“But it is because I have so many friends that it
is hard for me to know to whom I shall give the
legacy. Shall I give it to those who have baked
sweet cakes for me, or to those who have offered
me artichokes, browned in sweet oil? Or shall I
bequeath it to the sisters of charity who nursed me
when I was ill?”</p>

<p>“Have you much to give away, Fra Felice?”</p>

<p>“It will do, Donna Elisa. It will do.”</p>

<p>Fra Felice seemed to be worse again; he lay
silent with panting breast.</p>

<p>“I had also wished to give it to all poor, homeless
monks, who had lost their monasteries,” he
whispered.</p>

<p>And then after thinking for a while: “I should
also have liked to give it to the good old man in
Rome. He, you know, who watches over us all.”</p>

<p>“Are you so rich, Fra Felice?” said Donna Elisa.</p>

<p>“I have enough, Donna Elisa; I have enough.”</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, and rested for a while; then
he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I want to give it to everybody, Donna Elisa.”</p>

<p>He acquired new strength at the thought; a
slight flush was again visible in his cheeks, and he
raised himself on his elbow.</p>

<p>“See here, Donna Elisa,” he said, while he
thrust his hand into his cloak and drew out a sealed
envelope, which he handed to her, “you shall go and
give this to the syndic, to the syndic of Diamante.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here, Donna Elisa,” said Fra Felice, “here are
the five numbers that win next Saturday. They
have been revealed to me, and I have written them
down. And the syndic shall take these numbers
and have them fastened up on the Roman Gate,
where everything of importance is published. And
he shall let the people know that it is my testament.
I bequeath it to the people. Five winning numbers,
a whole quintern, Donna Elisa!”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa took the envelope and promised to
give it to the syndic. She could do nothing else,
for poor Fra Felice had not many minutes left to
live.</p>

<p>“When Saturday comes,” said Fra Felice, “there
will be many who will think of Fra Felice. ‘Can
old Fra Felice have deceived us?’ they will ask
themselves. ‘Can it be possible for us to win the
whole quintern?’</p>

<p>“On Saturday evening there is a drawing on the
balcony of the town-hall in Catania, Donna Elisa.
Then they carry out the lottery-wheel and table,
and the managers of the lottery are there, and the
pretty little poor-house child. And one number
after another is put into the lucky wheel until they
are all there, the whole hundred.</p>

<p>“All the people stand below and tremble in
expectation, as the sea trembles before the storm-wind.</p>

<p>“Everybody from Diamante will be there, and
they will stand quite pale and hardly daring to look
one another in the face. Before, they have believed,
but not now. Now they think that old Fra Felice
has deceived them. No one dares to cherish the
smallest hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then the first number is drawn, and I was right.
Ah, Donna Elisa, they will be so astonished they
will scarcely be able to rejoice. For they have all
expected disappointment. When the second number
comes out, there is the silence of death. Then
comes the third. The lottery managers will be
astonished that everything is so quiet. ‘To-day
they are not winning anything,’ they will say.
‘To-day the state has all the prizes.’ Then comes
the fourth number. The poor-house child takes the
roll from the wheel; and the marker opens the roll,
and shows the number. Down among the people it
is almost terrible; no one is able to say a word for
joy. Then the last number comes. Donna Elisa,
the people scream, they cry, they fall into one
another’s arms and sob. They are rich. All
Diamante is rich&mdash;”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa had kept her arm under Fra Felice’s
head and supported him while he had panted out all
this. Suddenly his head fell heavily back. Old
Fra Felice was dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While Donna Elisa was with old Fra Felice, many
people in Diamante had begun to trouble themselves
about the blind. Not the men; most of the men
were in the fields at work; but the women. They
had come in crowds to Santa Lucia to console the
blind, and finally, when about four hundred women
had gathered together, it occurred to them to go and
speak to the syndic.</p>

<p>They had gone up to the square and called for
the syndic. He had come out on the balcony of
the town-hall, and they had prayed for the blind.
The syndic was a kind and handsome man. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
answered them pleasantly, but had not been willing
to yield. He could not repeal what had been
decided in the town Junta. But the women were
determined that it should be repealed, and they
remained in the square. The syndic went into the
town-hall again, but they stayed in the square and
called and prayed. They did not intend to go away
till he yielded.</p>

<p>While this was going on, Donna Elisa came to
give the syndic Fra Felice’s testament. She was
grieved unto death at all the misery, but at the same
time she felt a bitter satisfaction, because she had
received no help from the Christchild. She had
always believed that the saints did not wish to help
Donna Micaela.</p>

<p>It was a fine gift she had received in San
Pasquale’s church. Not only could it not help the
blind, but it was in a fair way to ruin the whole
town. Now what little the people still possessed
would go to the lottery collector. There would be
a borrowing and a pawning.</p>

<p>The syndic admitted Donna Elisa immediately,
and was as calm and polite as always, although the
women were calling in the square, the blind were
bemoaning themselves in the waiting-room, and
people had run in and out of his room all day.</p>

<p>“How can I be at your service, Signora Antonelli?”
he said. Donna Elisa first looked about and wondered
to whom he was speaking. Then she told
about the testament.</p>

<p>The syndic was neither frightened nor surprised.
“That is very interesting,” he said, and stretched
out his hand for the paper.</p>

<p>But Donna Elisa held the envelope fast and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
asked: “Signor Sindaco, what do you intend to
do with it? Do you intend to fasten it to the Roman
Gate?”</p>

<p>“Yes; what else can I do, signora? It is a dead
man’s last wish.”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa would have liked to tell him what
a terrible testament it was, but she checked herself
to speak of the blind.</p>

<p>“Padre Succi, who directed that the blind should
always be allowed in his church, is also a dead man,”
she interposed.</p>

<p>“Signora Antonelli, are you beginning with that
too?” said the syndic, quite kindly. “It was a mistake;
but why did no one tell me that the blind
frequent the church of Lucia? Now, since it is
decided, I cannot annul the decision; I cannot.”</p>

<p>“But their rights and patents, Signor Sindaco?”</p>

<p>“Their rights are worth nothing. They have
to do with the Jesuits’ monastery, but there is no
longer such a monastery. And tell me, Signora
Antonelli, what will become of me if I yield?”</p>

<p>“The people will love you as a good man.”</p>

<p>“Signora, people will believe that I am a weak
man, and every day I shall have four hundred
laborers’ wives outside the town-hall, begging now
for one thing, now for another. It is only to hold
out for one day. To-morrow it will be forgotten.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” said Donna Elisa; “we shall
never forget it.”</p>

<p>The syndic smiled, and Donna Elisa saw that he
thought that he knew the people of Diamante much
better than she.</p>

<p>“You think that their hearts are in it?” he said.</p>

<p>“I think so, Signor Sindaco.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the syndic laughed softly. “Give me that
envelope, Signora.”</p>

<p>He took it and went out on the balcony.</p>

<p>He began to speak to the women. “I wish to
tell you,” he said, “that I have just now heard that
old Fra Felice is dead, and that he has left a legacy
to you all. He has written down five numbers that
are supposed to win in the lottery next Saturday,
and he bequeaths them to you. No one has seen
them yet. They are lying here in this envelope,
and it is unopened.”</p>

<p>He was silent a moment to let the women have
time to think over what he had said.</p>

<p>Instantly they began to cry: “The numbers, the
numbers!”</p>

<p>The syndic signed to them to be silent.</p>

<p>“You must remember,” he said, “that it was
impossible for Fra Felice to know what numbers
will be drawn next Saturday. If you play on these
numbers, you may all lose. And we cannot afford
to be poorer than we are already here in Diamante.
I ask you therefore to let me destroy the testament
without any one seeing it.”</p>

<p>“The numbers,” cried the women, “give us the
numbers!”</p>

<p>“If I am permitted to destroy the testament,”
said the syndic, “I promise you that the blind shall
have their church again.”</p>

<p>There was silence in the square. Donna Elisa
rose from her seat in the hall of the court-house
and seized the back of her chair with both
hands.</p>

<p>“I leave it to you to choose between the church
and the numbers,” said the syndic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“God in heaven!” sighed Donna Elisa, “is he a
devil to tempt poor people in such a way?”</p>

<p>“We have been poor before,” cried one of the
women, “we can still be poor.”</p>

<p>“We will not choose Barabbas instead of Christ,”
cried another.</p>

<p>The syndic took a match-box from his pocket,
lighted a match, and brought it slowly up to the
testament.</p>

<p>The women stood quiet and let Fra Felice’s five
numbers be destroyed. The blind people’s church
was saved.</p>

<p>“It is a miracle,” whispered old Donna Elisa;
“they all believe in Fra Felice, and they let his
numbers burn. It is a miracle.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Later in the afternoon Donna Elisa again sat in
her shop with her embroidery frame. She looked
old as she sat there, and there was something shaken
and broken about her. It was not the usual Donna
Elisa; it was a poor, elderly, forsaken woman.</p>

<p>She drew the needle slowly through the cloth,
and when she wished to take another stitch she
was uncertain and at a loss. It was hard for her to
keep the tears from falling on her embroidery and
spoiling it.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa was in such great grief for to-day she
had lost Gaetano forever. There was no more hope
of getting him back.</p>

<p>The saints had gone over to the side of the opponent,
and worked miracles in order to help Donna
Micaela. No one could doubt that a miracle had
happened. The poor women of Diamante would
never have been able to stand still while Fra Felice’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
numbers burned if they had not been bound by a
miracle.</p>

<p>It made a poor soul so old and cross to have the
good saints help Donna Micaela, who did not like
Gaetano.</p>

<p>The door-bell jingled violently, and Donna Elisa
rose from old habit. It was Donna Micaela. She
was joyful, and came toward Donna Elisa with outstretched
hands. But Donna Elisa turned away,
and could not press her hand.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela was in raptures. “Ah, Donna
Elisa, you have helped my railway. What can I
say? How shall I thank you?”</p>

<p>“Never mind about thanking me, sister-in-law!”</p>

<p>“Donna Elisa!”</p>

<p>“If the saints wish to give us a railway, it must
be because Diamante needs it, and not because they
love <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela shrank back. At last she thought
she understood why Donna Elisa was angry with
her. “If Gaetano were at home,” she said. She
stood and pressed her hand to her heart and moaned.
“If Gaetano were at home he would not allow you
to be so cruel to me.”</p>

<p>“Gaetano?&mdash;would not Gaetano?”</p>

<p>“No, he would not. Even if you are angry with
me because I loved him while my husband was alive,
you would not dare to upbraid me for it if he were
at home.”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa lifted her eyebrows a little. “You
think that he could prevail upon me to be silent
about such a thing,” she said, and her voice was
very strange.</p>

<p>“But, Donna Elisa,” Donna Micaela whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
in her ear, “it is impossible, quite impossible not
to love him. He is beautiful; don’t you know it?
And he subjugates me, and I am afraid of him.
You must let me love him.”</p>

<p>“Must I?” Donna Elisa kept her eyes down and
spoke quite shortly and harshly.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela was beside herself. “It is I
whom he loves,” she said. “It is not Giannita, but
me, and you ought to consider me as a daughter;
you ought to help me; you ought to be kind to me.
And instead you stand against me; you are cruel
to me. You do not let me come to you and talk
of him. However much I long, and however much
I work, I may not tell you of it.”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa could hold out no longer. Donna
Micaela was nothing but a child, young and foolish
and quivering like a bird’s heart,&mdash;just one to be
taken care of. She had to throw her arms about
her.</p>

<p>“I never knew it, you poor, foolish child,” she
said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_VII">VII<br />
<span class="smaller">AFTER THE MIRACLE</span></h3>

<p>The blind singers had a meeting in the church of
Lucia. Highest up in the choir behind the altar
sat thirty old, blind, men on the carved chairs of
the Jesuit fathers. They were poor, most of them;
most of them had a beggar’s wallet and a crutch
beside them.</p>

<p>They were all very earnest and solemn; they knew
what it meant to be members of that holy band of
singers, of that glorious old Academy.</p>

<p>Now and then below in the church a subdued
noise was audible. The blind men’s guides were
sitting there, children, dogs, and old women, waiting.
Sometimes the children began to romp with
one another and with the dogs, but it was instantly
suppressed and silenced.</p>

<p>Those of the blind who were <i lang="it">trovatori</i> stood up
one after another and spoke new verses.</p>

<p>“You people who live on holy Etna,” one of them
recited, “men who live on the mountain of wonders,
rise up, give your mistress a new glory! She longs
for two ribbons to heighten her beauty, two long,
narrow bands of steel to fasten her mantle. Give
them to your mistress, and she will reward you with
riches; she will give gold for steel. Countless are
the treasures that she in her might will give them
who assist her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“A gentle worker of miracles has come among us,”
said another. “He stands poor and unnoticed in the
bare old church, and his crown is of tin, and his diamonds
of glass. ‘Make no sacrifices to me, O ye
poor,’ he says; ‘build me no temple, all ye who suffer.
I will work for your happiness. If prosperity
shines from your houses, I shall shine with precious
stones; if want flees from the land, my feet
will be clothed in golden shoes embroidered with
pearls.’”</p>

<p>As each new verse was recited, it was accepted or
rejected. The blind men judged with great severity.</p>

<p>The next day they wandered out over Etna, and
sang the railway into the people’s hearts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the miracle of Fra Felice’s legacy, people
began to give contributions to the railway. Donna
Micaela soon had collected about a hundred lire.
Then she and Donna Elisa made the journey to
Messina to look at the steam-tram that runs between
Messina and Pharo. They had no greater ambition;
they would be satisfied with a steam-tram.</p>

<p>“Why does a railway need to be so expensive?”
said Donna Elisa. “It is just an ordinary road,
although people do lay down two steel rails on it.
It is the engineer and the fine gentlemen who make
a railway expensive. Don’t trouble yourself about
engineers, Micaela! Let our good road-builders,
Giovanni and Carmelo, build your railway.”</p>

<p>They carefully inspected the steam-tramway to
Pharo and brought back all the knowledge they
could. They measured how wide it ought to be
between the rails, and Donna Micaela drew on a
piece of paper the way the rails ran by one another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
at the stations. It was not so difficult; they were
sure they would come out well.</p>

<p>That day there seemed to be no difficulties. It
was as easy to build a station as an ordinary house,
they said. Besides, more than two stations were not
needed; a little sentry-box was sufficient at most of
the stopping-places.</p>

<p>If they could only avoid forming a company, taking
fine gentlemen into their service, and doing things
that cost money, their plan of the railway would be
realized. It would not cost so much. The ground
they could certainly get free. The noble gentlemen
who owned the land on Etna would of course understand
how much use of the railway they would have,
and would let it pass free of charge over their ground.</p>

<p>They did not trouble themselves to stake out the
line beforehand. They were going to begin at
Diamante and gradually build their way to Catania.
They only needed to begin and lay a little piece
every day. It was not so difficult.</p>

<p>After that journey they began the attempt to
build the road at their own risk. Don Ferrante
had not left a large inheritance to Donna Micaela,
but one good thing that he had bequeathed her was
a long stretch of lava-covered waste land off on
Etna. Here Giovanni and Carmelo began to break
ground for the new railway.</p>

<p>When the work began, the builders of the railway
possessed only one hundred lire. It was the miracle
of the legacy that had filled them with holy frenzy.</p>

<p>What a railway it would be, what a railway!</p>

<p>The blind singers were the share-collectors, the
Christ-image gave the concession, and the old shop
woman, Donna Elisa, was the engineer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_VIII">VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">A JETTATORE</span></h3>

<p>In Catania there was once a man with “the evil
eye,” a <i lang="it">jettatore</i>. He was almost the most terrible
<i lang="it">jettatore</i> who had ever lived in Sicily. As soon as
he showed himself on the street people hastened to
bend their fingers to the protecting sign. Often
it did not help at all; whoever met him could
prepare himself for a miserable day; he would find
his dinner burned, and the beautiful old jelly-bowl
broken. He would hear that his banker had suspended
payments, and that the little note that he
had written to his friend’s wife had come into the
wrong hands.</p>

<p>Most often a <i lang="it">jettatore</i> is a tall, thin man, with
pale, shy eyes and a long nose, which overhangs and
<em>hacks</em> his upper lip. God has set the mark of a
parrot’s beak upon the <i lang="it">jettatore</i>. Yet all things are
variable; nothing is absolutely constant. This <i lang="it">jettatore</i>
was a little fellow with a nose like a San
Michele.</p>

<p>Thereby he did much more harm than an ordinary
<i lang="it">jettatore</i>. How much oftener is one pricked by a
rose than burned by a nettle!</p>

<p>A <i lang="it">jettatore</i> ought never to grow up. He is well
off only when he is a child. Then he still has his
little mamma, and she never sees the evil eye; she
never understands why she sticks the needle into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
her finger every time he comes to her work-table.
She will never be afraid to kiss him. Although she
has sickness constantly in the house, and the servants
leave, and her friends draw away, she never
notices anything.</p>

<p>But after the <i lang="it">jettatore</i> has come out into the world,
he often has a hard time enough. Every one must
first of all think of himself; no one can ruin his life
by being kind to a <i lang="it">jettatore</i>.</p>

<p>There are several priests who are <i lang="it">jettatori</i>. There
is nothing strange in that; the wolf is happy if he
can tear to pieces many sheep. They could not
very well do more harm than by being priests.
One need only ask what happens to the children
whom he baptizes, and the couples whom he
marries.</p>

<p>The <i lang="it">jettatore</i> in question was an engineer and
wished to build railways. He had also a position
in one of the state railway buildings. The state
could not know that he was a <i lang="it">jettatore</i>. Ah, but
what misery, what misery! As soon as he obtained
a place on the railway a number of accidents
occurred. When they tunnelled through a hill, one
cave-in after another; when they tried to lay a
bridge, breach upon breach; when they exploded a
blast, the workmen were killed by the flying
fragments.</p>

<p>The only one who was never injured was the
engineer, the <i lang="it">jettatore</i>.</p>

<p>The poor fellows working under him! They
counted their fingers and limbs every evening.
“To-morrow perhaps we will have lost you,” they
said.</p>

<p>They informed the chief engineer; they informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the minister. Neither of them would listen to the
complaint. They were too sensible and too learned
to believe in the evil eye. The workmen ought to
mind better what they were about. It was their
own fault that they met with accidents.</p>

<p>And the gravel-cars tipped over; the locomotive
exploded.</p>

<p>One morning there was a rumor that the engineer
was gone. He had disappeared; no one knew what
had become of him. Had some one perhaps stabbed
him? Oh, no; oh, no! would any one have dared to
kill a <i lang="it">jettatore</i>?</p>

<p>But he was really gone; no one ever saw him
again.</p>

<p>It was a few years later that Donna Micaela began
to think of building her railway. And in order to
get money for it, she wished to hold a bazaar in the
great Franciscan monastery outside Diamante.</p>

<p>There was a cloister garden there, surrounded
by splendid old pillars. Donna Micaela arranged
little booths, little lotteries, and little places of
diversion under the arcades. She hung festoons of
Venetian lanterns from pillar to pillar. She piled
up great kegs of Etna wine around the cloister
fountain.</p>

<p>While Donna Micaela worked there she often
conversed with little Gandolfo, who had been made
watchman at the monastery since Fra Felice’s
death.</p>

<p>One day she made Gandolfo show her the whole
monastery. She went through it all from attic to
cellar, and when she saw those countless little cells
with their grated windows and whitewashed walls
and hard wooden seats, she had an idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>She asked Gandolfo to shut her in in one of the
cells and to leave her there for the space of five
minutes.</p>

<p>“Now I am a prisoner,” she said, when she was
left alone. She tried the door; she tried the
window. She was securely shut in.</p>

<p>So that was what it was to be a prisoner! Four
empty walls about one, the silence of the grave, and
the chill.</p>

<p>“Now I can feel as a prisoner feels,” she
thought.</p>

<p>Then she forgot everything else in the thought
that possibly Gandolfo might not come to let her
out. He could be called away; he could be taken
suddenly ill; he could fall and kill himself in some
of the dark passage-ways. Many things could happen
to prevent him from coming.</p>

<p>No one knew where she was; no one would think
of looking for her in that out-of-the-way cell. If
she were left there for even an hour she would go
mad with terror.</p>

<p>She saw before her starvation, slow starvation.
She struggled through interminable hours of anguish.
Ah, how she would listen for a step; how she would
call!</p>

<p>She would shake the door; she would scrape the
masonry of the walls with her nails; she would bite
the grating with her teeth.</p>

<p>When they finally found her she would be lying
dead on the floor, and they would find everywhere
traces of how she had tried to break her way out.</p>

<p>Why did not Gandolfo come? Now she must
have been there a quarter of an hour, a half-hour.
Why did he not come?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>She was sure that she had been shut in a whole
hour when Gandolfo came. Where had he been
such a long time?</p>

<p>He had not been long at all. He had only been
away five minutes.</p>

<p>“God! God! so that is being a prisoner; that is
Gaetano’s life!” She burst into tears when she saw
the open sky once more above her.</p>

<p>A while later, as they stood out on an open <i lang="it">loggia</i>,
Gandolfo showed her a couple of windows with
shutters and green shades.</p>

<p>“Does any one live there?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, Donna Micaela, some one does.”</p>

<p>Gandolfo told her that a man lived there who
never went out except at night,&mdash;a man who never
spoke to any one.</p>

<p>“Is he crazy?” asked Donna Micaela.</p>

<p>“No, no; he is as much in his right mind as you
or I. But people say that he has to conceal himself.
He is afraid of the government.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela was much interested in the man.
“What is his name?” she said.</p>

<p>“I call him Signor Alfredo.”</p>

<p>“How does he get any food?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I prepare it for him,” said Gandolfo.</p>

<p>“And clothes?”</p>

<p>“I get them for him. I bring him books and
newspapers, too.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela was silent for a while. “Gandolfo,”
she said, and gave him a rose which she held in her
hand, “lay this on the tray the next time you take
food to your poor prisoner.”</p>

<p>After that Donna Micaela sent some little thing
almost every day to the man in the monastery. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
might be a flower, a book or some fruit. It was
her greatest pleasure. She amused herself with her
fancies. She almost succeeded in imagining that
she was sending all these things to Gaetano.</p>

<p>When the day for the bazaar came, Donna Micaela
was in the cloister early in the morning. “Gandolfo,”
she said, “you must go up to your prisoner and
ask him if he will come to the entertainment this
evening.”</p>

<p>Gandolfo soon came back with the answer. “He
thanks you very much, Donna Micaela,” said the
boy. “He will come.”</p>

<p>She was surprised, for she had not believed that
he would venture out. She had only wished to
show him a kindness.</p>

<p>Something made Donna Micaela look up. She
was standing in the cloister garden, and a window
was thrown open in one of the buildings above her.
Donna Micaela saw a middle-aged man of an attractive
appearance standing up there and looking down
at her.</p>

<p>“There he is, Donna Micaela,” said Gandolfo.</p>

<p>She was happy. She felt as if she had redeemed
and saved the man. And it was more than that.
People who have no imagination will not understand
it. But Donna Micaela trembled and longed
all day; she considered how she would be dressed.
It was as if she had expected Gaetano.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela soon had something else to do
than to dream; the livelong day a succession of
calamities streamed over her.</p>

<p>The first was a communication from the old Etna
brigand, Falco Falcone:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear friend, Donna Micaela</span>,&mdash;As I have heard that
you intend to build a railway along Etna, I wish to tell you
that with my consent it will never be. I tell you this now
so that you need not waste any more money and trouble on
the matter.</p>

<p>Enlightened and most nobly born signora, I remain</p>

<p class="center">Your humble servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Falco Falcone</span>.</p>

<p>Passafiero, my sister’s son, has written this letter.</p>

</div>

<p>Donna Micaela flung the dirty letter away. It
seemed to her as if it were the death sentence of the
railway, but to-day she would not think of it. Now
she had her bazaar.</p>

<p>The moment after, her road-builders, Giovanni
and Carmelo, appeared. They wished to counsel
her to get an engineer. She probably did not know
what kind of ground there was on Etna. There
was, first, lava; then there was ashes; and then lava
again. Should the road be laid on the top layer of
lava, or on the bed of ashes, or should they dig down
still deeper? About how firm a foundation did a
railway need? They could not go ahead without a
man who understood that.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela dismissed them. To-morrow, to-morrow;
she had no time to think of it to-day.</p>

<p>Immediately after, Donna Elisa came with a still
worse piece of news.</p>

<p>There was a quarter in Diamante where a poverty-stricken
and wild people lived. Those poor souls
had been frightened when they heard of the railway.
“There will be an eruption of Etna and an earthquake,”
they had said. Great Etna will endure no
fetters. It will shake off the whole railway. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
people said now that they ought to go out and tear
up the track as soon as a rail was laid on it.</p>

<p>A day of misfortune, a day of misfortune! Donna
Micaela felt farther from her object than ever.</p>

<p>“What is the good of our collecting money at our
bazaar?” she said despondingly.</p>

<p>The day promised ill for her bazaar. In the afternoon
it began to rain. It had not rained so in
Diamante since the day when the clocks rang. The
clouds sank to the very house-roofs, and the water
poured down from them. People were wet to the
skin before they had been two minutes in the street.
Towards six o’clock, when Donna Micaela’s bazaar
was to open, it was raining its very hardest. When
she came out to the monastery, there was no one
there but those who were to help in serving and
selling.</p>

<p>She felt ready to cry. Such an unlucky day!
What had dragged down all these adversities upon
her?</p>

<p>Donna Micaela’s glance fell on a strange man who
was leaning against a pillar, watching her. Now
all at once she recognized him. He was the <i lang="it">jettatore</i>&mdash;the
<i lang="it">jettatore</i> from Catania, whom people had
taught her to fear as a child.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela went quickly over to him. “Come
with me, signor,” she said, and went before him.
She wished to go so far away that no one should
hear them, and then she wished to beg of him never
to come before her eyes again. She could do no
less. He must not ruin her whole life.</p>

<p>She did not think in what direction she went.
Suddenly she was at the door of the monastery
church and turned in there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Within, it was almost dark. Only by the Christ-image
a little oil lamp was burning.</p>

<p>When Donna Micaela saw the Christ-image she
was startled. Just then she had not wished to see
him.</p>

<p>He reminded her of the time when his crown had
rolled to Gaetano’s feet, when he had been so angry
with the brigands. Perhaps the Christ-image did
not wish her to drive away the <i lang="it">jettatore</i>.</p>

<p>She had good reason to fear the <i lang="it">jettatore</i>. It was
wrong of him to come to her entertainment; she
must somehow be rid of him.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela had gone on through the whole
church, and now stood and looked at the Christ-image.
She could not say a word to the man who
followed her.</p>

<p>She remembered what sympathy she had lately
felt for him, because a prisoner, like Gaetano. She
had been so happy that she had tempted him out to
life. What did she now wish to do? Did she wish
to send him back to captivity?</p>

<p>She remembered both her father and Gaetano.
Should this man be the third that she&mdash;</p>

<p>She stood silent and struggled with herself. At
last the <i lang="it">jettatore</i> spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, signora, is it not true that now you have
had enough of me?”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela made a negative gesture.</p>

<p>“Do you not desire me to return to my cell?”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you, signor.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you understand. Something terrible
has happened to you to-day. You do not look as
you did this morning.”</p>

<p>“I am very tired,” said Donna Micaela, evasively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>The man came close up to her as if to force out
the truth. Questions and answers flew short and
panting between them.</p>

<p>“Do you not see that all your festival is likely to
be a failure?”&mdash;“I must arrange it again to-morrow.”&mdash;“Have
you not recognized me?”&mdash;“Yes,
I have seen you before in Catania.”&mdash;“And
you are not afraid of the <i lang="it">jettatore</i>?”&mdash;“Yes,
formerly, as a child.”&mdash;“But now, now are you not
afraid?” She avoided answering him. “Are you
yourself afraid?” she said. “Speak the truth!” he
said, impatiently. “What did you wish to say to
me when you brought me here?”</p>

<p>She looked anxiously about her. She had to say
something; she must have something to answer him.
Then a thought occurred to her which seemed to
her quite terrible. She looked at the Christ-image.
“Do you require it?” she seemed to ask him. “Shall
I do it for this strange man? But it is throwing
away my only hope.”</p>

<p>“I hardly know whether I dare to speak of what
I wish of you,” she said. “No, you see; you do
not dare.”&mdash;“I intend to build a railway; you know
that?”&mdash;“Yes, I know.”&mdash;“I want you to help
me.”&mdash;“I?”</p>

<p>Now that she had made a beginning, it was easier
for her to continue. She was surprised that her
words sounded so natural.</p>

<p>“I know that you are a railroad builder. Yes,
you understand of course that with my railroad no
pay is given. But it would be better for you to
help me work than to sit shut in here. You are
making no use of your time.”</p>

<p>He looked at her almost sternly. “Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
know what you are saying?”&mdash;“It is of course a
presumptuous request.”&mdash;“Just so, yes, a presumptuous
request.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the poor man began to try to terrify
her.</p>

<p>“It will go with your railway as with your festival.”
Donna Micaela thought so too, but now she
thought that she had closed all ways of escape for
herself; now she must go on being good. “My
festival will soon be in full swing,” she said
calmly.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Donna Micaela,” said the man.
“The last thing a man ceases to believe good of is
himself. No one can cease to have hope for himself.”</p>

<p>“No; why should he?”</p>

<p>He made a movement as if he were impatient
with her confidence.</p>

<p>“When I first began to think about the thing,” he
said, “I was easily consoled. ‘There have been a
few unfortunate occurrences,’ I said to myself, ‘so
you have the reputation, and it has become a belief.
It is the belief that has made the trouble. People
have met you, and people have believed that they
would come to grief, and come to grief they did.
It is a misfortune worse than death to be considered
a <i lang="it">jettatore</i>, but you need not yourself believe it.’”</p>

<p>“It is so absurd,” said Donna Micaela.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, whence should my eyes have
got the power to bring misfortune? And when I
thought of it I determined to make a trial. I
travelled to a place where no one knew me. The
next day I read in the paper that the train on which
I had travelled had run over a flagman. When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
had been one day in the hotel, I saw the landlord in
despair, and all the guests leaving. What had happened?
I asked. ‘One of our servants has been
taken with small-pox.’ Ah, what a wretched
business!</p>

<p>“Well, Donna Micaela, I shut myself in and drew
back from all intercourse with people. When a
year had passed I had found peace. I asked myself
why I was shut in so. ‘You are a harmless man,’ I
said; ‘you wish to hurt no one. Why do you live
as miserably as a criminal?’ I had just meant to go
back to life again, when I met Fra Felice in one of
the passages. ‘Fra Felice, where is the cat?’&mdash;‘The
cat, signor?’&mdash;‘Yes, the monastery cat, that used to
come and get milk from me; where is he now?’&mdash;‘He
was caught in a rat-trap.’&mdash;‘What do you say,
Fra Felice?’&mdash;‘He got his paw in a steel trap and
he could not get loose. He dragged himself to one
of the garrets and died of starvation.’ What do you
say to that, Donna Micaela?”</p>

<p>“Was it supposed to be your fault that the cat
died?”</p>

<p>“I am a <i lang="it">jettatore</i>.”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. “Ah, what folly!”</p>

<p>“When some time had passed, again the desire
to live awoke within me. Then Gandolfo knocked
on my door, and invited me to your festival. Why
should I not go? It is impossible to believe that
one brings misfortune only by showing one’s self.
It was a festival in itself, Donna Micaela, only to
get ready and to take out one’s black clothes, brush
them, and put them on. But when I came down to
the scene of the festival, it was deserted; the rain
streamed in torrents; your Venetian lanterns were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
filled with water. And you yourself looked as if
you had suffered all life’s misfortunes in a single
day. When you looked at me you became ashy
gray with terror. I asked some one: ‘What was
Signora Alagona’s maiden name?’&mdash;‘Palmeri.’&mdash;‘Ah,
Palmeri; so she is from Catania. She has
recognized the <i lang="it">jettatore</i>.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is true; I recognized you.”</p>

<p>“You have been very friendly, very kind, and I
am distressed to have spoiled your festival. But
now I promise you that I shall keep away both from
your entertainment and your railway.”</p>

<p>“Why should you keep away?”</p>

<p>“I am a <i lang="it">jettatore</i>.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it. I cannot believe it.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it either. Yes, yes, I believe.
Do you see, people say that no one can have power
over a <i lang="it">jettatore</i> who is not as great in evil as he.
Once, they say, a <i lang="it">jettatore</i> looked at himself in the
glass, and then fell down and died. Well, I never
look at myself in the glass. Therefore I believe it.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it. I think I almost believed
it when I saw you out there. Now I do not believe
it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will let me work on your railway?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, if you only will.”</p>

<p>He came again close up to her, and they exchanged
a few short sentences. “Come forward to the
light; I wish to see your face!”&mdash;“You think that
I am dissembling.”&mdash;“I think that you are polite.”&mdash;“Why
should I be polite to you?”&mdash;“That railway
means something to you?”&mdash;“It means life
and happiness to me.”&mdash;“How is that?”&mdash;“It will
win one who is dear to me.”&mdash;“Very dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not reply, but he read the answer in her
face.</p>

<p>He bent his knee to her, and sank his head so
low that he could kiss the hem of her dress. “You
are good; you are very good. I shall never forget it.
If I were not who I am, how I would serve you!”</p>

<p>“You <em>shall</em> serve me,” she said. And she was so
moved by his misfortunes that she felt no more
fear of his injuring her.</p>

<p>He sprang up. “I will tell you something. You
cannot go across the floor without stumbling if I
look at you.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said.</p>

<p>“Try!”</p>

<p>And she tried. She was very much frightened,
and had never felt so unsteady as when she took
her first step. Then she thought: “If it were
for Gaetano’s sake, I could do it.” And then it
was easy.</p>

<p>She walked to and fro on the church floor. “Shall
I do it again?” He nodded.</p>

<p>As she was walking, the thought flashed through
her brain: “The Christchild has taken the curse
from him, because he is to help me.” She turned
suddenly and came back to him.</p>

<p>“Do you know, do you know? you are no <i lang="it">jettatore</i>!”</p>

<p>“Am I not?”</p>

<p>“No, no!” She took him by the shoulders and
shook him. “Do you not see? do you not understand?
It is taken from you.”</p>

<p>Little Gandolfo’s voice was heard in the path
outside the church. “Donna Micaela, Donna Micaela,
where are you? There are so many people, Donna
Micaela. Do you hear; do you hear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is it no longer raining?” said the <i lang="it">jettatore</i>, in
an uncertain voice.</p>

<p>“It is not raining; how could it be raining? The
Christ-image has taken the curse from you because
you are going to work for his railway.”</p>

<p>The man reeled and grasped at the air with his
hands. “It is gone. Yes, I think it is gone. Just
now it was there. But now&mdash;”</p>

<p>He wished again to fall on his knees before
Donna Micaela.</p>

<p>“Not to me,” she said; “to him, to him.” She
pointed to the Christ-image.</p>

<p>But nevertheless he fell down before her. He
kissed her hands, and with a voice broken by sobs
he told her how every one had hated and persecuted
him, and how much misery life had brought him
hitherto.</p>

<p>The next day the <i lang="it">jettatore</i> went out on Etna and
staked out the road. And he was no more dangerous
than any one else.</p>

<h3 id="II_IX">IX<br />
<span class="smaller">PALAZZO GERACI AND PALAZZO CORVAJA</span></h3>

<p>At the time when the Normans ruled in Sicily, long
before the family of Alagona had come to the island,
the two magnificent buildings, Palazzo Geraci and
Palazzo Corvaja, were built in Diamante.</p>

<p>The noble Barons Geraci placed their house in
the square, high up on the summit of Monte Chiaro.
The Barons Corvaja, on the other hand, built their
home far down the mountain and surrounded it with
gardens.</p>

<p>The black-marble walls of Palazzo Geraci were
built round a square court-yard, full of charm and
beauty. A long flight of steps, passing under an
arch adorned with an escutcheon, led to the second
story. Not entirely round the court-yard, but here
and there in the most unexpected places, the walls
opened into little pillared loggias. The walls were
covered with bas-reliefs, with speckled slabs of
Sicilian marble and with the coats of arms of the
Geraci barons. There were windows also, very
small, but with exquisitely carved frames; some
round, with panes so small that they could be covered
with a grape leaf; some oblong, and so narrow
that they let in no more light than a slit in a
curtain.</p>

<p>The Barons Corvaja did not try to adorn the
court-yard of their palace, but on the lower floor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the house they fitted up a magnificent hall. In the
floor was built a basin for gold-fish; in niches in the
walls fountains covered with mosaic, in which clear
water spouted into gigantic shells. Over it all, a
Moorish vaulted roof, supported on slender pillars,
with twining vines in mosaic. It was a hall whose
equal is only to be seen in the Moorish palace in
Palermo.</p>

<p>There was much rivalry and emulation during all
the time of building. When Palazzo Geraci put
forth a balcony, Palazzo Corvaja acquired its high
Gothic bay-windows; when the roof of Palazzo
Geraci was adorned with richly carved battlements,
a frieze of black marble, inlaid with white a yard
wide, appeared on Palazzo Corvaja. The Geraci
house was crowned by a high tower; the Corvaja
had a roof garden, with antique pots along the
railing.</p>

<p>When the palaces were finished the rivalry began
between the families who had built them. The
houses seemed to breed hostility and strife for all
who lived in them. A Baron Geraci could never
agree with a Baron Corvaja. When Geraci fought
for Anjou, Corvaja fought for Manfred. If Geraci
changed sides, and supported Aragoni, Corvaja went
to Naples, and fought for Robert and Joanna.</p>

<p>But that was not all. It was an understood thing
that when Geraci found a son-in-law, Corvaja had to
increase his power by a rich marriage. Neither of
the families could rest. They had to vie with each
other while eating, while amusing themselves, while
working. The Geraci came to the court of the
Bourbons in Naples, not out of desire of distinction,
but because the Corvaja were there. The Corvaja<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
on the other hand had to grow grapes and mine
sulphur, because the Geraci were interested in agriculture
and the working of mines. When a Geraci
received an inheritance some old relative of the
Corvaja had to lie down and die, so that the honor
of the family should not be hazarded.</p>

<p>Palazzo Geraci was always kept busy counting its servants,
in order not to let Palazzo Corvaja lead. But
not only the servants, but the braid on the caps, the
harnesses and the horses. The pheasant feather on
the heads of the Corvaja leaders must not be an inch
higher than that on the Geraci. Their goats must
increase in the same proportion, and the Geraci’s
oxen must have just as long horns as the Corvaja’s.</p>

<p>In our time one might have expected an end to
the enmity between the two palaces. In our time
there are just as few Corvaja in the one palace as
there are Geraci in the other.</p>

<p>The Geraci court-yard is now a dirty hole, which
contains donkey-stalls and pig-styes and chicken
houses. On the high steps rags are dried and the
bas-reliefs are broken and mouldy. In one of the
passage-ways a trade in vegetables is carried on, and
in the other shoes are made. The gate-keeper looks
like the most ragged of beggars, and from cellar to
attic live none but poor and penniless people.</p>

<p>It is no better in Palazzo Corvaja. There is not
a vestige of the mosaic left in the big hall; only
bare, empty arches. No beggars live there, because
the palace is principally in ruins. It no longer
raises its beautiful façade with the carved windows
to the bright Sicilian sky.</p>

<p>But the enmity between Geraci and Corvaja is not
over. In the old days it was not only the noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
families themselves who competed with one another;
it was also their neighbors and dependents. All
Diamante is to this day divided into Geraci and
Corvaja. There is still a high, loop-holed wall running
across the town, dividing the part of Diamante
which stands by the Geraci from that which has
declared itself for the Corvaja.</p>

<p>Even in our day no one from Geraci will marry a
girl from Corvaja. And a shepherd from Corvaja
cannot let his sheep drink from a Geraci fountain.
They have not even the same saints. San Pasquale
is worshipped in Geraci, and the black Madonna is
Corvaja’s patron saint.</p>

<p>A man from Geraci can never believe but that all
Corvaja is full of magicians, witches, and werewolves.
A man from Corvaja will risk his salvation
that in Geraci there are none but rogues and
pick-pockets.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela lived in the Geraci district, and
soon all that part of the town were partisans of her
railway. But then Corvaja could do no less than to
oppose her.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Corvaja specially disliked two
things. They were jealous of the reputation of the
black Madonna, and therefore did not like to have
another miracle-working image come to Diamante.
That was one thing. The other was that they feared
that Mongibello would bury all Diamante in ashes
and fire if any one tried to encircle it with a
railway.</p>

<p>A few days after the bazaar Palazzo Corvaja
began to show itself hostile. Donna Micaela one
day found on the roof-garden a lemon, which was so
thickly set with pins that it looked like a steel ball.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
It was Palazzo Corvaja, that was trying to bewitch
as many pains into her head as there were pins in
the lemon.</p>

<p>Then Corvaja waited a few days to see what effect
the lemon would have. But when Donna Micaela’s
people continued to work on Etna and stake out the
line, they came one night and pulled everything up.
And when the stakes were set up again the next
day, they broke the windows in the church of San
Pasquale and threw stones at the Christ-image.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a long and narrow little square on the
south side of Monte Chiaro. On both the long
sides stood dark, high buildings. On one of the
short sides was an abyss; on the other rose the
steep mountain. The mountain wall was arranged
in terraces, but the steps were crumbled and the
marble railings broken. On the broadest of the
terraces rose the stately ruins of Palazzo Corvaja.</p>

<p>The chief ornament of the square was a beautiful,
oblong water-basin which stood quite under the
terraces, close to the mountain wall. It stood there
white as snow, covered with carvings, and full of
clear, cold water. It was the best preserved of all
the former glories of the Corvaja.</p>

<p>One beautiful and peaceful evening two ladies
dressed in black came walking into the little square.
For the moment it was almost empty. The two
ladies looked about them, and when they saw no
one they sat down on the bench by the fountain,
and waited.</p>

<p>Soon several inquisitive children came forward
and looked at them, and the older of the two began
to talk to the children. She began to tell them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
stories: “It is said,” and “It is told,” and “Once
upon a time,” she said.</p>

<p>Then the children were told of the Christchild
who turned himself into roses and lilies when the
Madonna met one of Herod’s soldiers, who had been
commanded to kill all children. And they were
told the legend of how the Christchild once had sat
and shaped birds out of clay, and how he clapped his
hands and gave the clay pigeons wings with which
to fly away when a naughty boy wished to break
them to pieces.</p>

<p>While the old lady was talking, many children
gathered about her, and also big people. It was a
Saturday evening, so that the laborers were coming
home from their work in the fields. Most of them
came up to the Corvaja fountain for water. When
they heard that some one was telling legends they
stopped to listen. Both the ladies were soon surrounded
by a close, dark wall of heavy, black cloaks
and slouch hats.</p>

<p>Suddenly the old lady said to the children: “Do
you like the Christchild?” “Yes, yes,” they said,
and their big, dark eyes sparkled.&mdash;“Perhaps you
would like to see him?”&mdash;“Yes, we should indeed.”</p>

<p>The lady threw back her mantilla and showed the
children a little Christ-image in a jewelled dress,
and with a gold crown on his head and gold shoes
on his feet. “Here he is,” she said. “I have
brought him with me to show you.”</p>

<p>The children were in raptures. First they clasped
their hands at the sight of the image’s grave face,
then they began to throw kisses to it.</p>

<p>“He is beautiful, is he not?” said the lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us have him! Let us have him!” cried the
children.</p>

<p>But now a big, rough workman, a dark man with
a bushy, black beard, pushed forward. He wished
to snatch away the image. The old lady had barely
time to thrust it behind her back.</p>

<p>“Give it here, Donna Elisa, give it here!” said
the man.</p>

<p>Poor Donna Elisa cast one glance at Donna
Micaela, who had sat silent and displeased the
whole time by her side. Donna Micaela had been
persuaded with difficulty to go to Corvaja and show
the image to the people there. “The image helps
us when it wills,” she said. “We shall not force
miracles.”</p>

<p>But Donna Elisa had been determined to go, and
she had said that the image was only waiting to be
taken to the faithless wretches in Corvaja. After
everything that he had done, they might have
enough faith in him to believe that he could win
them over also.</p>

<p>Now she, Donna Elisa, stood there with the man
over her, and she did not know how she could prevent
him from snatching the image away.</p>

<p>“Give it to me amicably, Donna Elisa,” said the
man, “otherwise, by God, I will take it in spite of
you. I will hack it to small pieces, to small, small
pieces. You shall see how much there will be left
of your wooden doll. You shall see if it can withstand
the black Madonna.”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa pressed against the mountain wall;
she saw no escape. She could not run, and
she could not struggle. “Micaela!” she wailed,
“Micaela!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Donna Micaela was very pale. She held her
hands against her heart, as she always did when
anything agitated her. It was terrible to her to
stand opposed to those dark men. These were they
of the slouch hats and short cloaks of whom she had
always been afraid.</p>

<p>But now, when Donna Elisa appealed to her, she
turned quickly, seized the image and held it out to
the man.</p>

<p>“See here, take it!” she said defiantly. And she
took a step towards him. “Take it, and do with it
what you can!”</p>

<p>She held the image on her outstretched arms, and
came nearer and nearer to the dark workman.</p>

<p>He turned towards his comrades. “She does not
believe that I can do anything to the doll,” he said,
and laughed at her. And the whole group of workmen
slapped themselves on the knee and laughed.</p>

<p>But he did not take the image; he grasped instead
the big pick-axe, which he held in his hand. He
drew back a few steps, lifted the pick over his head,
and stiffened his whole body for a blow which was
to crush at once the entire hated wooden doll.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela shook her head warningly. “You
cannot do it,” she said, and she did not draw the
image back.</p>

<p>He saw that nevertheless she was afraid, and he
enjoyed frightening her. He stood longer than was
necessary with uplifted pick.</p>

<p>“Piero!” came a cry shrill and wailing.</p>

<p>“Piero! Piero!”</p>

<p>The man dropped his pick without striking. He
looked terrified.</p>

<p>“God! it is Marcia calling!” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same moment a crowd of people came
tumbling out of a little cottage which was built
among the ruins of the old Palazzo Corvaja. There
were about a dozen women and a carabiniere, who
were fighting. The carabiniere held a child in his
arms, and the women were trying to drag the child
away from him. But the policeman, who was a
tall, strong fellow, freed himself from them, lifted
the child to his shoulder, and ran down the terrace
steps.</p>

<p>The dark Piero had looked on without making a
movement. When the carabiniere freed himself,
he bent down to Donna Micaela and said eagerly:
“If <em>the little one</em> can prevent that, all Corvaja shall
be his friend.”</p>

<p>Now the carabiniere was down in the square.
Piero made a sign with his hand. Instantly all his
comrades closed in a ring round the fugitive. He
turned squarely round. Everywhere a close ring of
men threatened him with picks and shovels.</p>

<p>All at once there was terrible confusion. The
women who had been struggling with the carabiniere
came rushing down with loud cries. The little girl,
whom he held in his arms, screamed as loud as she
could and tried to tear herself away. People came
running from all sides. There were questionings
and wonderings.</p>

<p>“Let us go now,” said Donna Elisa to Donna
Micaela. “Now no one is thinking of us.”</p>

<p>But Donna Micaela had caught sight of one of the
women. She screamed least, but it was instantly
apparent that it was she whom the matter concerned.
She looked as if she was about to lose her life’s
happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>She was a woman who had been very beautiful,
although all freshness now was gone from her, for
she was no longer young. But hers was still an
impressive and large-souled face. “Here dwells a
soul which can love and suffer,” said the face.
Donna Micaela felt drawn to that poor woman as to
a sister.</p>

<p>“No, it is not the time to go yet,” she said to
Donna Elisa.</p>

<p>The carabiniere asked and asked if they would
not let him come out.</p>

<p>No, no, no! Not until he let the child go!</p>

<p>It was the child of Piero and his wife, Marcia.
But they were not the child’s real parents. The
trouble arose from that.</p>

<p>The carabiniere tried to win the people over to
his side. He tried to convince, not Piero nor
Marcia, but the others. “Ninetta is the child’s
mother,” he said; “you all know that. She has not
been able to have the child with her while she was
unmarried; but now she is married, and wishes to
have her child back. And now Marcia refuses to
give her the boy. It is hard on Ninetta, who has
not been able to have her child with her for eight
years. Marcia will not give him up. She drives
Ninetta away when she comes and begs for her
child. Finally Ninetta had to complain to the
syndic. And the syndic has told us to get her
the child. It is Ninetta’s own child,” he said
appealingly.</p>

<p>But it had no great effect on the men of Corvaja.</p>

<p>“Ninetta is a Geraci,” burst out Piero, and the
circle stood fast round the carabiniere.</p>

<p>“When we came here to fetch the child,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the latter, “we did not find him. Marcia was dressed
in black, and her rooms were draped with black,
and a lot of women sat and mourned with her. And
she showed us the certificate of the child’s death.
Then we went and told Ninetta that her child was
in the church-yard.</p>

<p>“Well, well, a while afterwards I went on guard
here in the square. I watched the children playing
there. Who was strongest, and who shouted the
loudest, if not one of the girls? ‘What is your
name?’ I asked her. ‘Francesco,’ she answered
instantly.</p>

<p>“It occurred to me that that girl, Francesco, might
be Ninetta’s boy, and I stood quiet and waited.
Just now I saw Francesco go into Marcia’s house.
I followed, and there sat the girl Francesco and
ate supper with Marcia. She and all the mourners
began to scream when I appeared. Then I seized
Signorina Francesco and ran. For the child is not
Marcia’s. Remember that, signori! He is Ninetta’s.
Marcia has no right to him.”</p>

<p>Then at last Marcia began to speak. She spoke
in a deep voice which compelled every one to listen,
and she made only a few, but noble gestures. Had
she no right to the child? But who had given him
food and clothing? He had been dead a thousand
times over if she had not been there. Ninetta had
left him with La Felucca. They knew La Felucca.
To leave one’s child to her was the same as saying
to it: “You shall die.” And, moreover, right? right?
What did that mean? The one whom the boy loved
had a right to him. The one who loved the boy had
a right to him. Piero and she loved the boy like
their own son. They could not be parted from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>The wife was desperate, the husband perhaps
even more so. He threatened the carabiniere whenever
he made a movement. Yet the carabiniere
seemed to see that the victory would be his. The
people had laughed when he spoke of “Signorina
Francesco.” “Cut me down, if you will,” he said to
Piero. “Does it help you? Will you retain the
child for that? He is not yours. He is Ninetta’s.”</p>

<p>Piero turned to Donna Micaela. “Pray to him to
help me.” He pointed to the image.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela instantly went forward to Marcia.
She was shy and trembled for what she was venturing,
but it was not the time for her to hold back.
“Marcia,” she whispered, “confess! Confess,&mdash;if
you dare!” The startled woman looked at her.
“I see it so well,” whispered Donna Micaela; “you
are as alike as two berries. But I will say nothing
if you do not wish it.” “He will kill me,” said
Marcia. “I know one who will not let him kill
you,” said Donna Micaela. “Otherwise they will
take your child from you,” she added.</p>

<p>All were silent, with eyes fixed on the two women.
They saw how Marcia struggled with herself. The
features of her strong face were distorted. Her lips
moved. “The child is mine,” she said, but in so
low a voice that no one heard it. She said it again,
and now it came in a piercing scream: “The child
is mine!”</p>

<p>“What will you do to me when I confess it?”
she said to the man. “The child is mine, but not
yours. He was born in the year when you were at
work in Messina. I put him with La Felucca, and
Ninetta’s boy was there too. One day when I came
to La Felucca she said, ‘Ninetta’s boy is dead.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
At first I only thought: ‘God! if it had been mine!
Then I said to La Felucca: ‘Let my boy be dead,
and let Ninetta’s live.’ I gave La Felucca my
silver comb, and she agreed. When you came
home from Messina I said to you: ‘Let us take a
foster child. We have never been on good terms.
Let us try what adopting a child will do.’ You
liked the proposal, and I adopted my own child.
You have been happy with him, and we have lived
as if in paradise.”</p>

<p>Before she finished speaking the carabiniere put
the child down on the ground. The dark men
silently opened their ranks for him, and he went
his way. A shiver went through Donna Micaela
when she saw the carabiniere go. He should have
stayed to protect the poor woman. His going seemed
to mean: “That woman is beyond the pale of the
law; I cannot protect her.” Every man and woman
standing there felt the same: “She is outside of
the law.”</p>

<p>One after another went their way.</p>

<p>Piero, the husband, stood motionless without
looking up. Something fierce and dreadful was
gathering in him. Rage and suffering were gathering
within him. Something terrible would happen
as soon as he and Marcia were alone.</p>

<p>The woman made no effort to escape. She stood
still, paralyzed by the certainty that her fate was
sealed, and that nothing could change it. She
neither prayed nor fled. She shrank together like a
dog before an angry master. The Sicilian women
know what awaits them when they have wounded
their husbands’ honor.</p>

<p>The only one who tried to defend her was Donna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Micaela. Never would she have begged Marcia to
confess, she said to Piero, if she had known what he
was. She had thought that he was a generous man.
Such a one would have said: “You have done
wrong; but the fact that you confess your sin publicly,
and expose yourself to my anger to save the
child, atones for everything. It is punishment
enough.” A generous man would have taken the
child on one arm, put the other round his wife’s
waist, and have gone happy to his home. A signor
would have acted so. But he was no signor; he
was a bloodhound.</p>

<p>She talked in vain; the man did not hear her;
the woman did not hear her. Her words seemed to
be thrown back from an impenetrable wall.</p>

<p>Just then the child came to the father, and tried
to take his hand. Furious, he looked at the boy.
As the latter was dressed in girl’s clothes, his hair
smoothly combed and drawn back by the ears, he
saw instantly the likeness to Marcia, which he had
not noticed before. He kicked Marcia’s son away.</p>

<p>There was a terrible tension in the square. The
neighbors continued to go quietly and slowly away.
Many went unwillingly and with hesitation, but still
they went. The husband seemed only to be waiting
for the last to go.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela ceased speaking; she took the
image instead and laid it in Marcia’s arms. “Take
him, my sister Marcia, and may he protect you!”
she said.</p>

<p>The man saw it, and his rage increased. It seemed
as if he could no longer contain himself till he was
alone. He crouched like a wild beast ready to
spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>But the image did not rest in vain in the woman’s
arms. The outcast moved her to an act of the
greatest love.</p>

<p>“What will Christ in Paradise say to me, who
have first deceived my husband, and then made him
a murderer?” she thought. And she remembered
how she had loved big Piero in the days of her
happy youth. She had not then thought of bringing
such misery upon him.</p>

<p>“No, Piero, no, do not kill me!” she said eagerly.
“They will send you to the galleys. You shall be
relieved of seeing me again without that.”</p>

<p>She ran towards the other side of the square,
where the ground fell away into an abyss. Every
one understood her intention. Her face bore witness
for her.</p>

<p>Several hurried after her, but she had a good
start. Then the image, which she still carried,
slipped from her arms and lay at her feet. She
stumbled over it, fell, and was overtaken.</p>

<p>She struggled to get away, but a couple of men
held her fast. “Ah, let me do it!” she cried; “it
is better for him!”</p>

<p>Her husband came up to her also. He had caught
up her child and placed him on his arm. He was
much moved.</p>

<p>“See, Marcia, let it be as it is,” he said. He
was embarrassed, but his dark, deep-set eyes shone
with happiness and said more than his words. “Perhaps,
according to old custom, it ought to be so,
but I do not care for that. Look, come now! It
would be a pity for such a woman as you, Marcia.”</p>

<p>He put his arm about Marcia’s waist, and went
towards his house in the ruins of Palazzo Corvaja.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
It was like a triumphal entry of one of the former
barons. The people of Corvaja stood on both sides
of the way and bowed to him and Marcia.</p>

<p>As they went past Donna Micaela, they both
stopped, bowed deep to her, and kissed the image
which some one had given back to her. But Donna
Micaela kissed Marcia. “Pray for me in your happiness,
sister Marcia!” she said.</p>

<h3 id="II_X">X<br />
<span class="smaller">FALCO FALCONE</span></h3>

<p>The blind singers have week after week sung of
Diamante’s railway, and the big collection-box in
the church of San Pasquale has been filled every
evening with gifts. Signor Alfredo measures and
sets stakes on the slopes of Etna, and the distaff-spinners
in the dark alleys tell stories of the wonderful
miracles that have been performed by the
little Christ-image in the despised church. From
the rich and powerful men who own the land on
Etna comes letter after letter promising to give
ground to the blessed undertaking.</p>

<p>During these last weeks every one comes with
gifts. Some give building stone for the stations,
some give powder to blast the lava blocks, some
give food to the workmen. The poor people of
Diamante, who have nothing, come in the night
after their work. They come with shovels and
wheelbarrows and creep out on Etna, dig the ground,
and ballast the road. When Signor Alfredo and his
people come in the morning they believe that the
Etna goblins have broken out from their lava streams
and helped on the work.</p>

<p>All the while people have been questioning and
asking: “Where is the king of Etna, Falco Falcone?
Where is the mighty Falco who has held sway on
the slopes of Etna for five and twenty years? He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
wrote to Don Ferrante’s widow that she would not
be allowed to construct the railway. What did he
mean by his threat? Why does he sit still when
people are braving his interdiction? Why does he
not shoot down the people of Corvaja when they
come creeping through the night with wheelbarrows
and pickaxes? Why does he not drag the blind
singers down into the quarry and whip them? Why
does he not have Donna Micaela carried off from
the summer-palace, in order to be able to demand a
cessation in the building of the railway as a ransom
for her life?”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela says to herself: “Has Falco
Falcone forgotten his promise, or is he waiting to
strike till he can strike harder?”</p>

<p>Everybody asks in the same way: “When is Etna’s
cloud of ashes to fall on the railway? When will
Mongibello cataracts tear it away? When will the
mighty Falco Falcone be ready to destroy it?”</p>

<p>While every one is waiting for Falco to destroy
the railway, they talk a great deal about him,
especially the workmen under Signor Alfredo.</p>

<p>Opposite the entrance to the church of San
Pasquale, people say, stands a little house on a bare
crag. The house is narrow, and so high that it
looks like a chimney left standing on a burnt building
site. It is so small that there is no room for
the stairs inside the house; they wind up outside
the walls. Here and there hang balconies and other
projections that are arranged with no more symmetry
than a bird’s nest on a tree-trunk.</p>

<p>In that house Falco Falcone was born, and his
parents were only poor working-people. In that
miserable hut Falco learned arrogance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Falco’s mother was an unfortunate woman, who
during the first years of her marriage brought only
daughters into the world. Her husband and all her
neighbors despised her.</p>

<p>The woman longed continually for a son. When
she was expecting her fifth child she strewed salt
every day on the threshold and sat and watched who
should first cross it. Would it be a man or a
woman? Should she bear a son or a daughter?</p>

<p>Every day she sat and counted. She counted the
letters in the month when her child was to be born.
She counted the letters in her husband’s name and
in her own. She added and subtracted. It was an
even number; therefore she would bear a son. The
next day she made the calculation over again.
“Perhaps I counted wrong yesterday,” she said.</p>

<p>When Falco was born his mother was much
honored, and she loved him on account of it more
than all her other children. When the father came
in to see the child he snatched off his cap and made
a low bow. Over the house-door they set a hat as
a token of honor, and they poured the child’s bath
water over the threshold, and let it run out into the
street. When Falco was carried to the church he
was laid on his god-mother’s right arm; when the
neighbors’ wives came to look after his mother they
courtesied to the child sleeping in his cradle.</p>

<p>He was also bigger and stronger than children
generally are. Falco had thick hair when he was
born, and when he was a week old he already had
a tooth. When his mother laid him to her breast
he was so wild that she laughed and said: “I think
that I have brought a hero into the world.”</p>

<p>She was always expecting great achievements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
from Falco, and she put pride into him. But who
else hoped anything of him? Falco could not even
learn to read. His mother tried to take a book and
teach him the letters. She pointed to A, that is
the big hat; she pointed to B, that is the spectacles;
she pointed to C, that is the snake. That he could
learn. Then his mother said: “If you put the spectacles
and the big hat together, it makes Ba.” That
he could not learn. He became angry and struck
her, and she let him alone. “You will be a great
man yet,” she said.</p>

<p>Falco was dull and bad-tempered in his childhood
and youth. As a child, he would not play;
as a youth, he would not dance. He had no sweetheart,
but he liked to go where fighting was to be
expected.</p>

<p>Falco had two brothers who were like other
people, and who were much more esteemed than he.
Falco was wounded to see himself eclipsed by his
brothers, but he was too proud to show it. His
mother was always on his side. After his father’s
death she had him sit at the head of the table, and
she never allowed any one to jest with him. “My
oldest son is the best of you all,” she said.</p>

<p>When the people remember it all they say:
“Falco is proud. He will make it a point of honor
to destroy the railway.”</p>

<p>And they have hardly terrified themselves with
one story before they remember another about him.</p>

<p>For thirty long years, people say, Falco lived like
any other poor person on Etna. On Monday he
went away to his work in the fields with his brothers.
He had bread in his sack for the whole week, and
he made soup of beans and rice like every one else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
And he was glad on Saturday evening to be able to
return to his home. He was glad to find the table
spread, with wine and macaroni, and the bed made
up with soft pillows.</p>

<p>It was just such a Saturday evening. Falco and
Falco’s brothers were on their way home; Falco, as
usual, a little behind the others, for he had a heavy
and slow way of walking. But look, when the
brothers reached home, no supper was waiting, the
beds were not made, and the dust lay thick on
the threshold. What, were all in the house dead?
Then they saw their mother sitting on the floor in a
dark corner of the cottage. Her hair was drawn
down over her face, and she sat and traced patterns
with her finger on the earth floor. “What is the
matter?” said the brothers. She did not look up;
she spoke as if she had spoken to the earth. “We
are beggared, beggared.” “Do they want to take
our house from us?” cried the brothers. “They
wish to take away our honor and our daily bread.”</p>

<p>Then she told: “Your eldest sister has had employment
with Baker Gasparo, and it has been good
employment. Signor Gasparo gave Pepa all the
bread left over in the shop, and she brought it to
me. There has been so much that there was enough
for us all. I have been happy ever since Pepa found
that employment. It will give me an old age free
from care, I thought. But last Monday Pepa came
home to me and wept; Signora Gasparo had turned
her away.”</p>

<p>“What had Pepa done?” asked Nino, who was
next younger to Falco.</p>

<p>“Signora Gasparo accused Pepa of stealing bread.
I went to Signora Gasparo and asked her to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Pepa back. ‘No,’ she said, ‘the girl is not honest.’
‘Pepa had the bread from Signor Gasparo,’ I said;
‘ask him.’ ‘I cannot ask him,’ said the signora;
‘he is away, and comes home next month.’ ‘Signora,’
I said, ‘we are so poor. Let Pepa come
back to her place.’ ‘No,’ she said; ‘I myself will
leave Signor Gasparo if he takes that girl back.’
‘Take care,’ I said then; ‘if you take bread from
me, I will take life from you.’ Then she was
frightened and called others in, so that I had to
go.”</p>

<p>“What is to be done about it?” said Nino. “Pepa
must find some other work.”</p>

<p>“Nino,” said Mother Zia, “you do not know what
that woman has said to the neighbors about Pepa
and Signor Gasparo.”</p>

<p>“Who can prevent women from talking?” said
Nino.</p>

<p>“If Pepa has nothing else to do, now she might
at least have cooked dinner for us,” said Turiddo.</p>

<p>“Signora Gasparo has said that her husband let
Pepa steal bread that she should&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mother,” interrupted Nino, red as fire, “I do
not intend to have myself put in the galleys for
Pepa’s sake.”</p>

<p>“The galleys do not eat Christians,” said Mother
Zia.</p>

<p>“Nino,” said Pietro, “we had better go to the
town to get some food.”</p>

<p>As they said it they heard some one laugh behind
them. It was Falco who laughed.</p>

<p>A while later Falco entered Signora Gasparo’s
shop and asked for bread. The poor woman was
frightened when Pepa’s brother came into the shop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
But she thought: “He has just come from his work.
He has not been home yet. He knows nothing.”</p>

<p>“Beppo,” she said to him, for Falco’s name was
not then Falco, “is the harvest a good one?” And
she was prepared not to have him answer.</p>

<p>Falco was more talkative than usual, and immediately
told her how many grapes had already been
put through the press. “Do you know,” he continued,
“that a farmer was murdered yesterday.”&mdash;“Alas,
yes, poor Signor Riego; I heard so.” And
she asked how it had happened.</p>

<p>“It was Salvatore who did it. But it is too
dreadful for a signora to hear!”&mdash;“Oh, no, what is
done can be and is told.”</p>

<p>“Salvatore went up to him in this way, signora.”
And Falco drew his knife and laid his hand on the
woman’s head. “Then he cut him across the throat
from ear to ear.”</p>

<p>As Falco spoke, he suited the action to the word.
The woman did not even have time to scream. It
was the work of a master.</p>

<p>After that, Falco was sent to the galleys, where he
remained five years.</p>

<p>When the people tell of that, their terror increases.
“Falco is brave,” they say. “Nothing in the world
can frighten him away from his purpose.”</p>

<p>That immediately made them think of another
story.</p>

<p>Falco was taken to the galleys in August, where
he became acquainted with Biagio, who afterwards
followed him through his whole life. One day he
and Biagio and a third prisoner were ordered to go
to work in the fields. One of the overseers wished
to construct a garden around his house. They dug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
there quietly, but their eyes began to wander and
wander. They were outside the walls; they saw
the plain and the mountains; they even saw up to
Etna. “It is the time,” whispered Falco to Biagio.
“I will rather die than go back to prison,” said
Biagio. Then they whispered to the other prisoner
that he must stand by them. He did not wish to
do so, because his time of punishment was soon
up. “Else we will kill you,” they said, and then he
agreed.</p>

<p>The guard stood over them with his loaded rifle
in his hand. On account of their fetters, Falco and
Biagio hopped with feet together over to the guard.
They swung their shovels over him, and before he
had time to think of shooting he was thrown down,
bound, and had a clump of earth in his mouth.
Thereupon the prisoners pried open their chains
with the shovels, so that they could take a step, and
crept away over the plain to the hills.</p>

<p>When night came Falco and Biagio abandoned
the prisoner whom they had taken with them. He
was old and feeble, so that he would have hindered
their flight. The next day he was seized by the
carabinieri, and shot.</p>

<p>They shudder when they think of it. “Falco is
merciless,” they say. They know that he will not
spare the railway.</p>

<p>Story after story comes to frighten the poor people
working on the railway on the slopes of Etna.</p>

<p>They tell of all the sixteen murders that Falco
has committed. They tell of his attacks and
plunderings.</p>

<p>There is one story more terrifying than all the
others together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>When Falco escaped from the galleys he lived in
the woods and caves, and in the big quarry near
Diamante. He soon gathered a band about him,
and became a wonderful and famous brigand hero.</p>

<p>All his family were held in much greater consideration
than before. They were respected, as the
mighty are respected. They scarcely needed to
work, for Falco loved his relations and was generous
to them. But he was not lenient towards them; he
was very stern.</p>

<p>Mother Zia was dead, and Nino was married and
lived in his father’s cottage. It happened one day
that Nino needed money, and he knew no better way
than to go to the priest,&mdash;not Don Matteo, but to
old Don Giovanni. “Your Reverence,” said Nino
to him, “my brother asks you for five hundred lire.”
“Where shall I find five hundred lire?” said Don
Giovanni. “My brother needs them; he must have
them,” said Nino.</p>

<p>Then old Don Giovanni promised to give the
money, if he only were given time to collect it.
Nino was hardly willing to agree to that. “You
can scarcely expect me to take five hundred lire
from my snuff-box,” said Don Giovanni. And
Nino granted him three days’ respite. “But beware
of meeting my brother during that time,” he said.</p>

<p>The next day Don Giovanni rode to Nicolosi to
try to claim a payment. Who should he meet on
the way but Falco and two of his band. Don
Giovanni threw himself from his donkey and fell
on his knees before Falco. “What does this mean,
Don Giovanni?”&mdash;“As yet I have no money for
you, Falco, but I will try to get it. Have mercy
upon me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Falco asked, and Don Giovanni told the whole
story. “Your Reverence,” said Falco, “he has
been deceiving you.” He begged Don Giovanni
to go with him to Diamante. When they came to
the old house Don Giovanni rode in behind the
wall of San Pasquale, and Falco called Nino out.
Nino came out on one of the balconies. “Eh,
Nino!” said Falco, and laughed. “You have
cheated the priest out of money?” “Do you know
it already?” said Nino. “I was just going to tell
it to you.”</p>

<p>Now Falco became sterner. “Nino,” he said,
“the priest is my friend, and he believes that I
have wished to rob him. You have done very
wrong.” He suddenly put his gun to his shoulder
and shot Nino down, and when he had done so he
turned to Don Giovanni, who had almost fallen
from his donkey with terror. “You see now, your
Reverence, that I had no part in Nino’s designs on
you!”</p>

<p>And that happened twenty years ago, when Falco
had not been a brigand for more than five years.</p>

<p>“Will Falco spare the railway,” people say, as they
tell it, “when he did not spare his own brother?”</p>

<p>There was yet more.</p>

<p>After Nino’s murder there was a vendetta over
Falco. Nino’s wife was so terrified when she found
her husband dead that half her body became paralyzed,
and she could no longer walk. But she took
her place at the window in the old cottage. There
she has sat for twenty years with a gun beside her, and
waited for Falco. And of her the great brigand has
been afraid. For twenty years he has not gone past
the home of his ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman has not deserted her post. No one
ever goes to the church of San Pasquale without
seeing her revengeful eyes shining behind the panes.
Who has ever seen her sleep? Who has seen her
work? She could do nothing but await her husband’s
murderer.</p>

<p>When people hear that, they are even more afraid.
Falco has luck on his side, they think. The woman
who wishes to kill him cannot move from her place.
He has luck on his side. He will also succeed in
destroying the railway. Fortune has never failed
Falco. The carabinieri have hunted, but have
never been able to catch him. The carabinieri have
feared Falco more than Falco has feared the
carabinieri.</p>

<p>People tell a story of a young carabiniere lieutenant
who once pursued Falco. He had arranged
a line of beaters and hunted Falco from one thicket
to another. At last the officer was certain that he
had Falco shut in in a grove. A guard was stationed
round the wood, and the officer searched the covert,
gun in hand. But however much he searched, he
saw no Falco. He came out, and met a peasant.
“Have you seen Falco Falcone?”&mdash;“Yes, signor;
he just went by me, and he asked me to greet you.”&mdash;“<i lang="it">Diavolo!</i>”&mdash;“He
saw you in the thicket, and
he was just going to shoot you, but he did not
do so, because he thought that perhaps it was your
duty to prosecute him.”&mdash;“<i lang="it">Diavolo! Diavolo!</i>”&mdash;“But
if you try another time&mdash;”&mdash;“<i lang="it">Diavolo!
Diavolo! Diavolo!</i>”</p>

<p>Do you think that lieutenant came back? Do you
not think that he instantly sought out a district
where he did not need to hunt brigands?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>And the workmen on Etna asked themselves:
“Who will protect us against Falco? He is terrible.
Even the soldiers tremble before him.”</p>

<p>They remember that Falco Falcone is now an old
man. He no longer plunders post-wagons; he does
not carry off land-owners. He sits quiet generally
in the quarry near Diamante, and instead of robbing
money and estates, he takes money and estates
under his protection.</p>

<p>He takes tribute from the great landed proprietors
and guards their estates from other thieves, and it
has become calm and peaceful on Etna, for he allows
no one to injure those who have paid a tax to him.</p>

<p>But that is not reassuring. Since Falco has
become friends with the great, he can all the more
easily destroy the railway.</p>

<p>And they remember the story of Niccola Galli,
who is overseer on the estate of the Marquis di San
Stefano on the southern side of Etna. Once his
workmen struck in the middle of the harvest time.
Niccola Galli was in despair. The wheat stood
ripe, and he could not get it reaped. His workmen
would not work; they lay down to sleep at the edge
of a ditch.</p>

<p>Niccola placed himself on a donkey and rode down
to Catania to ask his lord for advice. On the way
he met two men with guns on their shoulders.
“Whither are you riding, Niccola?”</p>

<p>Before Niccola had time to say many words they
took his donkey by the bit and turned him round.
“You must not ride to the Marquis, Niccola?”&mdash;“Must
I not?”&mdash;“No; you must ride home.”</p>

<p>As they went along, Niccola sat and shook on his
donkey. When they were again at home the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
said: “Now show us the way to the fields!” And
they went out to the laborers. “Work, you scoundrels!
The marquis has paid his tribute to Falco
Falcone. You can strike in other places, but not
here.” That field was reaped as never before.
Falco stood on one side of it and Biagio on the
other. The grain is soon harvested with such
overseers.</p>

<p>When the people remember that, their terror does
not decrease. “Falco keeps his word,” they say.
“He will do what he has threatened to do.”</p>

<p>No one has been a robber chief as long as Falco.
All the other famous heroes are dead or captives.
He alone keeps himself alive and in his profession
by incredible good fortune and skill.</p>

<p>Gradually he has collected about him all his
family. His brothers-in-law and nephews are all
with him. Most of them have been sent to the
galleys, but not one of them thinks whether he
suffers in prison; he only asks if Falco is satisfied
with him.</p>

<p>In the newspapers there are often accounts of
Falco’s deeds. Englishmen thrust a note of ten
lire into their guide’s hand if he will show them the
way to Falco’s quarry. The carabinieri no longer
shoot at him, because he is the last great brigand.</p>

<p>He so little fears to be captured that he often
comes down to Messina or Palermo. He has even
crossed the sound and been in Italy. He went to
Naples when Guglielmo and Umberto were there to
christen a battle-ship. He travelled to Rome when
Umberto and Margherita celebrated their silver
wedding.</p>

<p>The people think of it all, and tremble. “Falco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
is loved and admired,” the workmen say. “The
people worship Falco. He can do what he will.”</p>

<p>They know too that when Falco saw Queen Margherita’s
silver wedding, it pleased him so much
that he said: “When I have lived on Etna for five
and twenty years, I shall celebrate my silver wedding
with Mongibello.”</p>

<p>People laughed at that and said that it was a
good idea of Falco’s. For he had never had a
sweetheart, but Mongibello with its caves and forests
and craters and ice-fields had served and protected
him like a wife. To no one in the world did Falco
owe such gratitude as to Mongibello.</p>

<p>People ask when Falco and Mongibello are going
to celebrate their silver wedding. And people answer
that it will be this spring. Then the workmen
think: “<em>He is coming to destroy our railway on the
day of Mongibello</em>.”</p>

<p>They are filled with doubt and terror. They soon
will not dare to work any more. The nearer the
time approaches when Falco is to celebrate his
union with Mongibello, the more there are who
leave Signor Alfredo. Soon he is practically alone
at the work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are not many people in Diamante who have
seen the big quarry on Etna. They have learned to
avoid it because Falco Falcone lives there. They
have been careful to keep out of range of his gun.</p>

<p>They have not seen the great hole in Mongibello’s
side from which their ancestors, the Greeks, took
stone in remote times. They have not seen the
beautifully colored walls, and the mighty rocks that
look like ruined pillars. Perhaps they do not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
that on the bottom of the quarry grow more magnificent
flowers than in a conservatory. There it is no
longer Sicily; it is India.</p>

<p>In the quarry are mandarin trees, so yellow with
fruit that they look like gigantic sun-flowers; the
camellias are as big as tambourines; and on the
ground between the trees lie masses of magnificent
figs and downy peaches embedded in fallen rose-leaves.</p>

<p>One evening Falco is sitting alone in the quarry.
Falco is busy making a wreath, and he has beside
him a mass of flowers. The string he is using is as
thick as a rope; he holds his foot on the ball so
that it shall not roll away from him. He wears
spectacles, which continually slip too far down his
hooked nose.</p>

<p>Falco is swearing horribly, for his hands are stiff
and callous from incessantly handling a gun, and
cannot readily hold flowers. The fingers squeeze
them together like steel tongs. Falco swears because
the lilies and anemones fall into little pieces if he
merely looks at them.</p>

<p>Falco sits in his leather breeches and in the long,
buttoned-up coat, buried in flowers like a saint on a
feast-day. Biagio and his nephew, Passafiore, have
gathered them for him. They have piled up in
front of him an Etna of the most beautiful flowers of
the quarry. Falco can choose among lilies and
cactus-flowers and roses and pelargoniums. He
roars at the flowers that he will trample them to
dust under his leather sandals if they do not submit
themselves to his will.</p>

<p>Never before has Falco Falcone had to do with
flowers. In the whole course of his life he has never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
tied a nosegay for a girl, or plucked a rose for his
button-hole. He has never even laid a wreath on
his mother’s grave.</p>

<p>Therefore the delicate flowers rebel against him.
The flower sprays are entangled in his hair and in
his hat, and the petals have caught in his bushy
beard. He shakes his head violently, and the scar
in his cheek glows red as fire as it used to do in the
old days, when he fought with the carabinieri.</p>

<p>Still the wreath grows, and thick as a tree-trunk
it winds round Falco’s feet and legs. Falco swears
at it as if it were the steel fetters that once dragged
between his ankles. He complains more, when he
tears himself on a thorn or burns himself on a
nettle, than he did when the whip of the galley
guard lashed his back.</p>

<p>Biagio and Passafiore, his nephew, do not dare to
show themselves; they lie concealed in a cave till
everything is ready. They laugh at Falco with all
their might, for such wailings as Falco’s have not
sounded in the quarry since unhappy prisoners of
war were kept at work there.</p>

<p>Biagio looks up to great Etna, which is blushing
in the light of the setting sun. “Look at Mongibello,”
he says to Passafiore; “see how it blushes.
It must guess what Falco is busy with down in the
quarry.” And Passafiore answers: “Mongibello has
probably never thought that it would ever have anything
on its head but ashes and snow.”</p>

<p>But suddenly Biagio stopped laughing. “It is
not well, Passafiore,” he said. “Falco has become
too proud. I am afraid that the great Mongibello
is going to make a fool of him.”</p>

<p>The two bandits look one another in the eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
questioningly. “It is well if it is only pride,” says
Passafiore.</p>

<p>But now they look away at the same moment, and
dare say no more. The same thought, the same
dread has seized them both. Falco is going mad.
He is already mad at times. It is always so with
great brigand chiefs; they cannot bear their glory
and their greatness; they all go mad.</p>

<p>Passafiore and Biagio have seen it for a long time,
but they have borne it in silence, and each has
hoped that the other has seen nothing. Now they
understand that they both know it. They press
each other’s hands without a word. There is still
something so great in Falco. Both of them, Passafiore
and Biagio, will take care that no one shall
perceive that he is no longer the man he was.</p>

<p>Finally Falco has his wreath ready; he hangs it
on the barrel of his gun and comes out to the
others. All three climb out of the quarry, and at
the nearest farm-house they take horses in order to
come quickly to the top of Mongibello.</p>

<p>They ride at full gallop so that they have no
chance to talk, but as they pass the different farms
they can see the people dancing on the flat roofs.
And from the sheds, where the laborers sleep at
night, they hear talk and laughter. There happy,
peaceful people are sitting, guessing conundrums
and matching verses. Falco storms by, such things
are not for him. Falco is a great man.</p>

<p>They gallop towards the summit. At first they
ride between almond-trees and cactus, then under
plane-trees and stone-pines, then under oaks and
chestnut-trees.</p>

<p>The night is dark; they see nothing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
beauty of Mongibello. They do not see the vine-encircled
Monte Rosso; they do not see the two
hundred craters that stand in a circle round Etna’s
lofty peak like towers round a town; they do not
see the endless stretches of thick forest.</p>

<p>In Casa del Bosco, where the road ends, they dismount.
Biagio and Passafiore take the wreath and
carry it between them. As they walk along, Falco begins
to talk. He likes to talk since he has grown old.</p>

<p>Falco says that the mountain is like the twenty-five
years of his life that he has passed there. The
years that founded his greatness had blossomed
with deeds. To be with him then had been like
going through an endless arbor, where lemons and
grapes hung down overhead. Then his deeds had
been as numerous as the orange-trees round Etna’s
base. When he had come higher the deeds had
been less frequent, but those he had executed had
been mighty as the oaks and chestnut-trees on the
rising mountain. Now that he was at the summit
of greatness, he scorned to act. His life was as
bald as the mountain top; he was content to see
the world at his feet. But people ought to understand
that, if he should now undertake anything,
nothing could resist him. He was terrible, like the
fire-spouting summit.</p>

<p>Falco walks before and talks; Passafiore and
Biagio follow him in silent terror. Dimly they
see the mighty slopes of Mongibello with their
towns and fields and forests spread out beneath
them. And Falco thinks that he is as mighty as
all that!</p>

<p>As they struggle upwards they are beset with a
growing feeling of dread. The gaping fissures in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
the ground; the sulphur smoke from the crater,
which rolls down the mountain, too heavy to rise
into the air; the explosions inside the mountain;
the incessant, gently rumbling earthquake; the
slippery, rough ice-fields crossed by gushing brooks;
the extreme cold, the biting wind,&mdash;make the walk
hideous. And Falco says that it is like him! How
can he have such things in his soul? Is it filled
with a cold and a horror to be compared to Etna’s?</p>

<p>They stumble over blocks of ice, and they struggle
forward through snow lying sometimes a yard deep.
The mountain blast almost throws them down.
They have to wade through slush and water, for
through the day the sun has melted a mass of snow.
And while they grow stiff with cold, the ground
shakes under them with the everlasting fire.</p>

<p>They remember that Lucifer and all the damned
are lying under them. They shudder because Falco
has brought them to the gates of Hell.</p>

<p>But nevertheless beyond the ice-field they reach
the steep cone of ashes on the very summit of the
mountain. Here they drag themselves up, walking
on sliding ashes and pumice-stone. When they are
half way up the cone Falco takes the wreath, and
motions to the others to wait. He alone will scale
the summit.</p>

<p>The day is just breaking, and as Falco reaches
the top the sun is visible. The glorious morning
light streams over Mongibello and over the old Etna
brigand on its summit. The shadow of Etna is
thrown over the whole of Sicily, and it looks as if
Falco, standing up there, reached from sea to sea,
across the island.</p>

<p>Falco stands and gazes about him. He looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
across to Italy; he fancies he sees Naples and
Rome. He lets his glance pass over the sea to the
land of the Turk to the east and the land of the
Saracen to the south. He feels as if it all lay at
his feet and acknowledged <em>his</em> greatness.</p>

<p>Then Falco lays the wreath on the summit of
Mongibello.</p>

<p>When he comes down to his comrades he solemnly
presses their hands. As he leaves the cone they
see that he picks up a piece of pumice-stone, and
puts it in his pocket. Falco takes with him a
souvenir of the most beautiful hour of his life. He
has never before felt himself so great as on the top
of Mongibello.</p>

<p>On that day of happiness Falco will do no work.
The next day, he says, he will begin the undertaking
of freeing Mongibello from the railway.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a lonely farm-house on the road between
Paternó and Adernó. It is quite large, and it is
owned by a widow, Donna Silvia, who has many
strong sons. They are bold people who dare to live
alone the whole year in the country.</p>

<p>It is the day following the one when Falco crowned
Mongibello. Donna Silvia is sitting on the grass-plot
with her distaff; she is alone; there is no one else
at home on the farm. A beggar comes softly creeping
in through the gate.</p>

<p>He is an old man with a long, hooked nose which
hangs down over his upper lip, a bushy beard, pale
eyes with red eyelids. They are the ugliest eyes
imaginable; the whites are yellowish, and they
squint. The beggar is tall and very thin; he moves
his body when he walks, so that it looks as if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
wriggled forward. He walks so softly that Donna
Silvia does not hear him. The first thing she
notices is his shadow, which, slender as a snake,
bends down towards her.</p>

<p>She looks up when she sees the shadow. Then
the beggar bows to her and asks for a dish of
macaroni.</p>

<p>“I have macaroni on the fire,” says Donna Silvia.
“Sit down and wait; you shall have your fill.”</p>

<p>The beggar sits down beside Donna Silvia, and
after a while they begin to chat. They soon talk
of Falco.</p>

<p>“Is it true that you let your sons work on Donna
Micaela’s railway?” says the beggar.</p>

<p>Donna Silvia bites her lips together, and nods an
assent.</p>

<p>“You are a brave woman, Donna Silvia. Falco
might be revenged on you.”</p>

<p>“Then he can take revenge,” says Donna Silvia.
“But I will not obey one who has killed my father.
He forced him to escape from prison in Augusta,
and my father was captured and shot.”</p>

<p>And so saying she rises and goes in to get the
food.</p>

<p>As she stands in the kitchen she sees the beggar
through the window, sitting and rocking on the
stone-bench. He is not quiet for a moment. And
in front of him writhes his shadow, slender and
lithe as a snake.</p>

<p>Donna Silvia remembers what she had once heard
Caterina, who had been married to Falco’s brother,
Nino, say. “How will you recognize Falco after
twenty years?” people had asked her. “Should I
not recognize the man with the snake-shadow?” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
answered. “He will never lose it, long as he may
live.”</p>

<p>Donna Silvia presses her hand on her heart.
There in her yard Falco Falcone is sitting. He
has come to be revenged because her sons work on
the railway. Will he set fire to the house, or will
he murder her?</p>

<p>Donna Silvia is shaking in every limb as she
serves up her macaroni.</p>

<p>Falco begins to find the time long as he sits on
the stone-bench. A little dog comes up to him and
rubs against him. Falco feels in his pocket for a
piece of bread, but he finds only a stone, which he
throws to the dog.</p>

<p>The dog runs after the stone and brings it back
to Falco. Falco throws it again. The dog takes
the stone again, but now he runs away with it.</p>

<p>Falco remembers that it is the stone he picked up
on Mongibello, and goes after the dog to get it
back. He whistles to the dog, and it comes to him
instantly. “Drop the stone!” The dog puts its
head on one side and will not drop it. “Ah, give
me the stone, rascal!” The dog shuts its mouth.
It has no stone. “Let me see; let me see!” says
Falco. He bends the dog’s head back and forces it
to open its mouth. The stone lies far in under the
gums, and Falco tries to force it out. Then the
dog bites him, till the blood flows.</p>

<p>Falco is terrified. He goes in to Donna Silvia.
“I hope your dog is healthy,” he says.</p>

<p>“My dog? I have no dog. It is dead.”&mdash;“But
the one running outside?”&mdash;“I do not know which
one you mean,” she says.</p>

<p>Falco says nothing more, nor does he do Donna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Silvia any harm. He simply goes his way, frightened;
he thinks that the dog is mad, and he fears
hydrophobia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One evening Donna Micaela sits alone in the
music-room. She has put out the lamp and opened
the balcony doors. She likes to listen to the street
in the evening and at night. No more smiths and
stone-cutters and criers are heard. There is song,
laughter, whispering, and mandolins.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sees a dark hand laid on the balcony
railing. The hand drags up after it an arm and a
head; within a moment a whole human being swings
himself into the balcony. She sees him plainly,
for the street-lamps are still burning. He is a
small, broad-shouldered, bearded fellow, dressed
like a shepherd, with leather sandals, a slouch hat,
and an umbrella tied to his back. As soon as he is
on his feet he snatches his gun from his shoulder
and comes into the room with it in his hands.</p>

<p>She sits still without giving a sign of life. There
is no time either to summon help or to escape. She
hopes that the man will take what he wishes to
take, and go away without noticing her, sitting back
in the dark room.</p>

<p>The man puts his gun down between his legs, and
she hears him scratching with a match. She shuts
her eyes. He will believe that she is asleep.</p>

<p>When the robber gets the match lighted, he sees
her instantly. He coughs to wake her. As she
remains motionless, he creeps over to her and carefully
stretches out a finger towards her arm. “Do
not touch me! do not touch me!” she screams, and
can no longer sit still. The man draws back instantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
“Dear Donna Micaela, I only wanted to
wake you.”</p>

<p>There she sits and shakes with terror, and he
hears how she is sobbing. “Dear signora, dear
signora!” he says. “Light a candle that I can see
where you are,” she cries. He scratches a new
match, lifts the shade and chimney off the lamp,
and lights it as neatly as a servant. He places himself
again by the door, as far from her as possible.
Suddenly he goes out on the balcony with his gun.
“Now the signora cannot be afraid any longer.”</p>

<p>But when she does not cease weeping he says:
“Signora, I am Passafiore; I come with a message
to you from Falco. He no longer wishes to destroy
your railway.”</p>

<p>“Have you come to jest with me?” she says.</p>

<p>Then the man answers, almost weeping: “Would
God that it were a jest! God! that Falco were the
man he has been!”</p>

<p>He tells her how Falco went up Mongibello and
crowned its top. But the mountain had not liked
it; it had now overthrown Falco. A single little
piece of pumice-stone from Mongibello had been
enough to overthrow him.</p>

<p>“It is all over with Falco,” says Passafiore. “He
goes about in the quarry, and waits to fall ill. For
a week he has neither slept nor eaten. He is not
sick yet, but the wound in his hand does not heal
either. He thinks that he has the poison in his
body. ‘Soon I shall be a mad dog,’ he says. No
wine nor food tempt him. He takes no pleasure in
my praising his deeds. ‘What is that to talk
about?’ he says. ‘I shall end my life like a mad
dog.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Donna Micaela looked sharply at Passafiore.
“What do you wish me to do about it? You cannot
mean that I am to go down into the quarry to Falco
Falcone?”</p>

<p>Passafiore looks down and dares not answer anything.</p>

<p>She explains to him what that same Falco has
made her suffer. He has frightened away her workmen.
He has set himself against her dearest wish.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Passafiore falls on his knees. He
dares not go a step nearer to her than he is, but he
falls on his knees.</p>

<p>He implores her to understand the importance of
it. She does not know, she does not understand
who Falco is. Falco is a great man. Ever since
Passafiore was a little child he has heard of him.
All his life long he has longed to come out to the
quarry and live with him. All his cousins went to
Falco; his whole race were with him. But the
priest had set his heart that Passafiore should not
go. He apprenticed him to a tailor; only think, to
a tailor! He talked to him, and said that he should
not go. It was such a terrible sin to live like Falco.
Passafiore had also struggled against it for many
years for Don Matteo’s sake. But at last he had
not been able to resist; he had gone to the quarry.
And now he has not been with Falco more than a
year before the latter is quite destroyed. It is as
if the sun had gone out in the sky. His whole life
is ruined.</p>

<p>Passafiore looks at Donna Micaela. He sees that
she is listening to him, and understands him.</p>

<p>He reminds Donna Micaela that she had helped a
<i lang="it">jettatore</i> and an adulteress. Why should she be hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
to a brigand? The Christ-image in San Pasquale
gave her everything she asked for. He was sure
that she prayed to the Christchild to protect the
railway from Falco. And he had obeyed her; he
had made Mongibello’s pumice-stone break Falco’s
might. But now, would she not be gracious, and
help them, that Falco might get his health again,
and be an honor to the land, as he had been before?</p>

<p>Passafiore succeeds in moving Donna Micaela.
All at once she understands how it is with the old
brigand in the dark caves of the quarry. She sees
him there, waiting for madness. She thinks how
proud he has been, and how broken and crushed he
now is. No, no; no one ought to suffer so. It is
too much, too much.</p>

<p>“Passafiore,” she exclaims, “tell me what you
wish. I will do whatever I can. I am no longer
afraid. No, I am not at all afraid.”</p>

<p>“Donna Micaela, we have begged Falco to go to
the Christchild and ask for grace. But Falco will
not believe in the image. He will not do anything
but sit still and wait for the disaster. But to-day,
when I implored him to go and pray, he said: ‘You
know who sits and waits for me in the old house
opposite the church. Go to her, and ask her if
she will give me the privilege to go by her into
the church. If she gives her permission, then I
shall believe in the image, and say my prayers to
him.’”</p>

<p>“Well?” questions Donna Micaela.</p>

<p>“I have been to old Caterina, and she has given
her permission. ‘He shall be allowed to go into
San Pasquale without my killing him,’ she said.”</p>

<p>Passafiore is still on his knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has Falco already been to the church?” asks
Donna Micaela.</p>

<p>Passafiore moves somewhat nearer. He wrings
his hands in despair. “Donna Micaela, Falco is
very ill. It is not alone that about the dog; he was
ill before.” And Passafiore struggles with himself
before he can say it out. At last he acknowledges
that although Falco is a very great man, he sometimes
has attacks of madness. He had not spoken
of old Caterina alone; he had said: “If Caterina
will let me go into the church, and if Donna Micaela
Alagona comes down into the quarry and gives me
her hand, and leads me to the church, I will go to
the image.” And from that no one had been able
to move him. Donna Micaela, who was greatest
and holiest of women, must come to him, or he
would not go.</p>

<p>When Passafiore has finished, he remains kneeling
with bowed head. He dares not look up.</p>

<p>But Donna Micaela does not hesitate a second,
since there has been question of the Christ-image.
She seems not to think of Falco’s being already
mad. She does not say a word of her terror. Her
faith in the image is such that she answers softly,
like a subdued and obedient child:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Passafiore, I will go with you.”</p>

<p>She follows him as if walking in her sleep. She
does not hesitate to go with him up Etna. She
does not hesitate to climb down the steep cliffs into
the quarry. She comes, pale as death, but with
shining eyes, to the old brigand in his hole in the
cliff and gives him her hand. He rises up, ghastly
pale as she, and follows her. They do not seem like
human beings, but like spectres. They move on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
towards their goal in absolute silence. Their own
identity is dead, but a mightier spirit guides and
leads them.</p>

<p>Even the day after it seems like a fairy tale to
Donna Micaela that she has done such a thing.
She is sure that her own compassion, or pity, or
love could never have made her go down into the
brigands’ cave at night if a strange power had not
led her.</p>

<p>While Donna Micaela is in the robber’s cave, old
Caterina sits at her window, and waits for Falco.
She has consented, almost without their needing to
ask her.</p>

<p>“He shall go in peace to the church,” she says.
“I have waited for him twenty years, but he shall
go to the church.”</p>

<p>Soon Falco comes by, walking with Donna Micaela’s
hand in his. Passafiore and Biagio follow
him. Falco is bent; it is plain that he is old and
feeble. He alone goes into the church; the others
remain outside.</p>

<p>Old Caterina has seen him very plainly, but she
has not moved. She sits silent all the time Falco
is inside the church. Her niece, who lives with
her, believes that she is praying and thanking God
because she has been able to conquer her thirst for
revenge.</p>

<p>At last Caterina asks her to open a window. “I
wish to see if he still has his snake shadow,” she
says.</p>

<p>But she is gentle and friendly. “Take the gun,
if you wish,” she says. And her niece moves the
gun over to the other side of the table.</p>

<p>At last Falco comes from the church. The moonlight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
falls on his face, and Caterina sees that he is
unlike the Falco she remembered. The terrible
moroseness and arrogance are no longer visible in
his face. He comes bent and broken; he almost
inspires her with pity.</p>

<p>“<em>He</em> helps me,” he says aloud to Passafiore and
Biagio. “He has promised to help me.”</p>

<p>The brigands wish to go, but Falco is so happy
that he must first tell them of his joy.</p>

<p>“I feel no buzzing in my head; there is no burning,
no uneasiness. He is helping me.”</p>

<p>His comrades take him by the hand to lead him
away.</p>

<p>Falco goes a few steps, then stops again. He
straightens himself up, and at the same time moves
his body so that the snake shadow writhes and
twists on the wall.</p>

<p>“I shall be quite well, quite well,” he says.</p>

<p>The men drag him away, but it is too late.</p>

<p>Caterina’s eyes have fallen on the snake shadow.
She can control herself no longer; she throws herself
across the table, takes the gun, shoots and kills
Falco. She had not intended to do it, but when
she saw him it was impossible for her to let him
go. She had cherished the thought of revenge for
twenty years. It took the upper hand over her.</p>

<p>“Caterina, Caterina,” screams her niece.</p>

<p>“He only asked me to be allowed to go in peace
<em>into</em> the church,” answers the old woman.</p>

<p>Old Biagio lays Falco’s body straight, and says
with a grim look:&mdash;</p>

<p>“He would be quite well; quite well.”</p>

<h3 id="II_XI">XI<br />
<span class="smaller">VICTORY</span></h3>

<p>Far back in ancient days the great philosopher
Empedokles lived in Sicily. He was the most
beautiful and the most perfect of men; so wonderful
and so wise that the people regarded him as an
incarnate god.</p>

<p>Empedokles owned a country-place on Etna, and
one evening he prepared a feast there for his friends.
During the repast he spoke such words that they
cried out to him: “Thou art a god, Empedokles;
thou art a god!”</p>

<p>During the night Empedokles thought: “You
have risen as high as you can rise on earth. Now
die, before adversity and feebleness take hold of
you.” And he wandered up to the summit of Etna
and threw himself into the burning crater. “When
no one can find my body,” he thought, “the people
will say that I have been taken up alive to the
gods.”</p>

<p>The next morning his friends searched for him
through the villa and on the mountain. They too
came up to the crater, and there they found by the
crater’s mouth Empedokles’ sandal. They understood
that Empedokles had sought death in the
crater in order to be counted among the immortals.</p>

<p>He would have succeeded had not the mountain
cast up his shoe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>But on account of that story Empedokles’ name
has never been forgotten, and many have wondered
where his villa could have been situated. Antiquaries
and treasure-seekers have looked for it; for
the villa of the wonderful Empedokles was naturally
filled with marble statues, bronzes, and mosaics.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela’s father, Cavaliere Palmeri, had
set his heart on solving the problem of the villa.
Every morning he mounted his pony, Domenico,
and rode away to search for it. He was armed as
an investigator, with a scraper in his belt, a spade
at his side, and a big knapsack on his back.</p>

<p>Every evening, when Cavaliere Palmeri came
home, he told Donna Micaela about Domenico.
During the years that they had ridden about on
Etna, Domenico had become an antiquary. Domenico
turned from the road as soon as he caught sight of a
ruin. He stamped on the ground in places where
excavations should be made. He snorted scornfully
and turned away his head if any one showed him a
counterfeit piece of old money.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela listened with great patience and
interest. She was sure that in case that villa finally
did let itself be found Domenico would get all the
glory of the discovery.</p>

<p>Cavaliere Palmeri never asked his daughter about
<em>her</em> undertaking. He never showed any interest in
the railway. It seemed almost as if he were ignorant
that she was working for it.</p>

<p>It was not singular however; he never showed
interest in anything that concerned his daughter.</p>

<p>One day, as they both sat at the dining-table,
Donna Micaela all at once began to talk of the
railway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>She had won a victory, she said; she had finally
won a victory.</p>

<p>He must hear what news she had received that
day. It was not merely to be a railway between
Catania and Diamante, as she first had thought; it
was to be a railway round the whole of Etna.</p>

<p>By Falco’s death she had not only been rid of
Falco himself, but now the people believed also
that the great Mongibello and all the saints were
on her side. And so there had arisen an agitation
of the people to make the railway an actuality.
Contributions were signed in all the towns of Etna.
A company was formed. To-day the concession had
come; to-morrow the work was to begin in earnest.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela was excited; she could not eat.
Her heart swelled with joy and thankfulness. She
could not help talking of the tremendous enthusiasm
that had seized the people. She spoke with tears
in her eyes of the Christchild in the church of San
Pasquale.</p>

<p>It was touching to see how her face shone with
hope. It was as if she had, besides the happiness
of which she was speaking, a whole world of bliss
in expectation.</p>

<p>That evening she felt that Providence had guided
her well and happily. She perceived that Gaetano’s
imprisonment had been the work of God to lead
him back to faith. He would be set free by the
miracles of the little image, and that would convert
him so that he would become a believer as before.
And she might be his. How good God was!</p>

<p>And while this great bliss stirred within her,
her father sat opposite her quite cold and indifferent.</p>

<p>“It was very extraordinary,” was all he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will come to-morrow to the ceremony of
the laying of the foundations?”</p>

<p>“I do not know; I have my investigations.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela began to crumble her bread rather
hastily. Her patience was exhausted. She had
not asked him to share her sorrows, but her joys;
he must share her joys!</p>

<p>All at once the shackles of submission and fear,
which had bound her ever since the time of his
imprisonment, broke.</p>

<p>“You who ride so much about Etna,” she said
with a very quiet voice, “must have also come to
Gela?”</p>

<p>The cavaliere looked up and seemed to search his
memory. “Gela, Gela?”</p>

<p>“Gela is a village of a hundred houses, which is
situated on the southern side of Monte Chiaro, quite
at its foot,” continued Donna Micaela, with the most
innocent expression. “It is squeezed in between
Simeto and the mountain, and a branch of the river
generally flows through the principal street of Gela
so that it is very unusual to be able to pass dry-shod
through the village. The roof of the church
fell in during the last earthquake, and it has never
been mended, for Gela is quite destitute. Have
you really never heard of Gela?”</p>

<p>Cavaliere Palmeri answered with inexpressible
solemnity: “My investigations have taken me up
the mountain. I have not thought of looking for
the great philosopher’s villa in Gela.”</p>

<p>“But Gela is an interesting town,” said Donna
Micaela, obstinately. “They have no separate out-houses
there. The pigs live on the lower floor, the
people one flight up. There is an endless number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
of pigs in Gela. They thrive better than the
people, for the people are almost always sick.
Fever is always raging there; malaria never leaves
it. It is so damp that the cellars are always under
water, and it is wrapped in swamp mists every
night. In Gela there are no shops and no police,
nor post-office, nor doctor, nor apothecary. Six
hundred people are living there forgotten and brutalized.
You have never heard of Gela?” She looked
honestly surprised.</p>

<p>Cavaliere Palmeri shook his head. “Of course
I have heard the name&mdash;”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela cast a questioning glance on her
father. She then bent quickly forward towards
him, and drew out of his breastpocket a small, bent
knife, such a knife as is used to prune grape-vines.</p>

<p>“Poor Empedokles,” she said, and all at once her
whole face sparkled with fun. “You may believe
you have mounted to the gods, but Etna always
throws up your shoe.”</p>

<p>Cavaliere Palmeri sank back as if shot.</p>

<p>“Micaela!” he said, feebly fencing like some one
who does not know how he shall defend himself.</p>

<p>But she was instantly as serious and innocent as
before. “I have been told,” she said, “that Gela
a few years ago was on the way to ruin. All the
people there grow grapes, and when the phylloxera
came and destroyed their vineyards, they almost
starved to death. The Agricultural Society sent
them some of those American plants that are not
affected by the phylloxera. The people of Gela set
them out, but all the plants died. How could the
people of Gela know how to tend American vines?
Well, some one came and taught them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>“Micaela!”&mdash;it came almost like a wail. Donna
Micaela thought that her father already looked like
a conquered man, but she continued as if she had
noticed nothing.</p>

<p>“<em>Some one came</em>,” she said with strong emphasis,
“and he had had new vines sent out. He began to
plant them in their vineyards. They laughed at
him; they said that he was mad. But look, his
vines grew and lived; they did not die. And he
has saved Gela.”</p>

<p>“I do not think that your story is entertaining,
Micaela,” said Cavaliere Palmeri with an attempt to
interrupt her.</p>

<p>“It is quite as entertaining as your investigations,”
she said, calmly. “But I will tell you
something. One day I went into your room to get
a book on antiquities. Then I found that all your
bookshelves were full of pamphlets about the phylloxera,
about the cultivation of grapes, about wine-making.”</p>

<p>The cavaliere twisted on his chair like a worm.
“Be silent; be silent!” he said feebly. He was
more embarrassed than when he was accused of
theft.</p>

<p>Now all the suppressed fun shone once more in
her eyes.</p>

<p>“I sometimes looked at the letters you sent off,”
she continued. “I wished to see with what learned
men you corresponded. It surprised me that the
letters were always addressed to presidents and
secretaries of Agricultural Societies.”</p>

<p>Cavaliere Palmeri was unable to utter a word.
Donna Micaela enjoyed his helplessness more than
can be described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked him steadily in the eyes. “I do not
believe that Domenico has yet learned to recognize
a ruin,” she said with emphasis. “The dirty children
of Gela play with him every day, and feed him
with water-cresses. Domenico seems to be a god in
Gela, to say nothing of his&mdash;”</p>

<p>Cavaliere Palmeri seemed to have an idea.</p>

<p>“Your railway,” he said; “what did you say
about your railway? Perhaps I really can come
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela did not listen to him. She took
up her pocket-book.</p>

<p>“I have here a counterfeit old coin,” she said,&mdash;“a
‘Demarata’ of nickel. I bought it to show
Domenico. He is going to snort.”</p>

<p>“Listen, child!”</p>

<p>She did not answer his attempts to make amends.
Now the power was hers. It would take more than
that to pacify her.</p>

<p>“Once I opened your knapsack to look at your
antiquities. The only thing there was an old grape-vine.”</p>

<p>She was full of sparkling gayety.</p>

<p>“Child, child!”</p>

<p>“What is it to be called? It does not seem to
be investigating. Is it perhaps charity; is it perhaps
atonement&mdash;”</p>

<p>Cavaliere Palmeri struck with his clenched fist on
the table so that the glasses and plates rang. It
was unbearable. A dignified and solemn old gentleman
could not endure such mockery. “As surely
as you are my daughter, you must be silent now.”</p>

<p>“Your daughter!” she said, and her gayety was
gone in an instant; “am I really your daughter?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
The children in Gela are allowed to caress at least
Domenico, but I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What do you wish, Micaela, what do you want?”</p>

<p>They looked at one another, and their eyes simultaneously
filled with tears.</p>

<p>“I have no one but you,” she murmured.</p>

<p>Cavaliere Palmeri opened his arms unconditionally
to her. She rose hesitatingly; she did not
know if she saw right.</p>

<p>“I know how it is going to be,” he said, grumblingly;
“not one minute will I have to myself.”</p>

<p>“To find the villa?”</p>

<p>“Come here and kiss me, Micaela! To-night is
the first time since we left Catania that you have
been irresistible.”</p>

<p>When she threw her arms about him it was with
a hoarse, wild cry which almost frightened him.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE OASIS AND THE DESERT</span></h3>

<p>In the spring of 1894 the Etna railway was begun;
in the autumn of 1895 it was finished. It went up
from the shore, made a circuit round the mountain
in a wide half-circle, and came down again to the
shore.</p>

<p>Trains come and go every day, and Mongibello
lies subdued and makes no sign. Foreigners pass
with amazement through the black, distorted lava
streams, through the groves of white almond-trees,
through the dark old Saracen towns. “Look, look!
is there such a land on earth!” they say.</p>

<p>In the railway carriages there is always some one
telling of the time when the Christ-image was in
Diamante.</p>

<p>What a time! What a time! Each day new
miracles were performed. They cannot tell of them
all, but he brought as much happiness to Diamante
as if the hours of the day had been dancing maidens.
People thought that Time had filled his hour-glass
with shining sands of gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>If any one had asked who reigned in Diamante at
that time, the answer would have been that it was
the Christ-image. Everything was done according
to his will. No one took a wife, or played in a
lottery, or built himself a house without consulting
him.</p>

<p>Many knife-thrusts were spared for the image’s
sake, many old feuds settled, and many bitter words
were never uttered.</p>

<p>The people had to be good, for they observed that
the image helped those who were peaceable and
helpful. To them he granted the pleasant gifts of
happiness and riches.</p>

<p>If the world had been as it ought to be, Diamante
would soon have become a rich and powerful town.
But instead, that part of the world which did not
believe in the image destroyed all his work. All
the happiness he scattered about him was of no
avail.</p>

<p>The taxes were constantly increased, and took all
their money. There was the war in Africa. How
could the people be happy when their sons, their
money, and their mules had to go to Africa? The
war did not go well; one defeat followed another.
How could they be happy when their country’s honor
was at stake?</p>

<p>Especially after the railway had been finished was
it manifest that Diamante was like an oasis in a
great desert. An oasis is exposed to the drifting
sands of the desert and to robbers and wild beasts.
So was also Diamante. The oasis would have to
spread over the whole desert to feel secure. Diamante
began to believe that it could never be happy until
the whole world worshipped its Christ-image.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>It now happened that everything that Diamante
hoped and strove for was denied it.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela and all Diamante longed to get
Gaetano back. When the railway was ready Donna
Micaela went to Rome and asked for his release,
but it was refused her. The king and the queen
would have liked to help her, but they could not.
You know who was minister then. He ruled Italy
with a hand of iron; do you think that he allowed
the king to pardon a rebellious Sicilian?</p>

<p>The people also longed that the Christchild of
Diamante should have the adoration that was his
due, and Donna Micaela sought an audience for his
sake with the old man in the Vatican. “Holy
Father,” she said, “let me tell you what has been
taking place in Diamante on the slopes of Etna!”
And when she had told of all the miracles performed
by the image, she asked the pope to have the old
church of San Pasquale purified and consecrated,
and to appoint a priest for the worship of the Christchild.</p>

<p>“Dear Princess Micaela,” said the pope, “those
incidents of which you speak, the church dares not
consider miracles. But you need not at all despair.
If the Christchild wishes to be worshipped in your
town, he will give one more sign. He will show
Us his will so plainly that We shall not need to
hesitate. And forgive an old man, my daughter,
because he has to be cautious!”</p>

<p>A third thing the people of Diamante had hoped.
They had expected at last to hear something from
Gaetano. Donna Micaela journeyed also to Como,
where he was held prisoner. She had letters of
recommendation from the highest quarters in Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
and she was sure that she would be allowed to speak
to him. But the director of the prison sent her to
the prison doctor.</p>

<p>The latter forbade her to speak to Gaetano.</p>

<p>“You wish to see the prisoner?” he said. “You
shall not do it. Do you say that he loves you and
believes you to be dead? Let him think it! Let
him believe it! He has bowed his head to Death.
He suffers no longing. Do you wish him to know
that you are alive, so that he may begin to long?
You wish, perhaps, to kill him? I will tell you
something; if he begins to long for life, he will be
dead within three months.”</p>

<p>He spoke so positively that Donna Micaela understood
that she must give up seeing Gaetano. But
what a disappointment, what a disappointment!</p>

<p>When she came home, she felt like one who has
dreamt so vividly that he cannot, even after he is
awake, rouse himself from his visions. She could
not realize that all her hopes had been a mockery.
She surprised herself time after time thinking:
“When I have saved Gaetano.” But now she no
longer had any hope of saving him.</p>

<p>She thought now of one, now of another enterprise,
on which she wished to embark. Should she
drain the plain, or should she begin to quarry marble
on Etna. She hesitated and wondered. She could
not keep her mind on anything.</p>

<p>The same indolence that had taken possession of
Donna Micaela crept through the whole town. It
was soon plain that everything that depended on
people who did not believe in the Christchild of
Diamante was badly managed and unsuccessful.
Even the Etna railway was conducted in the wrong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
way. Accidents were happening constantly on the
steep inclines; and the price of the tickets was
too high. The people began to use the omnibuses
and post wagons again.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela and others with her began to
think of carrying the Christ-image out into the
world. They would go out and show how he gave
health and subsistence and happiness to all who
were quiet and industrious and helped their neighbor.
If people could once see, they would certainly
be converted.</p>

<p>“The image ought to stand on the Capitol and
govern the world,” said the people of Diamante.</p>

<p>“All those who govern us are incapable,” said
the people. “We prefer to be guided by the holy
Christchild.”</p>

<p>“The Christchild is powerful and charitable; if
he ruled us, the poor would be rich, and the rich
would have enough. He knows who wish to do
right. If he should come to power, they who now
are ruled would sit in the parliament. He would
pass through the world like a plough with a sharp
edge, and that which now lies unprofitable in the
depths would then bear harvests.”</p>

<p>Before their longed-for plans came to pass, however,
in the first days of March, 1896, the news of
the battle at Adna arrived. The Italians had been
defeated, and several thousands of them were killed
or taken prisoners.</p>

<p>A few days later there was a change of ministry
in Rome. And the man who came to power was
afraid of the rage and despair of the Sicilians. To
pacify them he pardoned out several of the imprisoned
socialists. The five for whom he thought the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
longed most were set free. They were Da Felice,
Bosco, Verro, Barbato and Alagona.</p>

<p>Ah, Micaela tried to be glad when she heard it.
She tried not to weep.</p>

<p>She had believed that Gaetano was in prison
because the Christ-image was to break down the
walls of his cell. He was sent there by the grace
of God, because he had to be forced to bow his head
before the Christchild and say: “My Lord and my
God.”</p>

<p>But now it was not the image which had freed
him; he would come out the same heathen as
before; the same yawning chasm would still exist
between them.</p>

<p>She tried to be glad. It was enough that he was
free. What did she or her happiness matter in
comparison to that!</p>

<p>But it happened so with everything for which
Diamante had hoped and striven.</p>

<p>The great desert was very cruel to the poor oasis.</p>

<h3 id="III_II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">IN PALERMO</span></h3>

<p>At last, at last, it is one o’clock at night. Those
who are afraid to oversleep rise from their beds,
dress themselves and go out into the street.</p>

<p>And those who have sat and hung over a café
table till now start up when they hear steps echo on
the stone pavements. They shake the drowsiness
from their bodies and hurry out. They mingle in
the swiftly increasing stream of people, and the
heavy feet of Time begin to move a little faster.</p>

<p>Mere acquaintances press each other’s hands with
heartfelt warmth. It is plain that the same enthusiasm
fills all souls. And the most absurd people
are out; old university professors, distinguished
noblemen and fine ladies, who otherwise never set
their foot in the street. They are all equally
joyous.</p>

<p>“God! God! that he is coming, that Palermo is to
have him back again!” they say.</p>

<p>The Palermo students, who have not moved from
their usual headquarters in Quattro Canti all night,
have provided torches and colored lanterns. They
were not to be lighted till four o’clock, when the
man they expected was to come; but about two
o’clock one or two of them begin to try whether
their torches burn well. Then they light everything
and greet the flames with cheers. It is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
to stand in darkness when so much joy is
burning within them.</p>

<p>In the hotels the travellers are waked and urged
to get up. “There is a festival in Palermo to-night,
O signori!”</p>

<p>The travellers ask for whom. “For one of the
socialists whom the government has pardoned out of
prison. He is coming now in the steamer from
Naples.”&mdash;“What kind of a man is he?”&mdash;“His
name is Bosco, and the people love him.”</p>

<p>There are preparations everywhere in the night
for his sake. One of the goatherds on Monte
Pellegrino is busy tying little bunches of blue-bells
for his goats to wear in their collars. And as he
has a hundred goats, and they all wear collars&mdash;But
it must be done. His goats could not wander
into Palermo the next morning without being
adorned in honor of the day.</p>

<p>The dressmakers have had to sit at their work
till midnight to finish all the new dresses that are
to be worn that morning. And when such a little
dressmaker has finished her work for others, she
has to think of herself. She puts a couple of plumes
in her hat and piles up bunches of ribbon a yard
high. To-day she must be beautiful.</p>

<p>The long rows of houses begin to be illuminated.
Here and there a rocket whizzes up. Fire-crackers
hiss and snap at every street corner.</p>

<p>The flower shops along Via Vittorio Emanuele
are emptied again and again. Always more, more
of the white orange-blossoms! All Palermo is
filled with the sweet fragrance of the orange-blossoms.</p>

<p>The gate-keeper in Bosco’s house has no peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
for a moment. Magnificent cakes and towerlike
bouquets are incessantly passing up the stairway,
and poems of welcome and telegrams of congratulation
are constantly coming. There is no end to
them.</p>

<p>The poor bronze emperor on the Piazza Bologna,
poor, ugly Charles the Fifth, who is forlorn and
thin and wretched as San Giovanni in the desert,
has in some inscrutable manner got a bunch of
flowers in his hand. When the students standing
on Quattro Canti, quite near by, hear of it, they
march up to the emperor in a procession, light him
with their torches, and raise a cheer for the old
despot. And one of them takes his bunch of
flowers to give it to the great socialist.</p>

<p>Then the students march down to the harbor.</p>

<p>Long before they get there their torches are
burnt out, but they do not care. They come with
arms about each other’s necks, singing loudly, and
sometimes breaking off in their song to shout:
“Down with Crispi! Long live Bosco!” The
song begins again, but it is again broken off,
because those who cannot sing throw their arms
round the singers and kiss them.</p>

<p>Guilds and corporations swarm out of the quarters
of the town where the same trade has been carried
on for more than a thousand years. The masons
come with their band of music and their banner;
there come the workers in mosaic; here come the
fishermen.</p>

<p>When the societies meet, they salute one another
with their banners. Sometimes they take time to
stop and make speeches. Then they tell of the five
released prisoners, the five martyrs whom the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
at last has given back to Sicily. And all
the people shout: “Long live Bosco! Long live
Da Felice! Long live Verro! Long live Barbato!
Long live Alagona!”</p>

<p>If any one who has had enough of the life in the
streets comes down to the harbor of Palermo, he
stops and asks: “What place is this? Madonna
Santissima, where am I?”</p>

<p>For he has expected to find the harbor still
deserted and dark.</p>

<p>All the boats and skiffs in the harbor of Palermo
have been taken by different societies and unions.
They are floating about in the harbor, richly hung
with colored Venetian lights, and every minute
great bunches of rockets are sent up from them.</p>

<p>Over the heavy thwarts priceless rugs and hangings
have been spread, and on them sit ladies, the
beautiful Palermo ladies, dressed in light silks and
shaded velvets.</p>

<p>The small craft glide about on the water, now in
big groups, now separately. From the big ships
rise masts and oars covered with pennants and
lights, and the little harbor steam-launches dart
about with funnels wreathed in flowers.</p>

<p>Beneath it all the water lies and shines and
mirrors and reflects, so that the light from one
lantern becomes a stream of brightness, and the
drops that fall from the oars are like a rain of gold.</p>

<p>Round about the harbor stand a hundred thousand,
a hundred and fifty thousand people, quite
delirious with joy. They kiss one another; they
raise shouts of rapture, and they are happy, happy.
They are beside themselves with joy. Many of
them cannot keep from weeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Fire, that is joy. It is good that fires can be
lighted. Suddenly a great blaze flames up on
Monte Pellegrino, just over the harbor. Mighty
flames burst from all the pointed mountain walls
surrounding the town. There are fires on Monte
Falcone, on San Martino, on the mountain of The
Thousands, where Garibaldi passed.</p>

<p>Far out on the sea comes the big Naples steamer.
And on the steamer is Bosco, the socialist.</p>

<p>He cannot sleep that night. He has gone up
from his cabin, and paces to and fro on the deck.
And then his old mother, who has journeyed to
Naples to meet him, comes from her cabin to keep
him company. But he cannot talk with her. He
is thinking that he will soon be at home. Ah,
Palermo, Palermo!</p>

<p>He has been in prison over two years. They
have been two years of suffering and longing, and
has it been of any good? That is what he wishes to
know. Has it been of benefit that he has been
faithful to the cause, and gone to prison? Has
Palermo thought of him? Have his sufferings won
the cause a single follower?</p>

<p>His old mother sits crouched on the gangway, and
shivers in the chill of the night. He has asked
her, but she knows nothing of such things. She
speaks of little Francesco and little Lina, how they
have grown. She knows nothing of what he is
struggling for.</p>

<p>Now he comes to his mother, takes her by the
wrist, leads her to the railing, and asks her if she
sees anything far away to the south. She looks out
over the water with her dim eyes, and sees only the
night, only the black night on the water. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
does not see at all that a cloud of fire is floating on
the horizon.</p>

<p>Then he begins to walk again, and she creeps
down under cover. He does not need to talk to
her; it is joy enough to have him home again after
only two years’ absence. He was condemned to be
away for twenty-four. She had not expected ever
to see him again. But now the king has showed
grace. For the king is a good man. If only he
were allowed to be as good as he wished!</p>

<p>Bosco walks across the deck, and asks the sailors
if they do not see the golden cloud on the horizon.</p>

<p>“That is Palermo,” say the seamen. “There is
always a bright light floating over it at night.”</p>

<p>It cannot be anything that concerns him. He
tries to persuade himself that nothing is being done
for him. He can hardly expect every one all at
once to have become socialists.</p>

<p>But after a while he thinks: “Still there must be
something unusual going on. All the sailors are
gathering forward at the bow.”</p>

<p>“Palermo is burning,” say the seamen.</p>

<p>Yes, that is what it must be.&mdash;It is because he
has suffered so terribly that he expects something
should be done for him.</p>

<p>Then the sailors see the fires on the mountains.</p>

<p>It cannot be a conflagration. It must be some
saint’s day. They ask one another what day it is.</p>

<p>He, too, tries to believe that it is some such
thing. He asks his mother if it is a feast-day.
They have so many of them.</p>

<p>They come nearer and nearer. The thundering
sound of the festival in the great city meets them.</p>

<p>“All Palermo is singing and playing to-night,”
says one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>“A telegram must have come of a victory in
Africa,” says another.</p>

<p>No one has a thought that it can be for his sake.
He goes and places himself at the stern in order not
to see anything. He will not deceive himself with
false hopes. Would all Palermo be illuminated for
a poor socialist?</p>

<p>Then his mother comes and fetches him. “Do
not stand there! Come and see Palermo! It must
be a king who is coming there to-day. Come and
look at Palermo!”</p>

<p>He considers a moment. No, he does not think
that any king is visiting Sicily just now. But he
cannot dare to think, when no one else, not even his
mother&mdash;</p>

<p>All at once every one on the steamer gives a loud
cry. It sounds almost like a cry of distress. A big
cutter has steered right down on them and now
glides along by the steamer’s side.</p>

<p>The cutter is all flowers and lights; over the
railing hang red and white silken draperies, everybody
on board is dressed in red and white. Bosco
stands on the steamer and looks to see what that
beautiful messenger brings. Then the sail turns,
and on its white surface shines to meet him: “Long
live Bosco!”</p>

<p>It is his name. Not a saint’s, not a king’s, not
the victorious general’s! The homage is for no
other on the steamer. His name, his name!</p>

<p>The cutter sends up some rockets; a whole cloud
of stars rain down, and then it is gone.</p>

<p>He enters the harbor, and there is jubilation
and enthusiasm and cheering and adoration. People
say: “We do not know how he will be able to live
through it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>But as soon as he realizes the homage, he feels
that he does not at all deserve it. He would like
to fall on his knees before those hundred and fifty
thousand people who pay him homage and pray to
them for forgiveness that he is so powerless, that he
has done nothing for them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As though by a special fate, Donna Micaela is
in Palermo that night. She is there to start one of
those new undertakings which she thinks she ought
to organize in order to retain life and reason. She
is probably there either on account of the draining
or of the marble quarry.</p>

<p>She is down at the harbor; like all the others.
People notice her as she pushes her way forward to
the edge of the water: a tall, dark woman, with an
air of being some one, a pale face with marked
features and imploring, longing, passionate eyes.</p>

<p>During the reception in the harbor, Donna Micaela
is fighting out a strange struggle. “If it were
Gaetano,” she thinks, “could I, could I&mdash;</p>

<p>“If it were for him all these people were rejoicing,
could I&mdash;”</p>

<p>There is so much joy&mdash;a joy the like of which she
has never seen. The people love one another and
are like brothers. And that not only because a
socialist is coming home, but because they all
believe that the earth will soon be happy. “If he
were to come now, while all this joy is roaring
about me,” she thinks. “Could I, could I&mdash;”</p>

<p>She sees Bosco’s carriage trying to force a way
through the crowd. It moves forward step by step.
For long moments it stands quite still. It will
take several hours to come up from the harbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>“If it were he, and I saw every one crowding
round him, could I forbear from throwing myself
into his arms? Could I?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As soon as she can work her way out of the crowd
she takes a carriage, drives out of Palermo, and
passes through the plain of Conca d’Oro to the big
Cathedral of the old Norman kings in Monreale.</p>

<p>She goes in, and stands face to face with the most
beautiful image of Christ that human art has created.
High up in the choir sits the blessing-giving Christ
in glowing mosaic. He is mighty and mysterious
and majestic. Without number are they who make
a pilgrimage to Monreale in order to feel the consolation
of gazing upon his face. Without number
are they who in far distant lands long for him.</p>

<p>The ground rocks under any one who sees him for
the first time. His eyes compel the knees of the
foreigner to bend. Without being conscious of it
the lips falter: “Thou, God, art God.”</p>

<p>About the walls of the temple glow the great
events of the world in wonderful mosaic pictures.
They only lead to him. They are only there to
say: “All the past is his; all the present belongs
to him, and all the future.”</p>

<p>The mysteries of life and death dwell within that
head.</p>

<p>There lives the spirit which directs the fate of the
world. There glows the love which shall lead the
world to salvation.</p>

<p>And Donna Micaela calls to him: “Thou son of
God, do not part me from thee! Let no man have
power to part me from thee!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="III_III">III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE HOME-COMING</span></h3>

<p>It is a strange thing to come home. While yet on
the journey, you cannot at all realize how strange it
will be.</p>

<p>When you come down to Reggio on the Strait of
Messina, and see Sicily emerge from the sea like a
bank of fog, you are at first almost impatient. “Is
it nothing else?” you say. “It is only a land like
all others.”</p>

<p>And when you disembark at Messina you are still
impatient. Something ought to have happened
while you have been away. It is dreadful to be met
by the same poverty, the same rags, the same
misery as when you went away.</p>

<p>You see that the spring has come. The fig-trees
are again in leaf; the grape-vines send out tendrils
which grow yards long in a few hours, and a mass
of peas and beans are spread out on the fruit-stands
by the harbor.</p>

<p>If you glance towards the heights above the town,
you see that the gray cactus plants that climb along
the edges of the cliffs are covered with blood-red
flowers. They have blossomed everywhere like
little, glowing flames. It looks as if the flower
cups had been filled with fire, which now is breaking
out.</p>

<p>But, however much the cactus blossoms, it is still
gray and dusty and cobwebby. You say to yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
that the cactus is like Sicily. However many
springs it may blossom, it is still the gray land of
poverty.</p>

<p>It is hard to realize that everything has remained
quiet and the same. Scylla and Charybdis ought to
have begun to roar as in former days. The stone
giant in the Girgenti temple should have risen with
reconstructed limbs. The temple of Selinunto
ought to have raised itself from its ruins. All
Sicily should have awakened.</p>

<p>If you continue your journey from Messina down
the coast, you are still impatient. You see that the
peasants are still ploughing with wooden ploughs
and that their horses are just as thin and broken
and jaded.</p>

<p>Yes, everything is the same. The sun sheds its
light over the earth like a rain of color; the pelargoniums
bloom at the roadside; the sea is a soft pale
blue, and caresses the shore.</p>

<p>Wild mountains with bold peaks line the coast.
Etna’s lofty top shines in the distance.</p>

<p>You notice all at once that something strange is
taking place. All your impatience is gone. Instead
you rejoice in the blossoming earth and in the mountains
and in the sea. You are reclaimed by the
beautiful earth as a bit of her lost property. There
is no time to think of anything but tufts and stones.</p>

<p>At last you approach your real home, the home
of your childhood. What wicked thoughts have
filled your mind while you have been away! You
never wished to see that wretched home again,
because you had suffered too much there. And
then you see the old walled town from afar, and it
smiles at you innocently, unconscious of its guilt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
“Come and love me once more,” it says. And you
can only be happy and grateful because it is willing
to accept your love.</p>

<p>Ah, when you go up the zigzag path that leads to
the gate of the town! The light shade of the olive-tree
falls over you. Was it meant as a caress? A
little lizard scampers along a wall. You have to
stop and look. May not the lizard be a friend of
your childhood who wishes to say good-day?</p>

<p>Suddenly a fear strikes you. Your heart begins
to throb and beat. You remember that you do not
know what you may be going to hear when you
come home. No one has written letters; you have
received none. Everything that recalled home you
have put away. It seemed the most sensible way,
since you were never to come home again. Up to
that moment your feelings for your home have been
dead and indifferent.</p>

<p>But in that moment you do not know how you can
bear it if everything is not exactly the same on the
mountain of your birth. It will be a mortal blow
if there is a single palm missing on Monte Chiaro
or if a single stone has loosened from the town wall.</p>

<p>Where is the big agave at the turn of the cliff?
The agave is not there; it has blossomed and been
cut down. And the stone bench at the street-corner
is broken. You will miss that bench; it has been
such a pleasant resting-place. And look, they have
built a barn on the green meadow under the almond-trees.
You will never again be able to stretch out
there in the flowering clover.</p>

<p>You are afraid of every step. What will you
meet next?</p>

<p>You are so moved that you feel that you could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
weep if a single old beggar-woman has died in your
absence.</p>

<p>No, you did not know that to come home was so
strange.</p>

<p>You came out of prison a few weeks ago, and the
torpor of the prison still has possession of you.
You hardly know if you will take the trouble to go
home. Your beloved is dead; it is too terrible to
tear your longing from its grave. So you drift
aimlessly about, and let one day pass like the next.
At last you pluck up courage. You must go home
to your poor mother.</p>

<p>And when you are there, you feel that you have
been longing for every stone, every blade of grass.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ever since he came into the shop Donna Elisa has
thought: “Now I will tell him of Micaela. Perhaps
he does not even know that she is alive.” But she
puts it off from minute to minute, not only because
she wishes to have him for a while to herself alone,
but also because as soon as she mentions Micaela’s
name he will fall into the anguish and misery of
love. For Micaela will not marry him; she has said
so to Donna Elisa a thousand times. She would
like to free him from prison, but she will not be
the wife of an atheist.</p>

<p>Only for one half-hour will Donna Elisa keep
Gaetano for herself; only for one half-hour.</p>

<p>But even so long she may not sit with his hand in
hers, asking him a thousand questions, for the people
have learned that he has come. All at once the
whole street is full of those who wish to see him.
Donna Elisa has bolted the door, for she knew that
she would not have him in peace a moment after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
they had discovered him, but it was of little avail.
They knock on the windows, and pound on the
door.</p>

<p>“Don Gaetano,” they cry; “Don Gaetano!”</p>

<p>Gaetano comes laughing out to the steps. They
wave their caps and cheer. He hurries down into
the crowd, and embraces one after another.</p>

<p>But that is not what they wish. He must go up
on the steps and make a speech. He must tell
them how cruel the government has been to him,
and how he has suffered in prison.</p>

<p>Gaetano laughs still, and stations himself on the
steps. “Prison,” he says; “what is it to talk
about? I have had my soup every day, and that is
more than many of you can say.”</p>

<p>Little Gandolfo swings his cap and calls to him:
“There are many more socialists in Diamante now
than when you went away, Don Gaetano.”</p>

<p>“How else could it be?” he laughs. “Everybody
must become a socialist. Is socialism anything
dreadful or terrible? Socialism is an idyl.
It is an idyl of one’s own home and happy work, of
which every one dreams from his childhood. A
whole world filled with&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stops, for he has cast a glance towards the
summer-palace. There stands Donna Micaela on
one of the balconies, and looks down at him.</p>

<p>He does not think for a moment that it is an
illusion or a hallucination. He sees instantly that
she is flesh and blood. But just for that reason&mdash;and
also because the prison life has taken all
his strength from him, so that he cannot be considered
a well person&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>He feels a terrible difficulty in holding himself
upright. He clutches in the air with his hands,
tries to get support from the door-post, but nothing
helps. His legs give way under him; he slides
down the steps and strikes his head on the stones.</p>

<p>He lies there like one dead.</p>

<p>Every one rushes to him, carries him in, runs
after surgeon and doctor, prescribes, talks, and proposes
a thousand ways to help him.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa and Pacifica get him finally into one
of the bedrooms. Luca drives the people out and
places himself on guard before the closed door.
Donna Micaela, who came in with the others, was
taken first of them all by the hand and led out. She
was not allowed to stay in at all. Luca had himself
seen Gaetano fall as if from a blow on the temple
when he caught sight of her.</p>

<p>Then the doctor comes, and he makes one attempt
after another to rouse Gaetano. He is not successful;
Gaetano lies as if turned to stone. The doctor
thinks that he received a dangerous blow on the
head when he fell. He does not know whether he
will succeed in bringing him to life.</p>

<p>The swoon in itself was nothing, but that blow
on the hard edge of the stone steps&mdash;</p>

<p>In the house there is an eager bustle. The poor
people outside can only listen and wait.</p>

<p>There they stand the livelong day outside Donna
Elisa’s door. There stand Donna Concetta and
Donna Emilia. No love has been lost between
them in former times, but to-day they stand beside
one another and mourn.</p>

<p>Many anxious eyes peer in through the windows
of Donna Elisa’s house. Little Gandolfo and old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Assunta from the Cathedral steps, and the poor old
chair-maker, stand there the whole afternoon without
tiring. It is so terrible that Gaetano is going
to die just when they have got him back again.</p>

<p>The blind stand and wait as if they expected him
to give them their sight, and the poor people, both
from Geraci and Corvaja, are waiting to hear how it
will turn out for their young lord, the last Alagona.</p>

<p>He wished them well, and he had great strength
and power. If he could only have lived&mdash;</p>

<p>“God has taken his hand from Sicily,” they say.
“He lets all those perish who wish to help the
people.”</p>

<p>All the afternoon and evening, and even till midnight,
the crowd of people are still outside Donna
Elisa’s house. At precisely twelve o’clock Donna
Elisa throws open the shop-door and comes out on
the steps. “Is he better?” they all cry at the sight
of her.&mdash;“No, he is not better.”</p>

<p>Then there is silence; but at last a single
trembling voice asks: “Is he worse?”&mdash;“No, no;
he is not worse. He is the same. The doctor is
with him.”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa has thrown a black shawl over her
head and carries a lantern in her hand. She goes
down the steps to the street, where the people are
sitting and lying, closely packed one beside one
another. She makes her way quietly through them.</p>

<p>“Is Gandolfo here?” she asks. “Yes, Donna
Elisa.” And Gandolfo comes forward to her.</p>

<p>“You must come with me and open your church
for me.”</p>

<p>Every one who hears Donna Elisa say that, understands
that she wishes to go to the Christchild in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
the church of San Pasquale and pray for Gaetano.
They rise and wish to go with her.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa is much touched by their sympathy.
She opens her heart to them.</p>

<p>“I will tell you something,” she says, and her
voice trembles exceedingly. “I have had a dream.
I do not know how I could sleep to-night. But
while I was sitting at the bedside, and was most
anxious, I did fall asleep. I had scarcely closed
my eyes before I saw the Christchild before me
in his crown and gold shoes, as he stands out in
San Pasquale. And he spoke in this way to me:
‘Make the unhappy woman who is on her knees
praying in my church your son’s wife, then Gaetano
will be well.’ He hardly had time to say it before
I awoke, and when I opened my eyes, I seemed to
see the Christchild disappearing through the wall.
And now I must go out and see if any one is there.</p>

<p>“But now you all hear that I vow that if there is
any woman out in the church of San Pasquale, I
shall do what the image commanded me. Even if
it is the poorest girl from the street, I shall take
charge of her and make her my son’s wife.”</p>

<p>When Donna Elisa has spoken, she and all those
who have waited in the street go out to San Pasquale.
The poor people are filled with shuddering
expectation. They can scarcely contain themselves
from rushing by Donna Elisa, in order to see if
there is any one in the church.</p>

<p>Fancy if it is a gypsy girl who has sought shelter
there for the night! Who can be in the church at
night except some poor, homeless wanderer? Donna
Elisa has made a terrible vow.</p>

<p>At last they come to Porta Etnea, and from there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
they go quickly, quickly down the hill. The saints
preserve us, the church door is open! Some one
really is there.</p>

<p>The lantern shakes in Donna Elisa’s hand. Gandolfo
wishes to take it from her, but she will keep
it. “In God’s name, in God’s name,” she murmurs
as she goes into the church.</p>

<p>The people crowd in after her. They almost
crush one another to death in the door, but their
excitement keeps them silent, no one says a word.
All gaze at the high altar. Is any one there? Is
any one there? The little hanging-lamp over the
image shines pitifully faint. Is any one there?</p>

<p>Yes, some one is there. There is a woman there.
She is on her knees, praying, and her head is so
deeply bent that they cannot see who she is. But
when she hears steps behind her she lifts her long,
bowed neck and looks up. It is Donna Micaela.</p>

<p>At first she is frightened and starts up as if she
wished to escape. Donna Elisa is also frightened,
and they look at one another as if they had never
met before. Then Donna Micaela says in a very
low voice: “You have come to pray for him, sister-in-law.”
And the people see her move a little way
along so that Donna Elisa may have room directly
in front of the image.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa’s hand trembles so that she has to set
the lantern down on the floor, and her voice is quite
hoarse as she says: “Has none other but you been
here to-night, Micaela?”&mdash;“No, none other.”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa has to support herself against the
wall to keep from falling, and Donna Micaela sees
it. She is instantly beside her and puts her arm
about her waist. “Sit down, sit down!” She leads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
her to the altar platform and kneels down in front
of her. “Is he so ill? We will pray for him.”</p>

<p>“Micaela,” says Donna Elisa, “I thought that I
should find help here.”&mdash;“Yes, you shall see, you
will.”&mdash;“I dreamed that the image came to me,
that he came to me and said that I was to come
here.”&mdash;“He has also helped us many times
before.”&mdash;“But he said this to me: ‘Make the
unhappy woman who is on her knees praying before
my altar your son’s wife, then your son will be
well.’”&mdash;“What do you say that he said?”&mdash;“I
was to make her who was kneeling and praying
out here my son’s wife.”&mdash;“And you were willing
to do it? You did not know whom you would
meet!”</p>

<p>“On the way I made a vow&mdash;and those who
followed me heard it&mdash;that whoever it might be, I
would take her in my arms and lead her to my home.
I thought that it was some poor woman whom God
wished to help.”&mdash;“It is one indeed.”&mdash;“I was in
despair when I saw that there was no one here but
you.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela does not answer; she gazes up at
the image. “Is it your will? Is it your will?”
she whispers anxiously.</p>

<p>Donna Elisa continues to bemoan herself. “I
saw him so plainly, and he has never deceived
before. I thought that some poor girl who had no
marriage portion had prayed to him for a husband.
Such things have happened before. What shall I
do now?”</p>

<p>She laments and bewails; she cannot get away
from the thought that it ought to be a poor woman.
Donna Micaela grows impatient. She takes her by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
the arm and shakes her. “But Donna Elisa, Donna
Elisa!”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa does not listen to her; she continues
her laments. “What shall I do? what shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Why, make the poor woman who was kneeling
and praying here your son’s wife, Donna Elisa!”</p>

<p>Donna Elisa looks up. Such a face as she sees
before her! So bewitching, so captivating, so
smiling!</p>

<p>But she may not look at it for more than a second.
Donna Micaela hides it instantly in Donna Elisa’s
old black dress.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Donna Micaela and Donna Elisa go together into
the town. The street winds so that they cannot
see Donna Elisa’s house until they are quite near.
When it at last comes into view they see that the
shop windows are lighted up. Four gigantic wax-candles
are burning behind the bunches of rosaries.</p>

<p>Both the women press each other’s hands. “He
lives!” one whispers to the other. “He lives!”</p>

<p>“You must not tell him anything about what the
image commanded you to do,” says Donna Micaela
to Donna Elisa.</p>

<p>Outside the shop they embrace one another and
each goes her own way.</p>

<p>In a little while Gaetano comes out on the steps
of the shop. He stands still for a moment and
breathes in the fresh night air. Then he sees how
lights are burning in the dark palace across the
street.</p>

<p>Gaetano breathes short and panting; he seems
almost afraid to go further. Suddenly he dashes
across like some one going to meet an unavoidable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
misfortune. He finds the door to the summer-palace
unlocked, takes the stairs in two bounds, and
bursts open the door to the music-room without
knocking.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela is sitting there, wondering if he
will come now in the night or the next morning.
Then she hears his step outside in the gallery.
She is seized with terror; how will he be? She
has longed so unspeakably for him. Will he really
be so that all that longing will be satisfied?</p>

<p>And will no more walls rise between them?
Will they for once be able to tell each other
everything? Will they speak of love, and not of
socialism?</p>

<p>When he opens the door she tries to go to meet
him, but she cannot; she is trembling in every
limb. She sits down and hides her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>She expects him to throw his arms about her and
kiss her, but that he does not do. It is not Gaetano’s
way to do what people expect of him.</p>

<p>As soon as he could stand upright he has thrown
on his clothes to come to see her. He is apparently
wildly gay when he comes now. He would have
liked her to take it lightly also. He will not be
agitated. He had fainted in the forenoon. He
could stand nothing.</p>

<p>He stands quietly beside her until she regains
her composure. “You have weak nerves,” he says.
That is actually all he says.</p>

<p>She and Donna Elisa and every one is convinced
that he has come to clasp her in his arms and say
that he loves her. But just for that reason it is
impossible for Gaetano. Some people are malicious;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
it is their nature never to do just what they ought
to do.</p>

<p>Gaetano begins to tell her of his journey; he
does not speak even of socialism, but talks of
express-trains and conductors and curious travelling
companions.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela sits and looks at him; her eyes
beg and implore more and more eagerly. Gaetano
seems to be glad and happy to see her, but why
can he not say what he has to say?</p>

<p>“Have you been on the Etna railway?” she asks.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answers, and begins quite unconstrainedly
to speak of the beauty and usefulness of
the road. He knows nothing of how it came to be.</p>

<p>Gaetano is saying to himself that he is a brute.
Why does he not speak the words for which she is
longing? But why is she sitting there so humbly?
Why does she show that he needs only to stretch
out his hand and take her? He is desperately,
stormily happy to be near her, but he feels so sure
of her, so certain. It is so amusing to torture her.</p>

<p>The people of Diamante are still standing outside
in the street, and they all feel as great a happiness
as if they had given away a daughter in
marriage.</p>

<p>They have been patient till now in order to give
Gaetano time to declare himself. But now it surely
must be accomplished. And they begin to shout:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Long live Gaetano! long live Micaela!”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela looks up with inexpressible dismay.
He surely must understand that she has
nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>She goes out to the gallery and sends Luca down
with the request that they will be silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>When she comes back, Gaetano has risen. He
offers her his hand; he wishes to go.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela puts out her hand almost without
knowing what she is doing. But then she draws it
back; “No, no,” she says.</p>

<p>He wishes to go, and who knows whether he will
come again on the morrow. She has not been able
to talk to him; she has not been able to say a word
to him of all that she wished to say.</p>

<p>Surely there was no need for them to be like ordinary
lovers. That man had given her life all its
life for many years. Whether he spoke to her of
love or not was of no importance; yet she wishes to
tell him what he has been to her.</p>

<p>And now, just now. One has to make the most
of one’s opportunities when Gaetano is in question.
She dares not let him go.</p>

<p>“You must not go yet,” she says. “I have something
to say to you.”</p>

<p>She draws forward a chair for him; she herself
places herself a little behind him. His eyes are too
gay to-night, they trouble her.</p>

<p>Then she begins to speak. She lays before him
the great, hidden treasures of her life. They were
all the words he had said to her and all the dreams
he had set her to dreaming. She had not lost one.
She had collected and saved them up. They had
been the only richness in her poor life.</p>

<p>In the beginning she speaks fast, as if repeating
a lesson. She is afraid of him; she does not know
whether he likes her to speak. At last she dares to
look at him. He is serious now, no longer malicious.
He sits still and listens as if he would not
lose a syllable. Just now his face was sickly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
ashen, but now it suddenly changes. His face
begins to shine as though transfigured.</p>

<p>She talks and talks. She looks at him, and now
she is beautiful. How could she help being beautiful?
At last she can speak out to him, she can
tell him how love came to her and how it has never
left her since. Finally she can tell him how he has
been all the world to her.</p>

<p>Words cannot say enough; she takes his hand and
kisses it.</p>

<p>He lets her do it without moving. The color in his
cheeks grows no deeper, but it becomes clearer, more
transparent. She remembers Gandolfo, who had said
that Gaetano’s face was so white that it shone.</p>

<p>He does not interrupt her. She tells him about
the railway, speaks of one miracle after another.
He looks at her now and then. His eyes glow at
the sight of her. He is not by any means making
fun of her.</p>

<p>She wonders exceedingly what is passing in him.
He looks as if what she said was nothing new to
him. He seems to recognize everything she says.
Could it be that his love for her was the same as
that she felt for him? Was it connected with every
noble feeling in him? Had it been the elevating
power in his life? Had it given wings to his artistic
powers? Had it taught him to love the poor and
the oppressed? Is it once more taking possession
of him, making him feel that he is an artist, an
apostle, that nothing is too high for him?</p>

<p>But as he is still silent she thinks that perhaps
he will not be tied to her. He loves her, but possibly
he wishes to be a free man. Perhaps he
thinks that she is not a suitable wife for a socialist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>Her blood begins to boil. She thinks that he
perhaps believes that she is sitting there and begging
for his love.</p>

<p>She has told him almost everything that has
happened while he has been away. Now she suddenly
breaks off in her story.</p>

<p>“I have loved you,” she says. “I shall always
love you, and I think that I should like you to tell
me once that you love me. It would make the
parting easier to bear.”</p>

<p>“Would it?” he says.</p>

<p>“Can I be your wife?” she says, and her voice
trembles with indignation. “I no longer fear your
teachings as I did; I am not afraid of your poor; I
wish to turn the world upside down, I, as well as
you. But I am a believer. How can I live with
you if you do not agree with me in that? Or perhaps
you would win me to unbelief? Then the
world would be dead for me. Everything would
lose its meaning, its significance. I should be a
miserable, destitute creature. We must part.”</p>

<p>“Really!” he turns towards her. His eyes begin
to glow with impatience.</p>

<p>“You may go now,” she says quietly; “I have
said to you everything I wished to say. I should
have wished that you had something to say to me.
But perhaps it is better as it is. We will not make
it harder to part than it need be.”</p>

<p>One of Gaetano’s hands holds her hands firmly
and closely, the other holds her head still. Then
he kisses her.</p>

<p>Was she mad, that she could think that he would
let anything, anything in the world, part them now?</p>

<h3 id="III_IV">IV<br />
<span class="smaller">ONLY OF THIS WORLD</span></h3>

<p>As she grew up everybody said of her: “She is
going to be a saint, a saint.”</p>

<p>Her name was Margherita Cornado. She lived
in Girgenti on the south side of Sicily, in the great
mining district. When she was a child her father
was a miner; later he inherited a little money, so
that he no longer needed to work.</p>

<p>There was a little, narrow, miserable roof-garden
on Margherita Cornado’s house in Girgenti. A
small and steep stairway led up to it, and one had
to creep out through a low door. But it was well
worth the trouble. When you reached the top you
saw not only a mass of roofs, but the whole air over
the town was gaily crowded with the towers and
façades of all Girgenti’s churches. And every
façade and every tower was a quivering lace-work of
images, of loggias, of glowing canopies.</p>

<p>And outside the town there was a wide plain
which sloped gently down towards the sea, and a
semicircle of hills that guarded the plain. The
plain was glittering red; the ocean was blue as
enamel; the hillsides were yellow; it was a whole
orient of warmth and color.</p>

<p>But there was even more to be seen. Ancient
temples were dotted about the valley. Ruins and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
strange old towers were everywhere, as in a fairy
world.</p>

<p>As Margherita Cornado grew up, she used to
spend most of her days there; but she never looked
out over the dazzling landscape. She was occupied
with other things.</p>

<p>Her father used to tell her of the life in the
sulphur mines at Grotte, where he had worked.
While Margherita Cornado sat on the airy terrace,
she thought that she was incessantly walking about
the dark mine veins, and finding her way through
dim shafts.</p>

<p>She could not help thinking of all the misery that
existed in the mines; especially she thought of the
children, who carried the ore up to the surface.
“The little wagons,” they called them. That expression
never left her mind. Poor, poor little
wagons, the little mine-wagons!</p>

<p>They came in the morning, and each followed a
miner down into the mine. As soon as he had dug
out enough ore, he loaded the mine-wagon with a
basket of it, and then the latter began to climb.
Several of them met on the way, so that there was
a long procession. And they began to sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“One journey made in struggling and pain,</div>
<div class="verse">Nineteen times to be travelled again.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When they finally reached the light of day, they
emptied their baskets of ore and threw themselves
on the ground to rest a moment. Most of them
dragged themselves over to the sulphurous pools
near the shaft of the mine and drank the pestiferous
water.</p>

<p>But they soon had to go down again, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
gathered at the mouth of the mine. As they clambered
down, they cried: “Lord and God, have mercy,
have mercy, have mercy!”</p>

<p>Every journey the little wagons made, their song
grew more feeble. They groaned and cried as they
crawled up the paths of the mine.</p>

<p>The little wagons were bathed in perspiration;
the baskets of ore ground holes in their shoulders.
As they went up and down they sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Seven more trips without pause for breath,</div>
<div class="verse">The pain of living is worse than death.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Margherita Cornado had suffered for those poor
children all her own childhood. And because she
was always thinking of their hardships, people
believed that she would be a saint.</p>

<p>Neither did she forget them as she grew older.
As soon as she was grown, she went to Grotte,
where most of the mines are, and when the little
wagons came out into the daylight, she was waiting
for them by the shaft with fresh, clean water. She
wiped the perspiration from their faces, and she
dressed the wounds on their shoulders. It was not
much that she could do for them, but soon the little
wagons felt that they could not go on with their
work any day that Margherita Cornado did not come
and comfort them.</p>

<p>But unfortunately for the little wagons, Margherita
was very beautiful. One day one of the mining-engineers
happened to see her as she was relieving
the children, and instantly fell very much in love
with her.</p>

<p>A few weeks after, Margherita Cornado stopped
coming to the Grotte mines. She sat at home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
instead and sewed on her wedding outfit. She was
going to marry the mining-engineer. It was a
good match, and connected her with the chief people
of the town, so she could not care for the little
wagons any longer.</p>

<p>A few days before the wedding the old beggar,
Santuzza, who was Margherita’s god-mother, came
and asked to speak to her. They betook themselves
to the roof-garden in order to be alone.</p>

<p>“Margherita,” said the old woman, “you are in
the midst of such happiness and magnificence that
perhaps there is no use speaking to you of those
who are in need and sorrow. You have forgotten
all such things.”</p>

<p>Margherita reproved her for speaking so.</p>

<p>“I come with a greeting to you from my son,
Orestes. He is in trouble, and he needs your
advice.”</p>

<p>“You know that you can speak freely to me,
Santuzza,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“Orestes is no longer at the Grotte mines; you
know that, I suppose. He is at Racalmuto. And
he is very badly off there. Not that the pay is so
bad, but the engineer is a man who grinds down the
poor to the last drop of blood.”</p>

<p>The old woman told how the engineer tortured
the miners. He made them work over time; he
fined them if they missed a day. He did not look
after the mines properly; there was one cave-in
after another. No one was secure of his life as
long as he was under earth.</p>

<p>“Well, Margherita, Orestes had a son. A splendid
boy; just ten years old. The engineer came and
wished to buy the boy from Orestes, and set him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
work with the little wagons. But Orestes said no.
His boy should not be ruined by such work.</p>

<p>“Then the engineer threatened him, and said that
Orestes would be dismissed from the mine.”</p>

<p>Santuzza paused.</p>

<p>“And then?” asked Margherita.</p>

<p>“Yes, then Orestes gave his son to the engineer.
The next day the boy got a whipping from him.
He beat him every day. The boy grew more and
more feeble. Orestes saw it, and asked the engineer
to spare the boy, but he had no mercy. He
said that the boy was lazy, and he continued to persecute
him. And now he is dead. My grandson
is dead, Margherita.”</p>

<p>The girl had quite forgotten all her own happiness.
She was once more only the miner’s daughter,
the protector of the little wagons, the poor child
who used to sit on the bright terrace and weep over
the hardships of the black mines.</p>

<p>“Why do you let the man live?” she cried.</p>

<p>The old woman looked at her furtively. Then
she crept close to her with a knife. “Orestes sends
you this with a thousand questions,” she said.</p>

<p>Margherita Cornado took the knife, kissed the
blade, and gave it back without a word.</p>

<p>It was the evening before the wedding. The
parents of the bridegroom were awaiting their son.
He was to come home from the mines towards night;
but he never came. Later in the night a servant
was sent to the Grotte mines to look for him, and
found him a mile from Girgenti. He lay murdered
at the roadside.</p>

<p>A search for the murderer was immediately instituted.
Strict examinations of the miners were held,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
but the culprit could not be discovered. There
were no witnesses; no one could be prevailed upon
to betray a comrade.</p>

<p>Then Margherita Cornado appeared and denounced
Orestes, who was the son of her god-mother, Santuzza,
and who had not moved to Racalmuto at all.</p>

<p>She did it although she had heard afterwards
that her betrothed had been guilty of everything of
which Santuzza had accused him. She did it
although she herself had sealed his doom by kissing
the knife.</p>

<p>She had hardly accused Orestes before she repented
of it; she was filled with the anguish of
remorse.</p>

<p>In another land what she had done would not
have been considered a crime, but it is so regarded
in Sicily. A Sicilian would rather die than be an
informer.</p>

<p>Margherita Cornado enjoyed no rest either by
night or by day. She had a continual aching feeling
of anguish in her heart, a great unhappiness
dwelt in her.</p>

<p>She was not severely judged, because every one
knew that she had loved the murdered man and
thought that Santuzza had been too cruel towards
her. No one spoke of her disdainfully, and no one
refused to salute her.</p>

<p>But it made no difference to her that others were
kind to her. Remorse filled her soul and tortured
her like an aching wound. Orestes had been sentenced
to the galleys for life. Santuzza had died a
few weeks after her son’s sentence had been passed,
and Margherita could not ask forgiveness of either of
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>She called on the saints, but they would not help
her. It seemed as if nothing in the world could
have the power to free her from the horror of
remorse.</p>

<p>At that time the famous Franciscan monk, Father
Gondo, was sojourning in the neighborhood of
Girgenti. He was preaching a pilgrimage to
Diamante.</p>

<p>It did not disturb Father Gondo not to have the
pope acknowledge the Christ-image in the church
of San Pasquale as a miracle-worker. He had met
the blind singers on his wanderings and had heard
them tell of the image. Through long, happy
nights he had sat at the feet of Father Elia and
Brother Tommaso, and from sunset to sunrise they
had told him of the image.</p>

<p>And now the famous preacher had begun to send
all who were in trouble to the great miracle-worker.
He warned the people not to let that holy time pass
unheeded. “The Christchild,” he said, “had not
hitherto been much worshipped in Sicily. The
time had come when he wished to possess a church
and followers. And to effect it he let his holy
image perform miracle after miracle.”</p>

<p>Father Gondo, who had passed his novitiate in
the monastery of Aracoeli on the Capitol, told the
people of the image of the Christchild that was
there, and of the thousand miracles he had performed.
“And now that good little child wishes
to be worshipped in Sicily,” said Father Gondo.
“Let us hesitate no longer, and hasten to him. For
the moment heaven is generous. Let us be the
first to acknowledge the image! Let us be like the
shepherds and wise men of the East; let us go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the holy child while he is still lying on his bed of
straw in the miserable hut!”</p>

<p>Margherita Cornado was filled with a new hope
when she heard him. She was the first to obey
Father Gondo’s summons. After her others joined
him also. Forty pilgrims marched with him through
the plateaus of the inland to Diamante.</p>

<p>They were all very poor and unhappy. But
Father Gondo made them march with song and
prayer. Soon their eyes began to shine as if the
star of Bethlehem had gone before them.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” said Father Gondo, “why God’s
son is greater than all the saints? Because he
gives the soul holiness; because he forgives sins;
because he grants to the spirit a blessed trust in
God; because his kingdom is not of this world.”</p>

<p>When his little army looked tired, he gave them
new life by telling them of the miracles the image
had performed. The legends of the blind singers
were like cooling drinks and cheering wine. The
poor wanderers in the barren lands of Sicily walked
with a lighter step, as if they were on their way to
Nazareth to see the carpenter’s son.</p>

<p>“He will take all our burdens from us,” said
Father Gondo. “When we come back our hearts
will be freed from every care.”</p>

<p>And during the wandering through the scorched,
glowing desert, where no trees gave cooling shade,
and where the water was bitter with salt and sulphur,
Margherita Cornado felt that her heart’s
torments were relieved. “The little king of heaven
will take away my pain,” she said.</p>

<p>At last, one day in May, the pilgrims reached the
foot of the hill of Diamante. There the desert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
stopped. They saw about them groves of olive-trees
and fresh green leaves. The mountain shone;
the town shone. They felt that they had come to
a place in the shadow of God’s grace.</p>

<p>They toiled joyfully up the zigzag path, and with
loud and exultant voices sang an old pilgrims’ song.</p>

<p>When they had gone some way up the mountain,
people came running from Diamante to meet them.
When the people heard the monotonous sound of the
old song, they threw aside their work and hurried
out. And the people of Diamante embraced and
kissed the pilgrims.</p>

<p>They had expected them long ago; they could not
understand why they had not come before. The
Christ-image of Diamante was a wonderful miracle-worker;
he was so compassionate, so loving that
every one ought to come to him.</p>

<p>When Margherita Cornado heard them she felt as
if her heart was already healed of its pain. All the
people of Diamante comforted her and encouraged
her. “He will certainly help you; he helps every
one,” they said. “No one has prayed to him in
vain.”</p>

<p>At the town-gate the pilgrims parted. The townspeople
took them to their homes, so that they might
rest after their journey. In an hour they were all
to meet at the Porta Etnea in order to go out to the
image together.</p>

<p>But Margherita had not the patience to wait a
whole hour. She asked her way out to the church
of San Pasquale and went there alone before all the
others.</p>

<p>When Father Gondo and the pilgrims came out to
San Pasquale an hour later, they saw Margherita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
Cornado sitting on the platform by the high altar.
She was sitting still and did not seem to notice
their coming. But when Father Gondo came close
up to her, she started up as if she had lain in wait
for him and threw herself upon him. She seized
him by the throat and tried to strangle him.</p>

<p>She was big, splendidly developed and strong.
It was only after a severe struggle that Father
Gondo and two of the pilgrims succeeded in subduing
her. She was quite mad, and so violent that
she had to be bound.</p>

<p>The pilgrims had come in a solemn procession;
they sang, and held burning candles in their hands.
There was a long line of them, for many people
from Diamante had joined them. Those who came
first immediately stopped their singing; those coming
after had noticed nothing and continued their
song. But then the news of what had happened
passed from file to file, and wherever it came the
song stopped. It was horrible to hear how it died
away and changed into a low wail.</p>

<p>All the weary pilgrims realized that they had
failed in their coming. All their laborious wanderings
had been in vain. They were disappointed in
their beautiful hopes. The holy image would have
no consolation to offer them.</p>

<p>Father Gondo himself was in despair. It was a
more severe blow to him than to any one else, for
each one of the others had only his own sorrow to
think of, but he bore the sorrows of all those people
in his heart. What answer could he give to all the
hopes he had awakened in them?</p>

<p>Suddenly one of his beautiful, child-like smiles
passed over his face. The image must wish to test<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
his faith and that of the others. If only they did
not fail, they would certainly be helped.</p>

<p>He began again to sing the pilgrim song in his
clear voice and went up to the altar.</p>

<p>But as he came nearer to the image, he broke off
in his song again. He stopped and looked at the
image with staring eyes. Then he stretched out
his hand, took the crown and brought it close to his
eyes. “It is written there; it is written there,” he
murmured. And he let the crown fall from his
hand and roll down on the stone floor.</p>

<p>From that moment Father Gondo knew that the
outcast from Aracoeli was before him.</p>

<p>But he did not immediately cry it out to the
people, but said instead, with his usual gentleness,&mdash;</p>

<p>“My friends, I wish to tell you something strange.”</p>

<p>He told them of the Englishwoman who had
wished to steal the Christ-image of Aracoeli. And
he told how the image had been called Antichrist
and had been cast out into the world.</p>

<p>“I still remember old Fra Simone,” said Father
Gondo. “He never showed me the image without
saying: ‘It was this little hand that rang. It was
this little foot that kicked on the door.’</p>

<p>“But when I asked Fra Simone what had become
of the other image, he always said: ‘What should
have become of him? The dogs of Rome have
probably dragged him away and torn him to
pieces.’”</p>

<p>When Father Gondo had finished speaking, he
went, still quite slowly and quietly, and picked up
the crown that he had just let fall to the floor.</p>

<p>“Now read that!” he said. And he let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
crown go from man to man. The people stood with
their wax-candles in their hands and lighted up the
crown with them. Those who could read, read; the
others saw that at least there was an inscription.</p>

<p>And each one who had held the crown in his hand
instantly extinguished his candle.</p>

<p>When the last candle was put out, Father Gondo
turned to his pilgrims who had gathered about him.
“I have brought you here,” he said to them, “that
you might find one who gives the soul peace and an
entry to God’s kingdom; but I have brought you
wrong, for this one has no such thing to give. His
kingdom is only of this world.</p>

<p>“Our unfortunate sister has gone mad,” continued
Father Gondo, “because she came here and hoped
for heavenly benefits. Her reason gave way when
her prayers were not heard. He could not hear her,
for his kingdom is only of this world.”</p>

<p>He was silent a moment, and they all looked up
at him to find out what they ought to think of it
all.</p>

<p>He asked as quietly as before: “Shall an image
which bears such words in its crown any longer be
allowed to desecrate an altar?”</p>

<p>“No, no!” cried the pilgrims. The people of
Diamante stood silent.</p>

<p>Father Gondo took the image in his hands and
carried it on his outstretched arms through the
church and towards the door.</p>

<p>But although the Father had spoken gently and
humbly, his eyes had rested the whole time sternly
and with compelling force on the crowd of people.
There was not one there whom he had not subdued
and mastered by the strength of his will. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
one had felt paralyzed and without the power of
thinking independently.</p>

<p>As Father Gondo approached the door, he stopped
and looked around. One last commanding glance
fell on the people.</p>

<p>“The crown also,” said Father Gondo. And the
crown was handed to him.</p>

<p>He set the image down and went out under the
stone canopy that protected the image of San
Pasquale. He whispered a word to a couple of pilgrims,
and they hurried away. They soon came
back with their arms full of branches and logs.
They laid them down before Father Gondo and set
them on fire.</p>

<p>All who had been in the church had crowded out.
They stood in the yard outside the church, still
subdued, with no will of their own. They saw that
the monk meant to burn their beloved image that
helped them so, and yet they made no resistance.
They could not understand themselves why they did
not try to save the image.</p>

<p>When Father Gondo saw the fire kindle and therefore
felt that the image was entirely in his power,
he straightened himself and his eyes flashed.</p>

<p>“My poor children,” he said gently, and turned
to the people of Diamante. “You have been harboring
a terrible guest. How is it possible for you
not to have discovered who he is?</p>

<p>“What ought I to believe of you?” he continued
more sternly. “You yourselves say that the image
has given you everything for which you have prayed.
Has no one in Diamante in all these years prayed
for the forgiveness of sins and the peace of the
soul?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can it be possible? The people of Diamante
have not had anything to pray for except lottery
numbers and good years and daily bread and health
and money. They have asked for nothing but the
good of this world. Not one has needed to pray for
heavenly grace.</p>

<p>“Can it really be? No, it is impossible,” said
Father Gondo joyfully, as if filled with a sudden
hope. “It is I who have made a mistake. The
people of Diamante have understood that I would
not lay the image on the fire without asking and
investigating about it. You are only waiting for
me to be silent to step forward and give your
testimony.</p>

<p>“Many will now come and say: ‘That image has
made me a believer;’ and many will say: ‘He has
granted me the forgiveness of sins;’ and many will
say: ‘He has opened my eyes, so that I have been
able to gaze on the glory of heaven.’ They will
come forward and speak, and I shall be mocked and
derided and compelled to bear the image to the
altar and acknowledge that I have been mistaken.”</p>

<p>Father Gondo stopped speaking and smiled invitingly
at the people. A quick movement passed
through the crowd of listeners. Several seemed to
have the intention of coming forward and testifying.
They came a few steps, but then they stopped.</p>

<p>“I am waiting,” said the Father, and his eyes
implored and called on the people to come.</p>

<p>No one came. The whole mass of people was
in wailing despair that they would not testify to the
advantage of their beloved image. But no one did
so.</p>

<p>“My poor children,” said Father Gondo, sadly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
“You have had Antichrist among you, and he has
got possession of you. You have forgotten heaven.
You have forgotten that you possess a soul. You
think only of this world.</p>

<p>“Formerly it was said that the people of Diamante
were the most religious in Sicily. Now it must be
otherwise. The inhabitants of Diamante are slaves
of the world. Perhaps they are even infidel socialists,
who love only the earth. They can be nothing
else. They have had Antichrist among them.”</p>

<p>When the people were accused in such a way,
they seemed at last to be about to rise in resistance.
An angry muttering passed through the ranks.</p>

<p>“The image is holy,” one cried. “When he
came San Pasquale’s bells rang all day.”</p>

<p>“Could they ring for less time to warn you of
such a misfortune?” rejoined the monk.</p>

<p>He went on with his accusations with growing
violence. “You are idolaters, not Christians. You
serve him because he helps you. There is nothing
of the spirit of holiness in you.”</p>

<p>“He has been kind and merciful, like Christ,”
answered the people.</p>

<p>“Is not just that the misfortune?” said the
Father, and now all of a sudden he was terrible in
his wrath. “He has taken the likeness of Christ to
lead you astray. In that way he has been able to
weave his web about you. By scattering gifts and
blessings over you, he has lured you into his net
and made you slaves of the world. Or is it not so?
Perhaps some one can come forward and say the
contrary? Perhaps he has heard that some one who
is not present to-day has prayed to the image for a
heavenly grace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>“He has taken away the power of a <i lang="it">jettatore</i>,”
said one.</p>

<p>“Is it not he who is as great in evil as the <i lang="it">jettatore</i>
who has power over him?” answered the father,
bitterly.</p>

<p>They made no other attempts to defend the image.
Everything that they said seemed only to make the
matter worse.</p>

<p>Several looked round for Donna Micaela, who was
also present. She stood among the crowd, heard
and saw everything, but made no attempt to save the
image.</p>

<p>When Father Gondo had said that the image was
Antichrist she had been terrified, and when he
showed that the people of Diamante had only asked
for the good of this world, her terror had grown.
She had not dared to do anything.</p>

<p>But when he said that she and all the others were
in the power of Antichrist, something in her rose
against him. “No, no,” she said, “it cannot be
so.” If she should believe that an evil power had
governed her during so many years, her reason
would give way. And her reason began to defend
itself.</p>

<p>Her faith in the supernatural broke in her like a
string too tightly stretched. She could not follow
it any longer.</p>

<p>With infinite swiftness everything of the supernatural
that she herself had experienced flashed
through her mind, and she passed sentence on it.
Was there a single proven miracle? She said to
herself that there were coincidences, coincidences.</p>

<p>It was like unravelling a skein. From what she
herself had experienced she passed to the miracles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
of other times. They were coincidences. They
were hypnotism. They were possibly legends, most
of them.</p>

<p>The raging monk continued to curse the people
with terrible words. She tried to listen to him to
get away from her own thoughts. But all she
thought was that what he said was madness and
lies.</p>

<p>What was going on in her? Was she becoming
an atheist?</p>

<p>She looked about for Gaetano. He was there
also; he stood on the church steps quite near the
monk. His eyes rested on her. And as surely as
if she had told him it, he knew what was passing
in her. But he did not look as if he were glad or
triumphant. He looked as if he wished to stop
Father Gondo, to save a little vestige of faith for
her.</p>

<p>Donna Micaela’s thoughts had no mercy. They
went on and robbed her soul. All the glowing
world of the supernatural was destroyed, crushed.
She said to herself that no one knew anything of
celestial matters, nor could know anything. Many
messages had gone from earth to heaven. None had
gone from heaven to earth.</p>

<p>“But I will still believe in God,” she said, and
clasped her hands as if still to hold fast the last and
best.</p>

<p>“Your eyes, people of Diamante, are wild and
evil,” said Father Gondo. “God is not in you.
Antichrist has driven God away from you.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela’s eyes again sought Gaetano’s.
“Can you give a poor, doubting creature something
on which to live?” they seemed to ask. His eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
met hers with proud confidence. He read in her
beautiful, imploring eyes how her trembling soul
clung to him for support. He did not doubt for a
moment that he would be able to make her life
beautiful and rich.</p>

<p>She thought of the joy that always met him wherever
he showed himself. She thought of the joy
that had roared about her that night in Palermo.
She knew that it rose from the new faith in a happy
earth. Could that faith and that joy take possession
of her also?</p>

<p>She wrung her hands in anguish. Could that
new faith be anything to her? Would she not
always feel as unhappy as now?</p>

<p>Father Gondo bent forward over the fire.</p>

<p>“I say to you once more,” he cried, “if only one
person comes and says that this image has saved his
soul, I will not burn it.”</p>

<p>Donna Micaela had a sudden feeling that she did
not wish the poor image to be destroyed. The
memory of the most beautiful hours of her life was
bound to it.</p>

<p>“Gandolfo, Gandolfo,” she whispered. She had
just seen him beside her.</p>

<p>“Yes, Donna Micaela.”</p>

<p>“Do not let him burn the image, Gandolfo!”</p>

<p>The monk had repeated his question once, twice,
thrice. No one came forward to defend the image.
But little Gandolfo crept nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>Father Gondo brought the image ever closer to
the fire.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Gaetano had bent forward. Involuntarily
a proud smile passed over his face. Donna
Micaela saw that he felt that Diamante belonged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
him. The monk’s wild proceedings made Gaetano
master of their souls.</p>

<p>She looked about in terror. Her eyes wandered
from face to face. Was the same thing going on
in all those people’s souls as in her own? She
thought she saw that it was so.</p>

<p>“Thou, Antichrist,” said Father Gondo, threateningly,
“dost thou see that no one has thought of his
soul as long as thou hast been here? Thou must
perish.”</p>

<p>Father Gondo laid the outcast on the pyre.</p>

<p>But the image had not lain there more than a
second before Gandolfo seized him.</p>

<p>He caught him up, lifted him high above his
head, and ran. Father Gondo’s pilgrims hurried
after him, and there began a wild chase down Monte
Chiaro’s precipices.</p>

<p>But little Gandolfo saved the image.</p>

<p>Down the road a big, heavy travelling-carriage
came driving. Gandolfo, whose pursuers were close
at his heels, knew nothing better to do than to
throw the image into the carriage.</p>

<p>Then he let himself be caught. When his pursuers
wished to hurry after the carriage, he stopped
them. “Take care; the lady in the carriage is
English.”</p>

<p>It was Signora Favara, who had at last wearied
of Diamante and was travelling out into the world
once more. And she was allowed to go away unmolested.
No Sicilian dares to lay hands on an
Englishwoman.</p>

<h3 id="III_V">V<br />
<span class="smaller">A FRESCO OF SIGNORELLI</span></h3>

<p>A week later Father Gondo was in Rome. He was
granted an interview with the old man in the
Vatican and told him how he had found Antichrist
in the likeness of Christ, how the former had entangled
the people of Diamante in worldliness, and
how he, Father Gondo, had wished to burn him.
He also told how he had not been able to lead the
people back to God. Instead, all Diamante had
fallen into unbelief and socialism. No one there
cared for his soul; no one thought of heaven. Father
Gondo asked what he should do with those unfortunate
people.</p>

<p>The old pope, who is wiser than any one now
living, did not laugh at Father Gondo’s story; he
was deeply distressed by it.</p>

<p>“You have done wrong; you have done very
wrong,” he said.</p>

<p>He sat silent for a while and pondered; then he
said: “You have not seen the Cathedral in Orvieto?”&mdash;“No,
Holy Father.”&mdash;“Then go there now and
see it,” said the pope; “and when you come back
again, you shall tell me what you have seen there.”</p>

<p>Father Gondo obeyed. He went to Orvieto and
saw the most holy Cathedral. And in two days he
was back in the Vatican.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did you see in Orvieto?” the pope asked
him.</p>

<p>Father Gondo said that in one of the chapels of
the Cathedral he had found some frescoes of Luca
Signorelli, representing “The Last Judgment.”
But he had not looked at either the “Last Judgment”
or at the “Resurrection of The Dead.”
He had fixed all his attention on the big painting
which the guide called “The Miracles of Antichrist.”</p>

<p>“What did you see in it?” asked the pope.</p>

<p>“I saw that Signorelli had painted Antichrist as
a poor and lowly man, just as the Son of God was
when he lived here on earth. I saw that he had
dressed him like Christ and given him Christ’s
features.”</p>

<p>“What more did you see?” said the pope.</p>

<p>“The first thing that I saw in the fresco was Antichrist
preaching so that the rich and the mighty
came and laid their treasures at his feet.</p>

<p>“The second thing I saw was a sick man brought
to Antichrist and healed by him.</p>

<p>“The third thing I saw was a martyr proclaiming
Antichrist and suffering death for him.</p>

<p>“The fourth thing I saw in the great wall-picture
was the people hastening to a great temple of peace,
the spirit of evil hurled from heaven, and all men of
violence killed by heaven’s thunderbolts.”</p>

<p>“What did you think when you saw that?” asked
the pope.</p>

<p>“When I saw it, I thought: ‘That Signorelli was
mad. Does he mean that in the time of Antichrist
evil shall be conquered, and the earth become holy
as a paradise?’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you see anything else?”</p>

<p>“The fifth thing I saw depicted in the painting
was the monks and priests piled up on a big bonfire
and burned.</p>

<p>“And the sixth and last thing I saw was the
Devil whispering in Antichrist’s ear, and suggesting
to him how he was to act and speak.”</p>

<p>“What did you think when you saw that?”</p>

<p>“I said to myself: ‘That Signorelli is not mad;
he is a prophet. Antichrist will certainly come in
the likeness of Christ and make a paradise of the
world. He will make it so beautiful that the people
will forget heaven. And it will be the world’s
most terrible temptation.’”</p>

<p>“Do you understand now,” said the pope, “that
there was nothing new in all that you told me?
The Church has always known that Antichrist
would come, armed with the virtues of Christ.”</p>

<p>“Did you also know that he had actually come,
Holy Father?” asked Father Gondo.</p>

<p>“Could I sit here on Peter’s chair year after year
without knowing that he has come?” said the pope.
“I see starting a movement of the people, which
burns with love for its neighbor and hates God. I
see people becoming martyrs for the new hope of a
happy earth. I see how they receive new joy and
new courage from the words ‘Think of the earth,’
as they once found them in the words ‘Think of
heaven.’ I knew that he whom Signorelli had foretold
had come.”</p>

<p>Father Gondo bowed silently.</p>

<p>“Do you understand now wherein you did wrong?”</p>

<p>“Holy Father, enlighten me as to my sin.”</p>

<p>The old pope looked up. His clear eyes looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
through the veil of chance which shrouds future
events and saw what was hidden behind it.</p>

<p>“Father Gondo,” he said, “that little child with
whom you fought in Diamante, the child who was
merciful and wonder-working like Christ, that poor,
despised child who conquered you and whom you
call Antichrist, do you not know who he is?”</p>

<p>“No, Holy Father.”</p>

<p>“And he who in Signorelli’s picture healed the
sick, and softened the rich, and felled evil-doers to
the earth, who transformed the earth to a paradise
and tempted the people to forget heaven. Do you
not know who he is?”</p>

<p>“No, Holy Father.”</p>

<p>“Who else can he be but the Antichristianity,
socialism?”</p>

<p>The monk looked up in terror.</p>

<p>“Father Gondo,” said the pope, sternly, “when
you held the image in your arms you wished to
burn him. Why? Why were you not loving to
him? Why did you not carry him back to the
little Christchild on the Capitolium from whom he
proceeded?</p>

<p>“That is what you wandering monks could do.
You could take the great popular movement in your
arms, while it is still lying like a child in its
swaddling clothes, and you could bear it to Jesus’
feet; and Antichrist would see that he is nothing
but an imitation of Christ, and would acknowledge
him his Lord and Master. But you do not do so.
You cast Antichristianity on the pyre, and soon he
in his turn will cast you there.”</p>

<p>Father Gondo bent his knee. “I understand,
Holy Father. I will go and look for the image.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>The pope rose majestically. “You shall not
look for the image; you shall let him go his way
through the ages. We do not fear him. When he
comes to storm the Capitol in order to mount the
throne of the world, we shall meet him, and we
shall lead him to Christ. We shall make peace
between earth and heaven. But you do wrong,” he
continued more mildly, “to hate him. You must
have forgotten that the sibyl considered him one of
the redeemers of the world. ‘On the heights of the
Capitol the redeemer of the world shall be worshipped,
Christ or Antichrist.’”</p>

<p>“Holy Father, if the miseries of this world are
to be remedied by him, and heaven suffers no
injury, I shall not hate him.”</p>

<p>The old pope smiled his most subtle smile.</p>

<p>“Father Gondo, you will permit me also to tell
you a Sicilian story. The story goes, Father
Gondo, that when Our Lord was busy creating the
world, He wished one day to know if He had much
more work to do. And He sent San Pietro out to
see if the world was finished.</p>

<p>“When San Pietro came back, he said: ‘Every
one is weeping and sobbing and lamenting.’</p>

<p>“‘Then the world is not finished,’ said Our Lord,
and He went on working.</p>

<p>“Three days later Our Lord sent San Pietro again
to the earth.</p>

<p>“‘Everyone is laughing and rejoicing and playing,’
said San Pietro, when he came back.</p>

<p>“‘Then the world is not finished,’ said Our Lord,
and He went on working.</p>

<p>“San Pietro was dispatched for the third time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Some are weeping and some are laughing,’ he
said, when he came back.</p>

<p>“‘Then the world is finished,’ said Our Lord.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
