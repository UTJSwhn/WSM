<h2 class="p4">LILLIAN MORRIS.</h2>

<p class="drop-capd p2">DURING my stay in California I went with
my worthy and gallant friend, Captain
R., to visit Y., a compatriot of ours who was
living in the secluded mountains of Santa Lucia.
Not finding him at home, we passed five days
in a lonely ravine, in company with an old
Indian servant, who during his masterâs absence
took care of the Angora goats and the bees.</p>

<p>Conforming to the ways of the country, I
spent the hot summer days mainly in sleep, but
when night came I sat down near a fire of dry
âchamisal,â and listened to stories from the
captain, concerning his wonderful adventures,
and events which could happen only in the
wilds of America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Those hours passed for me very bewitchingly.
The nights were real Californian: calm, warm,
starry; the fire burned cheerily, and in its
gleam I saw the gigantic, but shapely and noble
form of the old pioneer warrior. Raising his
eyes to the stars, he sought to recall past
events, cherished names, and dear faces, the
very remembrance of which brought a mild
sadness to his features. Of these narratives I
give one just as I heard it, thinking that the
reader will listen to it with as much interest
as I did.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="beg">I came</span> to America in September, 1849, said
the captain, and found myself in New Orleans,
which was half French at that time. From
New Orleans I went up the Mississippi to a
great sugar plantation, where I found work and
good wages. But since I was young in those
days, and full of daring, sitting in one spot and
writing annoyed me; so I left that place soon
and began life in the forest. My comrades
and I passed some time among the lakes of
Louisiana, in the midst of crocodiles, snakes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and mosquitoes. We supported ourselves with
hunting and fishing, and from time to time
floated down great numbers of logs to New
Orleans, where purchasers paid for them not
badly in money.</p>

<p>Our expeditions reached distant places. We
went as far as âBloody Arkansas,â which,
sparsely inhabited even at this day, was well-nigh
a pure wilderness then. Such a life, full
of labors and dangers, bloody encounters with
pirates on the Mississippi, and with Indians,
who at that time were numerous in Louisiana,
Arkansas, and Tennessee, increased my health
and strength, which by nature were uncommon,
and gave me also such knowledge of the plains,
that I could read in that great book not worse
than any red warrior.</p>

<p>After the discovery of gold in California,
large parties of emigrants left Boston, New
York, Philadelphia, and other eastern cities
almost daily, and one of these, thanks to my
reputation, chose me for leader, or as we say,
captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>I accepted the office willingly, since wonders
were told of California in those days, and I had
cherished thoughts of going to the Far West,
though without concealing from myself the
perils of the journey.</p>

<p>At present the distance between New York
and San Francisco is passed by rail in a week,
and the real desert begins only west of Omaha;
in those days it was something quite different.
Cities and towns, which between New York and
Chicago are as numerous as poppy-seeds now,
did not exist then; and Chicago itself, which
later on grew up like a mushroom after rain, was
merely a poor obscure fishing-village not found
on maps. It was necessary to travel with wagons,
men, and mules through a country quite wild,
and inhabited by terrible tribes of Indians:
Crows, Blackfeet, Pawnees, Sioux, and Arickarees,
which it was well-nigh impossible to avoid
in large numbers, since those tribes, movable
as sand, had no fixed dwellings, but, being hunters,
circled over great spaces of prairie, while
following buffaloes and antelopes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Not few were the toils, then, that threatened
us; but he who goes to the Far West must be
ready to suffer hardship, and expose his life
frequently. I feared most of all the responsibility
which I had accepted. This matter had
been settled, however, and there was nothing
to do but make preparations for the road.
These lasted more than two months, since we
had to bring wagons, even from Pittsburgh, to
buy mules, horses, arms, and collect large supplies
of provisions. Toward the end of winter,
however, all things were ready.</p>

<p>I wished to start in such season as to pass
the great prairies lying between the Mississippi
and the Rocky Mountains in spring, for I
knew that in summer because of heat in those
open places, multitudes of men died of various
diseases. I decided for this reason to lead the
train, not over the southern route by St. Louis,
but through Iowa, Nebraska, and Northern
Colorado. That road was more dangerous
with reference to Indians, but beyond doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
it was the healthier. The plan roused opposition
at first among people of the train. I declared
that if they would not obey they might
choose another captain. They yielded after
a brief consultation, and we moved at the first
breath of spring.</p>

<p>Days now set in which for me were toilsome
enough, especially till such time as men had
grown accustomed to me and the conditions
of the journey. It is true that my person
roused confidence, for my daring trips to Arkansas
had won a certain fame among the restless
population of the border, and the name of
âBig Ralph,â by which I was known on the
prairies, had struck the ears of most of my
people more than once. In general, however,
the captain, or leader, was, from the nature of
things, in a very critical position frequently
with regard to emigrants. It was my duty to
choose the camping-ground every evening,
watch over the advance in the daytime, have
an eye on the whole caravan, which extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
at times a mile over the prairie, appoint sentries
at the halting-places, and give men permission
to rest in the wagons when their turn
came.</p>

<p>Americans have in them, it is true, the spirit
of organization developed to a high degree; but
in toils on the road menâs energies weaken, and
unwillingness seizes the most enduring. At
such times no one wishes to reconnoitre on
horseback all day and stand sentry at night,
but each man would like to evade the turn
which is coming to him, and lie whole days in
a wagon. Besides, in intercourse with Yankees,
a captain must know how to reconcile discipline
with a certain social familiarity,&mdash;a thing far
from easy. In time of march, and in the hours
of night-watching, I was perfect master of the
will of each of my companions; but during rest
in the day at farms and settlements, to which we
came at first on the road, my rÃ´le of commander
ended. Each man was master of himself
then, and more than once I was forced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
overcome the opposition of insolent adventurers;
but when in presence of numerous spectators
it turned out a number of times that my
Mazovian fist was the stronger, my significance
rose, and later on I never had personal encounters.
Besides, I knew American character thoroughly.
I knew how to help myself, and, in
addition to all, my endurance and willingness
were increased by a certain pair of blue eyes,
which looked out at me with special interest
from beneath the canvas roof of a wagon. Those
eyes looked from under a forehead shaded by
rich golden hair, and they belonged to a maiden
named Lillian Morris. She was delicate, slender,
with finely cut features, and a face thoughtful,
though almost childlike. That seriousness
in such a young girl struck me at once when
beginning the journey, but duties connected
with the office of captain soon turned my mind
and attention elsewhere.</p>

<p>During the first weeks I exchanged with
Miss Morris barely a couple of words beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the usual daily âgood morning.â Taking compassion,
however, on her youth and loneliness,&mdash;she
had no relatives in that caravan,&mdash;I showed
the poor girl some trifling services. I had not
the least need of guarding her with my authority
of leader nor with my fist from the forwardness
of young men in the train, for among Americans
even the youngest woman is sure, if not
of the over-prompt politeness for which the
French are distinguished, at least of perfect
security. In view, however, of Lillianâs delicate
health, I put her in the most commodious
wagon, in charge of a driver of great experience,
named Smith. I spread for her a couch
on which she could sleep with comfort; finally,
I lent her a warm buffalo-skin, of which I
had a number in reserve. Though these services
were not important, Lillian seemed to
feel a lively gratitude, and omitted no opportunity
to show it. She was evidently a very
mild and retiring person. Two women, Aunt
Grosvenor and Aunt Atkins, soon loved her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
beyond expression for the sweetness of her
character. âLittle Bird,â a title which they
gave her, became the name by which she was
known in the caravan. Still, there was not the
slightest approach between Little Bird and me,
till I noticed that the blue and almost angelic
eyes of that maiden were turned toward me,
with a peculiar sympathy and determined interest.</p>

<p>That might have been interpreted in this
way: Among all the people of the train I
alone had some social refinement; Lillian, in
whom also a careful training was evident, saw
in me, therefore, a man nearer to her than
the rest of the company. But I understood
the affair somewhat differently. The interest
which she showed pleased my vanity; my
vanity made me pay her more attention, and
look oftener into her eyes. It was not long
till I was striving in vain to discover why, up
to that time, I had paid so little attention to
a person so exquisite,&mdash;a person who might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
inspire tender feelings in any man who had
a heart.</p>

<p>Thenceforth I was fond of coursing around
her wagon on my horse. During the heat of
the day, which in spite of the early spring
annoyed us greatly at noon, the mules dragged
forward lazily, and the caravan stretched along
the prairie, so that a man standing at the first
wagon could barely see the last one. Often did
I fly at such times from end to end, wearying
my horse without need, just to see that bright
head in passing, and those eyes, which hardly
ever left my mind. At first my imagination was
more taken than my heart; I received pleasant
solace from the thought that among those
strange people I was not entirely a stranger,
since a sympathetic little soul was occupied
with me somewhat. Perhaps this came not
from vanity, but from the yearning which on
earth a man feels to discover his own self in
a heart near to him, to fix his affections and
thoughts on one living beloved existence, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of wasting them on such indefinite, general
objects as plains and forests, and losing
himself in remotenesses and infinities.</p>

<p>I felt less lonely then, and the whole journey
took on attractions unknown to me hitherto.
Formerly, when the caravan stretched out on
the prairie, as I have described, so that the last
wagons vanished from the eye, I saw in that
only a lack of attention, and disorder, from
which I grew very angry. Now, when I halted
on some eminence, the sight of those wagons
white and striped, shone on by the sun and
plunging in the sea of grass, like ships on the
ocean, the sight of men, on horseback and
armed, scattered in picturesque disorder at the
sides of the wagons, filled my soul with delight
and happiness. And I know not whence such
comparisons came to me, but that seemed some
kind of Old Testament procession, which I,
like a patriarch, was leading to the Promised
Land. The bells on the harness of the mules
and the drawling, âGet up!â of the drivers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
accompanied like music thoughts which came
from my heart and my nature.</p>

<p>But I did not pass from that dialogue of
eyes with Lillian to another, for the presence
of the women travelling with her prevented
me. Still, from the time when I saw that there
was something between us for which I could
not find a name yet, though I felt that the
something was there, a certain strange timidity
seized me. I redoubled, however, my care for
the women, and frequently I looked into the
wagon, inquiring about the health of Aunt
Atkins and Aunt Grosvenor, so as to justify in
that way and equalize the attentions with which
I surrounded Lillian; but she understood my
methods perfectly, and this understanding became
as it were our own secret, concealed from
the rest of the people.</p>

<p>Soon, glances and a passing exchange of
words and tender endeavors were not enough
for me. That young maiden with bright hair
and sweet look drew me to her with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
irresistible power. I began to think of her
whole days; and at night, when wearied from
visiting the sentries, and hoarse from crying
âAll is well!â I came at last to the wagon,
and wrapping myself in a buffalo-skin, closed
my eyes to rest, it seemed to me that the
gnats and mosquitoes buzzing around were singing
unceasingly in my ears, âLillian! Lillian!
Lillian!â Her form stood before me in my
dreams; at waking, my first thought flew to
her like a swallow; and still, wonderful thing!
I had not noticed that the dear attraction
which everything assumed for me, that painting
in the soul of objects in golden colors, and
those thoughts sailing after her wagon, were
not a friendship nor an inclination for an
orphan, but a mightier feeling by far, a feeling
from which no man on earth can defend
himself when the turn has come to him.</p>

<p>It may be that I should have noticed this
sooner, had it not been that the sweetness of
Lillianâs nature won every one to her; I thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
therefore, that I was no more under the charm
of that maiden than were others. All loved
her as their own child, and I had proof of
this before my eyes daily. Her companions
were simple women, sufficiently inclined to
wordy quarrels, and still, more than once had
I seen Aunt Atkins, the greatest Herod on
earth, combing Lillianâs hair in the morning,
kissing her with the affection of a mother;
sometimes I saw Aunt Grosvenor warming in
her own palms the maidenâs hands, which had
chilled in the night. The men surrounded
her likewise with care and attentions. There
was a certain Henry Simpson in the train,
a young adventurer from Kansas, a fearless
hunter and an honest fellow at heart, but
so self-sufficient, so insolent and rough, that
during the first month I had to beat the man
twice, to convince him that there was some
one in the train with a stronger hand than
his, and of superior significance. You should
have seen that same Henry Simpson speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to Lillian. He who would not have
thought anything of the President of the
United States himself, lost in her presence
all his confidence and boldness, and repeated
every moment, âI beg your pardon, Miss
Morris!â He had quite the bearing of a
chained mastiff, but clearly the mastiff was
ready to obey every motion of that small,
half-childlike hand. At the halting-places he
tried always to be with Lillian, so as to render
her various little services. He lighted
the fire, and selected for her a place free
from smoke, covering it first with moss and
then with his own horse-blankets; he chose
for her the best pieces of game, doing all
this with a certain timid attention which I
had not thought to find in him, and which
roused in me, nevertheless, a kind of ill-will
very similar to jealousy.</p>

<p>But I could only be angry, nothing more.
Henry, if the turn to stand guard did not
come to him, might do what he liked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
his time, hence he could be near Lillian,
while my turn of service never ended. On
the road the wagons dragged forward one
after another, often very far apart; but when
we entered an open country for the midday
rest I placed the wagons, according to prairie
custom, in a line side by side, so that a man
could hardly push between them. It is
difficult to understand how much trouble and
toil I had before such an easily defended
line was formed. Mules are by nature wild
and untractable; either they balked, or would
not go out of the beaten track, biting each
other meanwhile, neighing and kicking;
wagons, twisted by sudden movement, were
turned over frequently, and the raising up
of such real houses of wood and canvas took
no little time; the braying of mules, the
cursing of drivers, the tinkling of bells, the
barking of dogs which followed us, caused
a hellish uproar. When I had brought all
into order in some fashion, I had to oversee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the unharnessing of the animals and urge on
the men whose work it was to drive them to
pasture and then to water. Meanwhile men
who during the advance had gone out on the
prairie to hunt, were returning from all sides
with game; the fires were occupied by people,
and I found barely time to eat and draw
breath.</p>

<p>I had almost double labor when we started
after each rest, for attaching the mules involved
more noise and uproar than letting
them out. Besides, the drivers tried always
to get ahead of one another, so as to spare
themselves trouble in turning out of line in
bad places. From this came quarrels and
disputes, together with curses and unpleasant
delays on the road. I had to watch over
all this, and in time of marching ride in
advance, immediately after the guides, to
examine the neighborhood and select in
season defensible places, abounding in water,
and, in general, commodious for night camps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Frequently I cursed my duties as captain,
though on the other hand the thought filled
me with pride, that in all that boundless
desert I was the first before the desert itself,
before people, before Lillian, and that the
fate of all those beings, wandering behind the
wagons over that prairie, was placed in my
hands.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="beg">On</span> a certain time, after we had passed the
Mississippi, we halted for the night at Cedar
River, the banks of which, grown over with
cottonwood, gave us assurance of fuel for the
night. While returning from the men on duty,
who had gone into the thicket with axes, I
saw, from a distance, that our people, taking
advantage of the beautiful weather and the
calm fair day, had wandered out on the prairie
in every direction. It was very early; we
halted for the night usually about five oâclock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in the afternoon, so as to move in the morning
at daybreak. Soon I met Miss Morris. I
dismounted immediately, and leading my horse
by the bridle, approached the young lady,
happy that I could be alone with her even
for a while. I inquired then why she, so
young and unattended, had undertaken a journey
which might wear out the strongest man.</p>

<p>âNever should I have consented to receive
you into our caravan,â said I, âhad I not
thought during the first few days of our
journey that you were the daughter of Aunt
Atkins; now it is too late to turn back. But
will you be strong enough, my dear child?
You must be ready to find the journey hereafter
less easy than hitherto.â</p>

<p>âI know all this,â answered she, without
raising her pensive blue eyes, âbut I must go
on, and I am happy indeed that I cannot
go back. My father is in California, and from
the letter which he sent me by way of Cape
Horn, I learn that for some months he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
been ill of a fever in Sacramento. Poor father!
he was accustomed to comfort and my care,&mdash;and
it was only through love of me that he
went to California. I do not know whether I
shall find him alive; but I feel that in going
to him, I am only fulfilling a duty that is
dear to me.â</p>

<p>There was no answer to such words; moreover,
all that I might object to this undertaking
would be too late. I inquired then of
Lillian for nearer details touching her father.
These she gave with great pleasure, and I
learned that in Boston Mr. Morris had been
judge of the Supreme Court, or highest tribunal
of the State; that he had lost his property,
and had gone to the newly discovered mines
of California in the hope of acquiring a new
fortune, and bringing back to his daughter,
whom he loved more than life, her former
social position. Meanwhile, he caught a
fever in the unwholesome Sacramento valley,
and judging that he should die he sent Lillian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
his last blessing. She sold all the property
that he had left with her, and resolved to
hasten to him. At first she intended to go
by sea; but an acquaintance with Aunt Atkins
made by chance two days before the caravan
started, changed her mind. Aunt Atkins,
who was from Tennessee, having had her ears
filled with tales which friends of mine from
the banks of the Mississippi had told her
and others of my daring expeditions to the
famed Arkansas, of my experience in journeys
over the prairies, and the care which I
gave to the weak (this I consider as a simple
duty), described me in such colors before
Lillian that the girl, without hesitating longer,
joined the caravan going under my leadership.
To those exaggerated narratives of Aunt
Atkins, who did not delay to add that I was
of noble birth, it is necessary to ascribe the
fact that Miss Morris was occupied with my
person.</p>

<p>âYou may be sure,â said I, when she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
finished her story, âthat no one will do you
any wrong here, and that care will not fail
you; as to your father, California is the
healthiest country on earth, and no one dies
of fever there. In every case, while I am
alive, you will not be left alone; and meanwhile
may God bless your sweet face!â</p>

<p>âThank you, captain,â answered she, with
emotion, and we went on; but my heart beat
with more violence. Gradually our conversation
became livelier, and no one could foresee
that that sky above us would become cloudy.</p>

<p>âBut all here are kind to you, Miss Morris?â
asked I again, not supposing that just that question
would be the cause of misunderstanding.</p>

<p>âOh yes, all,â said she, âand Aunt Atkins
and Aunt Grosvenor, and Henry Simpson
too is very good.â</p>

<p>This mention of Simpson pained me suddenly,
like the bite of a snake.</p>

<p>âHenry is a mule-driver,â answered I curtly,
âand has to care for the wagons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>.â</p>

<p>But Lillian, occupied with the course of her
own thoughts, had not noticed the change in
my voice, and spoke on as if to herself,&mdash;</p>

<p>âHe has an honest heart, and I shall be
grateful to him all my life.â</p>

<p>âMiss Morris,â interrupted I, cut to the
quick, âyou may even give him your hand.
I wonder, however, that you choose me as a
confidant of your feelings.â</p>

<p>When I said that she looked at me with astonishment
but made no reply, and we went
on together in disagreeable silence. I knew
not what to say, though my heart was full of
bitterness and anger toward her and myself.
I felt simply conquered by jealousy of Simpson,
but still I could not fight against it. The position
seemed to me so unendurable that I said
all at once briefly and dryly,&mdash;</p>

<p>âGood night, Miss Morris!â</p>

<p>âGood night,â answered she calmly, turning
her head to hide two tears that were dropping
down her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>I mounted my horse and rode away again
toward the point whence the sound of axes
came, and where, among others, Henry Simpson
was cutting a cottonwood. After a while
I was seized by a certain measureless regret,
for it seemed to me that those two tears
were falling on my heart. I turned my horse,
and next minute I was near Lillian a second
time.</p>

<p>âWhy are you crying, Miss Morris?â
asked I.</p>

<p>âOh, sir,â said she, âI know that you are
of a noble family, Aunt Atkins told me that,
and you have been so kind to me.â</p>

<p>She did everything not to cry; but she
could not restrain herself, and could not finish
her answer, for tears choked her voice.
The poor thing! she had been touched to
the bottom of her pensive soul by my answer
regarding Simpson, for there was evident
in it a certain aristocratic contempt; but I
was not even dreaming of aristocracy,&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was simply jealous; and now, seeing her so
unhappy, I wanted to seize my own collar
and throttle myself. Grasping her hand, I
said with animation:&mdash;</p>

<p>âLillian, Lillian, you did not understand me.
I take God to witness that no pride was speaking
through me. Look at me: I have nothing
in the world but these two hands,&mdash;what is my
descent to me? Something else pained me,
and I wanted to go away; but I could not
support your tears. And I swear to you also,
that what I have said to you pains me more
than it does you. You are not an object of
indifference to me, Lillian. Oh, not at all!
for if you were, what you think of Henry
would not concern me. He is an honest
fellow, but that does not touch the question.
You see how much your tears cost me;
then forgive me as sincerely as I entreat your
forgiveness.â</p>

<p>Speaking in this way I raised her hand and
pressed it to my lips; that high proof of respect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and the truthfulness which sounded in
my request, succeeded in quieting the maiden
somewhat. She did not cease at once to
weep, but her tears were of another kind,
for a smile was visible through them, as a
sun-ray through mist. Something too was
sticking in my throat, and I could not stifle
my emotion. A certain tender feeling mastered
my heart. We walked on in silence,
and round about us the world was pleasant
and sweet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the day was inclining toward
evening; the weather was beautiful, and in
the air, already dusky, there was so much
light that the whole prairie, the distant groups
of cottonwood-trees, the wagons in our train,
and the flocks of wild geese flying northward
through the sky, seemed golden and
rosy. Not the least wind moved the grass;
from a distance came to us the sound of
rapids, which the Cedar River formed in that
place, and the neighing of horses from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
direction of the camp. That evening with
such charms, that virgin land, and the presence
of Lillian, brought me to such a state
of mind that my soul was almost ready to fly
out of me somewhere to the sky. I thought
myself a shaken bell, as it were. At moments
I wanted to take Lillianâs hand again, raise it
to my lips, and not put it down for a long
time; but I feared lest this might offend her.
Meanwhile she walked on near me, calm, mild,
and thoughtful. Her tears had dried already;
at moments she raised her bright eyes to
me; then we began to speak again,&mdash;and
so reached the camp.</p>

<p>That day, in which I had experienced so
many emotions, was to end joyfully, for the
people, pleased with the beautiful weather,
had resolved to have a âpicnic,â or open air
festival. After a supper more abundant than
usual, one great fire was kindled, before which
there was to be dancing. Henry Simpson had
cleared away the grass purposely from a space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of many square yards, and sprinkled it with
sand brought from Cedar River. When the
spectators had assembled on the place thus
prepared, Simpson began to dance a jig, with
the accompaniment of negro flutes, to the
admiration of all. With hands hanging at
his sides he kept his whole body motionless;
but his feet were working so nimbly, striking
the ground in turn with heel and toe, that
their movement could hardly be followed by
the eye.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the flutes played madly; a second
dancer came out, a third, then a fourth,&mdash;and
the fun was universal. The audience joined
the negroes who were playing on the flutes,
and thrummed on tin pans, intended for washing
the gold-bearing earth, or kept time with
pieces of ox-ribs held between the fingers of
each hand, which gave out a sound like the
clatter of castanets.</p>

<p>Suddenly the cry of âminstrels! minstrels!â
was heard through the whole camp. The audience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
formed a circle around the dancing-place;
into this stepped our negroes, Jim and Crow.
Jim held a little drum covered with snake-skin,
Crow the pieces of ox-rib mentioned
already. For a time they stared at each other,
rolling the whites of their eyes; then they
began to sing a negro song, interrupted by
stamping and violent springs of the body; at
times the song was sad, at times wild. The
prolonged âDinah! ah! ah!â with which
each verse ended, changed at length into a
shout, and almost into a howling like that of
beasts. As the dancers warmed up and grew
excited, their movements became wilder, and
at last they fell to butting each other with
blows from which European skulls would have
cracked like nutshells. Those black figures,
shone upon by the bright gleam of the fire
and springing in wild leaps, presented a spectacle
truly fantastic. With their shouts and
the sounds of the drum, pipes, and tin pans,
and the click of the bones, were mingled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
shouts of the spectators: âHurrah for Jim!
Hurrah for Crow!â and then shots from
revolvers.</p>

<p>When at last the black men were wearied
and had fallen on the ground, they began to
labor with their breasts and to pant. I commanded
to give each a drink of brandy; this
put them on their feet again. But at that
moment the people began to call for a
âspeech.â In an instant the uproar and
music ceased. I had to drop Lillianâs arm,
climb to the seat of a wagon, and turn to
those present. When I looked from my
height on those forms illuminated by the
fires, forms large, broad-shouldered, bearded,
with knives at their girdles, and hats with torn
crowns, it seemed to me that I was in some
theatre, or had become a chieftain of robbers.
They were honest brave hearts, however, though
the rough life of more than one of these men
was stormy perhaps and half wild; but here
we formed, as it were, a little world torn away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
from the rest of society and confined to
ourselves, destined to a common fate and
threatened by common dangers. Here shoulder
had to touch shoulder; each felt that
he was brother to the next man; the roadless
places and boundless deserts with which we
were surrounded commanded those hardy
miners to love one another. The sight of
Lillian, the poor defenceless maiden, fearless
among them and safe as if under her fatherâs
roof, brought those thoughts to my head;
hence I told everything, just as I felt it,
and as befitted a soldier leader who was at
the same time a brother of wanderers. Every
little while they interrupted me with cries:
âHurrah for the Pole! Hurrah for the captain!
Hurrah for Big Ralph!â and with
clapping of hands; but what made me happiest
of all was to see between the network
of those sunburnt strong hands one
pair of small palms, rosy with the gleam of
the fire and flying like a pair of white doves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
I felt then at once, What care I for the
desert, the wild beasts, the Indians and the
âoutlawsâ? and cried with mighty ardor,
âI will conquer anything, I will kill anything
that comes in my way, and lead the train even
to the end of the earth,&mdash;and may God
forget my right hand, if this is not true!â
A still louder âHurrah!â answered these
words, and all began to sing with great enthusiasm
the emigrantsâ song: âI crossed
the Mississippi, I will cross the Missouri.â
Then Smith, the oldest among the emigrants,
a miner from near Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania,
spoke in answer. He thanked me in the
name of the whole company, and lauded my
skill in leading the caravan. After Smith,
from nearly every wagon a man spoke. Some
made very amusing remarks, for instance
Henry Simpson, who cried out every little
while: âGentlemen! Iâll be hanged if I
donât tell the truth!â When the speakers
had grown hoarse at last, the flutes sounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the bones rattled, and the men began to
dance a jig again.</p>

<p>Night had fallen completely; the moon came
out in the sky and shone so brightly that the
flame of the fires almost paled before its
gleams; the people and the wagons were
illuminated doubly by a red and a white
light. That was a beautiful night. The
uproar of our camp offered a strange but
pleasing contrast to the calmness and deep
slumber of the prairie.</p>

<p>Taking Lillianâs arm, I went with her
around the whole camp; our gaze passed
from the fires to the distance, and was lost
in the waves of the tall and dark grasses of
the prairie, silvery from the rays of the moon
and as mysterious as spirits. We strolled
alone in that way. Meanwhile, at one of the
fires, two Scottish Highlanders began to play
on pipes their plaintive air of âBonnie
Dundee.â We both stopped at a distance and
listened for some time in silence; all at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
I looked at Lillian, she dropped her eyes,&mdash;and
without knowing myself why I did so, I
pressed to my heart long and powerfully that
hand which she had rested on my arm. In
Lillian too the poor heart began to beat with
such force that I felt it as clearly as if on
my palm; we trembled, for we saw that
something was rising between us, that that
something was conquering, and that we would
not be to each other as we had been hitherto.
As to me I was swimming already whithersoever
that current was bearing me. I forgot that
the night was so bright, that the fires were not
distant, and that there were people around
them; and I wanted to fall at her feet at once,
or at least to look into her eyes. But she,
though leaning on my arm, turned her head,
as if glad to hide her face in the shade. I
wished to speak but could not; for it seemed
to me that I should call out with some voice
not my own, or if I should say the words
âI loveâ to Lillian I should drop to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
earth. I was not bold, being young then,
and was led not by my thoughts simply, but
by my soul too; and I felt this also clearly,
that if I should say âI love,â a curtain would
fall on my past; one door would close and
another would open, through which I should
pass into a certain new region. Hence,
though I saw happiness beyond that threshold
I halted, for this very reason it may be,&mdash;that
the brightness beating from out that place
dazzled me. Besides, when loving comes not
from the lips, but the heart, there is perhaps
nothing so difficult to speak about.</p>

<p>I had dared to press Lillianâs hand to my
breast; we were silent, for I had not the
boldness to mention love, and I had no wish
to speak of aught else,&mdash;it was impossible
at such a time.</p>

<p>It ended with this, that we both raised
our heads and looked at the stars, like people
who are praying. Then some one at the
great fire called me; we returned; the festival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
had closed, but to end it worthily and
well, the emigrants had determined to sing
a psalm before going to rest. The men had
uncovered their heads, and though among
them were persons of various faiths, all knelt
on the grass of the prairie and began to sing
the psalm, âWandering in the Wilderness.â
The sight was impressive. At moments of
rest the silence became so perfect that the
crackling of sparks in the fire could be heard,
and from the river the sound of the waterfalls
came to us.</p>

<p>Kneeling near Lillian, I looked once or twice
at her face; her eyes were uplifted and wonderfully
shining, her hair was a little disarranged;
and, singing the hymn with devotion,
she was so like an angel, that it seemed almost
possible to pray to her.</p>

<p>After the psalm, the people went to their
wagons. I, according to custom, repaired to
the sentries, and then to my rest, like the others.
But this time when the mosquitoes began to sing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in my ears, as they did every evening, âLillian!
Lillian! Lillian!â I knew that in that wagon
beyond there was sleeping the sight of my eye
and the soul of my soul, and that in all the
world there was nothing dearer to me than
that maiden.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="beg">At</span> dawn the following day we passed Cedar
River successfully and came out on a level,
broad prairie, stretching between that river and
the Winnebago, which curved imperceptibly
to the south, toward the belt of forests lying
along the lower boundary of Iowa. From the
morning Lillian had not dared to look in my
eyes. I saw that she was thoughtful; it
seemed as though she were ashamed of something,
or troubled for some cause; but still
what sin had we committed the evening before?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
She scarcely left the wagon. Aunt
Atkins and Aunt Grosvenor, thinking that she
was ill, surrounded her with care and tenderness.
I alone knew what that meant,&mdash;that it
was neither weakness, nor pangs of conscience;
it was the struggle of an innocent being with
the presentiment that a power new and unknown
is bearing it, like a leaf, to some place far
away. It was a clear insight that there was
no help, and that sooner or later she would
have to weaken and yield to the will of that
power, forget everything,&mdash;and only love.</p>

<p>A pure soul draws back and is afraid on the
threshold of love, but feeling that it will cross, it
weakens. Lillian therefore was as if wearied
by a dream; but when I understood all that,
the breath in my breast was nearly stopped from
joy. I know not whether it was an honorable
feeling, but when in the morning I flew past her
wagon and saw her, broken like a flower, I felt
something akin to what a bird of prey feels,
when it knows that the dove will not escape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
And still I would not do an injustice to that
dove for any treasure on earth, for with love I
had in my heart at the same time an immense
compassion. A wonderful thing however: notwithstanding
my feeling for Lillian, the whole
day passed for us as if in mutual offence, or at
least in perplexity. I was racking my head to
discover how I could be alone even for a moment
with her, but could not discover. Fortunately
Aunt Atkins came to my aid; she declared
that the little one needed more exercise, that
confinement in the stifling wagon was injuring
her health. I fell upon the thought that she
ought to ride on horseback, and ordered
Simpson to saddle a horse for her; and though
there were no side-saddles in the train, one of
those Mexican saddles with a high pommel
which women use everywhere on the frontier
prairies, could serve her very well. I forbade
Lillian to loiter behind far enough to drop out
of view. To be lost in the open prairie was
rather difficult, because people, whom I sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
out for game, circled about a considerable
distance in every direction. There was no
danger from the Indians, for that part of the
prairie, as far as the Winnebago, was visited by
the Pawnees only during the great hunts, which
had not begun yet. But the southern forest-tract
abounded in wild beasts, not all of which
were grass eating; wariness, therefore, was far
from superfluous.</p>

<p>To tell the truth I thought that Lillian
would keep near me for safety; this would permit
us to be alone rather frequently. Usually
I pushed forward in time of march some distance,
having before me only the two half-breed
scouts, and behind the whole caravan.
So it happened in fact, and I was at once inexpressibly
and truly happy, the first day, when I
saw my sweet Amazon moving forward at a
light gallop from the direction of the train.
The movement of the horse unwound her
tresses somewhat, and care for her skirt, which
was the least trifle short for the saddle, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
painted her face with a charming anxiety. When
she came up she was like a rose; for she knew
that she was going into a trap laid by me so that
we might be alone with each other, and knowing
this she came, though blushing, and as if unwilling,
feigning that she knew nothing. My
heart beat as if I had been a young student;
and, when our horses were abreast, I was angry
with myself, because I knew not what to say.
At the same time such sweet and powerful desires
began to go between us, that I, urged by
some unseen power, bent toward Lillian as if to
straighten something in the mane of her horse,
and meanwhile I pressed my lips to her hand,
which was resting on the pommel of the saddle.
A certain unknown and unspeakable happiness,
greater and keener than all delights that I had
known in life till that moment, passed through
my bones. I pressed that little hand to my
heart and began to tell Lillian, that if God had
bestowed all the kingdoms of the earth on me,
and all the treasures in existence, I would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
give for anything one tress of her hair, for she
had taken me soul and body forever.</p>

<p>âLillian, Lillian,â said I further, âI will
never leave you. I will follow you through
mountains and deserts, I will kiss your feet and
I will pray to you; only love me a little, only
tell me that in your heart I mean something.â</p>

<p>Thus speaking, I thought that my bosom
would burst, when she, with the greatest confusion,
began to repeat,&mdash;</p>

<p>âO Ralph! you know well! you know
everything!â</p>

<p>I did not know just this, whether to laugh or
to cry, whether to run away or to remain; and,
as I hope for salvation to-day, I felt saved
then, for nothing in the world was lacking
to me.</p>

<p>Thenceforth so far as my occupations permitted,
we were always together. And those
occupations decreased every day till we
reached the Missouri. Perhaps no caravan
had more success than ours during the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
month of the journey. Men and animals were
growing accustomed to order and skilled in
travelling; hence I had less need to look
after them, while the confidence which the
people gave me upheld perfect order in the
train. Besides, abundance of provisions and
the fine spring weather roused joyfulness and
increased good health. I convinced myself
daily, that my bold plan of conducting the
caravan not by the usual route through
St. Louis and Kansas, but through Iowa and
Nebraska, was best. There heat almost unendurable
tortured people, and in the unhealthy
region between the Mississippi and
Missouri fevers and other diseases thinned
the ranks of emigrants; here, by reason of
the cooler climate, cases of weakness were
fewer, and our labor was less.</p>

<p>It is true that the road by St. Louis was in
the earlier part of it freer from Indians; but my
train, composed of two or three hundred men
well furnished with weapons and ready for fighting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
had no cause to fear wild tribes, especially
those inhabiting Iowa, who though meeting
white men oftener, and, having more frequent
experience of what their hands could do, had
not the courage to rush at large parties. It
was only needful to guard against stampedes, or
night attacks on mules and horses,&mdash;the loss
of draught-animals puts a caravan on the prairies
in a terrible position. But against that there
was diligence and the experience of sentries who,
for the greater part, were as well acquainted
with the stratagems of Indians as I was.</p>

<p>When once I had introduced travelling discipline
and made men accustomed to it, I had
incomparably less to do during the day, and
could devote more time to the feelings which
had seized my heart. In the evening I went
to sleep with the thought: âTo-morrow I
shall see Lillian;â in the morning I said to
myself: âTo-day I shall see Lillian;â and every
day I was happier and every day more in love.
In the caravan people began by degrees to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
notice this; but no one took it ill of me, for
Lillian and I possessed the good-will of those
people. Once old Smith said in passing: âGod
bless you, captain, and you, Lillian.â That
connecting of our names made us happy all
day. Aunt Grosvenor and Aunt Atkins whispered
something frequently in Lillianâs ear,
which made her blush like the dawn, but she
would never tell me what it was. Henry
Simpson looked on us rather gloomily,&mdash;perhaps
he was forging some plan in his soul, but I
paid no heed to that.</p>

<p>Every morning at four I was at the head
of the caravan; before me the scouts, some
fifteen hundred yards distant, sang songs,
which their Indian mothers had taught them;
behind me at the same distance moved the
caravan, like a white ribbon on the prairie,&mdash;and
what a wonderful moment, when, about
two hours later, I hear on a sudden behind me
the tramp of a horse. I look, and behold the
sight of my soul, my beloved is approaching.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
The morning breeze bears behind her her hair,
which either had been loosened from the
movement, or badly fastened on purpose, for
the little rogue knew that she looked better that
way, that I liked her that way, and that when
the wind threw the tress on me I pressed it to
my lips. I feign not to notice her tricks, and
in this agreeable meeting the morning begins
for us. I taught her the Polish phrase: âDzien
dobryâ (good morning). When I heard her
pronouncing those words, she seemed still
dearer; the memory of my country, of my
family, of years gone by, of that which had been,
of that which had passed, flew before my eyes
on that prairie like mews of the ocean. More
than once I would have broken out in weeping,
but from shame I restrained with my eyelids
the tears that were ready to flow. She, seeing
that the heart was melting in me, repeated like
a trained starling: âDzien dobry! dzien dobry!
dzien dobry!â And how was I not to love my
starling beyond everything? I taught her then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
other phrases; and when her lips struggled
with our difficult sounds, and I laughed at a
faulty pronunciation, she pouted like a little
child, feigning anger and resentment. But we
had no quarrels, and once only a cloud flew
between us. One morning I pretended to
tighten a strap on her stirrup, but in truth the
leopard Uhlan was roused in me, and I began to
kiss her foot, or rather the poor shoe worn out
in the wilderness. Then she drew her foot
close to the horse, and repeating: âNo, Ralph!
no! no!â sprang to one side; and though I
implored and strove to pacify her she would
not come near me. She did not return to
the caravan, however, fearing to pain me too
much. I feigned a sorrow a hundred times
greater than I felt in reality, and sinking into
silence, rode on as if all things had ended on
earth for me. I knew that compassion would
stir in her, as indeed it did; for soon, alarmed
at my silence, she began to ride up at one side
and look at my eyes, like a child which wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to know if its mother is angry yet,&mdash;and I,
wishing to preserve a gloomy visage, had to turn
aside to avoid laughing aloud.</p>

<p>But this was one time only. Usually we were
as gladsome as prairie squirrels, and sometimes,
God forgive me, I, the leader of that caravan,
became a child with her. More than once
when we were riding side by side I would turn
on a sudden, saying to her that I had something
important and new to tell, and when she held
her inquisitive ear I whispered into it: âI
love.â Then she also whispered into my ear in
answer, with a smile and blush, âI also!â And
thus we confided our secrets to each other on
the prairie, where the wind alone could overhear
us.</p>

<p>In this manner day shot after day so quickly,
that, as I thought, the morning seemed to touch
the evening like links in a chain. At times
some event of the journey would vary such
pleasant monotony. A certain Sunday the half-breed
Wichita caught with a lasso an antelope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of a large kind, and with her a fawn which I
gave to Lillian, who made for it a collar on which
was put a bell, taken from a mule. This fawn
we called Katty. In a week it was tame, and ate
from our hands. During the march I would
ride on one side of Lillian, and Katty would
run on the other, raising its great black eyes
and begging with a bleat for caresses.</p>

<p>Beyond the Winnebago we came out on a
plain as level as a table, broad, rich, primeval.
The scouts vanished from our eyes at times in
the grass; our horses waded, as if in a river. I
showed Lillian that world altogether new to her,
and when she was delighted with its beauties, I
felt proud that that kingdom of mine was so
pleasing to her. It was spring,&mdash;April was
barely reaching its end, the time of richest
growth for grasses of all sorts. What was to
bloom on the plains was blooming already.</p>

<p>In the evening such intoxicating odors came
from the prairie, as from a thousand censers;
in the day, when the wind blew and shook the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
flowery expanse, the eye was just pained with
the glitter of red, blue, yellow, and colors of
all kinds. From the dense bed shot up the
slender stalks of yellow flowers, like our mullein;
around these wound the silver threads
of a plant called âtears,â whose clusters, composed
of transparent little balls, are really like
tears. My eyes, used to reading in the prairie,
discovered repeatedly plants that I knew: now
it was the large-leaved kalumna, which cures
wounds; now the plant called âwhite and red
stockings,â which closes its cups at the approach
of man or beast; finally, âIndian hatchets,â
the odor of which brings sleep and
almost takes away consciousness. I taught
Lillian at that time to read in this Divine
book, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>âIt will come to you to live in forests and
on plains; it is well then to know them in
season.â</p>

<p>In places on the level prairie rose, as if they
were oases, groups of cottonwood or alder, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
wreathed with wild grapes and lianas that they
could not be recognized under the tendrils and
leaves. On the lianas in turn climbed ivy
and the prickly, thorny âwachtia,â resembling
wild roses. Flowers were just dropping at all
points; inside, underneath that screen and
beyond that wall, was a certain mysterious
gloom; at the tree trunks were sleeping great
pools of water of the spring-time, which the
sun was unable to drink up; from the tree-tops
and among the brocade of flowers came
wonderful voices and the calling of birds.
When for the first time I showed such trees
to Lillian and such hanging cascades of flowers,
she stood as if fixed to the earth, repeating
with clasped hands,&mdash;</p>

<p>âOh, Ralph! is that real?â</p>

<p>She said that she was a little afraid to enter
such a depth; but one afternoon, when the
heat was great, and over the prairie was flying,
as it were, the hot breath of the Texan wind,
we rode in, and Katty came after us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>We stopped at a little pool, which reflected
our two horses and our two forms; we remained
in silence for a time. It was cool
there, obscure, solemn as in a Gothic cathedral,
and somewhat awe-inspiring. The light
of day came in bedimmed, greenish from the
leaves. Some bird, hidden under the cupola
of lianas, cried, âNo! no! no!â as if warning
us not to go farther; Katty began to
tremble and nestle up to the horses; Lillian
and I looked at each other suddenly, and for
the first time our lips met, and having met
could not separate. She drank my soul, I
drank her soul. Breath began to fail each
of us, still lips were on lips. At last her eyes
were covered with mist, and the hands which
she had placed on my shoulders were trembling
as in a fever: she was seized with a kind of
oblivion of her own existence, so that she grew
faint and placed her head on my bosom. We
were drunk with each other, with bliss, and
with ecstasy. I dared not move; but because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
I had a soul overfilled, because I loved a hundred
times more than may be thought or expressed,
I raised my eyes to discover if through
the thick leaves I could see the sky.</p>

<p>Recovering our senses, we came out at last
from beneath the green density to the open
prairie, where we were surrounded by the
bright sunshine and warm breeze; before us
was spread the broad and gladsome landscape.
Prairie chickens were fluttering in the grass,
and on slight elevations, which were perforated
like a sieve by prairie dogs, stood, as it were,
an army of those little creatures, which vanished
under the earth at our coming; directly
in front was the caravan, and horsemen careering
around it.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that we had come out of
a dark chamber to the white world, and the
same thought must have come to Lillian. The
brightness of the day rejoiced me; but that
excess of golden light and the memory of rapturous
kisses, traces of which were still evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
on her face, penetrated Lillian as it were with
alarm and with sadness.</p>

<p>âRalph, will you not take that ill of me?â
asked she, on a sudden.</p>

<p>âWhat comes to your head, O my own!
God forget me if in my heart there is any feeling
but respect and the highest love for you.â</p>

<p>âI did that because I love greatly,â said she;
and therewith her lips began to quiver and
she wept in silence, and though I was working
the soul out of myself she remained sad all that
day.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="beg">At</span> last we came to the Missouri. Indians
chose generally the time of crossing that river
to fall upon caravans; defence is most difficult
when some wagons are on one bank, and
some in the river; when the draught-beasts are
stubborn and balky, and disorder rises among
the people. Indeed, I noticed, before our
arrival at the river, that Indian spies had for
two days been following us; I took every precaution
therefore, and led the train in complete
military order. I did not permit wagons to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
loiter on the prairie, as in the eastern districts
of Iowa; the men had to stay together and be
in perfect readiness for battle.</p>

<p>When we had come to the bank and found
a ford, I ordered two divisions, of sixty men
each, to intrench themselves on both banks,
so as to secure the passage under cover
of small forts and the muzzles of rifles. The
remaining hundred and twenty emigrants had
to take the train over. I did not send in
more than a few wagons at once, so as to avoid
confusion. With such an arrangement everything
took place in the greatest order, and
attack became impossible, for the attackers
would have had to carry one or the other
intrenchment before they could fall upon those
who were crossing the river.</p>

<p>How far these precautions were not superfluous
the future made evident, for two years
later four hundred Germans were cut to pieces
by the Kiowas, at the place where Omaha
stands at this moment. I had this advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
besides: my men, who previously had
heard more than once narratives, which went
to the East, of the terrible danger of crossing
the yellow waters of the Missouri, seeing
the firmness and ease with which I had
solved the problem, gained blind confidence,
and began to look on me as some ruling
spirit of the plains.</p>

<p>Daily did those praises and that enthusiasm
reach Lillian, in whose loving eyes I grew to be
a legendary hero. Aunt Atkins said to her:
âWhile your Pole is with you, you may sleep
out in the rain, for he wonât let the drops fall
on you.â And the heart rose in my maiden
from those praises. During the whole time of
crossing I could give her hardly a moment,
and could only say hurriedly with my eyes
what my lips could not utter. All day I was
on horseback, now on one bank, now on the
other, now in the water. I was in a hurry to
advance as soon as possible from those thick
yellow waters, which were bearing down with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
them rotten trees, bunches of leaves, grass, and
malodorous mud from Dakota, infectious with
fever.</p>

<p>Besides this, the people were wearied immensely,
from continual watching; the horses
grew sick from unwholesome water, which we
could not use until we had kept it in charcoal
a number of hours.</p>

<p>At last, after eight daysâ time, we found ourselves
on the right bank of the river without
having broken a wagon, and with the loss of
only seven head of mules and horses. That
day, however, the first arrows fell, for my men
killed, and afterward, according to the repulsive
habit of the plains, scalped three Indians,
who had been trying to push in among the
mules. In consequence of this deed an embassy
of six leading warriors of the Bloody Tracks,
belonging to the Pawnee stock, visited us on
the following day. They sat down at our fire
with tremendous importance, demanding horses
and mules in return for the dead men, declaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
that, in case of refusal, five hundred warriors
would attack us immediately. I made no great
account of those five hundred warriors, since I
had the train in order and defended with intrenchments.
I saw well that that embassy had
been sent merely because those wild people had
caught at the first opportunity to extort something
without an attack, in the success of which
they had lost faith. I should have driven them
away in one moment, had I not wished to
exhibit them to Lillian. In fact, while they were
sitting at the council-fire motionless, with eyes
fixed on the flame, she, concealed in the wagon,
was looking with alarm and curiosity at their
dress trimmed at the seams with human hair,
their tomahawks adorned with feathers on the
handles, and at their faces painted black and
red, which meant war. In spite of these preparations,
however, I refused their demand
sharply, and, passing from a defensive to an
offensive rÃ´le, declared that if even one mule
disappeared from the train, I would go to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
tribe myself and scatter the bones of their five
hundred warriors over the prairie.</p>

<p>They went away, repressing their rage with
difficulty, but when going they brandished their
tomahawks over their heads in sign of war.
However, my words sank in their memory; for
at the time of their departure two hundred of
my men, prepared purposely, rose up with
threatening aspect, rattling their weapons, and
gave forth a shout of battle. That readiness
made a deep impression on the wild warriors.</p>

<p>Some hours later Henry Simpson, who at his
own instance had gone out to observe the
embassy, returned, all panting, with news that
a considerable division of Indians was approaching
us.</p>

<p>I, knowing Indian ways perfectly, knew that
those were mere threats, for the Indians, armed
with bows made of hickory, were not in numbers
sufficient to meet Kentucky rifles of long
range. I said that to Lillian, wishing to quiet
her, for she was trembling like a leaf; but all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the others were sure that a battle was coming;
the younger ones, whose warlike spirit was
roused, wished for it eagerly.</p>

<p>In fact, we heard the howling of the redskins
soon after; still, they kept at the distance
of some gun-shots, as if seeking a favorable
moment.</p>

<p>In our camp immense fires, replenished with
cottonwood and willows, were burning all night;
the men stood guard around the wagons; the
women were singing psalms from fear; the
mules, not driven out as usual to the night
pasture, but confined behind the wagons, were
braying and biting one another; the dogs, feeling
the nearness of the Indians, were howling,&mdash;in
a word, it was noisy and threatening
throughout the camp. In brief moments of
silence we heard the mournful and ominous
howling of the Indian outposts, calling with the
voices of coyotes.</p>

<p>About midnight the Indians tried to set fire
to the prairie, but the damp grass of spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
would not burn, though for some days not a raindrop
had fallen on that region.</p>

<p>When riding around the camp-ground before
daybreak I had a chance of seeing Lillian for a
moment. I found her sleeping from weariness,
with her head resting on the knees of Aunt
Atkins, who, armed with a bowie-knife, had
sworn to destroy the whole tribe, if one of them
dared to come near her darling. As to me, I
looked on that fair sleeping face with the love
not only of a man, but almost of a mother, and
I felt equally with Aunt Atkins that I would
tear into pieces any one who would threaten my
beloved. In her was my joy, in her my delight;
beyond her I had nothing but endless wandering,
tramping, and mishaps. Before my eyes
I had the best proof of this: in the distance
were the prairie, the rattle of weapons, the
night on horseback, the struggle with predatory
redskin murderers; nearer, right there before
my face, was the quiet sleep of that dear one,
so full of faith and trust in me, that my word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
alone had convinced her that there could be
no attack, and she had fallen asleep as full of
confidence as if under her fatherâs roof.</p>

<p>When I looked at those two pictures, I felt
for the first time how that adventurous life
without a morrow had wearied me, and I saw
at once that I should find rest and satisfaction
with her alone. âIf only to California!â
thought I, âif only to California! But the
toils of the journey&mdash;merely one-half of which,
and that half the easiest, is over&mdash;are evident
already on that pallid face; but a beautiful rich
country is waiting for us there, with its warm
sky and eternal spring.â Thus meditating, I
covered the feet of the sleeper with my buffalo-robe,
so that the night cold might not harm
her, and returned to the end of the camp.</p>

<p>It was time, for a thick mist had begun to rise
from the river; the Indians might really take
advantage of it and try their fortune. The fires
were dimmed more and more, and grew pale.
An hour later one man could not see another if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
ten paces distant. I gave command then to cry
on the square every minute, and soon nothing
was heard in that camp but the prolonged
âAllâs well!â which passed from mouth to
mouth like the words of a litany.</p>

<p>But the Indian camp had grown perfectly
still, as if its occupants were dumb. This began
to alarm me. At the first dawn an immense
weariness mastered us; God knows how many
nights the majority of the men had passed
without sleep,&mdash;besides, the fog, wonderfully
penetrating, sent a chill and a shiver through
all.</p>

<p>Would it not be better, thought I, instead of
standing on one place and waiting for what may
please the Indians, to attack and scatter them
to the four winds? This was not simply the
whim of an Uhlan, but an absolute need; for a
daring and lucky attack might gain us great
glory, which, spreading among the wild tribes,
would give us safety for a long stretch of road.</p>

<p>Leaving behind me one hundred and thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
men, under the lead of the old prairie wolf,
Smith, I commanded a hundred others to mount
their horses, and we moved forward somewhat
cautiously, but gladly, for the cold had become
more annoying, and in this way it was possible to
warm ourselves at least. At twice the distance
of a gunshot we raced forward at a gallop with
shouting, and in the midst of a musket-fire
rushed, like a storm, on the savages. A ball,
sent from our side by some awkward marksman,
whistled right at my ear, but only tore
my cap.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we were on the necks of the
Indians, who expected anything rather than an
attack, for this was surely the first time that
emigrants had charged the besiegers. Great
alarm so blinded them, therefore, that they fled
in every direction, howling from fright like wild
beasts, and perishing without resistance. A
smaller division of these people, pushed to the
river and, deprived of retreat, defended themselves
so sternly and stubbornly that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
chose to rush into the water rather than beg
for life.</p>

<p>Their spears pointed with sharpened deer-horns
and tomahawks made of hard flint were
not very dangerous, but they used them with
wonderful skill. We burst through these, however,
in the twinkling of an eye. I took one
prisoner, a sturdy rascal, whose hatchet and
arm I broke in the moment of fighting with
hatchets.</p>

<p>We seized a few tens of horses, but so wild
and vicious that there was no use in them. We
made a few prisoners, all wounded. I gave command
to care for these most attentively, and set
them free afterward at Lillianâs request, having
given them blankets, arms, and horses, necessary
for men seriously wounded. These poor
fellows, believing that we would tie them to
stakes for torture, had begun to chant their
monotonous death-songs, and were simply terrified
at first by what had happened. They
thought that we would liberate only to hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
them in Indian fashion; but seeing that no
danger threatened, they went away, exalting our
bravery and the goodness of âPale Flower,â
which name they had given Lillian.</p>

<p>That day ended, however, with a sad event,
which cast a shade on our delight at such a considerable
victory, and its foreseen results. Among
my men there were none killed; a number,
nevertheless, had received wounds more or less
serious; the most grievously wounded was
Henry Simpson, whose eagerness had borne
him away during battle. In the evening his
condition grew so much worse, that he was
dying; he wished to make some confession to
me, but, poor fellow, he could not speak, for
his jaw had been broken by a tomahawk. He
merely muttered: âPardon, my captain!â
Immediately convulsions seized him. I divined
what he wanted, remembering the bullet which
in the morning had whistled at my ear, and I
forgave him, as becomes a Christian. I knew
that he carried with him to the grave a deep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
though unacknowledged feeling for Lillian, and
supposed that he might have sought death.</p>

<p>He died about midnight; we buried him under
an immense cottonwood, on the bark of which I
carved out a cross with my knife.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="beg">On</span> the following day we moved on. Before
us was a prairie still more extensive, more level,
wilder, a region which the foot of a white man
had hardly touched at that time,&mdash;in a word,
we were in Nebraska.</p>

<p>During the first days we moved quickly enough
over treeless expanses, but not without difficulty,
for there was an utter lack of wood for
fuel. The banks of the Platte River, which cuts
the whole length of those measureless plains,
were, it is true, covered with a dense growth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
osier and willow; but that river having a shallow
bed, had overflowed, as is usual in spring, and
we had to keep far away. Meanwhile we passed
the nights at smouldering fires of buffalo dung,
which, not dried yet sufficiently by the sun, rather
smouldered with a blue flame than burnt. We
hurried on then with every effort toward Big Blue
River, where we could find abundance of fuel.</p>

<p>The country around us bore every mark of a
primitive land. Time after time, before the
train, which extended now in a very loose line,
rushed herds of antelopes with ruddy hair and
with white under the belly; at times there appeared
in the waves of grass the immense
shaggy heads of buffaloes, with bloodshot eyes
and steaming nostrils; then again these beasts
were seen in crowds, like black moving patches
on the distant prairie.</p>

<p>In places we passed near whole towns formed
of mounds raised by prairie dogs. The Indians
did not show themselves at first, and only a number
of days later did we see three wild horsemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
ornamented with feathers; but they vanished
before our eyes in an instant, like phantoms. I
convinced myself afterward that the bloody
lesson which I had given them on the Missouri,
made the name of âBig Araâ (for thus they
had modified Big Ralph) terrible among the
many tribes of prairie robbers; the kindness
shown the prisoners had captivated those people,
wild and revengeful, though not devoid of
knightly feeling.</p>

<p>When we had come to Big Blue River, I
resolved to halt ten days at its woody banks.
The second half of the road, which lay before
us, was more difficult than the first, for beyond
the prairie were the Rocky Mountains, and farther
on the âBad Landsâ of Utah and Nevada.
Meanwhile, our mules and horses, in spite of
abundant pasture, had become lean and road-weary;
hence it was needful to recruit their
strength with a considerable rest. For this purpose
we halted in the triangle formed by the
Big Blue River and Beaver Creek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a strong position, which, secured on
two sides by the rivers and on the third by the
wagons, had become almost impregnable, especially
since wood and water were found on
the spot. Of camp labor there was scarcely
any, excessive watching was not needed, and
the emigrants could use their leisure with perfect
freedom. The days, too, were the most
beautiful of our journey. The weather continued
to be marvellous, and the nights grew
so warm that one might sleep in the open
air.</p>

<p>The people went out in the morning to hunt,
and returned at midday, weighed down with
antelopes and prairie birds, which lived in millions
in the country about; the rest of the day
they spent eating, sleeping, singing, or shooting
for amusement at wild geese, which flew in
whole flocks above the camp.</p>

<p>In my life there has never been anything
better or happier than those ten days between
the rivers. From morning till evening I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
not part from Lillian, and that beginning not of
passing visits, but, as it were, of life, convinced
me more and more that I had loved once and
forever her, the mild and gentle. I became
acquainted with Lillian in those days more
nearly and more deeply. At night, instead of
sleeping, I thought frequently of what she was,
and that she had become to me as dear and as
needful in life as air is for breathing. God
sees that I loved greatly her beautiful face, her
long tresses, and her eyes,&mdash;as blue as that sky
bending over Nebraska,&mdash;and her form, lithe
and slender, which seemed to say: âSupport
and defend me forever; without thee I cannot
help myself in the world!â God sees that I
loved everything that was in her, every poor bit
of clothing of hers, and she attracted me with
such force that I could not resist; but there
was another charm in her for me, and that was
her sweetness and sensitiveness.</p>

<p>Many women have I met in life, but never
have I met and never shall I meet another such,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and I feel endless grief when I think of her.
The soul in Lillian Morris was as sensitive as
that flower whose leaves nestle in when you
draw near to it. Sensitive to every word of
mine, she comprehended everything and reflected
every thought, just as deep, transparent
water reflects all that passes by the brink of it.
At the same time that pure heart yielded itself to
feeling with such timidity that I felt how great
her love must be when she weakened and gave
herself in sacrifice. And then everything honorable
in my soul was changed into one feeling
of gratitude to her. She was simply my one,
my dearest in the world; so modest, that I had
to persuade her that to love is not a sin, and I
was breaking my head continually over this:
how can I persuade her? In such emotions
time passed for us at the meeting of the
rivers, till at last my supreme happiness was
accomplished.</p>

<p>One morning at daybreak we started to walk
up Beaver Creek; I wanted to show her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
beavers; a whole kingdom of them was flourishing
not farther than half a mile from our
wagons. Walking along the bank carefully, near
the bushes, we came soon to our object. There
was a little bay as it were, or a lakelet, formed
by the creek, at the brink of which stood two
great hickory-trees; at the very bank grew
weeping-willows, half their branches in the
water. The beaver-dam, a little higher up in
the creek, stopped its flow, and kept the water
ever at one height in the lakelet, above whose
clear surface rose the round cupola-shaped
houses of these very clever animals.</p>

<p>Probably the foot of man had never stood
before in that retreat, hidden on all sides by
trees. Pushing apart cautiously the slender
limbs of the willows, we looked at the water,
which was as smooth as a mirror, and blue.
The beavers were not at their work yet; the
little water-town slumbered in visible quiet;
and such silence reigned on the lake that I
heard Lillianâs breath when she thrust her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
golden head through the opening in the
branches with mine and our temples touched.
I caught her waist with my arm to hold her on
the slope of the bank, and we waited patiently,
delighted with what our eyes were
taking in.</p>

<p>Accustomed to life in wild places, I loved
Nature as my own mother, though simply; but
I felt that something like Godâs delight in Creation
was present.</p>

<p>It was early morning; the light had barely
come, and was reddening among the branches
of the hickories; the dew was dropping from
the leaves of the willows, and the world was
growing brighter each instant. Later on, there
came to the other shore prairie chickens, gray,
with black throats, pretty crests on their heads,
and they drank water, raising their bills as they
swallowed.</p>

<p>âAh, Ralph! how good it is here,â whispered
Lillian.</p>

<p>There was nothing in my head then but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
cottage in some lonely canyon, she with me,
and such a rosary of peaceful days, flowing
calmly into eternity and endless rest. It
seemed to us that we had brought to that wedding
of Nature our own wedding, to that calm
our calm, and to that bright light the bright
light of happiness within us.</p>

<p>Now the smooth surface described itself in a
circle, and from the water came up slowly the
bearded face of a beaver, wet and rosy from
the gleam of the morning; then a second, and
the two little beasts swam toward the lake,
pushing apart with their noses blue lines, puffing
and muttering. They climbed the dam,
and, sitting on their haunches, began to call;
at that signal heads, larger and smaller, rose up
as if by enchantment; a plashing was heard in
the lake. The herd appeared at first to be
playing,&mdash;simply diving and screaming in its
own fashion from delight; but the first pair,
looking from the dam, gave a sudden, prolonged
whistle from their nostrils, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
twinkle half of the beavers were on the dam,
and the other half had swum to the banks and
vanished under the willows, where the water
began to boil, and a sound as it were of sawing
indicated that the little beasts were working
there, cutting branches and bark.</p>

<p>Lillian and I looked long, very long, at
these acts, and at the pleasures of animal
life until man disturbs it. Wishing to change
her position, she moved a branch accidentally,
and in the twinkle of an eye every beaver
had vanished; only the disturbed water indicated
that something was beneath; but after
a while the water became smooth, and silence
surrounded us again, interrupted only by the
woodpeckers striking the firm bark of the
hickories.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sun had risen above the
trees and began to heat powerfully. Since
Lillian did not feel tired yet, we resolved to
go around the little lake. On the way we came
to a small stream which intersected the wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and fell into the lake from the opposite side.
Lillian could not cross it, so I had to carry
her; and despite her resistance, I took her like
a child in my arms and walked into the water.
But that stream was a stream of temptations.
Fear lest I should fall made her seize my
neck with both arms, hold to me with all her
strength, and hide her shamed face behind my
shoulder; but I began straightway to press my
lips to her temple, whispering: âLillian! my
Lillian!â And in that way I carried her over
the water.</p>

<p>When I reached the other bank I wished
to carry her farther, but she tore herself from
me almost rudely. A certain disquiet seized
both of us; she began to look around as if
in fear, and now pallor and now ruddiness
struck her face in turn. We went on. I took
her hand and pressed it to my heart. At moments
fear of myself seized me. The day
became sultry; heat flowed down from the sky
to the earth; the wind was not blowing, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
leaves on the hickories hung motionless, the
only sound was from woodpeckers striking the
bark as before; all seemed to be growing languid
from heat and falling asleep. I thought
that some enchantment was in the air, in that
forest, and then I thought only that Lillian was
with me and that we were alone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile weariness began to come on
Lillian; her breathing grew shorter and more
audible, and on her face, usually pale, fiery
blushes beat forth. I asked if she was not
tired, and if she would not rest.</p>

<p>âOh, no, no!â answered she quickly, as
if defending herself from even the thought;
but after a few tens of steps she tottered
suddenly and whispered,&mdash;</p>

<p>âI cannot, indeed, I cannot go farther.â</p>

<p>Then I took her again in my arms and carried
that dear burden to the edge of the shore,
where willows, hanging to the ground, formed
a shady corridor. In this green alcove I placed
her on the moss. I knelt down; and when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
looked at her the heart in me was straitened.
Her face was as pale as linen, and her staring
eyes looked on me with fear.</p>

<p>âLillian, what is the matter?â cried I. âI
am with you.â I bent to her feet then and covered
them with kisses. âLillian!â continued
I, âmy only, my chosen, my wife!â</p>

<p>When I said these last words a shiver passed
through her from head to foot; and suddenly
she threw her arms around my neck with a
certain unusual power, as in a fever repeating,
âMy dear! my dear! my husband!â
Everything vanished from my eyes then, and
it seemed to me that the whole globe of the
earth was flying away with us.</p>

<p>I know not to this day how it could be that
when I recovered from that intoxication and
came to my senses twilight was shining again
among the dark branches of the hickories, but
it was the twilight of evening. The woodpeckers
had ceased to strike the trees; one
twilight on the bottom of the lake was smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
at that other which was in the sky; the inhabitants
of the water had gone to sleep; the
evening was beautiful, calm, filled with a red
light; it was time to return to the camp.</p>

<p>When we had come out from beneath the
weeping-willows, I looked at Lillian; there
was not on her face either sadness or disquiet;
in her upturned eyes was the light of calm resignation
and, as it were, a bright aureole of
sacrifice and dignity encircled her blessed head.
When I gave her my hand, she inclined her
head quietly to my shoulder, and, without turning
her eyes from the heavens, she said to me:</p>

<p>âRalph, repeat to me that I am your wife,
and repeat it to me often.â</p>

<p>Since there was neither in the deserts, nor in
the place to which we were going, any marriage
save that of hearts, I knelt down, and when she
had knelt at my side, I said: âBefore God,
earth, and heaven, I declare to thee, Lillian
Morris, that I take thee as wife. Amen.â</p>

<p>To this she answered: âNow I am thine forever
and till death, thy wife, Ralph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>!â</p>

<p>From that moment we were married; she was
not my sweetheart, she was my lawful wife.
That thought was pleasant to both of us,&mdash;and
pleasant to me, for in my heart there rose a new
feeling of a certain sacred respect for Lillian,
and for myself, a certain honorableness and
great dignity through which love became ennobled
and blessed. Hand in hand, with heads
erect and confident look, we returned to the
camp, where the people were greatly alarmed
about us. A number of tens of men had gone
out in every direction to look for us; and with
astonishment I learned afterward that some
had passed around the lake, but could not
discover us; we on our part had not heard
their shouts.</p>

<p>I summoned the people, and when they had
assembled in a circle, I took Lillian by the
hand, went into the centre of the circle, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>âGentlemen, be witnesses, that in your
presence I call this woman, who stands with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
me, my wife; and bear witness of this before
justice, before law, and before every one whosoever
may ask you, either in the East or
the West.â</p>

<p>âWe will! and hurrah for you both!â
answered the miners.</p>

<p>Old Smith asked Lillian then, according to
custom, if she agreed to take me as husband,
and when she said âYes,â we were legally
married before the people.</p>

<p>In the distant prairies of the West, and on
all the frontiers where there are no towns,
magistrates, or churches, marriages are not
performed otherwise; and to this hour, if a
man calls a woman with whom he lives under
the same roof his wife, this declaration takes
the place of all legal documents. No one of
my men therefore wondered, or looked at my
marriage otherwise than with the respect
shown to custom; on the contrary, all were
rejoiced, for, though I had held them more
sternly than other leaders, they knew that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
did so honestly, and with each day they
showed me more good will, and my wife
was always the eye in the head of the caravan.
Hence there began a holiday and amusements.
The fires were stirred up; the Scots
took from their wagons the pipes, whose music
we both liked, since it was for us a pleasant
reminiscence; the Americans took out their
favorite ox-bones, and amid songs, shouts, and
shooting, the wedding evening passed for us.</p>

<p>Aunt Atkins embraced Lillian every little
while, now laughing, now weeping, now lighting
her pipe, which went out the next moment.
But I was touched most by the following
ceremony which is a custom in that movable
portion of the American population which
spends the greater part of its life in wagons.
When the moon went down the men fastened
on the ramrods of their guns branches of
lighted osier, and a whole procession, under the
lead of old Smith, conducted us from wagon
to wagon, asking Lillian at each of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
âIs this your home?â My beautiful love
answered, âNo!â and we went on. At Aunt
Atkinsâ wagon a real tenderness took possession
of us all, for in that one Lillian had ridden
hitherto. When she said there also in a low
voice, âNo,â Aunt Atkins bellowed like a
buffalo, and seizing Lillian in her embrace,
began to repeat: âMy little one! my sweet!â
sobbing meanwhile, and carried away with
weeping. Lillian sobbed too; and then all
those hardened hearts grew tender for an
instant, and there was no eye to which tears
did not come.</p>

<p>When we approached it, I barely recognized
my wagon, it was decked with branches and
flowers. Here the men raised the burning
torches aloft, and Smith inquired in a louder
and more solemn voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>âIs this your home?â</p>

<p>âThatâs it! Thatâs it!â answered Lillian.</p>

<p>Then all uncovered their heads, and there
was such silence that I heard the hissing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the fire and the sound of the burnt twigs
falling on the ground; the old white-haired
miner, stretching out his sinewy hands over us,
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>âMay God bless you both, and your house,
Amen!â</p>

<p>A triple hurrah answered that blessing. All
separated then, leaving me and my loved one
alone.</p>

<p>When the last man had gone, she rested her
head on my breast, whispering: âForever!
forever!â and at that moment the stars in our
souls outnumbered the stars of the sky.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="beg">Next</span> morning early I left my wife sleeping
and went to find flowers for her. While
looking for them, I said to myself every moment:
âYou are married!â and the thought
filled me with such delight, that I raised my
eyes to the Lord of Hosts, thanking Him for
having permitted me to live to the time in
which a man becomes himself genuinely and
rounds out his life with the life of another
loved beyond all. I had something now of my
own in the world, and though that canvas-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
wagon was my only house and hearth, I
felt richer at once, and looked at my previous
wandering lot with pity, and with wonder that
I could have lived in that manner hitherto.
Formerly it had not even come to my head
what happiness there is in that word âwife,â&mdash;happiness
which called to my heartâs blood with
that name, and to the best part of my own
soul. For a long time I had so loved Lillian
that I saw the whole world through her only,
connected everything with her, and understood
everything only as it related to her. And now
when I said âwife,â that meant, mine, mine
forever; and I thought that I should go wild
with delight, for it could not find place in my
head, that I, a poor man, should possess such
a treasure. What then was lacking to me?
Nothing. Had those prairies been warmer,
had there been safety there for her, had it not
been for the obligation to lead people to the
place to which I had promised to lead them,
I was ready not to go to California, but to settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
even in Nebraska, if with Lillian. I had been
going to California to dig gold, but now I was
ready to laugh at the idea. âWhat other
riches can I find there, when I have her?â I
asked myself. âWhat do we care for gold?
See, I will choose some canyon, where there is
spring all the year; I will cut down trees for a
house, and live with her, and a plough and a
gun will give us life. We shall not die of
hunger&mdash;â These were my thoughts while
gathering flowers, and when I had enough of
them I returned to the camp. On the road I
met Aunt Atkins.</p>

<p>âIs the little one sleeping?â asked she,
taking from her mouth for a moment the inseparable
pipe.</p>

<p>âShe is sleeping,â answered I.</p>

<p>To this Aunt Atkins, blinking with one eye,
added,&mdash;</p>

<p>âAh, you rascal!â</p>

<p>Meanwhile the âlittle oneâ was not sleeping,
for we both saw her coming down from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
wagon, and shielding her eyes against the sunlight
with her hand, she began to look on every
side. Seeing me, she ran up all rosy and fresh,
as the morning. When I opened my arms, she
fell into them panting, and putting up her
mouth, began to repeat:&mdash;</p>

<p>âDzien dobry! dzien dobry! dzien dobry!â</p>

<p>Then she stood on her toes, and looking into
my eyes, asked with a roguish smile, âAm I
your wife?â</p>

<p>What was there to answer, except to kiss
without end and fondle? And thus passed the
whole time at that meeting of rivers, for old
Smith had taken on himself all my duties till
the resumption of our journey.</p>

<p>We visited our beavers once more, and the
stream, through which I carried her now without
resistance. Once we went up Blue River in a
little redwood canoe. At a bend of the stream
I showed Lillian buffaloes near by, driving their
horns into the bank, from which their whole
heads were covered as if with armor of dried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
clay. But two days before starting, these expeditions
ceased, for first the Indians had appeared
in the neighborhood, and second my
dear lady had begun to be weak somewhat.
She grew pale and lost strength, and when I
inquired what the trouble was, she answered
only with a smile and the assurance that it was
nothing. I watched over her sleep, I nursed
her as well as I was able, almost preventing the
breezes from blowing on her, and grew thin
from anxiety. Aunt Atkins blinked mysteriously
with her left eye when talking of Lillianâs
illness, and sent forth such dense rolls of smoke
that she grew invisible behind them. I was
disturbed all the more, because sad thoughts
came to Lillian at times. She had beaten it
into her head that maybe it was not permitted
to love so intensely as we were loving, and once,
putting her finger on the Bible, which we read
every day, she said sadly,&mdash;</p>

<p>âRead, Ralph.â</p>

<p>I looked, and a certain wonderful feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
seized my heart too, when I read, âWho
changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped
and served the creature more than the
Creator, who is blessed forever.â She said
when I had finished reading, âBut if God is
angry at this, I know that with His goodness
He will punish only me.â</p>

<p>I pacified her by saying that love was simply
an angel, who flies from the souls of two
people to God and takes Him praise from the
earth. After that there was no talk between us
touching such things, since preparations for the
journey had begun. The fitting up of wagons
and beasts, and a thousand occupations, stole
my time from me. When at last the hour came
for departure we took tearful farewell of that
river fork, which had witnessed so much of our
happiness; but when I saw the train stretching
out again on the prairie, the wagons one after
another and lines of mules before the wagons,
I felt a certain consolation at the thought that
the end of the journey would be nearer each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
day, that a few months more and we should see
California, toward which we were striving with
such toil.</p>

<p>But the first days of the journey did not
pass over-successfully. Beyond the Missouri,
as far as the foot of the Rocky Mountains,
the prairie rises continually over enormous
expanses; therefore the beasts were easily
wearied, and were often tired out. Besides,
we could not approach the Platte River, for,
though the flood had decreased, it was the
time of the great spring hunts, and a multitude
of Indians circled around the river, looking
for herds of buffaloes moving northward.
Night service became difficult and wearying;
no night passed without alarms.</p>

<p>On the fourth day after we had moved from
the river fork, I broke up a considerable party
of Indian plunderers at the moment when they
were trying to stampede our mules. But worst
of all were the nights without fire. We were
unable to approach the Platte River, and frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
had nothing to burn, and toward
morning drizzling rain began to fall; buffalo
dung, which in case of need took the place of
wood, got wet, and would not burn.</p>

<p>The buffaloes filled me with alarm also.
Sometimes we saw herds of some thousands
on the horizon, rushing forward like a storm,
crushing everything before them. Were such
a herd to strike the train, we should perish
every one without rescue. To complete the
evil, the prairie was swarming at that time
with beasts of prey of all species; after the
buffaloes and Indians, came terrible gray bears,
cougars, big wolves from Kansas and the Indian
Territory. At the small streams, where
we stopped sometimes for the night, we saw
at sunset whole menageries coming to drink
after the heat of the day. Once a bear rushed
at Wichita, our half-breed; and if I had not
run up, with Smith and the other scout, Tom,
to help him, he would have been torn to
pieces. I opened the head of the monster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
with an axe, which I brought down with such
force that the handle of tough hickory was
broken; still, the beast rushed at me once
more, and fell only when Smith and Tom shot
him in the ear from rifles. Those savage
brutes were so bold that at night they came
up to the very train; and in the course of a
week we killed two not more than a hundred
yards from the wagons. In consequence of
this, the dogs raised such an uproar from twilight
till dawn that it was impossible to close
an eye.</p>

<p>Once I loved such a life; and when, a year
before, I was in Arkansas, during the greatest
heat, it was for me as in paradise. But now,
when I remembered that in the wagon my beloved
wife, instead of sleeping, was trembling
about me, and ruining her health with anxiety,
I wished all the Indians and bears and cougars
in the lowest pit, and desired from my soul to
secure as soon as possible the peace of that
being so fragile, so delicate, and so worshipped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that I wished to bear her forever in
my arms.</p>

<p>A great weight fell from my heart when,
after three weeks of such crossings, I saw at
last the waters of a river white as if traced
out with chalk; this stream is called now
Republican River, but at that time it had no
name in English. Broad belts of dark willows,
stretching like a mourning trail along the
white waters, could afford us fuel in plenty;
and though that kind of willow crackles in the
fire, and shoots sparks with great noise, still
it burns better than wet buffalo dung. I appointed
at this place another rest of two days,
because the rocks, scattered here and there
by the banks of the river, indicated the proximity
of a hilly country, difficult to cross, lying
on both sides of the back of the Rocky Mountains.
We were already on a considerable elevation
above the sea, as could be known by
the cold nights.</p>

<p>That inequality between day and night temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
troubled us greatly. Some people,
among others old Smith, caught fevers, and
had to go to their wagons. The seeds of the
disease had clung to them, probably, at the
unwholesome banks of the Missouri, and hardship
caused the outbreak. The nearness of
the mountains, however, gave hope of a speedy
recovery; meanwhile, my wife nursed them
with a devotion innate to gentle hearts only.</p>

<p>But she grew thin herself. More than once,
when I woke in the morning, my first look fell
on her beautiful face, and my heart beat uneasily
at its pallor and the blue half circles
under her eyes. It would happen that while
I was looking at her in that way she would
wake, smile at me, and fall asleep again. Then
I felt that I would have given half my health
of oak if we were in California; but California
was still far, far away.</p>

<p>After two days we started again, and coming
to the Republican River at noon, were soon
moving along the fork of the White Man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
toward the southern fork of the Platte, lying for
the most part in Colorado. The country became
more mountainous at every step, and we
were really in the canyon along the banks of
which rose up in the distance higher and
higher granite cliffs, now standing alone, now
stretching out continuously like walls, now
closing more narrowly, now opening out on
both sides. Wood was not lacking, for all the
cracks and crannies of the cliffs were covered
with dwarf pine and dwarf oak as well. Here
and there springs were heard; along the rocky
walls scampered the wolverine. The air was
cool, pure, wholesome. After a week the fever
ceased. But the mules and horses, forced
to eat food in which heather predominated,
instead of the juicy grass of Nebraska, grew
thinner and thinner, and groaned more loudly
as they pulled up the mountains our well filled
and weighty wagons.</p>

<p>At last on a certain afternoon we saw before
us beacons, as it were, or crested clouds half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
melting in the distance, hazy, blue, azure, with
white and gold on their crests, and immense
in size, extending from the earth to the sky.</p>

<p>At this sight a shout rose in the whole
caravan; men climbed to the tops of the
wagons to see better, from every side thundered
shouts: âRocky Mountains! Rocky
Mountains!â Caps were waving in the air,
and on all faces enthusiasm was evident.</p>

<p>Thus the Americans greeted their Rocky
Mountains, but I went to my wagon, and,
pressing my wife to my breast, vowed faith
to her once more in spirit before those heaven-touching
altars, which expressed such solemn
mysteriousness, majesty, unapproachableness,
and immensity. The sun was just setting,
and soon twilight covered the whole country;
but those giants in the last rays seemed like
measureless masses of burning coal and lava.
Later on, that fiery redness passed into violet,
ever darker, and at last all disappeared, and
was merged into one darkness, through which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
gazed at us from above the stars, the twinkling
eyes of the night.</p>

<p>But we were at least a hundred and fifty
miles yet from the main chain; in fact, the
mountains disappeared from our eyes next day,
intercepted by cliffs; again they appeared and
again they vanished, as our road went by
turns.</p>

<p>We advanced slowly, for new obstacles
stood in our way; and though we kept as
much as possible to the bed of the river,
frequently, where the banks were too steep,
we had to go around and seek a passage by
neighboring valleys. The ground in these
valleys was covered with gray heather and
wild peas, not good even for mules, and
forming no little hindrance to the journey,
for the long and powerful stems, twisting
around, made it difficult to pass through
them.</p>

<p>Sometimes we came upon openings and
cracks in the earth, impassable and hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of yards long; these we had to go around
also. Time after time the scouts, Wichita
and Tom, returned with accounts of new
obstacles. The land bristled with rocks, or
broke away suddenly.</p>

<p>On a certain day it seemed to us that we
were going through a valley, when all at once
the valley was missing; in place of it was a
precipice so deep that the gaze went down
with terror along the perpendicular wall, and
the head became dizzy. Giant oaks, growing
at the bottom of the abyss, seemed little
black clumps, and the buffaloes pasturing
among them like beetles. We entered more
and more into the region of precipices, of
stones, fragments, debris, and rocks thrown
one on the other with a kind of wild disorder.
The echo sent back twice and thrice from
granite arches the curses of drivers and
squealing of mules. On the prairie our wagons,
rising high above the surface of the
country, seemed lordly and immense; here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
before those perpendicular cliffs, the wagons
became wonderfully small to the eye, and
vanished in those gorges as if devoured by
gigantic jaws. Little waterfalls, or as they
are called by the Indians, âlaughing waters,â
stopped the road to us every few hundred
yards; toil exhausted our strength and that
of the animals. Meanwhile, when at times the
real chain of mountains appeared on the
horizon, it seemed as far away and hazy as
ever. Happily curiosity overcame in us even
weariness, and the continual change of views
kept it in practice. None of my people, not
excepting those who were born in the Alleghanies,
had ever seen such wild regions;
I myself gazed with wonder on those canyons,
along the edges of which the unbridled fancy
of Nature had reared as it were castles, fortresses,
and stone cities. From time to time
we met Indians, but these were different from
those on the prairies, very straggling and very
much wilder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The sight of white men roused in them
fear mingled with a desire for blood. They
seemed still more cruel than their brethren
in Nebraska; their stature was loftier, their
complexion much darker, their wide nostrils
and quick glances gave them the expression
of wild beasts caught in a trap. Their movements,
too, had almost the quickness and
timidity of beasts. While speaking, they put
their thumbs to their cheeks, which were
painted in white and blue stripes. Their
weapons were tomahawks and bows, the latter
made of a certain kind of firm mountain
hawthorn, so rigid that my men could not
bend them. These savages, who in considerable
numbers might have been very dangerous,
were distinguished by invincible thievishness;
happily they were few, the largest party that
we met not exceeding fifteen. They called
themselves Tabeguachis, Winemucas, and Yampas.
Our scout, Wichita, though expert in
Indian dialects, could not understand their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
language; hence we could not make out in
any way why all of them, pointing to the
Rocky Mountains and then to us, closed and
opened their palms, as if indicating some
number.</p>

<p>The road became so difficult, that with
the greatest exertion, we made barely fifteen
miles a day. At the same time our horses
began to die, being less enduring than mules
and more choice of food; men failed in
strength too, for during whole days they had
to draw wagons with the mules, or to hold
them in dangerous places. By degrees unwillingness
seized the weakest; some got the
rheumatism, and one, through whose mouth
blood came from exertion, died in three days,
cursing the hour in which it came to his head
to leave New York. We were then in the
worst part of the road, near the little river
called by the Indians Kiowa. There were no
cliffs there as high as on the Eastern boundary
of Colorado; but the whole country, as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the eye could reach, was bristling with fragments
thrown in disorder one upon another.
These fragments, some standing upright, others
overturned, presented the appearance of ruined
graveyards with fallen headstones. Those were
really the âBad Landsâ of Colorado, answering
to those which extended northward over Nebraska.
With the greatest effort we escaped
from them in the course of a week.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="beg">At</span> last we found ourselves at the foot of the
Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Fear seized me when I looked from a proximate
point at that world of granite mountains,
whose sides were wrapped in mist, and whose
summits were lost somewhere in eternal snow
and clouds. Their size and silent majesty
pressed me to the earth; hence I bent before
the Lord, imploring Him to permit me to lead,
past those measureless walls, my wagons, my
people, and my wife. After such a prayer I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
entered the stone gullies and corridors with
more confidence. When they closed behind us
we were cut off from the rest of the world.
Above was the sky; in it a few eagles were
screaming, around us was granite and then
granite without end,&mdash;a genuine labyrinth of
passages, vaults, ravines, openings, precipices,
towers, silent edifices, and as it were chambers,
gigantic and dreamy. There is such
a solemnity there, and the soul is under such
pressure, that a man knows not himself why he
whispers instead of speaking aloud. It seems
to him that the road is closing before him continually,
that some voice is saying to him: âGo
no farther, for there is no passage!â It seems
to him that he is attacking some secret on
which God Himself has set a seal. At night,
when those upright legions were standing as black
as mourning, and the moon cast about their
summits a silvery mantle of sadness, when certain
wonderful shadows rose around the âlaughing
waters,â a quiver passed through the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
hardened adventurers. We spent whole hours
by the fires, looking with a certain superstitious
awe at the dark depths of the ravines, lighted by
ruddy gleams; we seemed to think that something
terrible might show itself any moment.</p>

<p>Once we found under a hollow in the cliff
the skeleton of a man; and though from the
remnant of the hair which had dried to the
skull, we saw that he was an Indian, still an
ominous feeling pressed our hearts, for that
skeleton with grinning teeth seemed to forewarn
us that whoso wandered in there would
never come out again.</p>

<p>That same day the half-breed, Tom, was
killed suddenly, having fallen with his horse
from the edge of a cliff. A gloomy sadness
seized the whole caravan; formerly we had
advanced noisily and joyfully, now the drivers
ceased to swear, and the caravan pushed forward
in a silence broken only by the squeaking of
wheels. The mules grew ill-tempered more
frequently, and when one pair stood as still as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
if lashed to the earth, all the wagons behind
them had to stop. I was most tortured by this,&mdash;that
in those moments which were so difficult
and oppressive, and in which my wife needed my
presence more than at other times, I could not
be near her; for I had to double and treble myself
almost, so as to give an example, uphold courage
and confidence. The men, it is true, bore toil
with the endurance innate with Americans, though
they were simply using the last of their strength.
But my health was proof against every hardship.
There were nights in which I did not have two
hours of sleep; I dragged the wagons with
others, I posted the sentries, I went around the
square,&mdash;in a word, I performed service twice
more burdensome than any one of the company;
but it is evident that happiness gave me strength.
For when, wearied and beaten down, I came to
my wagon, I found there everything that I held
dearest: a faithful heart and a beloved hand,
that wiped my wearied forehead. Lillian,
though suffering a little, never went to sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
wittingly before my arrival; and when I reproached
her she closed my mouth with a kiss
and a prayer not to be angry. When I told her
to sleep she did so, holding my hand. Frequently
in the night, when she woke, she covered
me with beaver skins, so that I might rest
better. Always mild, sweet, loving, she cared
for me and brought me to worship her simply.
I kissed the hem of her garment, as if it had
been the most sacred thing, and that wagon of
ours became for me almost a church. That
little one in presence of those heaven-touching
walls of granite, upon which she cast her upraised
eyes, covered them for me in such a way,
that in presence of her they vanished from before
me, and amid all those immensities I saw only
her. What is there wonderful, if when strength
failed others, I had strength still, and felt that so
long as it was a question of her I would never
fail?</p>

<p>After three weeksâ journey we came at last to
a more spacious canyon formed by White River.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
At the entrance to it the Winta Indians prepared
an ambush which annoyed us somewhat;
but when their reddish arrows began to reach
the roof of my wifeâs wagon, I struck on them
with my men so violently that they scattered at
once. We killed three or four of them. The
only prisoner whom we took, a youth of
sixteen, when he had recovered a little from
terror, pointed in turn at us and to the West,
repeating the same gestures which the Yampa
had made. It seemed to us that he wanted to
say that there were white men near by, but it
was difficult to give credit to that supposition.
In time it turned out to be correct, and it is
easy to imagine the astonishment and delight of
my men on the following day, when, descending
from an elevated plateau, we saw on a broad
valley which lay at our feet, not only wagons,
but houses built of freshly-cut logs. These
houses formed a circle, in the centre of which
rose a large shed without windows; through the
middle of the plain a stream flowed; near it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
were herds of mules, guarded by men on
horseback.</p>

<p>The presence of men of my own race in that
valley filled me with astonishment, which soon
passed into fear, when I remembered that they
might be âcriminal outlawsâ hiding in the
desert from death. I knew from experience
that such outcasts push frequently to very remote
and entirely desert regions, where they
form detachments, on a complete military footing.
Sometimes they are founders of new
societies as it were, which at first live by plundering
people moving to more inhabited places;
but later, by a continual increase of population,
they change by degrees into ordered societies.
I met more than once with âoutlawsâ on the
upper course of the Mississippi, when, as a
squatter, I floated down logs to New Orleans;
more than once I had bloody adventures with
them, hence their cruelty and bravery were
equally well known to me.</p>

<p>I should not have feared them had not Lillian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
been with us; but at thought of the danger
in which she would be if we were defeated and
I fell, the hair rose on my head, and for the first
time in my life I was as full of fear as the greatest
coward. But I was convinced that if those
men were outlaws, we could not avoid battle
in any way, and that the conflict would be more
difficult with them than with Indians.</p>

<p>I warned my men at once of the probable
danger, and arranged them in order of battle. I
was ready either to perish myself, or destroy
that nest of wasps, and resolved to strike the
first blow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they saw us from the valley, and
two horsemen started toward us as fast as their
horses could gallop. I drew breath at that
sight, for âoutlawsâ would not send messengers
to meet us. In fact, it turned out that they were
riflemen of the American fur company, who had
their âsummer campâ in that place. Instead
of a battle, therefore, a most hospitable reception
was waiting for us, and every assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
from those rough but honest riflemen of the
desert. Indeed, they received us with open
arms, and we thanked God for having looked
on our misery and prepared such an agreeable
resting-place.</p>

<p>A month and a half had passed since our
departure from Big Blue River. Our strength
was exhausted, our mules were only half alive;
but here we might rest a whole week in perfect
safety, with abundance of food for ourselves,
and grass for our beasts. That was simply
salvation for us.</p>

<p>Mr. Thorston, the chief of the camp, was a
man of education and enlightenment. Knowing
that I was not a common rough fellow of the
prairies, he became friendly at once, and gave
his own cottage to me and Lillian, whose
health had suffered greatly.</p>

<p>I kept her two days in bed. She was so
wearied that she barely opened her eyes for
the first twenty-four hours; during that time I
took care that nothing should disturb her. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
sat at her bedside and watched hour after hour.
In two days she was strengthened enough to
go out; but I did not let her touch any work.
My men, too, for the first few days slept like
stones, wherever each one dropped down. Only
after they had slept did we repair our wagons
and clothing and wash our linen. The honest
riflemen helped us in everything earnestly.
They were Canadians, for the greater part,
who had hired with the company. They
spent the winter in trapping beavers, killing
skunks and minks; in summer they betook
themselves to so-called âsummer camps,â in
which there were temporary storehouses of
furs. The skins, dressed there in some fashion,
were taken under convoy to the East. The
service of those people, who hired for a number
of years, was arduous beyond calculation;
they had to go to very remote and wild places,
where all kinds of animals existed in plenty,
and where they themselves lived in continual
danger and endless warfare with redskins. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
is true that they received high wages; most
of them did not serve, however, for money,
but from love of life in the wilderness, and
adventures, of which there was never a lack.
The choice, too, was made of people of great
strength and health, capable of enduring all
toils. Their great stature, fur caps, and long
rifles reminded Lillian of Cooperâs tales; hence
she looked with curiosity on the whole camp
and on all the arrangements. Their discipline
was as absolute as that of a knightly order.
Thorston, the chief agent of the company,
and at the same time their employer, maintained
complete military authority. Withal
they were very honest people, hence time
passed for us among them with perfect comfort;
our camp, too, pleased them greatly,
and they said that they had never met
such a disciplined and well-ordered caravan.
Thorston, in presence of all, praised my plan
of taking the northern route instead of that
by St. Louis and Kansas. He told us that on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
that route a caravan of three hundred people,
under a certain Marchwood, after numerous
sufferings caused by heat and locusts, had
lost all their draught-beasts, and were cut to
pieces at last by the Arapahoe Indians. The
Canadian riflemen had learned this from the
Arapahoes themselves, whom they had beaten
in a great battle, and from whom they had
captured more than a hundred scalps, among
others that of Marchwood himself.</p>

<p>This information had great influence on my
people, so that old Smith, a veteran pathfinder,
who from the beginning was opposed to the
route through Nebraska, declared in presence
of all that I was smarter than he, and that it
was his part to learn of me. During our stay
in the hospitable summer camp we regained
our strength thoroughly. Besides Thorston,
with whom I formed a lasting friendship, I
made the acquaintance of Mick, famous in
all the States. This man did not belong to
the camp, but had wandered through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
deserts with two other famous explorers, Lincoln
and Kit Carson. Those three wonderful
men carried on real wars with whole tribes
of Indians; their skill and superhuman courage
always secured them the victory. The name
of Mick, of whom more than one book is
written, was so terrible to the Indians, that
with them his word had more weight than a
United States treaty. The Government employed
him often as an intermediary, and
finally appointed him Governor of Oregon.
When I made his acquaintance he was nearly
fifty years old; but his hair was as black as
the feather of a raven, and in his glance was
mingled kindness of heart with strength and
irrestrainable daring. He passed also for the
strongest man in the United States, and when
we wrestled I was the first, to the great astonishment
of all, whom he failed to throw to the
ground. This man with a great heart loved
Lillian immensely, and blessed her, as often
as he visited us. In parting he gave her a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
pair of beautiful little moccasins made by
himself from the skin of a doe. That present
was very timely, for my poor wife had not a
pair of sound shoes.</p>

<p>At last we resumed our journey, with good
omens, furnished with minute directions what
canyons to take on the way, and with supplies
of salt game. That was not all. The
kind Thorston had taken the worst of our
mules and in place of them given us his own,
which were strong and well rested. Mick,
who had been in California, told us real
wonders not only of its wealth, but of its
mild climate, its beautiful oak forests, and
mountain canyons, unequalled in the United
States. A great consolation entered our hearts
at once, for we did not know of the trials
which awaited us before entering that land of
promise.</p>

<p>In driving away, we waved our caps long
in farewell to the honest Canadians. As to
me, that day of parting is graven in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
heart for the ages, since in the forenoon that
beloved star of my life, putting both arms
around my neck, began, all red with embarrassment
and emotion, to whisper something
in my ear. When I heard it I bent to her feet,
and, weeping with great excitement, kissed her
knees.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="beg">Two</span> weeks after leaving the summer camp,
we came out on the boundary of Utah, and
the journey, as of old, though not without
labors, advanced more briskly than at the
beginning. We had yet to pass the western
part of the Rocky Mountains; forming a whole
network of branches called the Wasatch Range.
Two considerable streams, Green and Grand
Rivers, whose union forms the immense Colorado,
and numerous tributaries of those two
rivers, cut the mountains in every direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
opening in them passages which are easy
enough. By these passages we reached after
a certain time Utah Lake, where the salt lands
begin. A wonderful country surrounded us,
monotonous, gloomy; great level valleys encircled
by cliffs with blunt outlines,&mdash;these,
always alike, succeed one another, with oppressive
monotony. There is in those deserts and
cliffs a certain sternness, nakedness, and torpor,
so that at sight of them the Biblical deserts
recur to oneâs mind. The lakes here are
brackish, their shores fruitless and barren.
There are no trees; the ground over an
enormous expanse exudes salt and potash, or
is covered by a gray vegetation with large
felt-like leaves, which, when broken, give forth
a salt, clammy sap. That journey is wearisome
and oppressive, for whole weeks pass,
and the desert stretches on without end, and
opens into plains of eternal sameness, though
they are rocky. Our strength began to give
way again. On the prairies we were surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
by the monotony of life, here by the
monotony of death.</p>

<p>A certain oppression and indifference to
everything took gradual possession of the people.
We passed Utah,&mdash;always the same lifeless
lands! We entered Nevada,&mdash;no change!
The sun burnt so fiercely that our heads were
bursting from pain; the light, reflecting from
a surface covered with salt, dazzled the eye;
in the air was floating a kind of dust, coming
it was unknown whence, which inflamed our
eyelids. The draught-beasts, time after time,
seized the earth with their teeth, and dropped
from sunstroke, as if felled by lightning. The
majority of the people kept themselves up only
with the thought that in a week or two weeks
the Sierra Nevada would appear on the horizon,
and behind that the desired California.</p>

<p>Meanwhile days passed and weeks in ever
increasing labors. In the course of a certain
week we were forced to leave three wagons behind,
for there were no animals to draw them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, that was a land of misfortune and misery!
In Nevada the desert became deeper, and our
condition still worse, for disease fell upon us.</p>

<p>One morning people came to inform me
that Smith was sick. I went to see what his
trouble was, and saw with amazement that
typhus had overthrown the old miner. So
many climates are not changed with impunity;
severe labor, in spite of short rests, makes
itself felt, and the germs of disease are developed
from hardship and toil. Lillian, whom
Smith loved, as if she had been his own daughter,
and whom he blessed on the day of our
marriage, insisted on nursing him. I, weak
man, trembled in my whole soul for her, but
I could not forbid her to be a Christian. She
sat over the sick man whole days and nights,
together with Aunt Atkins and Aunt Grosvenor,
who followed her example. On the second
day, however, the old man lost consciousness,
and on the eighth he died in Lillianâs arms. I
buried him, shedding ardent tears over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
remains of him who had been not only my
assistant and right hand in everything, but a
real father to Lillian and me. We hoped that
after such a sacrifice God would take pity on
us; but that was merely the beginning of our
trials, for that very day another miner fell ill,
and almost every day after that some one lay
down in a wagon, and left it only when borne
on our arms to a grave.</p>

<p>And thus we dragged along over the desert,
and after us followed the pestilence, grasping
new victims continually. In her turn Aunt
Atkins fell ill, but, thanks to Lillianâs efforts,
her sickness was conquered. The soul was
dying in me every instant, and more than
once, when Lillian was with the sick, and
I somewhere on guard in front of the camp,
alone in the darkness, I pressed my temples
with my hands and knelt down in prayer to
God. Obedient as a dog, I was whining for
mercy on her without daring to say: âLet Thy
will and not mine be done.â Sometimes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the night, when we were alone, I woke suddenly,
for it seemed to me that the pestilence
was pushing the canvas of my wagon aside and
staring in, looking for Lillian. All the intervals
when I was not with her, and they formed most
of the time, were for me changed into one torture,
under which I bent as a tree before a
whirlwind. Lillian, however, had been equal to
all toils and efforts so far. Though the strongest
men fell, I saw her emaciated it is true,
pale, and with marks of maternity increasingly
definite on her forehead, but in health, and
going from wagon to wagon. I dared not
even ask if she were well; I only took her
by the shoulders and pressed her long and long
to my breast, and even had I wished to speak,
something so oppressed me, that I could not
have uttered a word.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, hope began to enter me,
and in my head were sounding no longer those
terrible words of the Bible: âWho worshipped
and served the creature more than the Creator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>.â</p>

<p>We were nearing the western part of Nevada,
where, beyond the belt of dead lakes,
the salt lands and desert rocks find an end,
and a belt of prairie begins, more level, greener,
and very fertile. During two daysâ journey no
one fell ill; I thought that our misery was over.
And it was high time!</p>

<p>Nine men had died, six were ailing yet;
under the fear of infection discipline had begun
to relax; nearly all the horses were dead, and
the mules seemed rather skeletons than beasts.
Of the fifty wagons with which we had moved
out of the summer camp, only thirty-two were
dragging now over the desert. Besides, since
no one wished to go hunting lest he might fall
somewhere away from the caravan and be left
without aid, our supplies, not being replenished,
were coming to an end. Wishing to spare
them, we had lived for a week past on black
ground squirrels; but their malodorous meat
had so disgusted us that we put it to our
mouths with loathing, and even that wretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
food was not found in sufficiency. Beyond the
lakes, however, game became more frequent,
and grass was abundant. Again we met Indians,
who, in opposition to their custom, attacked
us in daylight and on the open plain;
having firearms, they killed four of our people.
In the conflict I received such a severe wound
in the head from a hatchet that in the evening
of that day I lost consciousness from loss of
blood; but I was happy since Lillian was nursing
me, and not patients from whom she might
catch the typhus. Three days I lay in the
wagon, pleasant days, since I was with her
continually. I could kiss her hands when
she was changing the bandages, and look at
her. On the third day I was able to sit on
horseback; but the soul was weak in me, and
I feigned sickness before myself so as to be
with her longer.</p>

<p>Only then did I discover how tired I had
been, and what weariness had gone out of my
bones while I was lying prostrate. Before my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
illness I had suffered not a little concerning
my wife. I had grown as thin as a skeleton,
and as formerly I had been looking with fear
and alarm at her, so now she was looking with
the same feelings at me. But when my head
had ceased to fall from shoulder to shoulder
there was no help for it; I had to mount the
last living horse and lead the caravan forward,
especially as certain alarming signs were
surrounding us on all sides. There was a heat
well-nigh preternatural, and in the air a dull
haze as if of smoke from a distant burning; the
horizon became dull and dark. It was impossible
to see the sky, and the rays of the sun
came to the earth red and sickly; the draught-beasts
showed a wonderful disquiet, and, breathing
hoarsely, bared their teeth. As to us, we
inhaled fire with our breasts. The heat was
caused, as I thought, by one of those stifling
winds from the Gila desert, of which men had
told me in the East; but there was stillness
round about, and not a grass blade was stirring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
on the plain. In the evening the sun went
down as red as blood, and stifling nights followed.
The sick groaned for water, the dogs
howled. Whole nights I wandered around a
number of miles from the camp to make sure
that the plains were not burning; but there was
no fire in sight anywhere. I calmed myself
finally with the thought that the smoke must
be from a fire that had gone out already. In
the daytime I noticed that hares, antelopes,
buffaloes, even squirrels, were hastening eastward,
as if fleeing from that California to which
we were going with such effort. But since the
air had become a little purer and the heat
somewhat less, I settled finally in the thought
that there had been a fire which had ceased,
that the animals were merely looking for food
in some new place. It was only needful for us
to push up as soon as possible to the burnt strip,
and learn whether the belt of fire could be
crossed or whether we should go around it.
According to my calculation it could not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
more than three hundred miles to the Sierra
Nevada, or about twenty daysâ journey. I
resolved, therefore, to reach it, even with our
last effort.</p>

<p>We travelled at night now, for during the
hours of midday heat weakened the animals
greatly, and among the wagons there was always
some shade in which they could rest.</p>

<p>One night, being unable to remain on horseback
because of weariness and my wound, I sat
in the wagon with Lillian. I heard all at once
a sudden wheezing and biting of the wheels
striking on some peculiar ground; at the same
time shouts of âStop! stop!â were heard along
the whole length of the train. I sprang from the
wagon at once. By the light of the moon I saw
the drivers bent to the earth and looking at it
carefully. At the same moment a voice called:</p>

<p>âHo, captain, we are travelling on coals.â</p>

<p>I bent down, felt the earth,&mdash;we were travelling
on a burnt prairie. I stopped the caravan
at once, and we remained the rest of the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
on that spot. With the first light of morning
a wonderful sight struck our eyes: As far as
we could see, there lay a plain black as coal,&mdash;not
only were all the bushes and grass burnt,
but the earth was so glossy that the feet of our
mules and the wheels of the wagons were reflected
in it as they might have been in a
mirror. We could not see clearly the width of
the fire, for the horizon was still hazy from
smoke; but I gave command without hesitation
to turn to the south, so as to reach the edge of
that tract instead of venturing on the burnt
country. I knew from experience what it is to
travel on burnt prairie land where there is not
a blade of grass for draught-beasts. Since
evidently the fire had moved northward with
the wind, I hoped by going toward the south
to reach the beginning of it.</p>

<p>The people obeyed my order, it is true, but
rather unwillingly, for it involved God knows
how long a delay in the journey. During our
halt at noon the smoke became thinner; but if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
it did, the heat grew so terrible that the air
quivered from its fervency, and all at once
something took place which might seem a
miracle.</p>

<p>On a sudden the haze and smoke parted,
as if at a signal, and before our eyes rose
the Sierra Nevada, green, smiling, wonderful,
covered with gleaming snow on the summits,
and so near that with the naked eye we could
see the dents in the mountains, the green lakes,
and the forests. It seemed to us that a fresh
breeze filled with odors from the pitchy fir was
coming to us above the burnt fields, and that
in a few hours we should reach the flowery
foothills. At this sight the people, worn out
with the terrible desert and with labors, went
out of their minds almost with delight; some
fell on the ground sobbing, others stretched
forth their hands toward heaven or burst into
laughter, others grew pale without power to
speak. Lillian and I wept from delight too,
which in me was mingled with astonishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
for I had thought that a hundred and fifty
miles at least separated us yet from California;
but there were the mountains smiling at us
across the burnt plain, and they seemed to approach
as if by magic, and bend toward us and
invite us and lure us on.</p>

<p>The hours fixed for rest had not passed yet,
but the people would not hear of a longer
halt. Even the sick stretched out their yellow
hands from beneath the canvas roofs and
begged us to harness the mules and drive on.
Briskly and willingly we moved forward, and to
the biting of the wheels on the charred earth
were joined the cracking of whips, shouts, and
songs; of driving around the burnt tract there
was not a word now. Why go around when
a few tens of miles farther on was California
and its marvellous snowy mountains? We went
straight across toward them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the smoke covered the bright view
from us again with a wonderful suddenness.
Hours passed; the horizon came nearer. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
last the sun went down; night came. The stars
twinkled dimly on the sky, but we went forward
without rest; still the mountains were evidently
farther than they seemed. About midnight the
mules began to squeal and balk; an hour later
the caravan stopped, for the greater number of
the beasts had lain down. The men tried to
raise them, but there was no chance of doing so.
Not an eye closed all night. At the first rays
of light our glances flew eagerly into the distance
and&mdash;found nothing. A dark mourning desert
extended as far as the eye could see, monotonous,
dull, defining itself with a sharp line at
the horizon; of yesterdayâs mountains there was
not a trace.</p>

<p>The people were amazed. To me the ominous
word âmirageâ explained everything, but
also it went with a quiver to the marrow of my
bones. What was to be done,&mdash;go on? But
if that burnt plain extended for hundreds of
miles? Return, and then seek some miles distant
the end of the burnt tract?&mdash;but had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
mules strength to go back over the same road?
I hardly dared to look to the bottom of that
abyss, on the brink of which we were all standing.
I wished, however, to know what course
to take. I mounted my horse, moved forward,
and from a neighboring elevation I took in with
my eye a wider horizon with the aid of a field-glass.
I saw in the distance a green strip. When
I reached it, however, after an hourâs journey,
the place turned out to be merely a lake along
the bank of which the fire had not destroyed
vegetation completely. The burnt plain extended
farther than vision through the glass.
There was no help, it was necessary to turn back
the caravan and go around the fire. For that
purpose I turned my horse. I expected to find
the wagons where I had left them, for I had
given command to wait for me there. Meanwhile,
disobeying my command, they had raised
the mules, and the caravan went on. To my
questions they answered moodily: âThere are
the mountains, we will go to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>.â</p>

<p>I did not try even to struggle, for I saw that
there was no human power present to stop those
men. Perhaps I should have gone back alone
with Lillian, but my wagon was not there, and
Lillian had gone on with Aunt Atkins.</p>

<p>We advanced. Night came again, and with
it a forced halt. Out of the burnt plain
rose a great lurid moon and lighted the distance,
which was equally black. In the morning
only half of the wagons could be moved,
for the mules of the others had died. The
heat of that day was dreadful. The sunâs rays,
absorbed by the charred land, filled the air
with fire. On the road one of the sick men
expired in dreadful convulsions, and no one
undertook his burial; we laid him down on the
plain and went farther.</p>

<p>The water in the lake at which I had been
the day before refreshed men and animals for
a time, but could not restore their strength.
The mules had not nipped a grass blade for
thirty-six hours, and had lived only on straw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
which we took out of the wagons; but even that
failed them now. We marked the road as we
went with their bodies, and on the third day
there was left one only, which I took by force
for Lillian. The wagons and the tools in them,
which were to give us bread in California,
remained in that desert,&mdash;be it cursed for all
ages!</p>

<p>Every one now except Lillian went on foot.
Soon a new enemy looked us in the eyes,&mdash;hunger.
A part of our provisions had been left
in the wagons, that which each one could carry
was eaten. Meanwhile there was not a living
thing in the country around us. I alone in the
whole caravan had biscuits yet and a piece of
salt meat; but I hid them for Lillian, and I
was ready to rend any man to pieces who
would mention that food. I ate nothing myself,
and that terrible plain stretched on without
end.</p>

<p>As if to add to our torments the mirage appeared
in the midday hours on the plain again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
showing us mountains and forests with lakes; but
the nights were more terrible than ever. All the
rays which that charred land stole from the sun
in the daytime came out at night, scorching
our feet and parching our throats. On such a
night one man lost his mind, and sitting on
the ground burst into spasmodical laughter,
and that dreadful laughter followed us long in
the darkness. The mule on which Lillian was
riding fell; the famishing people tore it to
bits in a twinkle, but what food was that for
two hundred!</p>

<p>The fourth day passed and the fifth. From
hunger, the faces of the people became like
those of birds of some kind, and they began to
look with hate at one another. They knew
that I had provisions; but they knew, too, that
to ask one crumb of me was death, hence the
instinct of life overcame in them hunger. I
gave food to Lillian only at night, so as not to
enrage them with the sight of it. She implored
me by all that was holy to take my share, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
I threatened to put a bullet in my brain if she
even mentioned it. She was able, however, to
steal from my watchfulness crumbs which she
gave to Aunt Atkins and Aunt Grosvenor. At
that time hunger was tearing my entrails with
iron hand, and my head was burning from the
wound.</p>

<p>For five days there had been nothing in my
mouth but water from that lake. The thought
that I was carrying bread and meat, that I had
them with me, that I could eat, became a torture;
I was afraid besides, that being wounded,
I might go mad and seize the food.</p>

<p>âO Lord!â cried I in spirit, âsuffer me not
to become so far brutalized as to touch that
which is to keep her in life!â But there was
no mercy above me. On the morning of the
sixth day I saw on Lillianâs face fiery spots;
her hands were inflamed, she panted loudly.
All at once she looked at me wanderingly,
and said in haste, hurrying lest she might lose
presence of mind,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>âRalph, leave me here; save yourself, there
is no hope for me.â</p>

<p>I gritted my teeth, for I wanted to howl and
blaspheme; but saying nothing I took her by
the hands. Fiery zigzags began to leap before
my eyes in the air, and to form the words:
âWho worshipped and served the creature
more than the Creator?â I had broken like
a bow too much bent; so, staring at the merciless
heavens, I exclaimed with my whole soul
in rebellion,&mdash;</p>

<p>âI!â</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was bearing to the mount of
execution my dearest burden, this my only one,
my saint, my beloved martyr.</p>

<p>I know not where I found strength; I was
insensible to hunger, to heat, to suffering. I
saw nothing before me, neither people nor the
burning plain; I saw nothing but Lillian. That
night she grew worse. She lost consciousness;
at times she groaned in a low voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>âRalph, water!â And oh, torments! I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
only salt meat and dry biscuits. In supreme
despair I cut my arm with a knife to moisten
her lips with my blood; she grew conscious,
cried out, and fell into a protracted faint, from
which I thought she would not recover. When
she came to herself she wished to say something,
but the fever had blunted her mind, and
she only murmured,&mdash;</p>

<p>âRalph, be not angry! I am your wife.â</p>

<p>I carried her farther in silence. I had grown
stupid from pain.</p>

<p>The seventh day came. The Sierra Nevada
appeared at last on the horizon, and as the sun
was going down the life of my life began to
quench also. When she was dying I placed
her on the burnt ground and knelt beside her.
Her widely opened eyes were gleaming and
fixed on me; thought appeared in them for
a moment, and she whispered,&mdash;</p>

<p>âMy dear, my husband!â Then a quiver
ran through her, fear was on her face,&mdash;and
she died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>I tore the bandages from my head, and lost
consciousness. I have no memory of what happened
after that. As in a kind of dream I
remember people who surrounded me and took
my weapons; then they dug a grave, as it were;
and, still later, darkness and raving seized me,
and in them the fiery words: âWho worshipped
and served the creature more than the
Creator!â</p>

<p class="p2">I woke a month later in California at the
house of Moshynski, a settler. When I had
come to health somewhat I set out for Nevada;
the prairie had grown over again with grass,
and was abundantly green, so that I could not
find even her grave, and to this day I know not
where her sacred remains are lying. What
have I done, O God, that Thou didst turn Thy
face from me and forget me in the desert?&mdash;I
know not. Were it permitted me to weep even
one hour at her grave, life would be easier.
Every year I go to Nevada, and every year I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
seek in vain. Since those dreadful hours long
years have passed. My wretched lips have
uttered more than once, Let Thy will be done!
But without her it is hard for me in the world.
A man lives and walks among people, and
laughs even at times; but the lonely old heart
weeps and loves, and yearns and remembers.</p>

<p>I am old, and it is not long till I shall make
another journey, the journey to eternity; and
for one thing alone I ask God,&mdash;that on those
celestial plains I may find my heavenly one,
and not part from her ever again.</p>

<p class="drop-capi p2">IN the town of Antelope, situated on a river
of the same name in the State of Texas,
every living person was hurrying to the circus.
The inhabitants were interested all the more
since from the foundation of the town that
was the first time that a circus had come to
it with dancing women, minstrels, and rope-walkers.
The town was recent. Fifteen years
before not only was there not one house there,
but in all the region round about there were
no white people. Moreover, on the forks of
the river, on the very spot on which Antelope
was situated, stood an Indian village called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Chiavatta. That had been the capital of the
Black Snakes, who in their time were such
an eyesore to the neighboring settlements of
Berlin, GrÃ¼ndenau, and Harmonia, that these
settlements could endure them no longer.
True, the Indians were only defending their
âland,â which the State government of Texas
had guaranteed to them forever by the
most solemn treaties; but what was that to
the colonists of Berlin, GrÃ¼ndenau, and Harmonia?
It is true that they took from the
Black Snakes earth, air, and water, but they
brought in civilization in return; the redskins
on their part showed gratitude in their own
way,&mdash;that is, by taking scalps from the heads
of the Germans. Such a state of things could
not be suffered. Therefore, the settlers from
Berlin, GrÃ¼ndenau, and Harmonia assembled
on a certain moonlight night to the number
of four hundred, and, calling to their aid
Mexicans from La Ora, fell upon sleeping
Chiavatta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>The triumph of the good cause was perfect.
Chiavatta was burned to ashes, and the
inhabitants, without regard to sex or age,
were cut to pieces. Only small parties of warriors
escaped who at that time were absent
on a hunt. In the town itself not one soul
was left living, mainly because the place lay in
the forks of a river, which, having overflowed,
as is usual in spring-time, surrounded the settlement
with an impassable gulf of waters. But
the same forked position which ruined the
Indians, seemed good to the Germans. From
the forks it was difficult to escape, but the
place was defensible. Thanks to this thought,
emigration set in at once from Berlin, GrÃ¼ndenau,
and Harmonia to the forks, in which in
the twinkle of an eye, on the site of the wild
Chiavatta, rose the civilized town of Antelope.
In five years it numbered two thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p>In the sixth year they discovered on the
opposite bank of the forks a quicksilver mine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the working of this doubled the number of
inhabitants. In the seventh year, by virtue of
Lynch law, they hanged on the square of the
town the last twelve warriors of the Black
Snakes, who were caught in the neighboring
âForest of the Dead,â&mdash;and henceforth nothing
remained to hinder the development of Antelope.
Two âTagblÃ¤tterâ (daily papers) were
published in the town, and one âMontagsrevueâ
(Monday Review). A line of railroad united
the place with Rio del Norte and San Antonio;
on Opuncia Gasse (Opuncia Street) stood
three schools, one of which was a high school.
On the square where they had hanged the last
Black Snakes, the citizens had erected a
philanthropic institution. Every Sunday the
pastors taught in the churches love of oneâs
neighbor, respect for the property of others,
and similar virtues essential to a civilized
society; a certain travelling lecturer read a
dissertation âOn the rights of nations.â</p>

<p>The richest inhabitants had begun to talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of founding a university, to which the government
of the State was to contribute. The
citizens were prosperous. The trade in quicksilver,
oranges, barley, and wine brought them
famous profits. They were upright, thrifty,
industrious, systematic, fat. Whoever might
visit in later years Antelope with a population
nearing twenty thousand would not recognize
in the rich merchants of the place
those pitiless warriors who fifteen years before
had burned Chiavatta. The days passed for
them in their stores, workshops, and offices;
the evenings they spent in the beer-saloon
âGolden Sunâ on Rattlesnake Street. Listening
to those sounds somewhat slow and
guttural of âMahlzeit, Mahlzeit!â (meal-time,
meal-time), to those phlegmatic âNun ja
wissen Sie, Herr MÃ¼ller, ist das aber mÃ¶glich?â
(Well, now, Herr MÃ¼ller, but is that possible?),
that clatter of goblets, that sound of beer
dropping on the floor, that plash of overflowing
foam; seeing that calm, that ness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
those Philistine faces covered with fat,
those fishy eyes,&mdash;a man might suppose himself
in a beer-garden in Berlin or Monachium,
and not on the ruins of Chiavatta.
But in the town everything was âganz gemÃ¼thlichâ
(altogether cosey), and no one had a
thought of the ruins. That evening the whole
population was hastening to the circus, first,
because after hard labor recreation is as
praiseworthy as it is agreeable; second, because
the inhabitants were proud of its
arrival. It is well-known that circuses do
not come to every little place; hence the
arrival of the Hon. M. Deanâs troupe had
confirmed the greatness and magnificence of
Antelope. There was, however, a third and
perhaps the greatest cause of the general
curiosity.</p>

<p>No. Two of the programme read as follows:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">âA walk on a wire extended fifteen feet above
the ground will be made to the accompaniment of
music by the renowned gymnast Black Vulture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
sachem of the Black Snakes, the last descendant
of their chiefs, the last man of the tribe. 1. The
walk; 2. Springs of the Antelope; 3. The death-dance
and death-song.â</p>

<p class="pn1">If that âsachemâ could rouse the highest
interest in any place, it was surely in Antelope.
Hon. M. Dean told at the âGolden
Sunâ how fifteen years before, on a journey
to Santa FÃ©, he had found, on the Planos de
Tornado, a dying old Indian with a boy ten
years of age. The old man died from wounds
and exhaustion; but before death he declared
that the boy was the son of the slain sachem
of the Black Snakes, and the heir to that
office.</p>

<p>The troupe sheltered the orphan, who in time
became the first acrobat in it. It was only at
the âGolden Sun,â however, that Hon. M.
Dean learned first that Antelope was once
Chiavatta, and that the famous rope-walker
would exhibit himself on the grave of his
fathers. This information brought the director<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
into perfect humor; he might reckon now
surely on a <i>great attraction</i>, if only he knew
how to bring out the effect skilfully. Of
course the Philistines of Antelope hurried to
the circus to show their wives and children,
imported from Germany, the last of the Black
Snakes,&mdash;those wives and children who in their
lives had never seen Indians,&mdash;and to say:
âSee, we cut to pieces men just like that fellow,
fifteen years ago!â âAch, Herr Je!â It was
pleasant to hear such an exclamation of wonder
from the mouth of Amalchen, or little Fritz.
Throughout the town, therefore, all were repeating
unceasingly, âSachem! Sachem!â</p>

<p>From early morning the children were looking
through cracks in the boards with curious
and astonished faces; the older boys, more excited
by the warrior spirit, marched home from
school in terrible array, without knowing themselves
why they did so.</p>

<p>It is eight oâclock in the evening,&mdash;a wonderful
night, clear, starry. A breeze from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
suburbs brings the odor of orange groves, which
in the town is mingled with the odor of malt.
In the circus there is a blaze of light. Immense
pine-torches fixed before the principal gate are
burning and smoking. The breeze waves the
plumes of smoke and the bright flame which
illuminates the dark outlines of the building. It
is a freshly erected wooden pile, circular, with a
pointed roof, and the starry flag of America on
the summit of it. Before the gate are crowds
who could not get tickets or had not the wherewithal
to buy them; they look at the wagons
of the troupe, and principally at the canvas
curtain of the great Eastern door, on which is
depicted a battle of the whites with the redskins.
At moments when the curtain is drawn aside
the bright refreshment-bar within is visible, with
its hundreds of glasses on the table. Now they
draw aside the curtain for good, and the throng
enters. The empty passages between the seats
begin to resound with the steps of people, and
soon the dark moving mass fills all the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
from the highest point to the floor. It is clear
as day in the circus, for though they had not
been able to bring in gas pipes, a gigantic chandelier
formed of fifty kerosene lamps takes its
place. In those gleams are visible the heads
of the beer drinkers, fleshy, thrown back to give
room to their chins, the youthful faces of women,
and the pretty, wondering visages of children,
whose eyes are almost coming out of their heads
from curiosity. But all the spectators have the
curious, self-satisfied look that is usual in an
audience at a circus. Amid the hum of conversation
interrupted by cries of âFrisch
wasser! frisch wasser!â (fresh water), all
await the beginning with impatience.</p>

<p>At last a bell sounds, six grooms appear in
shining boots, and stand in two ranks at the
passage from the stables to the arena. Between
those ranks a furious horse rushes forth, without
bridle or saddle; and on him, as it were a
bundle of muslin ribbons and tulle, is the dancer
Lina. They begin man&oelig;uvring to the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of music. Lina is so pretty that young Matilda,
daughter of the brewer on Opuncia Gasse,
alarmed at sight of her beauty, inclines to the
ear of Floss, a young grocer from the same
street, and asks in a whisper if he loves her yet.
Meanwhile the horse gallops, and puffs like an
engine; the clowns, a number of whom run after
the dancer, crack whips, shout, and strike one
another on the faces. The dancer vanishes
like lightning; there is a storm of applause.
What a splendid representation! But No. One
passes quickly. No. Two is approaching. The
word âSachem! sachem!â flies from mouth to
mouth among the spectators. No one gives a
thought now to the clowns, who strike one
another continually. In the midst of the apish
movements of the clowns, the grooms bring
lofty wooden trestles several yards in height, and
put them on both sides of the arena. The band
ceases to play Yankee Doodle, and gives the
gloomy aria of the Commandore in Don Juan.
They extend the wire from one trestle to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
other. All at once a shower of red Bengal
light falls at the passage, and covers the whole
arena with a bloody glare. In that glare
appears the terrible sachem, the last of the
Black Snakes. But what is that? The sachem
is not there, but the manager of the troupe
himself, Hon. M. Dean. He bows to the public
and raises his voice. He has the honor to beg
âthe kind and respected gentlemen, as well as
the beautiful and no less respected ladies, to be
unusually calm, give no applause, and remain
perfectly still, for the chief is excited and wilder
than usual.â These words produce no little
impression, and&mdash;a wonderful thing!&mdash;those
very citizens of Antelope who fifteen years before
had destroyed Chiavatta, feel now some sort
of very unpleasant sensation. A moment before,
when the beautiful Lina was performing
her springs on horseback, they were glad to be
sitting so near, right there close to the parapet,
whence they could see everything so well; and
now they look with a certain longing for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
upper seats of the circus, and in spite of all laws
of physics, find that the lower they are the more
stifling it is.</p>

<p>But could that sachem remember? He was
reared from years of childhood in the troupe of
Hon. M. Dean, composed mainly of Germans.
Had he not forgotten everything? This seemed
probable. His environment and fifteen years
of a circus career, the exhibition of his art, the
winning of applause, must have exerted their
influence.</p>

<p>Chiavatta, Chiavatta! But they are Germans,
they are on their own soil, and think no
more of the fatherland than <i>business</i> permits.
Above all, man must eat and drink. This truth
every Philistine must keep in mind, as well as
the last of the Black Snakes.</p>

<p>These meditations are interrupted suddenly
by a certain wild whistle in the stables, and on
the arena appears the sachem expected so anxiously.
A brief murmur of the crowd is heard:
âThat is he, that is he!â&mdash;and then silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
But there is hissing from Bengal lights, which
burn continually at the passage. All eyes are
turned toward the chief, who in the circus will
appear on the graves of his fathers. The Indian
deserves really that men should look at him.
He seems as haughty as a king. A mantle of
white ermine&mdash;the mark of his chieftainship&mdash;covers
his figure, which is lofty, and so wild that
it brings to mind a badly tamed jaguar. He
has a face as it were forged out of bronze, like
the head of an eagle, and in his face there is a
cold gleam; his eyes are genuinely Indian, calm,
indifferent as it were,&mdash;and ominous. He
glances around on the assembly, as if wishing
to choose a victim. Moreover, he is armed
from head to foot. On his head plumes are
waving, at his girdle he has an ax and a knife
for scalping; but in his hand, instead of a bow,
he holds a long staff to preserve his balance
when walking on the wire. Standing in the
middle of the arena he gives forth on a sudden
a war cry. <i>Herr Gott!</i> That is the cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of the Black Snakes. Those who massacred
Chiavatta remember clearly that terrible howl,&mdash;and
what is most wonderful, those who fifteen
years before had no fear of one thousand
such warriors are sweating now before one.
But behold! the director approaches the chief
and says something to him, as if to pacify and
calm him. The wild beast feels the bit; the
words have their influence, for after a time
the sachem is swaying on the wire. With
eyes fixed on the kerosene chandelier he advances.
The wire bends much; at moments
it is not visible, and then the Indian seems
suspended in space. He is walking as it were
upward; he advances, retreats, and again he
advances, maintaining his balance. His extended
arms covered with the mantle seem
like great wings. He totters! he is falling!&mdash;No.
A short interrupted bravo begins like
a storm and stops. The face of the chief becomes
more and more threatening. In his
gaze fixed on the kerosene lamps is gleaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
some terrible light. There is alarm in the
circus, but no one breaks the silence. Meanwhile
the sachem approaches the end of the
wire, stops; all at once a war-song bursts
forth from his lips.</p>

<p>A strange thing! The chief sings in German.
But that is easy to understand. Surely he has
forgotten the tongue of the Black Snakes.
Moreover, no one notices that. All listen to
the song, which rises and grows in volume.
It is a half chant, a kind of half call, immeasurably
plaintive, wild, and hoarse, full of
sounds of attack.</p>

<p>The following words were heard: âAfter the
great yearly rains, five hundred warriors went
from Chiavatta on the war-path or to the
spring hunts; when they came back from war
they brought scalps, when they came back
from the hunt they brought flesh and the skins
of buffaloes; their wives met them with gladness,
and they danced in honor of the Great
Spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>âChiavatta was happy. The women worked
in the wigwams, the children grew up to be
beautiful maidens, to be brave, fearless warriors.
The warriors died on the field of glory,
and went to the silver mountains to hunt with
the ghosts of their fathers. Their axes were
never dipped in the blood of women and children,
for the warriors of Chiavatta were high-minded.
Chiavatta was powerful; but pale-faces
came from beyond distant waters and set fire to
Chiavatta. The white warriors did not destroy
the Black Snakes in battle, but they stole in as
do jackals at night, they buried their knives
in the bosoms of sleeping men, women, and
children.</p>

<p>âNow there is no Chiavatta. In place of it
the white men have raised their stone wigwams.
The murdered nation and ruined Chiavatta cry
out for vengeance.â</p>

<p>The voice of the chief became hoarse.
Standing on the wire, he seemed a red archangel
of vengeance floating above the heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of that throng of people. Evidently the director
himself was afraid. A silence as of death
settled down in the circus. The chief howled
on,&mdash;</p>

<p>âOf the whole nation there remained only
one little child. He was weak and small, but
he swore to the spirit of the earth that he
would have vengeance,&mdash;that he would see
the corpses of white men, women, and children,
that he would see fire and blood.â</p>

<p>The last words were changed into a bellow
of fury. In the circus murmurs were heard like
the sudden puffs of a whirlwind. Thousands of
questions without answer came to menâs minds.
What will he do, that mad tiger? What is he
announcing? How will he accomplish his vengeance,&mdash;he
alone? Will he stay here or
flee? Will he defend himself, and how? âWas
ist das, was ist das?â is heard in the terrified
accents of women.</p>

<p>All at once an unearthly howl was rent from
the breast of the chief. The wire swayed violently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
he sprang to the wooden trestle, standing
at the chandelier, and raised his staff. A
terrible thought flew like a flash through all
heads. He will hurl around the lamps and fill
the circus with torrents of flaming kerosene.
From the breasts of the spectators one shout
was just rising; but what do they see? From
the arena the cry comes, âStop! stop!â The
chief is gone! Has he jumped down? He has
gone through the entrance without firing the
circus! Where is he? See, he is coming,
coming a second time, panting, tired, terrible.
In his hand is a pewter plate, and extending it
to the spectators, he calls in a voice of entreaty:
âWas gefÃ¤llig fÃ¼r den letzten der
Schwarzen Schlangen?â (What will you give
to the last of the Black Snakes?)</p>

<p>A stone falls from the breasts of the spectators.
You see that was all in the programme,
it was a trick of the director for effect. The
dollars and half dollars came down in a shower.
How could they say âNoâ to the last of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Black Snakes, in Antelope reared on the ruins
of Chiavatta? People have hearts.</p>

<p>After the exhibition, the sachem drank beer
and ate dumplings at the âGolden Sun.â His
environment had exerted its influence, evidently.
He found great popularity in Antelope,
especially with the women,&mdash;there was even
scandal about him.</p>

<p class="drop-capi p4">IN the little town of Lupiskory, after the
funeral of widow Kaliksta, there were
vespers, and after vespers old women, between
ten and twenty in number, remained in the
church to finish the hymn. It was four oâclock
in the afternoon; but, since twilight comes in
winter about that hour, it was dark in the
church. The great altar, especially, was sunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
in deep shade. Only two candles were burning
at the ciborium; their flickering flames
barely lighted a little the gilding of the doors,
and the feet of Christ, hanging on a cross
higher up. Those feet were pierced with an
enormous nail, and the head of that nail
seemed a great point gleaming on the altar.</p>

<p>From other candles, just quenched, streaks
of smoke were waving, filling the places behind
the stalls with a purely church odor of wax.</p>

<p>An old man and a small boy were busied
before the steps of the altar. One was sweeping;
the other was stretching the carpet on the
steps. At moments, when the women ceased
their singing, either the angry whisper of the
old man was heard scolding the boy, or the
hammering on the snow-covered windows of
sparrows that were cold and hungry outside.</p>

<p>The women were sitting on benches nearer
the door. It would have been still darker had
it not been for a few tallow candles, by the
light of which those who had prayer-books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
were reading. One of those candles lighted
well enough a banner fastened to the seat just
beyond; the banner represented sinners surrounded
by devils and flames. It was impossible
to see what was painted on the other
banners.</p>

<p>The women were not singing; they were,
rather, muttering with sleepy and tired voices
a hymn in which these words were repeated
continually,&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">âAnd when the hour of death comes,<br />
Gain for us, gain from Thy Son.â</p>

<p class="pn1">That church buried in shadow, the banners
standing at the seats, the old women with their
yellow faces, the lights flickering as if oppressed
by the gloom,&mdash;all that was dismal
beyond expression; nay, it was simply terrible.
The mournful words of the song about death
found there a fitting background.</p>

<p>After a time the singing stopped. One of
the women stood up at the seat, and began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
say, with a trembling voice, âHail, Mary, full
of grace!â And others responded, âThe Lord
is with Thee,â etc.; but since it was the day
of Kalikstaâs funeral, each âHail, Mary,â concluded
with the words, âLord, grant her eternal
rest, and may endless light shine on her!â</p>

<p>Marysia, the dead womanâs daughter, was
sitting on a bench at the side of one of the
old women. Just then the snow, soft and
noiseless, was falling on the fresh grave of her
mother; but the little girl was not ten years
old yet, and seemed not to understand either
her loss, or the pity which it might rouse in
another. Her face, with large blue eyes, had
in it the calmness of childhood, and even a
certain careless repose. A little curiosity was
evident,&mdash;nothing beyond that. Opening her
mouth, she looked with great attention at the
banner on which was painted hell with sinners;
then she looked into the depth of the
church, and afterward on the window at which
the sparrows were hammering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Her eyes remained without thought. Meanwhile,
the women began to mutter, sleepily, for
the tenth time,&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">âAnd when the hour of death comes.â</p>

<p class="p1">The little girl twisted the tresses of her light-colored
hair, woven into two tiny braids not
thicker than mice tails. She seemed tired;
but now the old man occupied her attention.
He went to the middle of the church, and
began to pull a knotty rope hanging from the
ceiling. He was ringing for the soul of
Kaliksta, but he did this in a purely mechanical
manner; he was thinking, evidently, of
something else.</p>

<p>That ringing was also a sign that vespers
were ended. The women, after repeating for
the last time the prayer for a happy death,
went out on the square. One of them led
Marysia by the hand.</p>

<p>âBut, Kulik,â asked another, âwhat will
you do with the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>?â</p>

<p>âWhat will I do? She will go to Leschyntsi.
Voytek Margula will take her. But why do
you ask me?â</p>

<p>âWhat will she do in Leschyntsi?â</p>

<p>âMy dears, the same as here. Let her go
to where she came from. Even at the mansion
they will take in the orphan, and let her
sleep in the kitchen.â</p>

<p>Thus conversing, they passed through the
square to the inn. Darkness was increasing
every moment. It was wintry, calm; the sky
was covered with clouds, the air filled with
moisture and wet snow. Water was dropping
from the roofs; on the square lay slush formed
of snow and straw. The village, with wretched
and tattered houses, looked as gloomy as the
church. A few windows were gleaming with
light; movement had ceased, but in the inn
an organ was playing.</p>

<p>It was playing to entice, for there was no
one inside. The women entered, drank vodka;
Kulik gave Marysia half a glass, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>âDrink! Thou art an orphan; thou wilt
not meet kindness.â</p>

<p>The word âorphanâ brought the death of
Kaliksta to the minds of the women. One
of them said,&mdash;</p>

<p>âTo you, Kulik, drink! Oh, my dears, how
that <i>paralus</i> [paralysis] took her so that she
couldnât stir! She was cold before the priest
came to hear her confession.â</p>

<p>âI told her long ago,â said Kulik, âthat she
was spinning fine [near her end]. Last week
she came to me. Said I, âAh, better give
Marysia to the mansion!â But she said, âI
have one little daughter, and Iâll not give her
to any one.â But she grew sorry, and began
to sob, and then she went to the mayor to
put her papers in order. She paid four zloty
and six groshes. âBut I do not begrudge it
for my child,â said she. My dears, but her
eyes were staring, and after death they were
staring still more. People wanted to close
them, but could not. They say that after
death, even, she was looking at her child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>.â</p>

<p>âLet us drink half a quarter over this
sorrow!â</p>

<p>The organ was playing continually. The
women began to be somewhat tender. Kulik
repeated, with a voice of compassion, âPoor
little thing! poor little thing!â and the second
old woman called to mind the death of
her late husband.</p>

<p>âWhen he was dying,â said she, âhe sighed
so, oh, he sighed so, he sighed so!&mdash;â and
drawling still more, her voice passed into a
chant, from a chant into the tone of the organ,
till at last she bent to one side, and in following
the organ began to sing,&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">âHe sighed, he sighed, he sighed,<br />
On that day he sighed.â</p>

<p class="p1">All at once she fell to shedding hot tears,
gave the organist six groshes, and drank some
more vodka. Kulik, too, was excited by tenderness,
but she turned it on Marysia,&mdash;</p>

<p>âRemember, little orphan,â said she, âwhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the priest said when they were covering thy
mother with snow, that there is a yamyol [an
angel] above thee&mdash;â Here she stopped,
looked around as if astonished, and then
added, with unusual energy, âWhen I say that
there is a yamyol, there <i>is</i> a yamyol!â</p>

<p>No one contradicted her. Marysia, blinking
with her poor, simple eyes, looked attentively
at the woman. Kulik spoke on,&mdash;</p>

<p>âThou art a little orphan, that is bad for
thee! Over orphans there is a yamyol. He
is good. Here are ten groshes for thee. Even
if thou wert to start on foot to Leschyntsi,
thou couldst go there, for he would guide
thee.â</p>

<p>The second old woman began to sing:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">âIn the shade of his wings he will keep thee eternally,<br />
Under his pinions thou wilt lie without danger.â</p>

<p class="p1">âBe quiet!â said Kulik. And then she
turned again to the child,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>âKnowest thou, stupid, who is above thee?â</p>

<p>âA yamyol,â said, with a thin voice, the little
girl.</p>

<p>âOh, thou little orphan, thou precious berry,
thou little worm of the Lord! A yamyol with
wings,â said she, with perfect tenderness, and
seizing the child she pressed her to her honest,
though tipsy, bosom.</p>

<p>Marysia burst into weeping at once. Perhaps
in her dark little head and in her heart,
which knew not yet how to distinguish, there
was roused some sort of perception at that
moment.</p>

<p>The innkeeper was sleeping most soundly
behind the counter; on the candle-wicks
mushrooms had grown; the man at the organ
ceased to play, for what he saw amused him.</p>

<p>Then there was silence, which was broken by
the sudden plashing of horsesâ feet before the
door, and a voice calling to the horses,&mdash;</p>

<p>âPrrr!â</p>

<p>Voytek Margula walked into the inn with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
lighted lantern in his hand. He put down the
lantern, began to slap his arms to warm them,
and at last said to the innkeeper,&mdash;</p>

<p>âGive half a quarter.â</p>

<p>âMargula, thou chestnut,â cried Kulik,
âthou wilt take the little girl to Leschyntsi.â</p>

<p>âIâll take her, for they told me to take her,â
replied Margula.</p>

<p>Then looking closely to the two women he
added,&mdash;</p>

<p>âBut ye are as drunk as&mdash;â</p>

<p>âMay the plague choke thee,â retorted Kulik.
âWhen I tell thee to be careful with the child,
be careful. She is an orphan. Knowest thou,
fool, who is above her?â</p>

<p>Voytek did not see fit to answer that question,
but determined evidently to raise another
subject, and began,&mdash;</p>

<p>âTo all of you&mdash;â</p>

<p>But he didnât finish, for he drank the vodka,
made a wry face, and putting down the glass
with dissatisfaction, said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>âThatâs pure water. Give me a second from
another bottle.â</p>

<p>The innkeeper poured from another. Margula
twisted his face still more:</p>

<p>âAi! havenât you arrack?â</p>

<p>Evidently the same danger threatened Margula
that threatened the women; but at that
very time, in the mansion at Lupiskory, the
landowner was preparing for one of the journals
a long and exhaustive article, âOn the right
of landowners to sell liquor, this right being
considered as the basis of society.â But Voytek
co-operated only involuntarily to strengthen the
basis of society, and that all the more because
the sale here, though in a village, was really by
the landowner.</p>

<p>When he had co-operated five times in succession
he forgot, it is true, his lantern, in which
the light had gone out, but he took the half-sleeping
little girl by the hand, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>âBut come on, thou nightmare!â</p>

<p>The women had fallen asleep in a corner, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
one bade farewell to Marysia. The whole story
was this: Her mother was in the graveyard and
she was going to Leschyntsi.</p>

<p>Voytek and the girl went out, sat in the sleigh.
Voytek cried to the horses, and they moved on.
At first the sleigh dragged heavily enough
through the slush of the town, but they came
out very soon to fields which were broad and
white. Movement was easy then; the snow
barely made a noise under the sleigh-runners.
The horses snorted at times, at times came the
barking of dogs from a distance.</p>

<p>They went on and on. Voytek urged the
horses, and sang through his nose, âDog ear,
remember thy promise.â But soon he grew
silent, and began to âcarry Jewsâ (nod). He
nodded to the right, to the left. He dreamt
that they were pounding him on the shoulders
in Leschyntsi, because he had lost a basket of
letters; so, from time to time, he was half awake,
and repeated: âTo all!â Marysia did not
sleep, for she was cold. She looked with widely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
opened eyes on the white fields, hidden from
moment to moment by the dark shoulders of
Margula. She thought also that her âmother
was dead;â and thinking thus, she pictured to
herself perfectly the pale and thin face of her
mother with its staring eyes,&mdash;and she felt half
consciously that that face was greatly beloved,
that it was no longer in the world, and would
never be in Leschyntsi again. She had seen
with her own eyes how they covered it up in
Lupiskory. Remembering this, she would have
cried from grief; but as her knees and feet
were chilled, she began to cry from cold.</p>

<p>There was no frost, it is true, but the
air was penetrating, as is usual during thaws.
As to Voytek he had, at least in his stomach,
a good supply of heat taken from the inn.
The landowner at Lupiskory remarked justly:
âThat vodka warms in winter, and since it is
the only consolation of our peasants, to deprive
landowners of the sole power of consoling peasants
is to deprive them of influence over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
populace.â Voytek was so consoled at that
moment that nothing could trouble him.</p>

<p>Even this did not trouble him, that the
horses when they came to the forest slackened
their pace altogether, though the road there
was better, and then walking to one side, the
beasts turned over the sleigh into a ditch. He
woke, it is true, but did not understand well
what had happened.</p>

<p>Marysia begun to push him.</p>

<p>âVoytek!â</p>

<p>âWhy art thou croaking?â</p>

<p>âThe sleigh is turned over.â</p>

<p>âA glass?â asked Voytek, and went to sleep
for good.</p>

<p>The little girl sat by the sleigh, crouching
down as best she could, and remained there.
But her face was soon chilled, so she began to
push the sleeping man again.</p>

<p>âVoytek!â</p>

<p>He gave no answer.</p>

<p>âVoytek, I want to go to the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>.â</p>

<p>And after a while again: âVoytek, Iâll walk
there.â</p>

<p>At last she started. It seemed to her that
Leschyntsi was very near. She knew the road,
too, for she had walked to church over it every
Sunday with her mother. But now she had to
go alone. In spite of the thaw the snow in the
forest was deep, but the night was very clear.
To the gleam from the snow was added light
from the clouds, so that the road could be
seen as in the daytime. Marysia, turning her
eyes to the dark forest, could see tree-trunks
very far away outlined distinctly, black, motionless,
on the white ground; and she saw clearly
also snow-drifts blown to the whole height of
them. In the forest there was a certain immense
calm, which gave solace to the child.
On the branches was thick, frozen snow, and
from it drops of water were trickling, striking
with faint sound against the branches and twigs.
But that was the only noise. All else around
was still, white, silent, dumb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The wind was not blowing. The snowy
branches were not stirring with the slightest
movement. Everything was sleeping in the
trance of winter. It might seem that the
snowy covering on the earth, and the whole
silent and shrouded forest, with the pale clouds
in the heavens, were all a kind of white, lifeless
unity. So it is in time of thaw. Marysia was
the only living thing, moving like a little black
speck amid these silent greatnesses. Kind,
honest forest! Those drops, which the thawing
ice let down, were tears, perhaps, over the
orphan. The trees are so large, but also so
compassionate, above the little creature. See,
she is alone, so weak and poor, in the snow, in
the night, in the forest, wading along trustfully,
as if there is no danger.</p>

<p>The clear night seems to care for her. When
something so weak and helpless yields itself,
trusts so perfectly in enormous power, there is a
certain sweetness in the act. In that way all
may be left to the will of God. The girl walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
rather long, and was wearied at last. The heavy
boots, which were too large, hindered her; her
small feet were going up and down in them
continually. It was hard to drag out such big
boots from the snow. Besides, she could not
move her hands freely, for in one of them,
closed rigidly, she held with all her strength
those ten groshes which Kulik had given her.
She feared to drop them in the snow. She began
at times to cry aloud, and then she stopped
suddenly, as if wishing to know if some one
had heard her. Yes, the forest had heard her!
The thawing ice sounded monotonously and
somewhat sadly. Besides, maybe some one
else had heard her. The child went more and
more slowly. Could she go astray? How?
The road, like a white, broad, winding ribbon,
stretches into the distance, lies well marked
between two walls of dark trees. An unconquerable
drowsiness seized the little girl.</p>

<p>She stepped aside and sat down under a
tree. The lids dropped over her eyes. After a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
time, she thought that her mother was coming
to her along the white road from the graveyard.
No one was coming. Still, the child
felt certain that some one must come. Who?
A yamyol. Hadnât old Kulik told her that
a yamyol was above her? Marysia knew what
a yamyol is. In her motherâs cottage there
was one painted with a shield in his hand
and with wings. He would come, surely.
Somehow the ice began to sound more loudly.
Maybe that is the noise of his wings, scattering
drops more abundantly. Stop! Some
one is coming really; the snow, though soft,
sounds clearly; steps are coming, and coming
quietly but quickly. The child raises her
sleepy eyelids with confidence.</p>

<p>âWhat is that?â</p>

<p>Looking at the little girl intently is a gray
three-cornered face with ears, standing upright,&mdash;ugly,
terrible!</p>

<p class="drop-capi p2">IT is Sunday! Great posters, affixed for a
number of days to the corners of Puerta
del Sol, Calle Alcala, and all streets on which
there was considerable movement, announce to
the city that to-day, âSi el tiempo lo permiteâ
(if the weather permits), will take place bull-fight
XVI., in which Cara-Ancha Lagartijo and
the renowned Frascuello are to appear as
âespadasâ (swords).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, the weather permits. There was rain
in the morning; but about ten oâclock the wind
broke the clouds, gathered them into heaps,
and drove them away off somewhere in the
direction of the Escurial. Now the wind itself
has ceased; the sky as far as the eye can reach
is blue, and over the Puerta del Sol a bright sun
is shining,&mdash;such a Madrid sun, which not
only warms, not only burns, but almost bites.</p>

<p>Movement in the city is increasing, and on
peopleâs faces satisfaction is evident.</p>

<p>Two oâclock.</p>

<p>The square of the Puerta del Sol is emptying
gradually, but crowds of people are advancing
through the Calle Alcala toward the Prado. In
the middle is flowing a river of carriages and
vehicles. All that line of equipages is moving
very slowly, for on the sidewalks there is not
room enough for pedestrians, many of whom
are walking along the sides of the streets and
close to the carriages. The police, on white
horses and in showy uniforms and three-cornered
hats, preserve order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>It is Sunday, that is evident, and an afternoon
hour; the toilets are carefully made, the
attire is holiday. It is evident also that the
crowds are going to some curious spectacle.
Unfortunately the throng is not at all many-colored;
no national costumes are visible,&mdash;neither
the short coats, yellow kerchiefs <i>Ã¡ la
contrabandista</i>, with one end dropping down
to the shoulder, nor the round Biscay hats, nor
girdles, nor the Catalan knives behind the
girdles.</p>

<p>Those things may be seen yet in the neighborhood
of Granada, Seville, and Cordova; but
in Madrid, especially on holidays, the cosmopolitan
frock is predominant. Only at times do
you see a black mantilla pinned to a high comb,
and under the mantilla eyes blacker still.</p>

<p>In general faces are dark, glances quick,
speech loud. Gesticulation is not so passionate
as in Italy, where when a man laughs he
squirms like a snake, and when he is angry he
gnaws off the top of his hat; still, it is energetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and lively. Faces have well-defined features
and a resolute look. It is easy to understand
that even in amusement these people retain
their special and definite character.</p>

<p>However, they are a people who on weekdays
are full of sedateness, bordering on sloth,
sparing of words, and collected. Sunday enlivens
them, as does also the hope of seeing a
bloody spectacle.</p>

<p>Let us cut across the Prado and enter an
alley leading to the circus.</p>

<p>The crowd is becoming still denser. Here
and there shouts are rising, the people applauding
single members of the company, who
are going each by himself to the circus.</p>

<p>Here is an omnibus filled with âcapeadors,â
that is, partakers in the fight, whose whole defence
is red capes with which they mislead and
irritate the bull. Through the windows are visible
black heads with pigtails, and wearing three-cornered
hats. The coats of various colors
worn by the capeadors are embroidered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
gold and silver tinsel. These capeadors ride
in an omnibus, for the modest pay which they
get for their perilous service does not permit
a more showy conveyance.</p>

<p>Somewhat farther, three mounted âpicadorsâ
push their way through the people. The sun
plays on their broad-brimmed white hats. They
are athletic in build, but bony and lean. Their
shaven faces have a stern, and, as it were, concentrated
look. They are sitting on very high
wooden saddles, hence they are perfectly visible
over the crowd. Each of them holds in his
hand a lance, with a wooden ball at the end of
it, from which is projecting an iron point not
above half an inch long. The picador cannot
kill a bull with a weapon like that,&mdash;he can
only pierce him or stop him for a moment; but
in the last case he must have in his arm the
strength of a giant.</p>

<p>Looking at these men, I remember involuntarily
DorÃ©âs illustrations to âDon Quixote.â In
fact, each of these horsemen might serve as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
model for the knight âof the rueful visage.â
That lean silhouette, outlined firmly on the sky,
high above the heads of the multitude, the
lance standing upright, and that bare-boned
horse under the rider, those purely Gothic outlines
of living things,&mdash;all answer perfectly to
the conception which we form of the knight of
La Mancha, when we read the immortal work
of Cervantes.</p>

<p>But, the picadors pass us, and urging apart the
crowd slowly, push forward considerably. Now
only three lances are visible, three hats, and
three coats embroidered on the shoulders. New
men ride up, as incalculably similar to the first
as if some mill were making picadors for all
Spain on one pattern. There is a difference
only in the color of the horses, which, however,
are equally lean.</p>

<p>Our eyes turn now to the long row of carriages.
Some are drawn by mules, but mules
so large, sleek, and beautiful that, in spite of the
long ears of the animals, the turn-out does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
seem ridiculous. Here and there may be seen
also Andalusian horses with powerful backs,
arched necks, and curved faces. Such may be
seen in the pictures of battle-painters of the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>In the carriages are sitting the flower of
Madrid society. The dresses are black, there
is very black lace on the parasols, on the fans,
and on the heads of ladies; black hair trimmed
in forelocks, from under which are glancing
eyes, as it were, of the lava of Vesuvius.
Mourning colors, importance, and powder are
the main traits of that society.</p>

<p>The faces of old and of young ladies also are
covered with powder, all of them are equally
frigid and pale. A great pity! Were it not
for such a vile custom, their complexion would
have that magnificent warm tone given by southern
blood and a southern sun, and which may
be admired in faces painted by Fortuni.</p>

<p>In the front seats of the carriages are men
dressed with an elegance somewhat exaggerated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
they have a constrained and too holiday
air,&mdash;in other words, they cannot wear fine
garments with that free inattention which characterizes
the higher society of France.</p>

<p>But the walls of the circus are outlined before
us with growing distinctness. There is nothing
especial in the building: an enormous pile reared
expressly to give seats to some tens of thousands
of people,&mdash;that is the whole plan of it.</p>

<p>Most curious is the movement near the
walls. Round about, it is black from carriages,
equipages, and heads of people. Towering
above this dark mass, here and there, is a
horseman, a policeman, or a picador in colors
as brilliant as a poppy full blown.</p>

<p>The throng sways, opens, closes, raises its
voice; coachmen shout; still louder shout
boys selling handbills. These boys squeeze
themselves in at all points among footmen
and horsemen; they are on the steps of carriages
and between the wheels; some climb
up on the buttresses of the circus; some are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
on the stone columns which mark the way
for the carriages. Their curly hair, their
gleaming eyes, their expressive features, dark
faces, and torn shirts open in the bosom,
remind me of our gypsies, and of boys in
Murilloâs pictures. Besides programmes some
of them sell whistles. Farther on, among the
crowds, are fruit-venders; water-sellers with
bronze kegs on their shoulders; in one place
are flower dealers; in another is heard the
sound of a guitar played by an old blind
woman led by a little girl.</p>

<p>Movement, uproar, laughter; fans are fluttering
everywhere as if they were wings of thousands
of birds; the sun pours down white light
in torrents from a spotless sky of dense blue.</p>

<p>Suddenly and from all sides are heard cries
of âmira, mira!â (look, look!) After a while
these cries are turned into a roar of applause,
which like real thunder flies from one extreme
to another; now it is quiet, now it rises and
extends around the whole circus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>What has happened? Surely the queen is
approaching, and with her the court?</p>

<p>No! near by is heard âeviva Frascuello!â
That is the most famous espada, who is
coming for laurels and applause.</p>

<p>All eyes turn to him, and the whole throng
of women push toward his carriage. The air
is gleaming with flowers thrown by their hands
to the feet of that favorite, that hero of every
dream and imagining, that âpearl of Spain.â
They greet him the more warmly because he
has just returned from a trip to Barcelona,
where during the exhibition he astonished all
barbarous Europe with thrusts of his sword;
now he appears again in his beloved Madrid,
more glorious, greater,&mdash;a genuine new Cid
el Campeador.</p>

<p>Let us push through the crowd to look at
the hero. First, what a carriage, what horses!
More beautiful there are not in the whole of
Castile. On white satin cushions sits, or reclines,
we should say, a man whose age it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
difficult to determine, for his face is shaven
most carefully. He is dressed in a coat of
pale lily-colored satin, and knee-breeches of
similar material trimmed with lace. His coat
and the side seams of his breeches are glittering
and sparkling from splendid embroidery,
from spangles of gold and silver shining like
diamonds in the sun. The most delicate laces
ornament his breast. His legs, clothed in rose-colored
silk stockings, he holds crossed carelessly
on the front seat,&mdash;the very first athlete
in the hippodrome at Paris might envy him
those calves.</p>

<p>Madrid is vain of those calves,&mdash;and in truth
she has reason.</p>

<p>The great man leans with one hand on the
red hilt of his Catalan blade; with the other he
greets his admirers of both sexes kindly. His
black hair, combed to his poll, is tied behind
in a small roll, from beneath which creeps forth
a short tress. That style of hair-dressing and
the shaven face make him somewhat like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
woman, and he reminds one besides of some
actor from one of the provinces; taken generally,
his face is not distinguished by intelligence,
a quality which in his career would not be
a hindrance, though not needed in any way.</p>

<p>The crowds enter the circus, and we enter
with them.</p>

<p>Now we are in the interior. It differs from
other interiors of circuses only in size and in
this,&mdash;that the seats are of stone. Highest in
the circle are the boxes; of these one in velvet
and in gold fringe is the royal box. If no one
from the court is present at the spectacle this
box is occupied by the prefect of the city.
Around are seated the aristocracy and high
officials; opposite the royal box, on the other
side of the circus, is the orchestra. Half-way
up in the circus is a row of arm-chairs; stone
steps form the rest of the seats. Below, around
the arena, stretches a wooden paling the height
of a manâs shoulder. Between this paling and
the first row of seats, which is raised considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
higher for the safety of the spectators, is
a narrow corridor, in which the combatants
take refuge, in case the bull threatens them too
greatly.</p>

<p>One-half of the circus is buried in shadow,
the other is deluged with sunlight. On every
ticket, near the number of the seat, is printed
âsombraâ (shadow) or âsolâ (sun). Evidently
the tickets âsombraâ cost considerably
more. It is difficult to imagine how those
who have âsolâ tickets can endure to sit in
such an atmosphere a number of hours and
on those heated stone steps, with such a sun
above their heads.</p>

<p>The places are all filled, however. Clearly
the love of a bloody spectacle surpasses the
fear of being roasted alive.</p>

<p>In northern countries the contrast between
light and shadow is not so great as in Spain;
in the north we find always a kind of half
shade, half light, certain transition tones; here
the boundary is cut off in black with a firm line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
without any transitions. In the illuminated
half the sand seems to burn; peopleâs faces and
dresses are blazing; eyes are blinking under the
excess of glare; it is simply an abyss of light,
full of heat, in which everything is sparkling and
gleaming excessively, every color is intensified
tenfold. On the other hand, the shaded half
seems cut off by some transparent curtain,
woven from the darkness of night. Every
man who passes from the light to the shade,
makes on us the impression of a candle put
out on a sudden.</p>

<p>At the moment when we enter, the arena is
crowded with people. Before the spectacle the
inhabitants of Madrid, male and female, must
tread that sand on which the bloody drama is
soon to be played. It seems to them that thus
they take direct part, as it were, in the struggle.
Numerous groups of men are standing,
lighting their cigarettes and discoursing vivaciously
concerning the merits of bulls from this
herd or that one. Small boys tease and pursue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
one another. I see how one puts under the
eyes of another a bit of red cloth, treating him
just as a âcapeadorâ treats a bull. The boy
endures this a while patiently; at last he rolls
his eyes fiercely and runs at his opponent. The
opponent deceives him adroitly with motions of
a cape, exactly again as the capeador does the
bull. The little fellows find their spectators,
who urge them on with applause.</p>

<p>Along the paling pass venders of oranges
proclaiming the merits of their merchandise.
This traffic is carried on through the air. The
vender throws, at request, with unerring dexterity,
an orange, even to the highest row; in
the same way he receives a copper piece, which
he catches with one hand before it touches the
earth. Loud dialogues, laughter, calls, noise,
rustling of fans, the movement of spectators as
they arrive,&mdash;all taken together form a picture
with a fulness of life of which no other spectacle
can give an idea.</p>

<p>All at once from the orchestra come sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of trumpets and drums. At that signal the
people on the arena fly to their places with as
much haste as if danger were threatening their
lives. There is a crush. But after a while all
are seated. Around, it is just black: people
are shoulder to shoulder, head to head. In
the centre remains the arena empty, deluged
with sunlight.</p>

<p>Opposite the royal box a gate in the paling
is thrown open, and in ride two âalguazils.â
Their horses white, with manes and tails
plaited, are as splendid as if taken from pictures.
The riders themselves, wearing black
velvet caps with white feathers, and doublets of
similar material, with lace collars, bring to mind
the incomparable canvases of Velasquez, which
may be admired in the Museo del Prado. It
seems to us that we are transferred to the times
of knighthood long past. Both horsemen are
handsome, both of showy form. They ride
stirrup to stirrup, ride slowly around the whole
arena to convince themselves that no incautious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
spectator has remained on it. At last they halt
before the royal box, and with a movement full
of grace uncover their heads with respect.</p>

<p>Whoso is in a circus for the first time will
be filled with admiration at the stately, almost
middle-age, ceremonial, by the apparel and
dignity of the horsemen. The alguazils seem
like two noble heralds, giving homage to a
monarch before the beginning of a tournament.
It is, in fact, a prayer for permission to open
the spectacle, and at the same time a request
for the key of the stables in which the bulls are
confined. After a while the key is let down
from the box on a gold string; the alguazils
incline once again and ride away. Evidently
this is a mere ceremonial, for the spectacle was
authorized previously, and the bulls are confined
by simple iron bolts. But the ceremony
is beautiful, and they never omit it.</p>

<p>In a few minutes after the alguazils have
vanished, the widest gate is thrown open, and
a whole company enters. At the head of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
ride the same two alguazils whom we saw before
the royal box; after them advance a rank of
capeadors; after the capeadors come âbanderilleros,â
and the procession is concluded by
picadors. This entire party is shining with all
the colors of the rainbow, gleaming from tinsel,
gold, silver, and satins of various colors. They
come out from the dark side to the sunlighted
arena, dive into the glittering light, and bloom
like flowers. The eye cannot delight itself
sufficiently with the many colors of those spots
on the golden sand.</p>

<p>Having reached the centre, they scatter on a
sudden, like a flock of butterflies. The picadors
dispose themselves around at the paling,
and each one drawing his lance from its rest,
grasps it firmly in his right hand; the men on
foot form picturesque groups; they stand in
postures full of indifference, waiting for the
bull.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most beautiful moment
of the spectacle, full of originality, so thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Spanish that regret at not being a painter comes
on a man in spite of himself. How much color,
what sunlight might be transferred from the
palette to the canvas!</p>

<p>Soon blood will be flowing on that sand. In
the circus it is as still as in time of sowing
poppy seed,&mdash;it is barely possible to hear the
sound of fans, which move only in as much as
the hands holding them quiver from impatience.
All eyes are turned to the door through which
the bull will rush forth. Time now is counted
by seconds.</p>

<p>Suddenly the shrill, and at the same time the
mournful, sound of a trumpet is heard in the
orchestra; the door of the stable opens with
a crash, and the bull bursts into the arena, like
a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>That is a lordly beast, with a powerful and
splendid neck, a head comparatively short,
horns enormous and turned forward. Our
heavy breeder gives a poor idea of him; for
though the Spanish bull is not the equal of ours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
in bulk of body, he surpasses him in strength,
and, above all, in activity. At the first cast of
the eye you recognize a beast reared wild in
the midst of great spaces; consequently with all
his strength he can move almost as swiftly as a
deer. It is just this which makes him dangerous
in an unheard of degree. His forelegs are a
little higher than his hind ones; this is usual
with cattle of mountain origin. In fact, the
bulls of the circus are recruited especially from
the herds in the Sierra Morena. Their color
is for the greater part black, rarely reddish or
pied. The hair is short, and glossy as satin;
only the neck is covered somewhat with longer
and curly hair.</p>

<p>After he has burst into the arena, the bull
slackens his pace toward the centre, looks
with bloodshot eyes to the right, to the left,&mdash;but
this lasts barely two seconds; he sees a
group of capeadors; he lowers his head to the
ground, and hurls himself on them at random.</p>

<p>The capeadors scatter, like a flock of sparrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
at which some man has fired small-shot.
Holding behind them red capes, they circle
now in the arena, with a swiftness that makes
the head dizzy; they are everywhere; they
glitter to the right, to the left; they are in the
middle of the arena, at the paling, before the
eyes of the bull, in front, behind. The red
capes flutter in the air, like banners torn by
the wind.</p>

<p>The bull scatters the capeadors in every
direction; with lightning-like movements he
chases one,&mdash;another thrusts a red cape under
his very eyes; the bull leaves the first victim to
run after a second, but before he can turn, some
third one steps up. The bull rushes at that
one! Distance between them decreases, the
horns of the bull seem to touch the shoulder of
the capeador; another twinkle of an eye and
he will be nailed to the paling,&mdash;but meanwhile
the man touches the top of the paling with his
hand, and vanishes as if he had dropped
through the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>What has happened? The capeador has
sprung into the passage extending between the
paling and the first row of seats.</p>

<p>The bull chooses another man; but before
he has moved from his tracks the first capeador
thrusts out his head from behind the paling,
like a red Indian stealing to the farm of a
settler, and springs to the arena again. The
bull pursues more and more stubbornly those
unattainable enemies, who vanish before his very
horns; at last he knows where they are hidden.
He collects all his strength, anger gives him
speed, and he springs like a hunting-horse over
the paling, certain that he will crush his foes
this time like worms.</p>

<p>But at that very moment they hurl themselves
back to the arena with the agility of
chimpanzees, and the bull runs along the empty
passage, seeing no one before him.</p>

<p>The entire first row of spectators incline
through the barrier, then strike from above at
the bull with canes, fans, and parasols. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
public are growing excited. A bull that springs
over the paling recommends himself favorably.
When people in the first row applaud him with
all their might, those in the upper rows clap
their hands, crying, âBravo el toro! muy buen!
Bravo el toro!â (Bravo the bull! Very well,
bravo the bull!)</p>

<p>Meanwhile he comes to an open door and
runs out again to the arena. On the opposite
side of it two capeadors are sitting on a step
extending around the foot of the paling, and
are conversing without the slightest anxiety.
The bull rushes on them at once; he is in the
middle of the arena,&mdash;and they sit on without
stopping their talk; he is ten steps away,&mdash;they
continue sitting as if they had not seen
him; he is five steps away,&mdash;they are still talking.
Cries of alarm are heard here and there
in the circus; before his very horns the two
daring fellows spring, one to the right, the
other to the left. The bullâs horns strike the
paling with a heavy blow. A storm of handclapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
breaks out in the circus, and at that
very moment these and other capeadors surround
the bull again and provoke him with red
capes.</p>

<p>His madness passes now into fury: he hurls
himself forward, rushes, turns on his tracks;
every moment his horns give a thrust, every
moment it seems that no human power can
wrest this or that man from death. Still the
horns cut nothing but air, and the red capes are
glittering on all sides; at times one of them
falls to the ground, and that second the bull in
his rage drives almost all of it into the sand.
But that is not enough for him,&mdash;he must search
out some victim, and reach him at all costs.</p>

<p>Hence, with a deep bellow and with bloodshot
eyes he starts to run forward at random,
but halts on a sudden; a new sight strikes his
eye,&mdash;that is, a picador on horseback.</p>

<p>The picadors had stood hitherto on their
lean horses, like statues, their lances pointing
upward. The bull, occupied solely with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
hated capes, had not seen them, or if he had
seen them he passed them.</p>

<p>Almost never does it happen that the bull
begins a fight with horsemen. The capes absorb
his attention and rouse all his rage. It
may be, moreover, that the picadors are like
his half-wild herdsmen in the Sierra Morena,
whom he saw at times from a distance, and
before whom he was accustomed to flee with
the whole herd.</p>

<p>But now he has had capes enough; his fury
seeks eagerly some body to pierce and on
which to sate his vengeance.</p>

<p>For spectators not accustomed to this kind
of play, a terrible moment is coming. Every
one understands that blood must be shed soon.</p>

<p>The bull lowers his head and withdraws a
number of paces, as if to gather impetus; the
picador turns the horse a little, with his right
side to the attacker, so the horse, having his
right eye bound with a cloth, shall not push
back at the moment of attack. The lance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
a short point is lowered in the direction of the
bull; he withdraws still more. It seems to you
that he will retreat altogether, and your oppressed
bosom begins to breathe with more
ease.</p>

<p>Suddenly the bull rushes forward like a rock
rolling down from a mountain. In the twinkle
of an eye you see the lance bent like a bow;
the sharp end of it is stuck in the shoulder of
the bull,&mdash;and then is enacted a thing simply
dreadful: the powerful head and neck of the
furious beast is lost under the belly of the
horse, his horns sink their whole length in
the horseâs intestines; sometimes the bull lifts
horse and rider, sometimes you see only the
upraised hind part of the horse, struggling
convulsively in the air. Then the rider falls to
the ground, the horse tumbles upon him, and
you hear the creaking of the saddle; horse,
rider, and saddle form one shapeless mass,
which the raging bull tramples and bores with
his horns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Faces unaccustomed to the spectacle grow
pale. In Barcelona and Madrid I have seen
Englishwomen whose faces had become as pale
as linen. Every one in the circus for the
first time has the impression of a catastrophe.
When the rider is seen rolled into a lump,
pressed down by the weight of the saddle and
the horse, and the raging beast is thrusting his
horns with fury into that mass of flesh, it seems
that for the man there is no salvation, and that
the attendants will raise a mere bloody corpse
from the sand.</p>

<p>But that is illusion. All that is done is in
the programme of the spectacle.</p>

<p>Under the white leather and tinsel the rider
has armor which saves him from being crushed,&mdash;he
fell purposely under the horse, so that
the beast should protect him with his body
from the horns. In fact the bull, seeing before
him the fleshy mass of the horseâs belly, expends
on it mainly his rage. Let me add that
the duration of the catastrophe is counted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
seconds. The capeadors have attacked the
bull from every side, and he, wishing to free
himself from them, must leave his victims. He
does leave them, he chases again after the
capeadors; his steaming horns, stained with
blood, seem again to be just touching the
capeadorsâ shoulders. They, in escaping, lead
him to the opposite side of the arena; other
men meanwhile draw from beneath the horse
the picador, who is barely able to move under
the weight of his armor, and throw him over
the paling.</p>

<p>The horse too tries to raise himself: frequently
he rises for a moment, but then a
ghastly sight strikes the eye. From his torn
belly hangs a whole bundle of intestines with a
rosy spleen, bluish liver, and greenish stomach.
The hapless beast tries to walk a few steps; but
his trembling feet tread on his own entrails, he
falls, digs the ground with his hoofs, shudders.
Meanwhile the attendants run up, remove the
saddle and bridle, and finish the torments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the horse with one stab of a stiletto, at the point
where head and neck come together.</p>

<p>On the arena remains the motionless body,
which, lying now on its side, seems wonderfully
flat. The intestines are carried out quickly
in a basket which is somewhat like a wash-tub,
and the public clap their hands with excitement.
Enthusiasm begins to seize them:
âBravo el toro! Bravo picador!â Eyes are
flashing, on faces a flush comes, a number of
hats fly to the arena in honor of the picador.
Meanwhile âel toro,â having drawn blood
once, kills a number of other horses. If his
horns are buried not in the belly but under
the shoulder of the horse, a stream of dark
blood bursts onto the arena in an uncommon
quantity; the horse rears and falls backward
with his rider. A twofold danger threatens
the man: the horns of the bull or, in spite of
his armor, the breaking of his neck. But, as
we have said, the body of the horse becomes
a protection to the rider; hence, every picador<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
tries to receive battle at the edge of the arena,
so as to be, as it were, covered between the
body of the horse and the paling. When the
bull withdraws, the picador advances, but only
a few steps, so that the battle never takes
place in the centre.</p>

<p>All these precautions would not avail much,
and the bull would pierce the horseman at last,
were it not for the capeadors. They press on
the bull, draw away his attention, rush with
unheard of boldness against his rage, saving
each moment the life of some participant in
the fight. Once I saw an espada, retreating
before the raging beast, stumble against the
head of a dead horse and fall on his back;
death inevitable was hanging over him, the
horns of the bull were just ready to pass through
his breast, when suddenly between that breast
and the horns the red capes were moving, and
the bull flew after the capes. It may be said
that were it not for that flock of chimpanzees
waving red capes, the work of the picadors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
would be impossible, and at every representation
as many of them as of horses would
perish.</p>

<p>It happens rarely that a picador can stop a
bull at the point of a lance. This takes place
only when the bull advances feebly, or the
picador is gifted with gigantic strength of arms,
surpassing the measure of men. I saw two such
examples in Madrid, after which came a hurricane
of applause for the picador.</p>

<p>But usually the bull kills horses like flies;
and he is terrible when, covered with sweat,
glittering in the sun, with a neck bleeding
from lances and his horns painted red, he
runs around the arena, as if in the drunkenness
of victory. A deep bellow comes from
his mighty lungs; at one moment he scatters
capeadors, at another he halts suddenly over
the body of a horse, now motionless, and
avenges himself on it terribly,&mdash;he raises it on
his horns, carries it around the arena, scattering
drops of stiff blood on spectators in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
first row; then he casts it again on the stained
sand and pierces it a second time. It seems
to him, evidently, that the spectacle is over, and
that it has ended in his triumph.</p>

<p>But the spectacle has barely passed through
one-half of its course. Those picadors whose
horses have survived the defeat, ride out, it is
true, from the arena; but in place of them run
in with jumps, and amid shouts, nimble banderilleros.
Every one of them in his upraised
hands has two arrows, each an ell long, ornamented,
in accordance with the coat of the
man, with a blue, a green, or a red ribbon, and
ending with a barbed point, which once it is
under the skin will not come out of it. These
men begin to circle about the bull, shaking
the arrows, stretching toward him the points,
threatening and springing up toward him.
The bull rolls his bloodshot eyes, turns his
head to the right, to the left, looking to see
what new kind of enemies these are. âAh,â
says he, evidently, to himself, âyou have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
little blood, you want more&mdash;you shall have
it!â and selecting the man, he rushes at
him.</p>

<p>But what happens? The first man, instead
of fleeing, runs toward the bull,&mdash;runs past his
head, as if he wished to avoid him; but in
that same second something seems hanging
in the air like a rainbow: the man is running
away empty-handed with all the strength of his
legs, toward the paling, and in the neck of the
bull are two colored arrows.</p>

<p>After a moment another pair are sticking in
him, and then a third pair,&mdash;six altogether,
with three colors. The neck of the beast
seems now as if ornamented with a bunch of
flowers, but those flowers have the most terrible
thorns of any on earth. At every movement
of the bull, at every turn of his head, the arrows
move, shake, fly from one side of his neck to
the other, and with that every point is boring
into the wound. Evidently from pain the
animal is falling into the madness of rage; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the more he rushes the greater his pain.
Hitherto the bull was the wrong-doer, now
they wrong him, and terribly. He would like
to free himself from those torturing arrows;
but there is no power to do that. He is growing
mad from mere torment, and is harassed
to the utmost. Foam covers his nostrils, his
tongue is protruding; he bellows no longer,
but in the short intervals between the wild
shouts, the clapping, and the uproar of the
spectators, you may hear his groans, which
have an accent almost human. The capeadors
harassed him, every picador wounded him,
now the arrows are working into his wounds;
thirst and heat complete his torments.</p>

<p>It is his luck that he did not get another
kind of âbanderille.â If&mdash;which, however,
happens rarely&mdash;the bull refuses to attack the
horses and has killed none, the enraged public
rise, and in the circus something in the nature
of a revolution sets in. Men with their canes
and women with their parasols and fans turn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the royal box; wild, hoarse voices of cruel
cavaliers, and the shrill ones of senoritas, shout
only one word: âFuego! fuego! fuego!â
(Fire, fire, fire!)</p>

<p>The representatives of the government withhold
their consent for a long time. Hence
âFuego!â is heard ever more threateningly,
and drowns all other voices; the threat rises
to such an intensity as to make us think that
the public may pass at any instant from
words to a mad deed of some kind. Half
an hour passes: âFuego! fuego!â There is
no help for it. The signal is given, and the
unfortunate bull gets a banderille which
when thrust into his neck blazes up that same
instant.</p>

<p>The points wound in their own way, and in
their own way rolls of smoke surround the head
of the beast, the rattle of fireworks stuns him;
great sparks fall into his wounds, small congreve
rockets burst under his skin; the smell
of burnt flesh and singed hair fill the arena.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
In truth, cruelty can go no further; but the
delight of the public rises now to its zenith.
The eyes of women are covered with mist
from excitement, every breast is heaving with
pleasure, their heads fall backward, and between
their open moist lips are gleaming white
teeth. You would say that the torment of
the beast is reflected in the nerves of those
women with an answering degree of delight.
Only in Spain can such things be seen. There
is in that frenzy something hysterical, something
which recalls certain Ph&oelig;nician mysteries,
performed on the altar of Melitta.</p>

<p>The daring and skill of the banderilleros surpass
every measure. I saw one of them who
had taken his place in the middle of the arena
in an arm-chair; he had stretched his legs
carelessly before him,&mdash;they were in rose-colored
stockings,&mdash;he crossed them, and holding
above his head a banderille, was waiting for
the bull. The bull rushed at him straightway;
the next instant, I saw only that the banderille<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
was fastened in the neck, and the bull was
smashing the chair with mad blows of his head.
In what way the man had escaped between the
chair and the horns, I know not,&mdash;that is the
secret of his skill. Another banderillero, at
the same representation, seizing the lance of a
picador at the moment of attack, supported
himself with it, and sprang over the back and
whole length of the bull. The beast was dumb-founded,
could not understand where his victim
had vanished.</p>

<p>A multitude of such wonders of daring and
dexterity are seen at each representation.</p>

<p>One bull never gets more than three pairs of
banderilles. When the deed is accomplished,
a single trumpet is heard in the orchestra with
a prolonged and sad note,&mdash;and the moment
the most exciting and tragic in the spectacle
approaches. All that was done hitherto was
only preparation for this. Now a fourth act
of the drama is played.</p>

<p>On the arena comes out the âmatadorâ himself,&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
is, the espada. He is dressed like
the other participants in the play, only more
elaborately and richly. His coat is all gold and
tinsel: costly laces adorn his breast. He may
be distinguished by this too,&mdash;that he comes
out bareheaded always. His black hair, combed
back carefully, ends on his shoulders in a small
tail. In his left hand he holds a red cloth flag,
in his right a long Toledo sword. The capeadors
surround him as soldiers their chief, ready
at all times to save him in a moment of danger,
and he approaches the bull, collected, cool, but
terrible and triumphant.</p>

<p>In all the spectators the hearts are throbbing
violently, and a moment of silence sets
in.</p>

<p>In Barcelona and Madrid I saw the four
most eminent espadas in Spain, and in truth I
admit, that besides their cool blood, dexterity,
and training, they have a certain hypnotic
power, which acts on the animal and fills him
with mysterious alarm. The bull simply bears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
himself differently before the espada from
what he did before the previous participants in
the play. It is not that he withdraws before
him; on the contrary, he attacks him with
greater insistence perhaps. But in former
attacks, in addition to rage, there was evident
a certain desire. He hunted, he scattered, he
killed; he was as if convinced that the whole
spectacle was for him, and that the question
was only in this, that he should kill. Now, at
sight of that cold, awful man with a sword in
his hand, he convinces himself that death is
there before him, that he must perish, that on
that bloody sand the ghastly deed will be accomplished
in some moments.</p>

<p>This mental state of the beast is so evident
that every man can divine it. Perhaps even
this, by its tragic nature, becomes the charm of
the spectacle. That mighty organism, simply
seething with a superabundance of vitality, of
desire, of strength, is unwilling to die, will not
consent to die for anything in the world! and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
death, unavoidable, irresistible, is approaching;
hence unspeakable sorrow, unspeakable despair,
throbs through every movement of the bull.
He hardly notices the capeadors, whom before
he pursued with such venom; he attacks the
espada himself, but he attacks with despair
completely evident.</p>

<p>The espada does not kill him at once, for
that is not permitted by the rules of the play.
He deceives the bull with movements of the
flag, himself he pushes from the horns by turns
slight and insignificant; he waits for the
moment, withdraws, advances. Evidently he
wishes to sate the public; now, this very instant,
heâll strike, now he lowers his sword
again.</p>

<p>The struggle extends over the whole arena;
it glitters in the sun, is dark in the shade. In
the circus applause is heard, now general, now
single from the breast of some seÃ±orita who is
unable to restrain her enthusiasm. At one
moment bravos are thundering; at another, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the espada has retreated awkwardly or given
a false blow, hissing rends the ear. The bull
has now given some tens of blows with his
horns,&mdash;always to the flag; the public are
satisfied; here and there voices are crying:
âMata el toro! mata el toro!â (Kill the bull!
kill the bull!)</p>

<p>And now a flash comes so suddenly that
the eye cannot follow it; then the group of
fighters scatter, and in the neck of the bull,
above the colored banderilles, is seen the red
hilt of the sword. The blade has gone through
the neck, and, buried two thirds of its length,
is planted in the lungs of the beast.</p>

<p>The espada is defenceless; the bull attacks
yet, but he misleads him in the old fashion
with the flag, he saves himself from the blows
with half turns.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it seems that people have gone
wild in the circus. No longer shouts, but one
bellow and howl are heard, around, from
above to below. All are springing from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
seats. To the arena are flying bouquets,
cigar-cases, hats, fans. The fight is approaching
its end.</p>

<p>A film is coming over the eyes of the bull;
from his mouth are hanging stalactites of bloody
saliva; his groan becomes hoarse. Night is
embracing his head. The glitter and heat of
the sun concern him no longer. He attacks
yet, but as it were in a dream. It is darker
and darker for him. At last he collects the
remnant of his consciousness, backs to the
paling, totters for a moment, kneels on his
fore feet, drops on his hind ones, and begins
to die.</p>

<p>The espada looks at him no longer; he
has his eyes turned to the spectators, from
whom hats and cigar-cases are flying, thick
as hail; he bows; capeadors throw back to
the spectators their hats.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a mysterious man dressed in
black climbs over the paling in silence and
puts a stiletto in the bull, where the neckbone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
meets the skull; with a light movement
he sinks it to the hilt and turns it.</p>

<p>That is the blow of mercy, after which the
head of the bull drops on its side.</p>

<p>All the participants pass out. For a moment
the arena is empty; on it are visible only the
body of the bull and the eviscerated carcasses
of four or five horses, now cold.</p>

<p>But after a while rush in with great speed
men with mules, splendidly harnessed in yellow
and red; the men attach these mules to the
bodies and draw them around so that the
public may enjoy the sight once again, then
with speed equally great they go out through
the doors of the arena.</p>

<p>But do not imagine that the spectacle is
ended with one bull. After the first comes
a second, after the second a third, and so on.
In Madrid six bulls perish at a representation.
In Barcelona, at the time of the fair, eight
were killed.</p>

<p>Do not think either that the public are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
wearied by the monotony of the fight. To
begin with, the fight itself is varied with personal
episodes caused by temperament, the
greater or less rage of the bull, the greater or
less skill of the men in their work; secondly,
that public is never annoyed at the sight of
blood and death.</p>

<p>The âtoreadoresâ (though in Spain no participant
in the fight is called a toreador),
thanks to their dexterity, rarely perish; but
if that happens, the spectacle is considered
as the more splendid, and the bull receives
as much applause as the espada. Since, however,
accidents happen to people sometimes,
at every representation, besides the doctor,
there is present a priest with the sacrament.
That spiritual person is not among the audience,
of course; but he waits in a special
room, to which the wounded are borne in
case of an accident.</p>

<p>Whether in time, under the influence of
civilization, bull-fights will be abandoned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Spain, it is difficult to say. The love of those
fights is very deep in the nature of the Spanish
people. The higher and intelligent ranks of
society take part in them gladly. The defenders
of these spectacles say that in substance
they are nothing more than hazardous
hunting, which answers to the knightly
character of the nation. But hunting is an
amusement, not a career; in hunting there
is no audience,&mdash;only actors; there are no
throngs of women, half fainting from delight
at the spectacle of torment and death;
finally, in hunting no one exposes his life
for hire.</p>

<p>Were I asked if the spectacle is beautiful,
I should say yes; beautiful especially in its
surroundings,&mdash;that sun, those shades, those
thousands of fans at sight of which it seems
as though a swarm of butterflies had settled
on the seats of the circus, those eyes, those
red moist lips. Beautiful is that incalculable
quantity of warm and strong tones, that mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of colors, gold, tinsel, that inflamed sand, from
which heat is exhaling,&mdash;finally those proofs
of bold daring, and that terror hanging over
the play. All that is more beautiful by far
than the streams of blood and the torn bellies
of the horses.</p>

<p>He, however, who knows these spectacles
only from description, and sees them afterwards
with his own eyes, cannot but think:
what a wonderful people for whom the highest
amusement and delight is the sight of a
thing so awful, so absolute and inevitable as
death. Whence comes that love? Is it
simply a remnant of Middle-age cruelty; or
is it that impulse which is roused in many
persons, for instance at sight of a precipice,
to go as near as possible to the brink, to
touch that curtain, behind which begin the
mystery and the pit?&mdash;that is a wonderful
passion, which in certain souls becomes irresistible.</p>

<p>Of the Spaniards it may be said, that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the whole course of their history they have
shown a tendency to extremes. Few people
have been so merciless in warfare; none have
turned a religion of love into such a gloomy
and bloody worship; finally, no other nation
amuses itself by playing with death.</p>

<p class="padv1 p1">With Fire and Sword. An Historical Novel of
Poland and Russia. By <span class="smcap">Henryk Sienkiewicz</span>.
Translated from the original by Jeremiah Curtin.
Crown 8vo. Cloth, $2.00. Library edition, 2 vols.,

<p class="padv1 p1">The Deluge. An Historical Novel of Poland,
Sweden, and Russia, a sequel to âWith Fire and

Sienkiewicz by Jeremiah Curtin. With photogravure
portrait of the author and map of the country at the
period of the stories. 2 vols. Crown 8vo. Cloth,
$3.00.</p>

<p class="padv2 p1">Every one should read these remarkable books. They have
received the highest praise everywhere. The distinguished
writer, Charles Dudley Warner, in a review of âWith Fire and
Swordâ in âHarperâs Monthly Magazine,â says that the
author has given, in the character of Zagloba, a new type to
the literature of fiction.</p>

<p class="padv2">Of these extraordinary romances it has been truly said that
<i>action in the field has never before been described in any language
with such a marvellous expression of energy</i>. The
comparisons which have suggested themselves to American
critics couple the Polish novelist with such names as Scott,
Dumas, Schiller, Cervantes, Shakespeare, and Homer. The
character of Zagloba has been described as âa curious and
fascinating combination of Falstaff and Ulysses.â</p>

<p class="padv2">âThe only modern romance with which âFire and Swordâ
can be compared,â says the âNew York Tribune,â âis âThe
Three Musketeers.ââ</p>

<p class="padv2 p1">This great historical romance completes the remarkable
series of historical novels by Sienkiewicz, begun by âWith Fire

works have been received everywhere with enthusiastic

<p class="pc2">Yanko the Musician and Other Stories.</p>

<p class="padv1 p1">By <span class="smcap">Henryk Sienkiewicz</span>. Translated from the Polish by
Jeremiah Curtin. Illustrated by Edmund H. Garrett.
16mo. White and gold. $1.25.</p>

<p class="padv2 p1">This charming volume contains the following stories of
two continents by the popular author of âWith Fire and
Sword,â âThe Deluge,â etc.: I. Yanko the Musician; II.
The Lighthouse Keeper of Aspinwall; III. From the Diary
of a Tutor in Poznan; IV. A Comedy of Errors, a Sketch of
American Life; V. Bartek the Victor. âYanko the Musician,â
the initial story of the volumes, won the author his fame. In
a review of Sienkiewicz in Blackwoodâs Magazine, this beautiful
story was fittingly described as <i>a little poem in prose, absolutely
perfect of its kind</i>.</p>

<p class="padv2">âBartek the Victorâ is the story of a hero of the Franco-Prussian
war. The Blackwood reviewer, writing of it, says:
âThe battle of Gravelotte is so admirably described that it is
difficult to believe the writer not to have been actively engaged
in it himself.â</p>

<p class="padv2 p1">The stories are deeply intellectual.&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Public
Ledger.</i></p>

<p class="padv2">The tale of Yanko has wonderful pathos.&mdash;<i>Chicago Herald.</i></p>

<p class="padv2">Exquisite in technical expression.&mdash;<i>Boston Beacon.</i></p>

<p class="padv2">There is an outdoor freshness about these tales, and an impulse
which, like Polish music, sets oneâs blood a-tingling.&mdash;<i>New Haven
Register.</i></p>

<p class="padv2">They are full of powerful interest.&mdash;<i>Boston Courier.</i></p>

<p class="padv2">The simple story of the lighthouse man is a little masterpiece.&mdash;<i>New
York Times.</i></p>

<p class="padv2">The admirers of the distinguished Polish novelist will not be
disappointed in this volume of short stories, which is beautifully
illustrated by Edmund H. Garrett, and daintily bound.&mdash;<i>Boston
Home Journal.</i></p>

<p class="padv2">These stories show that he touches nothing without mastery.&mdash;<i>Christian
Register.</i></p>

<p class="padv2">The title story is a strangely simple, pathetic story of a weakling
child with a passion for music. The careful, loving treatment of the
slight plot makes it, even in translation, a beautiful story.&mdash;<i>Chicago
Figaro.</i></p>

<p class="padv2">Five stories, all conceived with great power and written with
masterly skill.&mdash;<i>Boston Gazette.</i></p>

of <span class="smcap">Vladimir Korolenko</span> by Aline Delano. With Introduction
by George Kennan, and illustrations by Edmund
H. Garrett. 16mo. Cloth, gilt top, $1.25.</p>

<p class="padv2">This unique and exquisite little book is less a story than a
wonderfully faithful and delicate study in psychology. Though told
in prose, it is in essence a poem. The volume is in <i>edition de luxe</i>,
with dainty and charming bits of vignette illustration and a perfection
of finish which gives refined pleasure to the touch as well as to the
eye.&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

Cloth, gilt top, $1.25. Uniform with âA Woman of
Shawmut.â</p>

<p class="padv2">Swedish life in all its varying domestic aspects, as seen from

elaborated in a veritably artistic manner. <i>The whole story has the
idyllic touch.</i>&mdash;<i>Boston Beacon.</i></p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of

where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
