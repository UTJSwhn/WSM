    <p>
      Such a day made glad the heart. All the flags of July were waving; the sun
      and the poppies flaming; white butterflies spiring up and twining, and the
      bees busy on the snapdragons. The lime-trees were coming into flower. Tall
      white lilies in the garden beds already rivaled the delphiniums; the York
      and Lancaster roses were full-blown round their golden hearts. There was a
      gentle breeze, and a swish and stir and hum rose and fell above the head
      of Edward Pierson, coming back from his lonely ramble over Tintern Abbey.
      He had arrived at Kestrel, his brother Robert&rsquo;s home on the bank of the
      Wye only that morning, having stayed at Bath on the way down; and now he
      had got his face burnt in that parti-coloured way peculiar to the faces of
      those who have been too long in London. As he came along the narrow,
      rather overgrown avenue, the sound of a waltz thrummed out on a piano fell
      on his ears, and he smiled, for music was the greatest passion he had. His
      dark grizzled hair was pushed back off his hot brow, which he fanned with
      his straw hat. Though not broad, that brow was the broadest part of a
      narrow oval face whose length was increased by a short, dark, pointed
      beard&mdash;a visage such as Vandyk might have painted, grave and gentle,
      but for its bright grey eyes, cinder-lashed and crow&rsquo;s-footed, and its
      strange look of not seeing what was before it. He walked quickly, though
      he was tired and hot; tall, upright, and thin, in a grey parsonical suit,
      on whose black kerseymere vest a little gold cross dangled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above his brother&rsquo;s house, whose sloping garden ran down to the railway
      line and river, a large room had been built out apart. Pierson stood where
      the avenue forked, enjoying the sound of the waltz, and the cool whipping
      of the breeze in the sycamores and birches. A man of fifty, with a sense
      of beauty, born and bred in the country, suffers fearfully from nostalgia
      during a long unbroken spell of London; so that his afternoon in the old
      Abbey had been almost holy. He had let his senses sink into the sunlit
      greenery of the towering woods opposite; he had watched the spiders and
      the little shining beetles, the flycatchers, and sparrows in the ivy;
      touched the mosses and the lichens; looked the speedwells in the eye;
      dreamed of he knew not what. A hawk had been wheeling up there above the
      woods, and he had been up there with it in the blue. He had taken a real
      spiritual bath, and washed the dusty fret of London off his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a year he had been working his parish single-handed&mdash;no joke&mdash;for
      his curate had gone for a chaplain; and this was his first real holiday
      since the war began, two years ago; his first visit, too, to his brother&rsquo;s
      home. He looked down at the garden, and up at the trees of the avenue. Bob
      had found a perfect retreat after his quarter of a century in Ceylon. Dear
      old Bob! And he smiled at the thought of his elder brother, whose burnt
      face and fierce grey whiskers somewhat recalled a Bengal tiger; the
      kindest fellow that ever breathed! Yes, he had found a perfect home for
      Thirza and himself. And Edward Pierson sighed. He too had once had a
      perfect home, a perfect wife; the wound of whose death, fifteen years ago,
      still bled a little in his heart. Their two daughters, Gratian and Noel,
      had not &ldquo;taken after&rdquo; her; Gratian was like his own mother, and Noel&rsquo;s
      fair hair and big grey eyes always reminded him of his cousin Leila, who&mdash;poor
      thing!&mdash;had made that sad mess of her life, and now, he had heard,
      was singing for a living, in South Africa. Ah! What a pretty girl she had
      been!
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawn by that eternal waltz tune he reached the doorway of the music-room.
      A chintz curtain hung there, and to the sound of feet slipping on polished
      boards, he saw his daughter Noel waltzing slowly in the arms of a young
      officer in khaki: Round and round they went, circling, backing, moving
      sideways with curious steps which seemed to have come in recently, for he
      did not recognise them. At the piano sat his niece Eve, with a teasing
      smile on her rosy face. But it was at his young daughter that Edward
      Pierson looked. Her eyes were half-closed, her cheeks rather pale, and her
      fair hair, cut quite short, curled into her slim round neck. Quite cool
      she seemed, though the young man in whose arms she was gliding along
      looked fiery hot; a handsome boy, with blue eyes and a little golden down
      on the upper lip of his sunny red-cheeked face. Edward Pierson thought:
      &lsquo;Nice couple!&rsquo; And had a moment&rsquo;s vision of himself and Leila, dancing at
      that long-ago Cambridge May Week&mdash;on her seventeenth birthday, he
      remembered, so that she must have been a year younger than Nollie was now!
      This would be the young man she had talked of in her letters during the
      last three weeks. Were they never going to stop?
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed into view of those within, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you very hot, Nollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blew him a kiss; the young man looked startled and self-conscious, and
      Eve called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bet, Uncle. They&rsquo;ve got to dance me down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson said mildly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bet? My dears!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel murmured over her shoulder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Daddy!&rdquo; And the young man gasped:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s bet us one of her puppies against one of mine, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson sat down, a little hypnotized by the sleepy strumming, the slow
      giddy movement of the dancers, and those half-closed swimming eyes of his
      young daughter, looking at him over her shoulder as she went by. He sat
      with a smile on his lips. Nollie was growing up! Now that Gratian was
      married, she had become a great responsibility. If only his dear wife had
      lived! The smile faded from his lips; he looked suddenly very tired. The
      struggle, physical and spiritual, he had been through, these fifteen
      years, sometimes weighed him almost to the ground: Most men would have
      married again, but he had always felt it would be sacrilege. Real unions
      were for ever, even though the Church permitted remarriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched his young daughter with a mixture of aesthetic pleasure and
      perplexity. Could this be good for her? To go on dancing indefinitely with
      one young man could that possibly be good for her? But they looked very
      happy; and there was so much in young creatures that he did not
      understand. Noel, so affectionate, and dreamy, seemed sometimes possessed
      of a little devil. Edward Pierson was naif; attributed those outbursts of
      demonic possession to the loss of her mother when she was such a mite;
      Gratian, but two years older, had never taken a mother&rsquo;s place. That had
      been left to himself, and he was more or less conscious of failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat there looking up at her with a sort of whimsical distress. And,
      suddenly, in that dainty voice of hers, which seemed to spurn each word a
      little, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stop!&rdquo; and, sitting down beside him, took up his hat to fan
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve struck a triumphant chord. &ldquo;Hurrah I&rsquo;ve won!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Noel, we weren&rsquo;t half done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; but Daddy was getting bored, weren&rsquo;t you, dear? This is Cyril
      Morland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson shook the young man&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy, your nose is burnt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear; I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give you some white stuff for it. You have to sleep with it on all
      night. Uncle and Auntie both use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Eve says so. If you&rsquo;re going to bathe, Cyril, look out for that
      current!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man, gazing at her with undisguised adoration, muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel&rsquo;s eyes lingered after him; Eve broke a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to have a bath before tea, Nollie, you&rsquo;d better hurry
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Was it jolly in the Abbey, Daddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely; like a great piece of music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy always puts everything into music. You ought to see it by
      moonlight; it&rsquo;s gorgeous then. All right, Eve; I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo; But she did
      not get up, and when Eve was gone, cuddled her arm through her father&rsquo;s
      and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you think of Cyril?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, how can I tell? He seems a nice-looking young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Daddy; don&rsquo;t strain yourself. It&rsquo;s jolly down here, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
       She got up, stretched herself a little, and moved away, looking like a
      very tall child, with her short hair curling in round her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson, watching her vanish past the curtain, thought: &lsquo;What a lovely
      thing she is!&rsquo; And he got up too, but instead of following, went to the
      piano, and began to play Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Prelude and Fugue in E minor. He
      had a fine touch, and played with a sort of dreamy passion. It was his way
      out of perplexities, regrets, and longings; a way which never quite failed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Cambridge, he had intended to take up music as a profession, but family
      tradition had destined him for Holy Orders, and an emotional Church
      revival of that day had caught him in its stream. He had always had
      private means, and those early years before he married had passed happily
      in an East-End parish. To have not only opportunity but power to help in
      the lives of the poor had been fascinating; simple himself, the simple
      folk of his parish had taken hold of his heart. When, however, he married
      Agnes Heriot, he was given a parish of his own on the borders of East and
      West, where he had been ever since, even after her death had nearly killed
      him. It was better to go on where work and all reminded him of one whom he
      had resolved never to forget in other ties. But he knew that his work had
      not the zest it used to have in her day, or even before her day. It may
      well be doubted whether he, who had been in Holy Orders twenty-six years,
      quite knew now what he believed. Everything had become circumscribed, and
      fixed, by thousands of his own utterances; to have taken fresh stock of
      his faith, to have gone deep into its roots, would have been like taking
      up the foundations of a still-standing house. Some men naturally root
      themselves in the inexpressible&mdash;for which one formula is much the
      same as another; though Edward Pierson, gently dogmatic, undoubtedly
      preferred his High-Church statement of the inexpressible to that of, say,
      the Zoroastrians. The subtleties of change, the modifications by science,
      left little sense of inconsistency or treason on his soul. Sensitive,
      charitable, and only combative deep down, he instinctively avoided
      discussion on matters where he might hurt others or they hurt him. And,
      since explanation was the last thing which o could be expected of one who
      did not base himself on Reason, he had found but scant occasion ever to
      examine anything. Just as in the old Abbey he had soared off into the
      infinite with the hawk, the beetles, and the grasses, so now, at the
      piano, by these sounds of his own making, he was caught away again into
      emotionalism, without realising that he was in one of his, most religious
      moods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming to tea, Edward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman standing behind him, in a lilac-coloured gown, had one of those
      faces which remain innocent to the end of the chapter, in spite of the
      complete knowledge of life which appertains to mothers. In days of
      suffering and anxiety, like these of the great war, Thirza Pierson was a
      valuable person. Without ever expressing an opinion on cosmic matters, she
      reconfirmed certain cosmic truths, such as that though the whole world was
      at war, there was such a thing as peace; that though all the sons of
      mothers were being killed, there remained such a thing as motherhood; that
      while everybody was living for the future, the present still existed. Her
      tranquil, tender, matter-of-fact busyness, and the dew in her eyes, had
      been proof against twenty-three years of life on a tea-plantation in the
      hot part of Ceylon; against Bob Pierson; against the anxiety of having two
      sons at the front, and the confidences of nearly every one she came
      across. Nothing disturbed her. She was like a painting of &ldquo;Goodness&rdquo; by an
      Old Master, restored by Kate Greenaway. She never went to meet life, but
      when it came, made the best of it. This was her secret, and Pierson always
      felt rested in her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and moved by her side, over the lawn, towards the big tree at the
      bottom of the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;you think Noel is looking, Edward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very pretty. That young man, Thirza?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s over head and ears in love with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the dismayed sound he uttered, she slipped her soft round arm within
      his. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to the front soon, poor boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they talked to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has. Nollie hasn&rsquo;t yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie is a queer child, Thirza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie is a darling, but rather a desperate character, Edward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a swing under the tree, where the tea-things were set out, the &ldquo;rather
      desperate character&rdquo; was swaying. &ldquo;What a picture she is!&rdquo; he said, and
      sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of his brother came to them,&mdash;high and steamy, as though
      corrupted by the climate of Ceylon:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You incorrigible dreamy chap, Ted! We&rsquo;ve eaten all the raspberries. Eve,
      give him some jam; he must be dead! Phew! the heat! Come on, my dear, and
      pour out his tea. Hallo, Cyril! Had a good bathe? By George, wish my head
      was wet! Squattez-vous down over there, by Nollie; she&rsquo;ll swing, and keep
      the flies off you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a cigarette, Uncle Bob&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Your father doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just for the flies. You don&rsquo;t mind, Daddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if it&rsquo;s necessary, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel smiled, showing her upper teeth, and her eyes seemed to swim under
      their long lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t necessary, but it&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; said Bob Pierson. &ldquo;Here you are, Nollie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Noel shook her head. At that moment she struck her father as
      startlingly grown-up-so composed, swaying above that young man at her
      feet, whose sunny face was all adoration. &lsquo;No longer a child!&rsquo; he thought.
      &lsquo;Dear Nollie!&rsquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      Awakened by that daily cruelty, the advent of hot water, Edward Pierson
      lay in his chintz-curtained room, fancying himself back in London. A wild
      bee hunting honey from the bowl of flowers on the window-sill, and the
      scent of sweetbrier, shattered that illusion. He drew the curtain, and,
      kneeling on the window-seat thrust his head out into the morning. The air
      was intoxicatingly sweet. Haze clung over the river and the woods beyond;
      the lawn sparkled with dew, and two wagtails strutted in the dewy
      sunshine. &lsquo;Thank God for loveliness!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;Those poor boys at the
      front!&rsquo; And kneeling with his elbows on the sill, he began to say his
      prayers. The same feeling which made him beautify his church, use
      vestments, good music, and incense, filled him now. God was in the
      loveliness of His world, as well as in His churches. One could worship Him
      in a grove of beech trees, in a beautiful garden, on a high hill, by the
      banks of a bright river. God was in the rustle of the leaves, and the hum
      of a bee, in the dew on the grass, and the scent of flowers; God was in
      everything! And he added to his usual prayer this whisper: &ldquo;I give Thee
      thanks for my senses, O Lord. In all of us, keep them bright, and grateful
      for beauty.&rdquo; Then he remained motionless, prey to a sort of happy yearning
      very near, to melancholy. Great beauty ever had that effect on him. One
      could capture so little of it&mdash;could never enjoy it enough! Who was
      it had said not long ago: &ldquo;Love of beauty is really only the sex instinct,
      which nothing but complete union satisfies.&rdquo; Ah! yes, George&mdash;Gratian&rsquo;s
      husband. George Laird! And a little frown came between his brows, as
      though at some thorn in the flesh. Poor George! But then, all doctors were
      materialists at heart&mdash;splendid fellows, though; a fine fellow,
      George, working himself to death out there in France. One must not take
      them too seriously. He plucked a bit of sweetbrier and put it to his nose,
      which still retained the shine of that bleaching ointment Noel had
      insisted on his using. The sweet smell of those little rough leaves
      stirred up an acute aching. He dropped them, and drew back. No longings,
      no melancholy; one ought to be out, this beautiful morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sunday; but he had not to take three Services and preach at least
      one sermon; this day of rest was really to be his own, for once. It was
      almost disconcerting; he had so long felt like the cab horse who could not
      be taken out of the shafts lest he should fall down. He dressed with
      extraordinary deliberation, and had not quite finished when there came a
      knock on his door, and Noel&rsquo;s voice said: &ldquo;Can I come in, Daddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her flax-blue frock, with a Gloire de Dijon rose pinned where it met on
      her faintly browned neck, she seemed to her father a perfect vision of
      freshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter from Gratian; George has been sent home ill, and he&rsquo;s
      gone to our house. She&rsquo;s got leave from her hospital to come home and
      nurse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson read the letter. &ldquo;Poor George!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going to let me be a nurse, Daddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must wait till you&rsquo;re eighteen, Nollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could easily say I was. It&rsquo;s only a month; and I look much more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might be anything from fifteen to twenty-five, my dear, according as
      you behave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go out as near the front as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her head was poised so that the sunlight framed her face, which was rather
      broad&mdash;the brow rather too broad&mdash;under the waving light-brown
      hair, the nose short and indeterminate; cheeks still round from youth,
      almost waxen-pale, and faintly hollowed under the eyes. It was her lips,
      dainty yet loving, and above all her grey eyes, big and dreamily alive,
      which made her a swan. He could not imagine her in nurse&rsquo;s garb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is new, isn&rsquo;t it, Nollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cyril Morland&rsquo;s sisters are both out; and he&rsquo;ll be going soon. Everybody
      goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gratian hasn&rsquo;t got out yet: It takes a long time to get trained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; all the more reason to begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She got up, looked at him, looked at her hands, seemed about to speak, but
      did not. A little colour had come into her cheeks. Then, obviously making
      conversation, she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to church? It&rsquo;s worth anything to hear Uncle Bob read the
      Lessons, especially when he loses his place. No; you&rsquo;re not to put on your
      long coat till just before church time. I won&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obediently Pierson resigned his long coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you see, you can have my rose. Your nose is better!&rdquo; She kissed his
      nose, and transferred her rose to the buttonhole of his short coat.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. Come along!&rdquo; And with her arm through his, they went down.
      But he knew she had come to say something which she had not said.
    </p>
    <p>
      2
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob Pierson, in virtue of greater wealth than the rest of the
      congregation, always read the Lessons, in his high steamy voice, his
      breathing never adjusted to the length of any period. The congregation,
      accustomed, heard nothing peculiar; he was the necessary gentry with the
      necessary finger in the pie. It was his own family whom he perturbed. In
      the second row, Noel, staring solemnly at the profile of her father in the
      front row, was thinking: &lsquo;Poor Daddy! His eyes look as if they were coming
      out. Oh, Daddy! Smile! or it&rsquo;ll hurt you!&rsquo; Young Morland beside her, rigid
      in his tunic, was thinking: &lsquo;She isn&rsquo;t thinking of me!&rsquo; And just then her
      little finger crooked into his. Edward Pierson was thinking: &lsquo;Oh! My dear
      old Bob! Oh!&rsquo; And, beside him, Thirza thought: &lsquo;Poor dear Ted I how nice
      for him to be having a complete rest! I must make him eat he&rsquo;s so thin!&rsquo;
      And Eve was thinking: &lsquo;Oh, Father! Mercy!&rsquo; But Bob Pierson was thinking:
      &lsquo;Cheer oh! Only another three verses!&rsquo; Noel&rsquo;s little finger unhooked
      itself, but her eyes stole round to young Morland&rsquo;s eyes, and there was a
      light in them which lingered through the singing and the prayers. At last,
      in the reverential rustle of the settling congregation, a surpliced figure
      mounted the pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come not to bring Peace, but a sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson looked up. He felt deep restfulness. There was a pleasant light in
      this church; the hum of a country bluebottle made all the difference to
      the quality of silence. No critical thought stirred within him, nor any
      excitement. He was thinking: &lsquo;Now I shall hear something for my good; a
      fine text; when did I preach from it last?&rsquo; Turned a little away from the
      others, he saw nothing but the preacher&rsquo;s homely face up there above the
      carved oak; it was so long since he had been preached to, so long since he
      had had a rest! The words came forth, dropped on his forehead, penetrated,
      met something which absorbed them, and disappeared. &lsquo;A good plain sermon!&rsquo;
      he thought. &lsquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m stale; I don&rsquo;t seem&mdash;&rsquo; &ldquo;Let us not, dear
      brethren,&rdquo; droned the preacher&rsquo;s earnest voice, &ldquo;think that our dear Lord,
      in saying that He brought a sword, referred to a physical sword. It was
      the sword of the spirit to which He was undoubtedly referring, that bright
      sword of the spirit which in all ages has cleaved its way through the
      fetters imposed on men themselves by their own desires, imposed by men on
      other men in gratification of their ambitions, as we have had so striking
      an example in the invasion by our cruel enemies of a little neighbouring
      country which had done them no harm. Dear brethren, we may all bring
      swords.&rdquo; Pierson&rsquo;s chin jerked; he raised his hand quickly and passed it
      over his face. &lsquo;All bring swords,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;swords&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t
      asleep&mdash;surely!&rsquo; &ldquo;But let us be sure that our swords are bright;
      bright with hope, and bright with faith, that we may see them flashing
      among the carnal desires of this mortal life, carving a path for us
      towards that heavenly kingdom where alone is peace, perfect peace. Let us
      pray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson did not shut his eyes; he opened them as he fell on his knees. In
      the seat behind, Noel and young Morland had also fallen on their knees
      their faces covered each with a single hand; but her left hand and his
      right hung at their sides. They prayed a little longer than any others
      and, on rising, sang the hymn a little louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      3
    </p>
    <p>
      No paper came on Sundays&mdash;not even the local paper, which had so long
      and so nobly done its bit with headlines to win the war. No news whatever
      came, of men blown up, to enliven the hush of the hot July afternoon, or
      the sense of drugging&mdash;which followed Aunt Thirza&rsquo;s Sunday lunch.
      Some slept, some thought they were awake; but Noel and young Morland
      walked upward through the woods towards a high common of heath and furze,
      crowned by what was known as Kestrel rocks. Between these two young people
      no actual word of love had yet been spoken. Their lovering had advanced by
      glance and touch alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Morland was a school and college friend of the two Pierson boys now
      at the front. He had no home of his own, for his parents were dead; and
      this was not his first visit to Kestrel. Arriving three weeks ago, for his
      final leave before he should go out, he had found a girl sitting in a
      little wagonette outside the station, and had known his fate at once. But
      who knows when Noel fell in love? She was&mdash;one supposes&mdash;just
      ready for that sensation. For the last two years she had been at one of
      those high-class finishing establishments where, in spite of the healthy
      curriculum, perhaps because of it, there is ever an undercurrent of
      interest in the opposing sex; and not even the gravest efforts to
      eliminate instinct are quite successful. The disappearance of every young
      male thing into the maw of the military machine put a premium on instinct.
      The thoughts of Noel and her school companions were turned, perforce, to
      that which, in pre-war freedom of opportunity they could afford to regard
      as of secondary interest. Love and Marriage and Motherhood, fixed as the
      lot of women by the countless ages, were threatened for these young
      creatures. They not unnaturally pursued what they felt to be receding.
    </p>
    <p>
      When young Morland showed, by following her about with his eyes, what was
      happening to him, Noel was pleased. From being pleased, she became a
      little excited; from being excited she became dreamy. Then, about a week
      before her father&rsquo;s arrival, she secretly began to follow the young man
      about with her eyes; became capricious too, and a little cruel. If there
      had been another young man to favour&mdash;but there was not; and she
      favoured Uncle Bob&rsquo;s red setter. Cyril Morland grew desperate. During
      those three days the demon her father dreaded certainly possessed her. And
      then, one evening, while they walked back together from the hay-fields,
      she gave him a sidelong glance; and he gasped out: &ldquo;Oh! Noel, what have I
      done?&rdquo; She caught his hand, and gave it a quick squeeze. What a change!
      What blissful alteration ever since!
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the wood young Morland mounted silently, screwing himself up to
      put things to the touch. Noel too mounted silently, thinking: &lsquo;I will kiss
      him if he kisses me!&rsquo; Eagerness, and a sort of languor, were running in
      her veins; she did not look at him from under her shady hat. Sun light
      poured down through every chink in the foliage; made the greenness of the
      steep wood marvellously vivid and alive; flashed on beech leaves, ash
      leaves, birch leaves; fell on the ground in little runlets; painted bright
      patches on trunks and grass, the beech mast, the ferns; butterflies chased
      each other in that sunlight, and myriads of ants and gnats and flies
      seemed possessed by a frenzy of life. The whole wood seemed possessed, as
      if the sunshine were a happy Being which had come to dwell therein. At a
      half-way spot, where the trees opened and they could see, far below them,
      the gleam of the river, she sat down on the bole of a beech-tree, and
      young Morland stood looking at her. Why should one face and not an other,
      this voice and not that, make a heart beat; why should a touch from one
      hand awaken rapture, and a touch from another awaken nothing? He knelt
      down and pressed his lips to her foot. Her eyes grew very bright; but she
      got up and ran on&mdash;she had not expected him to kiss her foot. She
      heard him hurrying after her, and stopped, leaning against a birch trunk.
      He rushed to her, and, without a word spoken, his lips were on her lips.
      The moment in life, which no words can render, had come for them. They had
      found their enchanted spot, and they moved no further, but sat with their
      arms round each other, while the happy Being of the wood watched. A
      marvellous speeder-up of Love is War. What might have taken six months,
      was thus accomplished in three weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short hour passed, then Noel said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell Daddy, Cyril. I meant to tell him something this morning,
      only I thought I&rsquo;d better wait, in case you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland answered: &ldquo;Oh, Noel!&rdquo; It was the staple of his conversation while
      they sat there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a short hour passed, and Morland said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go off my chump if we&rsquo;re not married before I go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long does it take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No time, if we hurry up. I&rsquo;ve got six days before I rejoin, and perhaps
      the Chief will give me another week, if I tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Daddy! Kiss me again; a long one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the long one was over, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can come and be near you till you go out? Oh, Cyril!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Noel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you won&rsquo;t go so soon. Don&rsquo;t go if you can help it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I can help it, darling; but I shan&rsquo;t be able.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not; I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Morland clutched his hair. &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s in the same boat, but it
      can&rsquo;t last for ever; and now we&rsquo;re engaged we can be together all the time
      till I&rsquo;ve got the licence or whatever it is. And then&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy won&rsquo;t like our not being married in a church; but I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking down at her closed eyes, and their lashes resting on her cheeks,
      young Morland thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My God! I&rsquo;m in heaven!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another short hour passed before she freed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go, Cyril. Kiss me once more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly dinner-time, and they ran down. 4
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Pierson, returning from the Evening Service, where he had read the
      Lessons, saw them in the distance, and compressed his lips. Their long
      absence had vexed him. What ought he to do? In the presence of Love&rsquo;s
      young dream, he felt strange and helpless. That night, when he opened the
      door of his room, he saw Noel on the window-seat, in her dressing-gown,
      with the moonlight streaming in on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t light up, Daddy; I&rsquo;ve got something to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took hold of the little gold cross on his vest, and turned it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m engaged to Cyril; we want to be married this week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was exactly as if someone had punched him in the ribs; and at the sound
      he made she hurried on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, we must be; he may be going out any day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of his aching consternation, he admitted a kind of reason in
      her words. But he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you&rsquo;re only a child. Marriage is the most serious thing in life;
      you&rsquo;ve only known him three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all that, Daddy&rdquo; her voice sounded so ridiculously calm; &ldquo;but we
      can&rsquo;t afford to wait. He might never come back, you see, and then I should
      have missed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Noel, suppose he never did come back; it would only be much worse
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped the little cross, and took hold of his hand, pressing it
      against her heart. But still her voice was calm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; much better, Daddy; you think I don&rsquo;t know my own feelings, but I
      do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in Pierson softened; the priest hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie, true marriage is the union of souls; and for that, time is
      wanted. Time to know that you feel and think the same, and love the same
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know; but we do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell that, my dear; no one could in three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these aren&rsquo;t ordinary times, are they? People have to do things in a
      hurry. Oh, Daddy! Be an angel! Mother would have understood, and let me, I
      know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson drew away his hand; the words hurt, from reminder of his loss,
      from reminder of the poor substitute he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Nollie!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After all these years since she left us, I&rsquo;m as
      lonely as ever, because we were really one. If you marry this young man
      without knowing more of your own hearts than you can in such a little
      time, you may regret it dreadfully; you may find it turn out, after all,
      nothing but a little empty passion; or again, if anything happens to him
      before you&rsquo;ve had any real married life together, you&rsquo;ll have a much
      greater grief and sense of loss to put up with than if you simply stay
      engaged till after the war. Besides, my child, you&rsquo;re much too young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat so still that he looked at her in alarm. &ldquo;But I must!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bit his lips, and said sharply: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, Nollie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She got up, and before he could stop her, was gone. With the closing of
      the door, his anger evaporated, and distress took its place. Poor child!
      What to do with this wayward chicken just out of the egg, and wanting to
      be full-fledged at once? The thought that she would be lying miserable,
      crying, perhaps, beset him so that he went out into the passage and tapped
      on her door. Getting no answer, he went in. It was dark but for a streak
      of moonlight, and in that he saw her, lying on her bed, face down; and
      stealing up laid his hand on her head. She did not move; and, stroking her
      hair, he said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie dear, I didn&rsquo;t mean to be harsh. If I were your mother, I should
      know how to make you see, but I&rsquo;m only an old bumble-daddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rolled over, scrambling into a cross-legged posture on the bed. He
      could see her eyes shining. But she did not speak; she seemed to know that
      in silence was her strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said with a sort of despair:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must let me talk it over with your aunt. She has a lot of good
      sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent over and kissed her hot forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, my dear; don&rsquo;t cry. Promise me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, and lifted her face; he felt her hot soft lips on his
      forehead, and went away a little comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Noel sat on her bed, hugging her knees, listening to the night, to the
      emptiness and silence; each minute so much lost of the little, little time
      left, that she might have been with him.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pierson woke after a troubled and dreamful night, in which he had thought
      himself wandering in heaven like a lost soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      After regaining his room last night nothing had struck him more forcibly
      than the needlessness of his words: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Nollie!&rdquo; for he had
      realised with uneasiness that she had not been near crying. No; there was
      in her some emotion very different from the tearful. He kept seeing her
      cross-legged figure on the bed in that dim light; tense, enigmatic, almost
      Chinese; kept feeling the feverish touch of her lips. A good girlish burst
      of tears would have done her good, and been a guarantee. He had the
      uncomfortable conviction that his refusal had passed her by, as if
      unspoken. And, since he could not go and make music at that time of night,
      he had ended on his knees, in a long search for guidance, which was not
      vouchsafed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The culprits were demure at breakfast; no one could have told that for the
      last hour they had been sitting with their arms round each other, watching
      the river flow by, talking but little, through lips too busy. Pierson
      pursued his sister-in-law to the room where she did her flowers every
      morning. He watched her for a minute dividing ramblers from pansies,
      cornflowers from sweet peas, before he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very troubled, Thirza. Nollie came to me last night. Imagine! They
      want to get married&mdash;those two!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accepting life as it came, Thirza showed no dismay, but her cheeks grew a
      little pinker, and her eyes a little rounder. She took up a sprig of
      mignonette, and said placidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of it, Thirza&mdash;that child! Why, it&rsquo;s only a year or two since
      she used to sit on my knee and tickle my face with her hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thirza went on arranging her flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noel is older than you think, Edward; she is more than her age. And real
      married life wouldn&rsquo;t begin for them till after&mdash;if it ever began.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson experienced a sort of shock. His sister-in-law&rsquo;s words seemed
      criminally light-hearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered; &ldquo;the union, Thirza! Who can tell what
      will happen before they come together again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at his quivering face, and said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Edward; but if you refuse, I should be afraid, in these days, of
      what Noel might do. I told you there&rsquo;s a streak of desperation in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noel will obey me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder! There are so many of these war marriages now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re dreadful. What do they mean&mdash;Just a momentary
      gratification of passion. They might just as well not be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They mean pensions, as a rule,&rdquo; said Thirza calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirza, that is cynical; besides, it doesn&rsquo;t affect this case. I can&rsquo;t
      bear to think of my little Nollie giving herself for a moment which may
      come to nothing, or may turn out the beginning of an unhappy marriage. Who
      is this boy&mdash;what is he? I know nothing of him. How can I give her to
      him&mdash;it&rsquo;s impossible! If they had been engaged some time and I knew
      something of him&mdash;yes, perhaps; even at her age. But this hasty
      passionateness&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t right, it isn&rsquo;t decent. I don&rsquo;t understand,
      I really don&rsquo;t&mdash;how a child like that can want it. The fact is, she
      doesn&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s asking, poor little Nollie. She can&rsquo;t know the
      nature of marriage, and she can&rsquo;t realise its sacredness. If only her
      mother were here! Talk to her, Thirza; you can say things that I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thirza looked after the retreating figure. In spite of his cloth, perhaps
      a little because of it, he seemed to her like a child who had come to show
      her his sore finger. And, having finished the arrangement of her flowers,
      she went out to find her niece. She had not far to go; for Noel was
      standing in the hall, quite evidently lying in wait. They went out
      together to the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl began at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t any use talking to me, Auntie; Cyril is going to get a license.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! So you&rsquo;ve made up your minds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that&rsquo;s fair by me, Nollie? Should I have asked him here if
      I&rsquo;d thought this was going to happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel only smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you the least idea what marriage means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Gratian is married. Besides, at school&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father is dead against it. This is a sad thing for him. He&rsquo;s a
      perfect saint, and you oughtn&rsquo;t to hurt him. Can&rsquo;t you wait, at least till
      Cyril&rsquo;s next leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might never have one, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heart of her whose boys were out there too, and might also never have
      another leave; could not but be responsive to those words. She looked at
      her niece, and a dim appreciation of this revolt of life menaced by death,
      of youth threatened with extinction, stirred in her. Noel&rsquo;s teeth were
      clenched, her lips drawn back, and she was staring in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy oughtn&rsquo;t to mind. Old people haven&rsquo;t to fight, and get killed; they
      oughtn&rsquo;t to mind us taking what we can. They&rsquo;ve had their good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was such a just little speech that Thirza answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; perhaps he hasn&rsquo;t quite realised that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to make sure of Cyril, Auntie; I want everything I can have with
      him while there&rsquo;s the chance. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s much to ask, when perhaps
      I&rsquo;ll never have any more of him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thirza slipped her hand through the girl&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Only, Nollie, suppose, when all this is over,
      and we breathe and live naturally once more, you found you&rsquo;d made a
      mistake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel shook her head. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all think that, my dear; but thousands of mistakes are made by people
      who no more dream they&rsquo;re making them than you do now; and then it&rsquo;s a
      very horrible business. It would be especially horrible for you; your
      father believes heart and soul in marriage being for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s a darling; but I don&rsquo;t always believe what he believes, you know.
      Besides, I&rsquo;m not making a mistake, Auntie! I love Cyril ever so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thirza gave her waist a squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t make a mistake. We love you too much, Nollie. I wish we had
      Gratian here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gratian would back me up,&rdquo; said Noel; &ldquo;she knows what the war is. And you
      ought to, Auntie. If Rex or Harry wanted to be married, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d
      never oppose them. And they&rsquo;re no older than Cyril. You must understand
      what it means to me Auntie dear, to feel that we belong to each other
      properly before&mdash;before it all begins for him, and&mdash;and there
      may be no more. Daddy doesn&rsquo;t realise. I know he&rsquo;s awfully good, but&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I think he remembers only too well. He was desperately attached
      to your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel clenched her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he? Well, so am I to Cyril, and he to me. We wouldn&rsquo;t be unreasonable
      if it wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t necessary. Talk, to Cyril, Auntie; then you&rsquo;ll
      understand. There he is; only, don&rsquo;t keep him long, because I want him.
      Oh! Auntie; I want him so badly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned; and slipped back into the house; and Thirza, conscious of
      having been decoyed to this young man, who stood there with his arms
      folded, like Napoleon before a battle, smiled and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cyril, so you&rsquo;ve betrayed me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even in speaking she was conscious of the really momentous change in this
      sunburnt, blue-eyed, lazily impudent youth since the day he arrived, three
      weeks ago, in their little wagonette. He took her arm, just as Noel had,
      and made her sit down beside him on the rustic bench, where he had
      evidently been told to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Mrs. Pierson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not as if Noel were an ordinary
      girl in an ordinary time, is it? Noel is the sort of girl one would knock
      one&rsquo;s brains out for; and to send me out there knowing that I could have
      been married to her and wasn&rsquo;t, will take all the heart out of me. Of
      course I mean to come back, but chaps do get knocked over, and I think
      it&rsquo;s cruel that we can&rsquo;t take what we can while we can. Besides, I&rsquo;ve got
      money; and that would be hers anyway. So, do be a darling, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He
      put his arm round her waist, just as if he had been her son, and her
      heart, which wanted her own boys so badly, felt warmed within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I don&rsquo;t know Mr. Pierson, but he seems awfully gentle and jolly,
      and if he could see into me he wouldn&rsquo;t mind, I know. We don&rsquo;t mind
      risking our lives and all that, but we do think we ought to have the run
      of them while we&rsquo;re alive. I&rsquo;ll give him my dying oath or anything, that I
      could never change towards Noel, and she&rsquo;ll do the same. Oh! Mrs. Pierson,
      do be a jolly brick, and put in a word for me, quick! We&rsquo;ve got so few
      days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Thirza feebly, &ldquo;do you think it&rsquo;s fair to such a
      child as Noel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do. You don&rsquo;t understand; she&rsquo;s simply had to grow up. She is
      grown-up&mdash;all in this week; she&rsquo;s quite as old as I am, really&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;m twenty-two. And you know it&rsquo;s going to be&mdash;it&rsquo;s got to be&mdash;a
      young world, from now on; people will begin doing things much earlier.
      What&rsquo;s the use of pretending it&rsquo;s like what it was, and being cautious,
      and all that? If I&rsquo;m going to be killed, I think we&rsquo;ve got a right to be
      married first; and if I&rsquo;m not, then what does it matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve known each other twenty-one days, Cyril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; twenty-one years! Every day&rsquo;s a year when&mdash;Oh! Mrs. Pierson,
      this isn&rsquo;t like you, is it? You never go to meet trouble, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that shrewd remark, Thirza put her hand on the hand which still clasped
      her waist, and pressed it closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;we must see what can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyril Morland kissed her cheek. &ldquo;I will bless you for ever,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      haven&rsquo;t got any people, you know, except my two sisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And something like tears started up on Thirza&rsquo;s eyelashes. They seemed to
      her like the babes in the wood&mdash;those two!

      IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the dining-room of her father&rsquo;s house in that old London Square between
      East and West, Gratian Laird, in the outdoor garb of a nurse, was writing
      a telegram: &ldquo;Reverend Edward Pierson, Kestrel, Tintern, Monmouthshire.
      George terribly ill. Please come if you can. Gratian.&rdquo; Giving it to a
      maid, she took off her long coat and sat down for a moment. She had been
      travelling all night, after a full day&rsquo;s work, and had only just arrived,
      to find her husband between life and death. She was very different from
      Noel; not quite so tall, but of a stronger build; with dark
      chestnut-coloured hair, clear hazel eyes, and a broad brow. The expression
      of her face was earnest, with a sort of constant spiritual enquiry; and a
      singularly truthful look: She was just twenty; and of the year that she
      had been married, had only spent six weeks with her husband; they had not
      even a house of their own as yet. After resting five minutes, she passed
      her hand vigorously over her face, threw back her head, and walked up
      stairs to the room where he lay. He was not conscious, and there was
      nothing to be done but sit and watch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he dies,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;I shall hate God for His cruelty. I have had
      six weeks with George; some people have sixty years.&rsquo; She fixed her eyes
      on his face, short and broad, with bumps of &ldquo;observation&rdquo; on the brows. He
      had been sunburnt. The dark lashes of his closed eyes lay on deathly
      yellow cheeks; his thick hair grew rather low on his broad forehead. The
      lips were just open and showed strong white teeth. He had a little clipped
      moustache, and hair had grown on his clean-cut jaw. His pyjama jacket had
      fallen open. Gratian drew it close. It was curiously still, for a London
      day, though the window was wide open. Anything to break this heavy stupor,
      which was not only George&rsquo;s, but her own, and the very world&rsquo;s! The
      cruelty of it&mdash;when she might be going to lose him for ever, in a few
      hours or days! She thought of their last parting. It had not been very
      loving, had come too soon after one of those arguments they were inclined
      to have, in which they could not as yet disagree with suavity. George had
      said there was no future life for the individual; she had maintained there
      was. They had grown hot and impatient. Even in the cab on the way to his
      train they had pursued the wretched discussion, and the last kiss had been
      from lips on lips yet warm from disagreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since, as if in compunction, she had been wavering towards his point
      of view; and now, when he was perhaps to solve the problem&mdash;find out
      for certain&mdash;she had come to feel that if he died, she would never
      see him after. It was cruel that such a blight should have come on her
      belief at this, of all moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand on his. It was warm, felt strong, although so motionless
      and helpless. George was so vigorous, so alive, and strong-willed; it
      seemed impossible that life might be going to play him false. She recalled
      the unflinching look of his steel-bright eyes, his deep, queerly vibrating
      voice, which had no trace of self-consciousness or pretence. She slipped
      her hand on to his heart, and began very slowly, gently rubbing it. He, as
      doctor, and she, as nurse, had both seen so much of death these last two
      years! Yet it seemed suddenly as if she had never seen death, and that the
      young faces she had seen, empty and white, in the hospital wards, had just
      been a show. Death would appear to her for the first time, if this face
      which she loved were to be drained for ever of light and colour and
      movement and meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      A humblebee from the Square Garden boomed in and buzzed idly round the
      room. She caught her breath in a little sob....

      Pierson received that telegram at midday, returning from a lonely walk
      after his talk with Thirza. Coming from Gratian so self-reliant&mdash;it
      meant the worst. He prepared at once to catch the next train. Noel was
      out, no one knew where: so with a sick feeling he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAREST CHILD,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going up to Gratian; poor George is desperately ill. If it goes
      badly you should be with your sister. I will wire to-morrow morning early.
      I leave you in your aunt&rsquo;s hands, my dear. Be reasonable and patient. God
      bless you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your devoted
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DADDY.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was alone in his third-class compartment, and, leaning forward, watched
      the ruined Abbey across the river till it was out of sight. Those old
      monks had lived in an age surely not so sad as this. They must have had
      peaceful lives, remote down here, in days when the Church was great and
      lovely, and men laid down their lives for their belief in her, and built
      everlasting fanes to the glory of God! What a change to this age of rush
      and hurry, of science, trade, material profit, and this terrible war! He
      tried to read his paper, but it was full of horrors and hate. &lsquo;When will
      it end?&rsquo; he thought. And the train with its rhythmic jolting seemed
      grinding out the answer: &ldquo;Never&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Chepstow a soldier got in, followed by a woman with a very flushed face
      and curious, swimmy eyes; her hair was in disorder, and her lip bleeding,
      as if she had bitten it through. The soldier, too, looked strained and
      desperate. They sat down, far apart, on the seat opposite. Pierson,
      feeling that he was in their way, tried to hide himself behind his paper;
      when he looked again, the soldier had taken off his tunic and cap and was
      leaning out of the window. The woman, on the seat&rsquo;s edge, sniffing and
      wiping her face, met his glance with resentful eyes, then, getting up, she
      pulled the man&rsquo;s sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit dahn; don&rsquo;t &lsquo;ang out o&rsquo; there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier flung himself back on the seat and looked at Pierson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wife an&rsquo; me&rsquo;s &lsquo;ad a bit of a row,&rdquo; he said companionably. &ldquo;Gits on me
      nerves; I&rsquo;m not used to it. She was in a raid, and &lsquo;er nerves are all gone
      funny; ain&rsquo;t they, old girl? Makes me feel me &lsquo;ead. I&rsquo;ve been wounded
      there, you know; can&rsquo;t stand much now. I might do somethin&rsquo; if she was to
      go on like this for long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson looked at the woman, but her eyes still met his resentfully. The
      soldier held out a packet of cigarettes. &ldquo;Take one,&rdquo; he said. Pierson took
      one and, feeling that the soldier wanted him to speak, murmured: &ldquo;We all
      have these troubles with those we&rsquo;re fond of; the fonder we are of people,
      the more we feel them, don&rsquo;t we? I had one with my daughter last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the soldier; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right. The wife and me&rsquo;ll make it up.
      &lsquo;Ere, come orf it, old girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From behind his paper he soon became conscious of the sounds of
      reconciliation&mdash;reproaches because someone had been offered a drink,
      kisses mixed with mild slappings, and abuse. When they got out at Bristol
      the soldier shook his hand warmly, but the woman still gave him her
      resentful stare, and he thought dreamily: &lsquo;The war! How it affects
      everyone!&rsquo; His carriage was invaded by a swarm of soldiers, and the rest
      of the journey was passed in making himself small. When at last he reached
      home, Gratian met him in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the same. The doctor says we shall know in a few hours now. How
      sweet of you to come! You must be tired, in this heat. It was dreadful to
      spoil your holiday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear! As if&mdash;May I go up and see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Laird was still lying in that stupor. And Pierson stood gazing down
      at him compassionately. Like most parsons, he had a wide acquaintance with
      the sick and dying; and one remorseless fellowship with death. Death! The
      commonest thing in the world, now&mdash;commoner than life! This young
      doctor must have seen many die in these last two years, saved many from
      death; and there he lay, not able to lift a finger to save himself.
      Pierson looked at his daughter; what a strong, promising young couple they
      were! And putting his arm round her, he led her away to the sofa, whence
      they could see the sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he dies, Dad&mdash;&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will have died for the Country, my love, as much as ever our soldiers
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; but that&rsquo;s no comfort. I&rsquo;ve been watching here all day; I&rsquo;ve been
      thinking; men will be just as brutal afterwards&mdash;more brutal. The
      world will go on the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must hope not. Shall we pray, Gracie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could believe that the world&mdash;if I could believe anything! I&rsquo;ve
      lost the power, Dad; I don&rsquo;t even believe in a future life. If George
      dies, we shall never meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson stared at her without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gratian went on: &ldquo;The last time we talked, I was angry with George because
      he laughed at my belief; now that I really want belief, I feel that he was
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson said tremulously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my dear; it&rsquo;s only that you&rsquo;re overwrought. God in His mercy will
      give you back belief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no God, Dad&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling child, what are you saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No God who can help us; I feel it. If there were any God who could take
      part in our lives, alter anything without our will, knew or cared what we
      did&mdash;He wouldn&rsquo;t let the world go on as it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear, His purposes are inscrutable. We dare not say He should not
      do this or that, or try to fathom to what ends He is working.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then He&rsquo;s no good to us. It&rsquo;s the same as if He didn&rsquo;t exist. Why should
      I pray for George&rsquo;s life to One whose ends are just His own? I know George
      oughtn&rsquo;t to die. If there&rsquo;s a God who can help, it will be a wicked shame
      if George dies; if there&rsquo;s a God who can help, it&rsquo;s a wicked shame when
      babies die, and all these millions of poor boys. I would rather think
      there&rsquo;s no God than a helpless or a wicked God&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her father had suddenly thrown up his hands to his ears. She moved closer,
      and put her arm round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad dear, I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson pressed her face down to his shoulder; and said in a dull voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think would have happened to me, Gracie, if I had lost belief
      when your mother died? I have never lost belief. Pray God I never shall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George would not wish me to pretend I believe&mdash;he would want me to
      be honest. If I&rsquo;m not honest, I shan&rsquo;t deserve that he should live. I
      don&rsquo;t believe, and I can&rsquo;t pray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, you&rsquo;re overtired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dad.&rdquo; She raised her head from his shoulder and, clasping her hands
      round her knees, looked straight before her. &ldquo;We can only help ourselves;
      and I can only bear it if I rebel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson sat with trembling lips, feeling that nothing he could say would
      touch her just then. The sick man&rsquo;s face was hardly visible now in the
      twilight, and Gratian went over to his bed. She stood looking down at him
      a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and rest, Dad; the doctor&rsquo;s coming again at eleven. I&rsquo;ll call you if I
      want anything. I shall lie down a little, beside him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson kissed her, and went out. To lie there beside him would be the
      greatest comfort she could get. He went to the bare narrow little room he
      had occupied ever since his wife died; and, taking off his boots, walked
      up and down, with a feeling of almost crushing loneliness. Both his
      daughters in such trouble, and he of no use to them! It was as if Life
      were pushing him utterly aside! He felt confused, helpless, bewildered.
      Surely if Gratian loved George, she had not left God&rsquo;s side, whatever she
      might say. Then, conscious of the profound heresy of this thought, he
      stood still at the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earthly love&mdash;heavenly love; was there any analogy between them?
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Square Gardens the indifferent whisper of the leaves answered;
      and a newsvendor at the far end, bawling his nightly tale of murder. 3
    </p>
    <p>
      George Laird passed the crisis of his illness that night, and in the
      morning was pronounced out of danger. He had a splendid constitution, and&mdash;Scotsman
      on his father&rsquo;s side&mdash;a fighting character. He came back to life very
      weak, but avid of recovery; and his first words were: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hanging
      over the edge, Gracie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very high cliff, and his body half over, balancing; one inch, the merest
      fraction of an inch more, and over he would have gone. Deuced rum
      sensation! But not so horrible as it would have been in real life. With
      the slip of that last inch he felt he would have passed at once into
      oblivion, without the long horror of a fall. So this was what it was for
      all the poor fellows he had seen slip in the past two years! Mercifully,
      at the end, one was not alive enough to be conscious of what one was
      leaving, not alive enough even to care. If he had been able to take in the
      presence of his young wife, able to realise that he was looking at her
      face, touching her for the last time&mdash;it would have been hell; if he
      had been up to realising sunlight, moonlight, the sound of the world&rsquo;s
      life outside, the softness of the bed he lay on&mdash;it would have meant
      the most poignant anguish of defraudment. Life was a rare good thing, and
      to be squashed out of it with your powers at full, a wretched mistake in
      Nature&rsquo;s arrangements, a wretched villainy on the part of Man&mdash;for
      his own death, like all those other millions of premature deaths, would
      have been due to the idiocy and brutality of men! He could smile now, with
      Gratian looking down at him, but the experience had heaped fuel on a fire
      which had always smouldered in his doctor&rsquo;s soul against that half
      emancipated breed of apes, the human race. Well, now he would get a few
      days off from his death-carnival! And he lay, feasting his returning
      senses on his wife. She made a pretty nurse, and his practised eye judged
      her a good one&mdash;firm and quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Laird was thirty. At the opening of the war he was in an East-End
      practice, and had volunteered at once for service with the Army. For the
      first nine months he had been right up in the thick of it. A poisoned arm;
      rather than the authorities, had sent him home. During that leave he
      married Gratian. He had known the Piersons some time; and, made conscious
      of the instability of life, had resolved to marry her at the first chance
      he got. For his father-in-law he had respect and liking, ever mixed with
      what was not quite contempt and not quite pity. The blend of authority
      with humility, cleric with dreamer, monk with artist, mystic with man of
      action, in Pierson, excited in him an interested, but often irritated,
      wonder. He saw things so differently himself, and had little of the
      humorous curiosity which enjoys what is strange simply because it is
      strange. They could never talk together without soon reaching a point when
      he wanted to say: &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re not to trust our reason and our senses for
      what they&rsquo;re worth, sir&mdash;will you kindly tell me what we are to
      trust? How can we exert them to the utmost in some matters, and in others
      suddenly turn our backs on them?&rdquo; Once, in one of their discussions, which
      often bordered on acrimony, he had expounded himself at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s a great ultimate Mystery, that we
      shall never know anything for certain about the origin of life and the
      principle of the Universe; but why should we suddenly shut up our
      enquiring apparatus and deny all the evidence of our reason&mdash;say,
      about the story of Christ, or the question of a future life, or our moral
      code? If you want me to enter a temple of little mysteries, leaving my
      reason and senses behind&mdash;as a Mohammedan leaves his shoes&mdash;it
      won&rsquo;t do to say to me simply: &lsquo;There it is! Enter!&rsquo; You must show me the
      door; and you can&rsquo;t! And I&rsquo;ll tell you why, sir. Because in your brain
      there&rsquo;s a little twist which is not in mine, or the lack of a little twist
      which is in mine. Nothing more than that divides us into the two main
      species of mankind, one of whom worships, and one of whom doesn&rsquo;t. Oh,
      yes! I know; you won&rsquo;t admit that, because it makes your religions natural
      instead of what you call supernatural. But I assure you there&rsquo;s nothing
      more to it. Your eyes look up or they look down&mdash;they never look
      straight before them. Well, mine do just the opposite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That day Pierson had been feeling very tired, and though to meet this
      attack was vital, he had been unable to meet it. His brain had stammered.
      He had turned a little away, leaning his cheek on his hand, as if to cover
      that momentary break in his defences. Some days later he had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am able now to answer your questions, George. I think I can make you
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laird had answered: &ldquo;All right, sir; go ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You begin by assuming that the human reason is the final test of all
      things. What right have you to assume that? Suppose you were an ant. You
      would take your ant&rsquo;s reason as the final test, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Would that
      be the truth?&rdquo; And a smile had fixed itself on his lips above his little
      grave beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Laird also had smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems a good point, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;until you recognise that I don&rsquo;t
      take, the human reason as final test in any absolute sense. I only say
      it&rsquo;s the highest test we can apply; and that, behind that test all is
      quite dark and unknowable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Revelation, then, means nothing to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we can usefully go on, George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we can, sir. In talking with you, I always feel like
      fighting a man with one hand tied behind his back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, perhaps, feel that I am arguing with one who was blind from
      birth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all that, they had often argued since; but never without those
      peculiar smiles coming on their faces. Still, they respected each other,
      and Pierson had not opposed his daughter&rsquo;s marriage to this heretic, whom
      he knew to be an honest and trustworthy man. It had taken place before
      Laird&rsquo;s arm was well, and the two had snatched a month&rsquo;s honeymoon before
      he went back to France, and she to her hospital in Manchester. Since then,
      just one February fortnight by the sea had been all their time
      together....
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon he had asked for beef tea, and, having drunk a cup, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something to tell your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But warned by the pallor of his smiling lips, Gratian answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me first, George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our last talk, Gracie; well&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;on the other
      side. I looked over; it&rsquo;s as black as your hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. While you were lying here last night, I told father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He squeezed her hand, and said: &ldquo;I also want to tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad will say the motive for life is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say it leaps out all the more, Gracie. What a mess we make of it&mdash;we
      angel-apes! When shall we be men, I wonder? You and I, Gracie, will fight
      for a decent life for everybody. No hands-upping about that! Bend down!
      It&rsquo;s good to touch you again; everything&rsquo;s good. I&rsquo;m going to have a
      sleep....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the relief of the doctor&rsquo;s report in the early morning Pierson had
      gone through a hard struggle. What should he wire to Noel? He longed to
      get her back home, away from temptation to the burning indiscretion of
      this marriage. But ought he to suppress reference to George&rsquo;s progress?
      Would that be honest? At last he sent this telegram: &ldquo;George out of danger
      but very weak. Come up.&rdquo; By the afternoon post, however, he received a
      letter from Thirza:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had two long talks with Noel and Cyril. It is impossible to budge
      them. And I really think, dear Edward, that it will be a mistake to oppose
      it rigidly. He may not go out as soon as we think. How would it be to
      consent to their having banns published?&mdash;that would mean another
      three weeks anyway, and in absence from each other they might be
      influenced to put it off. I&rsquo;m afraid this is the only chance, for if you
      simply forbid it, I feel they will run off and get married somewhere at a
      registrar&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson took this letter out with him into the Square Garden, for painful
      cogitation. No man can hold a position of spiritual authority for long
      years without developing the habit of judgment. He judged Noel&rsquo;s conduct
      to be headlong and undisciplined, and the vein of stubbornness in his
      character fortified the father and the priest within him. Thirza
      disappointed him; she did not seem to see the irretrievable gravity of
      this hasty marriage. She seemed to look on it as something much lighter
      than it was, to consider that it might be left to Chance, and that if
      Chance turned out unfavourable, there would still be a way out. To him
      there would be no way out. He looked up at the sky, as if for inspiration.
      It was such a beautiful day, and so bitter to hurt his child, even for her
      good! What would her mother have advised? Surely Agnes had felt at least
      as deeply as himself the utter solemnity of marriage! And, sitting there
      in the sunlight, he painfully hardened his heart. He must do what he
      thought right, no matter what the consequences. So he went in and wrote
      that he could not agree, and wished Noel to come back home at once.

    <p>
      But on the same afternoon, just about that hour, Noel was sitting on the
      river-bank with her arms folded tight across her chest, and by her side
      Cyril Morland, with despair in his face, was twisting a telegram &ldquo;Rejoin
      tonight. Regiment leaves to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What consolation that a million such telegrams had been read and sorrowed
      over these last two years! What comfort that the sun was daily blotted dim
      for hundreds of bright eyes; the joy of life poured out and sopped up by
      the sands of desolation!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have we got, Cyril?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve engaged a car from the Inn, so I needn&rsquo;t leave till midnight. I&rsquo;ve
      packed already, to have more time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it to ourselves, then. Let&rsquo;s go off somewhere. I&rsquo;ve got some
      chocolate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland answered miserably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can send the car up here for my things, and have it pick me up at the
      Inn, if you&rsquo;ll say goodbye to them for me, afterwards. We&rsquo;ll walk down the
      line, then we shan&rsquo;t meet anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in the bright sunlight they walked hand in hand on each side of a
      shining rail. About six they reached the Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get a boat,&rdquo; said Noel. &ldquo;We can come back here when it&rsquo;s moonlight.
      I know a way of getting in, after the gate&rsquo;s shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hired a boat, rowed over to the far bank, and sat on the stern seat,
      side by side under the trees where the water was stained deep green by the
      high woods. If they talked, it was but a word of love now and then, or to
      draw each other&rsquo;s attention to a fish, a bird, a dragon-fly. What use
      making plans&mdash;for lovers the chief theme? Longing paralysed their
      brains. They could do nothing but press close to each other, their hands
      enlaced, their lips meeting now and then. On Noel&rsquo;s face was a strange
      fixed stillness, as if she were waiting&mdash;expecting! They ate their
      chocolates. The sun set, dew began to fall; the river changed, and grew
      whiter; the sky paled to the colour of an amethyst; shadows lengthened,
      dissolved slowly. It was past nine already; a water-rat came out, a white
      owl flew over the river, towards the Abbey. The moon had come up, but shed
      no light as yet. They saw no beauty in all this&mdash;too young, too
      passionate, too unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel said: &ldquo;When she&rsquo;s over those trees, Cyril, let&rsquo;s go. It&rsquo;ll be half
      dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They waited, watching the moon, which crept with infinite slowness up and
      up, brightening ever so little every minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; said Noel. And Morland rowed across.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the boat, and she led the way past an empty cottage, to a shed
      with a roof sloping up to the Abbey&rsquo;s low outer wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can get over here,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They clambered up, and over, to a piece of grassy courtyard, and passed on
      to an inner court, under the black shadow of the high walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the time?&rdquo; said Noel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-past ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already! Let&rsquo;s sit here in the dark, and watch for the moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat down close together. Noel&rsquo;s face still had on it that strange
      look of waiting; and Morland sat obedient, with his hand on her heart, and
      his own heart beating almost to suffocation. They sat, still as mice, and
      the moon crept up. It laid a first vague greyness on the high wall, which
      spread slowly down, and brightened till the lichen and the grasses up
      there were visible; then crept on, silvering the dark above their heads.
      Noel pulled his sleeve, and whispered: &ldquo;See!&rdquo; There came the white owl,
      soft as a snowflake, drifting across in that unearthly light, as if flying
      to the moon. And just then the top of the moon itself looked over the
      wall, a shaving of silvery gold. It grew, became a bright spread fan, then
      balanced there, full and round, the colour of pale honey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ours!&rdquo; Noel whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      2
    </p>
    <p>
      From the side of the road Noel listened till the sound of the car was lost
      in the folds of the valley. She did not cry, but passed her hands over her
      face, and began to walk home, keeping to the shadow of the trees. How many
      years had been added to her age in those six hours since the telegram
      came! Several times in that mile and a half she stepped into a patch of
      brighter moonlight, to take out and kiss a little photograph, then slip it
      back next her heart, heedless that so warm a place must destroy any
      effigy. She felt not the faintest compunction for the recklessness of her
      love&mdash;it was her only comfort against the crushing loneliness of the
      night. It kept her up, made her walk on with a sort of pride, as if she
      had got the best of Fate. He was hers for ever now, in spite of anything
      that could be done. She did not even think what she would say when she got
      in. She came to the avenue, and passed up it still in a sort of dream. Her
      uncle was standing before the porch; she could hear his mutterings. She
      moved out of the shadow of the trees, went straight up to him, and,
      looking in his perturbed face, said calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cyril asked me to say good-bye to you all, Uncle. Good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, I say, Nollie look here you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had passed on. She went up to her room. There, by the door, her aunt
      was standing, and would have kissed her. She drew back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Auntie. Not to-night!&rdquo; And, slipping by, she locked her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob and Thirza Pierson, meeting in their own room, looked at each other
      askance. Relief at their niece&rsquo;s safe return was confused by other
      emotions. Bob Pierson expressed his first:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew! I was beginning to think we should w have to drag the river. What
      girls are coming to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the war, Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like her face, old girl. I don&rsquo;t know what it was, but I didn&rsquo;t
      like her face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither did Thirza, but she would not admit it, and encourage Bob to take
      it to heart. He took things so hardly, and with such a noise!
    </p>
    <p>
      She only said: &ldquo;Poor young things! I suppose it will be a relief to
      Edward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love Nollie!&rdquo; said Bob Pierson suddenly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an affectionate
      creature. D-nit, I&rsquo;m sorry about this. It&rsquo;s not so bad for young Morland;
      he&rsquo;s got the excitement&mdash;though I shouldn&rsquo;t like to be leaving
      Nollie, if I were young again. Thank God, neither of our boys is engaged.
      By George! when I think of them out there, and myself here, I feel as if
      the top of my head would come off. And those politician chaps spouting
      away in every country&mdash;how they can have the cheek!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thirza looked at him anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no dinner!&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you think they&rsquo;ve been doing
      with themselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holding each other&rsquo;s hands, poor dears! D&rsquo;you know what time it is, Bob?
      Nearly one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all I can say is, I&rsquo;ve had a wretched evening. Get to bed, old
      girl. You&rsquo;ll be fit for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was soon asleep, but Thirza lay awake, not exactly worrying, for that
      was not her nature, but seeing Noel&rsquo;s face, pale, languid, passionate,
      possessed by memory.

    <p>
      Noel reached her father&rsquo;s house next day late in the afternoon. There was
      a letter in the hall for her. She tore it open, and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DARLING LOVE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got back all right, and am posting this at once to tell you we shall
      pass through London, and go from Charing Cross, I expect about nine
      o&rsquo;clock to-night. I shall look out for you, there, in case you are up in
      time. Every minute I think of you, and of last night. Oh! Noel!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your devoted lover,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the wrist-watch which, like every other little patriot, she
      possessed. Past seven! If she waited, Gratian or her father would seize on
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my things up, Dinah. I&rsquo;ve got a headache from travelling; I&rsquo;m going
      to walk it off. Perhaps I shan&rsquo;t be in till past nine or so. Give my love
      to them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Noel, you can&rsquo;t,&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Noel was gone. She walked towards Charing Cross; and, to kill time,
      went into a restaurant and had that simple repast, coffee and a bun, which
      those in love would always take if Society did not forcibly feed them on
      other things. Food was ridiculous to her. She sat there in the midst of a
      perfect hive of creatures eating hideously. The place was shaped like a
      modern prison, having tiers of gallery round an open space, and in the air
      was the smell of viands and the clatter of plates and the music of a band.
      Men in khaki everywhere, and Noel glanced from form to form to see if by
      chance one might be that which represented, for her, Life and the British
      Army. At half-past eight she went out and made her way: through the crowd,
      still mechanically searching &ldquo;khaki&rdquo; for what she wanted; and it was
      perhaps fortunate that there was about her face and walk something which
      touched people. At the station she went up to an old porter, and, putting
      a shilling into his astonished hand, asked him to find out for her whence
      Morland&rsquo;s regiment would start. He came back presently, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel went. He was rather lame, had grey whiskers, and a ghostly thin
      resemblance to her uncle Bob, which perhaps had been the reason why she
      had chosen him. 64
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother goin&rsquo; out, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! It&rsquo;s a crool war. I shan&rsquo;t be sorry when it&rsquo;s over. Goin&rsquo; out and
      comin&rsquo; in, we see some sad sights &lsquo;ere. Wonderful spirit they&rsquo;ve got, too.
      I never look at the clock now but what I think: &lsquo;There you go, slow-coach!
      I&rsquo;d like to set you on to the day the boys come back!&rsquo; When I puts a bag
      in: &lsquo;Another for &lsquo;ell&rsquo; I thinks. And so it is, miss, from all I can &lsquo;ear.
      I&rsquo;ve got a son out there meself. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;ere they&rsquo;ll come along. You stand
      quiet and keep a lookout, and you&rsquo;ll get a few minutes with him when he&rsquo;s
      done with &lsquo;is men. I wouldn&rsquo;t move, if I were you; he&rsquo;ll come to you, all
      right&mdash;can&rsquo;t miss you, there.&rsquo; And, looking at her face, he thought:
      &lsquo;Astonishin&rsquo; what a lot o&rsquo; brothers go. Wot oh! Poor little missy! A
      little lady, too. Wonderful collected she is. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;ard!&rsquo;.rdquo; And trying to
      find something consoling to say, he mumbled out: &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t be in a
      better place for seen&rsquo;im off. Good night, miss; anything else I can do for
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you; you&rsquo;re very kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked back once or twice at her blue-clad figure standing very still.
      He had left her against a little oasis of piled-up empty milk-cans, far
      down the platform where a few civilians in similar case were scattered.
      The trainway was empty as yet. In the grey immensity of the station and
      the turmoil of its noise, she felt neither lonely nor conscious of others
      waiting; too absorbed in the one thought of seeing him and touching him
      again. The empty train began backing in, stopped, and telescoped with a
      series of little clattering bangs, backed on again, and subsided to rest.
      Noel turned her eyes towards the station arch ways. Already she felt
      tremulous, as though the regiment were sending before it the vibration of
      its march.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not as yet seen a troop-train start, and vague images of brave
      array, of a flag fluttering, and the stir of drums, beset her. Suddenly
      she saw a brown swirling mass down there at the very edge, out of which a
      thin brown trickle emerged towards her; no sound of music, no waved flag.
      She had a longing to rush down to the barrier, but remembering the words
      of the porter, stayed where she was, with her hands tightly squeezed
      together. The trickle became a stream, a flood, the head of which began to
      reach her. With a turbulence of voices, sunburnt men, burdened up to the
      nose, passed, with rifles jutting at all angles; she strained her eyes,
      staring into that stream as one might into a walking wood, to isolate a
      single tree. Her head reeled with the strain of it, and the effort to
      catch his voice among the hubbub of all those cheery, common,
      happy-go-lucky sounds. Some who saw her clucked their tongues, some went
      by silent, others seemed to scan her as though she might be what they were
      looking for. And ever the stream and the hubbub melted into the train, and
      yet came pouring on. And still she waited motionless, with an awful fear.
      How could he ever find her, or she him? Then she saw that others of those
      waiting had found their men. And the longing to rush up and down the
      platform almost overcame her; but still she waited. And suddenly she saw
      him with two other officer boys, close to the carriages, coming slowly
      down towards her. She stood with her eyes fixed on his face; they passed,
      and she nearly cried out. Then he turned, broke away from the other two,
      and came straight to her. He had seen her before she had seen him. He was
      very flushed, had a little fixed frown between his blue eyes and a set
      jaw. They stood looking at each other, their hands hard gripped; all the
      emotion of last night welling up within them, so that to speak would have
      been to break down. The milk-cans formed a kind of shelter, and they stood
      so close together that none could see their faces. Noel was the first to
      master her power of speech; her words came out, dainty as ever, through
      trembling lips:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write to me as much as ever you can, Cyril. I&rsquo;m going to be a nurse at
      once. And the first leave you get, I shall come to you&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget! Move a little back, darling; they can&rsquo;t see us here. Kiss me!&rdquo;
       She moved back, thrust her face forward so that he need not stoop, and put
      her lips up to his. Then, feeling that she might swoon and fall over among
      the cans, she withdrew her mouth, leaving her forehead against his lips.
      He murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it all right when you got in last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I said good-bye for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Noel&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been afraid&mdash;I oughtn&rsquo;t&mdash;I oughtn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; nothing can take you from me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have got pluck. More than!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Along whistle sounded. Morland grasped her hands convulsively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my little wife! Don&rsquo;t fret. Goodbye! I must go. God bless you,
      Noel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other, just another moment, then she took her hands
      from his and stood back in the shadow of the milk-cans, rigid, following
      him with her eyes till he was lost in the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every carriage window was full of those brown figures and red-brown faces,
      hands were waving vaguely, voices calling vaguely, here and there one
      cheered; someone leaning far out started to sing: &ldquo;If auld acquaintance&mdash;&rdquo;
       But Noel stood quite still in the shadow of the milk-cans, her lips drawn
      in, her hands hard clenched in front of her; and young Morland at his
      window gazed back at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      2
    </p>
    <p>
      How she came to be sitting in Trafalgar Square she did not know. Tears had
      formed a mist between her and all that seething, summer-evening crowd. Her
      eyes mechanically followed the wandering search-lights, those new milky
      ways, quartering the heavens and leading nowhere. All was wonderfully
      beautiful, the sky a deep dark blue, the moonlight whitening the spire of
      St. Martin&rsquo;s, and everywhere endowing the great blacked-out buildings with
      dream-life. Even the lions had come to life, and stared out over this
      moonlit desert of little human figures too small to be worth the
      stretching out of a paw. She sat there, aching dreadfully, as if the
      longing of every bereaved heart in all the town had settled in her. She
      felt it tonight a thousand times worse; for last night she had been
      drugged on the new sensation of love triumphantly fulfilled. Now she felt
      as if life had placed her in the corner of a huge silent room, blown out
      the flame of joy, and locked the door. A little dry sob came from her. The
      hay-fields and Cyril, with shirt unbuttoned at the neck, pitching hay and
      gazing at her while she dabbled her fork in the thin leavings. The bright
      river, and their boat grounded on the shallows, and the swallows flitting
      over them. And that long dance, with the feel of his hand between her
      shoulder-blades! Memories so sweet and sharp that she almost cried out.
      She saw again their dark grassy courtyard in the Abbey, and the white owl
      flying over them. The white owl! Flying there again to-night, with no
      lovers on the grass below! She could only picture Cyril now as a brown
      atom in that swirling brown flood of men, flowing to a huge brown sea.
      Those cruel minutes on the platform, when she had searched and searched
      the walking wood for her, one tree, seemed to have burned themselves into
      her eyes. Cyril was lost, she could not single him out, all blurred among
      those thousand other shapes. And suddenly she thought: &lsquo;And I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      lost to him; he&rsquo;s never seen me at home, never seen me in London; he won&rsquo;t
      be able to imagine me. It&rsquo;s all in the past, only the past&mdash;for both
      of us. Is there anybody so unhappy?&rsquo; And the town&rsquo;s voices-wheels, and
      passing feet, whistles, talk, laughter&mdash;seemed to answer callously:
      &lsquo;Not one.&rsquo; She looked at her wrist-watch; like his, it had luminous hands:
      &lsquo;Half-past ten&rsquo; was greenishly imprinted there. She got up in dismay. They
      would think she was lost, or run over, or something silly! She could not
      find an empty taxi, and began to walk, uncertain of her way at night. At
      last she stopped a policeman, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is the way towards Bloomsbury, please? I can&rsquo;t find a taxi.&rdquo; The
      man looked at her, and took time to think it over; then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re linin&rsquo; up for the theatres,&rdquo; and looked at her again. Something
      seemed to move in his mechanism:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; that way, miss. If you like, you can step along with me.&rdquo; Noel
      stepped along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The streets aren&rsquo;t what they ought to be,&rdquo; the policeman said. &ldquo;What with
      the darkness, and the war turning the girls heads&mdash;you&rsquo;d be surprised
      the number of them that comes out. It&rsquo;s the soldiers, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel felt her cheeks burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed it,&rdquo; the policeman went on: &ldquo;but this
      war&rsquo;s a funny thing. The streets are gayer and more crowded at night than
      I&rsquo;ve ever seen them; it&rsquo;s a fair picnic all the time. What we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to
      settle down to when peace comes, I don&rsquo;t know. I suppose you find it quiet
      enough up your way, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Noel; &ldquo;quite quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No soldiers up in Bloomsbury. You got anyone in the Army, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! It&rsquo;s anxious times for ladies. What with the Zeps, and their brothers
      and all in France, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;arassin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve lost a brother meself, and I&rsquo;ve
      got a boy out there in the Garden of Eden; his mother carries on dreadful
      about him. What we shall think of it when it&rsquo;s all over, I can&rsquo;t tell.
      These Huns are a wicked tough lot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel looked at him; a tall man, regular and orderly, with one of those
      perfectly decent faces so often seen in the London police.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;ve lost someone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t lost anyone very
      near, yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s &lsquo;ope you won&rsquo;t, miss. These times make you feel for others,
      an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s something. I&rsquo;ve noticed a great change in folks you&rsquo;d never
      think would feel for anyone. And yet I&rsquo;ve seen some wicked things too; we
      do, in the police. Some of these English wives of aliens, and &lsquo;armless
      little German bakers, an&rsquo; Austrians, and what-not: they get a crool time.
      It&rsquo;s their misfortune, not their fault, that&rsquo;s what I think; and the way
      they get served&mdash;well, it makes you ashamed o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; English
      sometimes&mdash;it does straight: And the women are the worst. I said to
      my wife only last night, I said: &lsquo;They call themselves Christians,&rsquo; I
      said, &lsquo;but for all the charity that&rsquo;s in &lsquo;em they might as well be Huns.&rsquo;
      She couldn&rsquo;t see it-not she!&rsquo; Well, why do they drop bombs?&rsquo; she says.
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;those English wives and bakers drop bombs? Don&rsquo;t be
      silly,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re as innocent as we.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s the innocent that gets
      punished for the guilty. &lsquo;But they&rsquo;re all spies,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; I said,
      &lsquo;old lady! Now really! At your time of life!&rsquo; But there it is; you can&rsquo;t
      get a woman to see reason. It&rsquo;s readin&rsquo; the papers. I often think they
      must be written by women&mdash;beggin&rsquo; your pardon, miss&mdash;but reely,
      the &lsquo;ysterics and the &lsquo;atred&mdash;they&rsquo;re a fair knockout. D&rsquo;you find
      much hatred in your household, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel shook her head. &ldquo;No; my father&rsquo;s a clergyman, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the policeman. And in the glance he bestowed on her could be
      seen an added respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re bound to have a sense of justice against
      these Huns; some of their ways of goin&rsquo; on have been above the limit. But
      what I always think is&mdash;of course I don&rsquo;t say these things&mdash;no
      use to make yourself unpopular&mdash;but to meself I often think: Take &lsquo;em
      man for man, and you&rsquo;d find &lsquo;em much the same as we are, I daresay. It&rsquo;s
      the vicious way they&rsquo;re brought up, of actin&rsquo; in the mass, that&rsquo;s made &lsquo;em
      such a crool lot. I see a good bit of crowds in my profession, and I&rsquo;ve a
      very low opinion of them. Crowds are the most blunderin&rsquo; blighted things
      that ever was. They&rsquo;re like an angry woman with a bandage over her eyes,
      an&rsquo; you can&rsquo;t have anything more dangerous than that. These Germans, it
      seems, are always in a crowd. They get a state o&rsquo; mind read out to them by
      Bill Kaser and all that bloody-minded lot, an&rsquo; they never stop to think
      for themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they&rsquo;d be shot if they did,&rdquo; said Noel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there is that,&rdquo; said the policeman reflectively. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve brought
      discipline to an &lsquo;igh pitch, no doubt. An&rsquo; if you ask me,&rdquo;&mdash;he
      lowered his voice till it was almost lost in his chin-strap, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be
      runnin&rsquo; &lsquo;em a good second &lsquo;ere, before long. The things we &lsquo;ave to protect
      now are gettin&rsquo; beyond a joke. There&rsquo;s the City against lights, there&rsquo;s
      the streets against darkness, there&rsquo;s the aliens, there&rsquo;s the aliens&rsquo;
      shops, there&rsquo;s the Belgians, there&rsquo;s the British wives, there&rsquo;s the
      soldiers against the women, there&rsquo;s the women against the soldiers,
      there&rsquo;s the Peace Party, there&rsquo;s &lsquo;orses against croolty, there&rsquo;s a Cabinet
      Minister every now an&rsquo; then; and now we&rsquo;ve got these Conchies. And, mind
      you, they haven&rsquo;t raised our pay; no war wages in the police. So far as I
      can see, there&rsquo;s only one good result of the war&mdash;the burglaries are
      off. But there again, you wait a bit and see if we don&rsquo;t have a prize crop
      of &lsquo;m, or my name&rsquo;s not &lsquo;Arris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have an awfully exciting life!&rdquo; said Noel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman looked down at her sideways, without lowering his face, as
      only a policeman can, and said indulgently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re used to it, you see; there&rsquo;s no excitement in what you&rsquo;re used to.
      They find that in the trenches, I&rsquo;m told. Take our seamen&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      lots of &lsquo;em been blown up over and over again, and there they go and sign
      on again next day. That&rsquo;s where the Germans make their mistake! England in
      war-time! I think a lot, you know, on my go; you can&rsquo;t &lsquo;elp it&mdash;the
      mind will work&mdash;an&rsquo; the more I think, the more I see the fightin&rsquo;
      spirit in the people. We don&rsquo;t make a fuss about it like Bill Kaser. But
      you watch a little shopman, one o&rsquo; those fellows who&rsquo;s had his house
      bombed; you watch the way he looks at the mess&mdash;sort of disgusted.
      You watch his face, and you see he&rsquo;s got his teeth into it. You watch one
      of our Tommies on &lsquo;is crutches, with the sweat pourin&rsquo; off his forehead
      an&rsquo; &lsquo;is eyes all strainy, stumpin&rsquo; along&mdash;that gives you an idea! I
      pity these Peace fellows, reely I pity them; they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re
      up against. I expect there&rsquo;s times when you wish you was a man, don&rsquo;t you,
      miss? I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s times when I feel I&rsquo;d like to go in the trenches.
      That&rsquo;s the worst o&rsquo; my job; you can&rsquo;t be a human bein&rsquo;&mdash;not in the
      full sense of the word. You mustn&rsquo;t let your passions rise, you mustn&rsquo;t
      drink, you mustn&rsquo;t talk; it&rsquo;s a narrow walk o&rsquo; life. Well, here you are,
      miss; your Square&rsquo;s the next turnin&rsquo; to the right. Good night and thank
      you for your conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel held out her hand. &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman took her hand with a queer, flattered embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, miss,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve got a trouble; and I&rsquo;m
      sure I hope it&rsquo;ll turn out for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel gave his huge hand a squeeze; her eyes had filled with tears, and she
      turned quickly up towards the Square, where a dark figure was coming
      towards her, in whom she recognised her father. His face was worn and
      harassed; he walked irresolutely, like a man who has lost something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; In his voice was an infinite relief. &ldquo;My
      child, where have you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Daddy. Cyril has just gone to the front. I&rsquo;ve been seeing
      him off from Charing Cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson slipped his arm round her. They entered the house without
      speaking....
    </p>
    <p>
      3
    </p>
    <p>
      By the rail of his transport, as far&mdash;about two feet&mdash;as he
      could get from anyone, Cyril Morland stood watching Calais, a dream city,
      brighten out of the heat and grow solid. He could hear the guns already,
      the voice of his new life-talking in the distance. It came with its
      strange excitement into a being held by soft and marvellous memories, by
      one long vision of Noel and the moonlit grass, under the dark Abbey wall.
      This moment of passage from wonder to wonder was quite too much for a boy
      unused to introspection, and he stood staring stupidly at Calais, while
      the thunder of his new life came rolling in on that passionate moonlit
      dream.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      After the emotions of those last three days Pierson woke with the feeling
      a ship must have when it makes landfall. Such reliefs are natural, and as
      a rule delusive; for events are as much the parents of the future as they
      were the children of the past. To be at home with both his girls, and
      resting&mdash;for his holiday would not be over for ten days&mdash;was
      like old times. Now George was going on so well Gratian would be herself
      again; now Cyril Morland was gone Noel would lose that sudden youthful
      love fever. Perhaps in two or three days if George continued to progress,
      one might go off with Noel somewhere for one&rsquo;s last week. In the meantime
      the old house, wherein was gathered so much remembrance of happiness and
      pain, was just as restful as anywhere else, and the companionship of his
      girls would be as sweet as on any of their past rambling holidays in Wales
      or Ireland. And that first morning of perfect idleness&mdash;for no one
      knew he was back in London&mdash;pottering, and playing the piano in the
      homely drawing-room where nothing to speak of was changed since his wife&rsquo;s
      day, was very pleasant. He had not yet seen the girls, for Noel did not
      come down to breakfast, and Gratian was with George.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discovery that there was still a barrier between him and them came but
      slowly in the next two days. He would not acknowledge it, yet it was
      there, in their voices, in their movements&mdash;rather an absence of
      something old than the presence of something new. It was as if each had
      said to him: &ldquo;We love you, but you are not in our secrets&mdash;and you
      must not be, for you would try to destroy them.&rdquo; They showed no fear of
      him, but seemed to be pushing him unconsciously away, lest he should
      restrain or alter what was very dear to them. They were both fond of him,
      but their natures had set foot on definitely diverging paths. The closer
      the affection, the more watchful they were against interference by that
      affection. Noel had a look on her face, half dazed, half proud, which
      touched, yet vexed him. What had he done to forfeit her confidence&mdash;surely
      she must see how natural and right his opposition had been! He made one
      great effort to show the real sympathy he felt for her. But she only said:
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk of Cyril, Daddy; I simply can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; And he, who easily shrank
      into his shell, could not but acquiesce in her reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Gratian it was different. He knew that an encounter was before him; a
      struggle between him and her husband&mdash;for characteristically he set
      the change in her, the defection of her faith, down to George, not to
      spontaneous thought and feeling in herself. He dreaded and yet looked
      forward to this encounter. It came on the third day, when Laird was up,
      lying on that very sofa where Pierson had sat listening to Gratian&rsquo;s
      confession of disbelief. Except for putting in his head to say good
      morning, he had not yet seen his son-in-law: The young doctor could not
      look fragile, the build of his face, with that law and those heavy
      cheekbones was too much against it, but there was about him enough of the
      look of having come through a hard fight to give Pierson&rsquo;s heart a
      squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, George,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you gave us a dreadful fright! I thank God&rsquo;s
      mercy.&rdquo; With that half-mechanical phrase he had flung an unconscious
      challenge. Laird looked up whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you really think God merciful, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us argue, George; you&rsquo;re not strong enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m pining for something to bite on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson looked at Gratian, and said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s mercy is infinite, and you know it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laird also looked at Gratian, before he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s mercy is surely the amount of mercy man has succeeded in arriving
      at. How much that is, this war tells you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson flushed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t follow you,&rdquo; he said painfully. &ldquo;How can you say
      such things, when you yourself are only just&mdash;No; I refuse to argue,
      George; I refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laird stretched out his hand to his wife, who came to him, and stood
      clasping it with her own. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to argue,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m simply
      bursting with it. I challenge you, sir, to show me where there&rsquo;s any sign
      of altruistic pity, except in man. Mother love doesn&rsquo;t count&mdash;mother
      and child are too much one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The curious smile had come already, on both their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear George, is not man the highest work of God, and mercy the highest
      quality in man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit. If geological time be taken as twenty-four hours, man&rsquo;s
      existence on earth so far equals just two seconds of it; after a few more
      seconds, when man has been frozen off the earth, geological time will
      stretch for as long again, before the earth bumps into something, and
      becomes nebula once more. God&rsquo;s hands haven&rsquo;t been particularly full, sir,
      have they&mdash;two seconds out of twenty-four hours&mdash;if man is His
      pet concern? And as to mercy being the highest quality in, man, that&rsquo;s
      only a modern fashion of talking. Man&rsquo;s highest quality is the sense of
      proportion, for that&rsquo;s what keeps him alive; and mercy, logically pursued,
      would kill him off. It&rsquo;s a sort of a luxury or by-product.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George! You can have no music in your soul! Science is such a little
      thing, if you could only see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me a bigger, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what has been revealed to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! There it is again! By whom&mdash;how?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God Himself&mdash;through our Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint flush rose in Laird&rsquo;s yellow face, and his eyes brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if He existed, which some people, as you know, doubt,
      was a very beautiful character; there have been others. But to ask us to
      believe in His supernaturalness or divinity at this time of day is to ask
      us to walk through the world blindfold. And that&rsquo;s what you do, don&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Pierson looked at his daughter&rsquo;s face. She was standing quite still,
      with her eyes fixed on her husband. Somehow he was aware that all these
      words of the sick man&rsquo;s were for her benefit. Anger, and a sort of despair
      rose within him, and he said painfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot explain. There are things that I can&rsquo;t make clear, because you
      are wilfully blind to all that I believe in. For what do you imagine we
      are fighting this great war, if it is not to reestablish the belief in
      love as the guiding principle of life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laird shook his head. &ldquo;We are fighting to redress a balance, which was in
      danger of being lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The balance of power?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&mdash;no! The balance of philosophy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson smiled. &ldquo;That sounds very clever, George; but again, I don&rsquo;t
      follow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The balance between the sayings: &lsquo;Might is Right,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Right is Might.&rsquo;
      They&rsquo;re both half-truth, but the first was beating the other out of the
      field. All the rest of it is cant, you know. And by the way, sir, your
      Church is solid for punishment of the evildoer. Where&rsquo;s mercy there?
      Either its God is not merciful, or else it doesn&rsquo;t believe in its God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just punishment does not preclude mercy, George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does in Nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Nature, George&mdash;always Nature. God transcends Nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why does He give it a free rein? A man too fond of drink, or women&mdash;how
      much mercy does he get from Nature? His overindulgence brings its exact
      equivalent of penalty; let him pray to God as much as he likes&mdash;unless
      he alters his ways he gets no mercy. If he does alter his ways, he gets no
      mercy either; he just gets Nature&rsquo;s due reward. We English who have
      neglected brain and education&mdash;how much mercy are we getting in this
      war? Mercy&rsquo;s a man-made ornament, disease, or luxury&mdash;call it what
      you will. Except that, I&rsquo;ve nothing to say against it. On the contrary, I
      am all for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more Pierson looked at his daughter. Something in her face hurt him&mdash;the
      silent intensity with which she was hanging on her husband&rsquo;s words, the
      eager search of her eyes. And he turned to the door, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is bad for you, George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw Gratian put her hand on her husband&rsquo;s forehead, and thought&mdash;jealously:
      &lsquo;How can I save my poor girl from this infidelity? Are my twenty years of
      care to go for nothing, against this modern spirit?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in his study, the words went through his mind: &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy,
      Merciful and Mighty!&rdquo; And going to the little piano in the corner, he
      opened it, and began playing the hymn. He played it softly on the shabby
      keys of this thirty-year old friend, which had been with him since College
      days; and sang it softly in his worn voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sound made him look up. Gratian had come in. She put her hand on his
      shoulder, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it hurts you, Dad. But we&rsquo;ve got to find out for ourselves,
      haven&rsquo;t we? All the time you and George were talking, I felt that you
      didn&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s I who&rsquo;ve changed. It&rsquo;s not what he thinks, but what
      I&rsquo;ve come to think of my own accord. I wish you&rsquo;d understand that I&rsquo;ve got
      a mind of my own, Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson looked up with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you have a mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian shook her head. &ldquo;No, you thought my mind was yours; and now you
      think it&rsquo;s George&rsquo;s. But it&rsquo;s my own. When you were my age weren&rsquo;t you
      trying hard to find the truth yourself, and differing from your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson did not answer. He could not remember. It was like stirring a
      stick amongst a drift of last year&rsquo;s leaves, to awaken but a dry rustling,
      a vague sense of unsubstantiality. Searched? No doubt he had searched, but
      the process had brought him nothing. Knowledge was all smoke! Emotional
      faith alone was truth&mdash;reality!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Gracie!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;search if you must, but where will you find
      bottom? The well is too deep for us. You will come back to God, my child,
      when you&rsquo;re tired out; the only rest is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to rest. Some people search all their lives, and die
      searching. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be most unhappy, my child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m unhappy, Dad, it&rsquo;ll be because the world&rsquo;s unhappy. I don&rsquo;t
      believe it ought to be; I think it only is, because it shuts its eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson got up. &ldquo;You think I shut my eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do, it is because there is no other way to happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you happy; Dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As happy as my nature will let me be. I miss your mother. If I lose you
      and Noel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but we won&rsquo;t let you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson smiled. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think I have!&rdquo;

      Some wag, with a bit of chalk, had written the word &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; on three
      successive doors of a little street opposite Buckingham Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It caught the eye of Jimmy Fort, limping home to his rooms from a very
      late discussion at his Club, and twisted his lean shaven lips into a sort
      of smile. He was one of those rolling-stone Englishmen, whose early lives
      are spent in all parts of the world, and in all kinds of physical conflict&mdash;a
      man like a hickory stick, tall, thin, bolt-upright, knotty, hard as nails,
      with a curved fighting back to his head and a straight fighting front to
      his brown face. His was the type which becomes, in a generation or so,
      typically Colonial or American; but no one could possibly have taken Jimmy
      Fort for anything but an Englishman. Though he was nearly forty, there was
      still something of the boy in his face, something frank and curly-headed,
      gallant and full of steam, and his small steady grey eyes looked out on
      life with a sort of combative humour. He was still in uniform, though they
      had given him up as a bad job after keeping him nine months trying to mend
      a wounded leg which would never be sound again; and he was now in the War
      Office in connection with horses, about which he knew. He did not like it,
      having lived too long with all sorts and conditions of men who were
      neither English nor official, a combination which he found trying. His
      life indeed, just now, bored him to distraction, and he would ten times
      rather have been back in France. This was why he found the word &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; so
      exceptionally tantalising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching his rooms, he threw off his tunic, to whose stiff regularity he
      still had a rooted aversion; and, pulling out a pipe, filled it and sat
      down at his window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moonshine could not cool the hot town, and it seemed sleeping badly&mdash;the
      seven million sleepers in their million homes. Sound lingered on, never
      quite ceased; the stale odours clung in the narrow street below, though a
      little wind was creeping about to sweeten the air. &lsquo;Curse the war!&rsquo; he
      thought. &lsquo;What wouldn&rsquo;t I give to be sleeping out, instead of in this
      damned city!&rsquo; They who slept in the open, neglecting morality, would
      certainly have the best of it tonight, for no more dew was falling than
      fell into Jimmy Fort&rsquo;s heart to cool the fret of that ceaseless thought:
      &lsquo;The war! The cursed war!&rsquo; In the unending rows of little grey houses, in
      huge caravanserais, and the mansions of the great, in villas, and high
      slum tenements; in the government offices, and factories, and railway
      stations where they worked all night; in the long hospitals where they lay
      in rows; in the camp prisons of the interned; in bar racks, work-houses,
      palaces&mdash;no head, sleeping or waking, would be free of that thought:
      &lsquo;The cursed war!&rsquo; A spire caught his eye, rising ghostly over the roofs.
      Ah! churches alone, void of the human soul, would be unconscious! But for
      the rest, even sleep would not free them! Here a mother would be
      whispering the name of her boy; there a merchant would snore and dream he
      was drowning, weighted with gold; and a wife would be turning to stretch
      out her arms to-no one; and a wounded soldier wake out of a dream trench
      with sweat on his brow; and a newsvendor in his garret mutter hoarsely. By
      thousands the bereaved would be tossing, stifling their moans; by
      thousands the ruined would be gazing into the dark future; and housewives
      struggling with sums; and soldiers sleeping like logs&mdash;for to morrow
      they died; and children dreaming of them; and prostitutes lying in stale
      wonder at the busyness of their lives; and journalists sleeping the sleep
      of the just. And over them all, in the moonlight that thought &lsquo;The cursed
      war!&rsquo; flapped its black wings, like an old crow! &ldquo;If Christ were real,&rdquo; he
      mused, &ldquo;He&rsquo;d reach that moon down, and go chalking &lsquo;Peace&rsquo; with it on
      every door of every house, all over Europe. But Christ&rsquo;s not real, and
      Hindenburg and Harmsworth are!&rdquo; As real they were as two great bulls he
      had once seen in South Africa, fighting. He seemed to hear again the stamp
      and snort and crash of those thick skulls, to see the beasts recoiling and
      driving at each other, and the little red eyes of them. And pulling a
      letter out of his pocket, he read it again by the light of the moon:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;15, Camelot Mansions,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. John&rsquo;s Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MR. FORT, &ldquo;I came across your Club address to-night, looking at some
      old letters. Did you know that I was in London? I left Steenbok when my
      husband died, five years ago. I&rsquo;ve had a simply terrific time since. While
      the German South West campaign was on I was nursing out there, but came
      back about a year ago to lend a hand here. It would be awfully nice to
      meet you again, if by any chance you are in England. I&rsquo;m working in a V.
      A. D. hospital in these parts, but my evenings are usually free. Do you
      remember that moonlit night at grape harvest? The nights here aren&rsquo;t
      scented quite like that. Listerine! Oh! This war! &ldquo;With all good
      remembrances,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;LEILA LYNCH.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A terrific time! If he did not mistake, Leila Lynch had always had a
      terrific time. And he smiled, seeing again the stoep of an old Dutch house
      at High Constantia, and a woman sitting there under the white flowers of a
      sweet-scented creeper&mdash;a pretty woman, with eyes which could put a
      spell on you, a woman he would have got entangled with if he had not cut
      and run for it! Ten years ago, and here she was again, refreshing him out
      of the past. He sniffed the fragrance of the little letter. How everybody
      always managed to work into a letter what they were doing in the war! If
      he answered her he would be sure to say: &ldquo;Since I got lamed, I&rsquo;ve been at
      the War Office, working on remounts, and a dull job it is!&rdquo; Leila Lynch!
      Women didn&rsquo;t get younger, and he suspected her of being older than
      himself. But he remembered agreeably her white shoulders and that turn of
      her neck when she looked at you with those big grey eyes of hers. Only a
      five-day acquaintanceship, but they had crowded much into it as one did in
      a strange land. The episode had been a green and dangerous spot, like one
      of those bright mossy bits of bog when you were snipe-shooting, to set
      foot on which was to let you down up to the neck, at least. Well, there
      was none of that danger now, for her husband was dead-poor chap! It would
      be nice, in these dismal days, when nobody spent any time whatever except
      in the service of the country, to improve his powers of service by a few
      hours&rsquo; recreation in her society. &lsquo;What humbugs we are!&rsquo; he thought: &lsquo;To
      read the newspapers and the speeches you&rsquo;d believe everybody thought of
      nothing but how to get killed for the sake of the future. Drunk on
      verbiage! What heads and mouths we shall all have when we wake up some
      fine morning with Peace shining in at the window! Ah! If only we could;
      and enjoy ourselves again!&rsquo; And he gazed at the moon. She was dipping
      already, reeling away into the dawn. Water carts and street sweepers had
      come out into the glimmer; sparrows twittered in the eaves. The city was
      raising a strange unknown face to the grey light, shuttered and deserted
      as Babylon. Jimmy Fort tapped out his pipe, sighed, and got into bed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Coming off duty at that very moment, Leila Lynch decided to have her
      hour&rsquo;s walk before she went home. She was in charge of two wards, and as a
      rule took the day watches; but some slight upset had given her this extra
      spell. She was, therefore, at her worst, or perhaps at her best, after
      eighteen hours in hospital. Her cheeks were pale, and about her eyes were
      little lines, normally in hiding. There was in this face a puzzling blend
      of the soft and hard, for the eyes, the rather full lips, and pale cheeks,
      were naturally soft; but they were hardened by the self-containment which
      grows on women who have to face life for themselves, and, conscious of
      beauty, intend to keep it, in spite of age. Her figure was contradictory,
      also; its soft modelling a little too rigidified by stays. In this desert
      of the dawn she let her long blue overcoat flap loose, and swung her hat
      on a finger, so that her light-brown, touched-up hair took the morning
      breeze with fluffy freedom. Though she could not see herself, she
      appreciated her appearance, swaying along like that, past lonely trees and
      houses. A pity there was no one to see her in that round of Regent&rsquo;s Park,
      which took her the best part of an hour, walking in meditation, enjoying
      the colour coming back into the world, as if especially for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was character in Leila Lynch, and she had lived an interesting life
      from a certain point of view. In her girlhood she had fluttered the hearts
      of many besides Cousin Edward Pierson, and at eighteen had made a
      passionate love match with a good-looking young Indian civilian, named
      Fane. They had loved each other to a standstill in twelve months. Then had
      begun five years of petulance, boredom, and growing cynicism, with
      increasing spells of Simla, and voyages home for her health which was
      really harmed by the heat. All had culminated, of course, in another
      passion for a rifleman called Lynch. Divorce had followed, remarriage, and
      then the Boer War, in which he had been badly wounded. She had gone out
      and nursed him back to half his robust health, and, at twenty-eight, taken
      up life with him on an up-country farm in Cape Colony. This middle period
      had lasted ten years, between the lonely farm and an old Dutch house at
      High Constantia. Lynch was not a bad fellow, but, like most soldiers of
      the old Army, had been quite carefully divested of an aesthetic sense. And
      it was Leila&rsquo;s misfortune to have moments when aesthetic sense seemed
      necessary. She had struggled to overcome this weakness, and that other
      weakness of hers&mdash;a liking for men&rsquo;s admiration; but there had
      certainly been intervals when she had not properly succeeded. Her
      acquaintance with Jimmy Fort had occurred during one of these intervals,
      and when he went back to England so abruptly, she had been feeling very
      tenderly towards him. She still remembered him with a certain pleasure.
      Before Lynch died, these &ldquo;intervals&rdquo; had been interrupted by a spell of
      returning warmth for the invalided man to whom she had joined her life
      under the romantic conditions of divorce. He had failed, of course, as a
      farmer, and his death left her with nothing but her own settled income of
      a hundred and fifty pounds a year. Faced by the prospect of having almost
      to make her living, at thirty-eight, she felt but momentary dismay&mdash;for
      she had real pluck. Like many who have played with amateur theatricals,
      she fancied herself as an actress; but, after much effort, found that only
      her voice and the perfect preservation of her legs were appreciated by the
      discerning managers and public of South Africa; and for three chequered
      years she made face against fortune with the help of them, under an
      assumed name. What she did&mdash;keeping a certain bloom of refinement,
      was far better than the achievements of many more respectable ladies in
      her shoes. At least she never bemoaned her &ldquo;reduced circumstances,&rdquo; and if
      her life was irregular and had at least three episodes, it was very human.
      She bravely took the rough with the smooth, never lost the power of
      enjoying herself, and grew in sympathy with the hardships of others. But
      she became deadly tired. When the war broke out, remembering that she was
      a good nurse, she took her real name again and a change of occupation. For
      one who liked to please men, and to be pleased by them, there was a
      certain attraction about that life in war-time; and after two years of it
      she could still appreciate the way her Tommies turned their heads to look
      at her when she passed their beds. But in a hard school she had learned
      perfect self-control; and though the sour and puritanical perceived her
      attraction, they knew her to be forty-three. Besides, the soldiers liked
      her; and there was little trouble in her wards. The war moved her in
      simple ways; for she was patriotic in the direct fashion of her class. Her
      father had been a sailor, her husbands an official and a soldier; the
      issue for her was uncomplicated by any abstract meditation. The Country
      before everything! And though she had tended during those two years so
      many young wrecked bodies, she had taken it as all in the a day&rsquo;s work,
      lavishing her sympathy on the individual, without much general sense of
      pity and waste. Yes, she had worked really hard, had &ldquo;done her bit&rdquo;; but
      of late she had felt rising within her the old vague craving for &ldquo;life,&rdquo;
       for pleasure, for something more than the mere negative admiration
      bestowed on her by her &ldquo;Tommies.&rdquo; Those old letters&mdash;to look them
      through them had been a sure sign of this vague craving&mdash;had
      sharpened to poignancy the feeling that life was slipping away from her
      while she was still comely. She had been long out of England, and so
      hard-worked since she came back that there were not many threads she could
      pick up suddenly. Two letters out of that little budget of the past, with
      a far cry between them, had awakened within her certain sentimental
      longings.

    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR LADY OF THE STARRY FLOWERS,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exiturus (sic) to saluto! The tender carries you this message of
      good-bye. Simply speaking, I hate leaving South Africa. And of all my
      memories, the last will live the longest. Grape harvest at Constantia, and
      you singing: &lsquo;If I could be the falling dew: If ever you and your husband
      come to England, do let me know, that I may try and repay a little the
      happiest five days I&rsquo;ve spent out here.

    <p>

      &ldquo;TIMMY FORT.&rdquo;

    <p>
      She remembered a very brown face, a tall slim figure, and something
      gallant about the whole of him. What was he like after ten years?
      Grizzled, married, with a large family? An odious thing&mdash;Time! And
      Cousin Edward&rsquo;s little yellow letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good heavens! Twenty-six years ago&mdash;before he was a parson, or
      married or anything! Such a good partner, really musical; a queer, dear
      fellow, devoted, absentminded, easily shocked, yet with flame burning in
      him somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR LEILA,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After our last dance I went straight off&rsquo;&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t go in. I went
      down to the river, and walked along the bank; it was beautiful, all grey
      and hazy, and the trees whispered, and the cows looked holy; and I walked
      along and thought of you. And a farmer took me for a lunatic, in my dress
      clothes. Dear Leila, you were so pretty last night, and I did love our
      dances. I hope you are not tired, and that I shall see you soon again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your affectionate cousin,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;EDWARD PIERSON.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he had gone and become a parson, and married, and been a widower
      fifteen years. She remembered the death of his wife, just before she left
      for South Africa, at that period of disgrace when she had so shocked her
      family by her divorce. Poor Edward&mdash;quite the nicest of her cousins!
      The only one she would care to see again. He would be very old and
      terribly good and proper, by now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her wheel of Regent&rsquo;s Park was coming full circle, and the sun was up
      behind the houses, but still no sound of traffic stirred. She stopped
      before a flower-bed where was some heliotrope, and took a long, luxurious
      sniff: She could not resist plucking a sprig, too, and holding it to her
      nose. A sudden want of love had run through every nerve and fibre of her;
      she shivered, standing there with her eyes half closed, above the pale
      violet blossom. Then, noting by her wrist-watch that it was four o&rsquo;clock,
      she hurried on, to get to her bed, for she would have to be on duty again
      at noon. Oh! the war! She was tired! If only it were over, and one could
      live!...
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere by Twickenham the moon had floated down; somewhere up from
      Kentish Town the sun came soaring; wheels rolled again, and the seven
      million sleepers in their million houses woke from morning sleep to that
      same thought....

    <p>
      Edward Pierson, dreaming over an egg at breakfast, opened a letter in a
      handwriting which he did not recognise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;V. A. D. Hospital,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mulberry Road, St. John&rsquo;s Wood N. W.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR COUSIN EDWARD,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember me, or have I gone too far into the shades of night? I
      was Leila Pierson once upon a time, and I often think of you and wonder
      what you are like now, and what your girls are like. I have been here
      nearly a year, working for our wounded, and for a year before that was
      nursing in South Africa. My husband died five years ago out there. Though
      we haven&rsquo;t met for I dare not think how long, I should awfully like to see
      you again. Would you care to come some day and look over my hospital? I
      have two wards under me; our men are rather dears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your forgotten but still affectionate cousin
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;LEILA LYNCH.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. S. I came across a little letter you once wrote me; it brought back
      old days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No! He had not forgotten. There was a reminder in the house. And he looked
      up at Noel sitting opposite. How like the eyes were! And he thought: &lsquo;I
      wonder what Leila has become. One mustn&rsquo;t be uncharitable. That man is
      dead; she has been nursing two years. She must be greatly changed; I
      should certainly like to see her. I will go!&rsquo; Again he looked at Noel.
      Only yesterday she had renewed her request to be allowed to begin her
      training as a nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see a hospital to-day, Nollie,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if you like, I&rsquo;ll
      make enquiries. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;ll mean you have to begin by washing up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; anything, so long as I do begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; I&rsquo;ll see about it.&rdquo; And he went back to his egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel&rsquo;s voice roused him. &ldquo;Do you feel the war much, Daddy? Does it hurt
      you here?&rdquo; She had put her hand on her heart. &ldquo;Perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t, because
      you live half in the next world, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words: &ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo; sprang to Pierson&rsquo;s lips; he did not speak them,
      but put his egg-spoon down, hurt and bewildered. What did the child mean?
      Not feel the war! He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m able to help people sometimes, Nollie,&rdquo; and was conscious that
      he had answered his own thoughts, not her words. He finished his breakfast
      quickly, and very soon went out. He crossed the Square, and passed East,
      down two crowded streets to his church. In the traffic of those streets,
      all slipshod and confused, his black-clothed figure and grave face, with
      its Vandyk beard, had a curious remote appearance, like a moving remnant
      of a past civilisation. He went in by the side door. Only five days he had
      been away, but they had been so full of emotion that the empty familiar
      building seemed almost strange to him. He had come there unconsciously,
      groping for anchorage and guidance in this sudden change of relationship
      between him and his daughters. He stood by the pale brazen eagle, staring
      into the chancel. The choir were wanting new hymn-books&mdash;he must not
      forget to order them! His eyes sought the stained-glass window he had put
      in to the memory of his wife. The sun, too high to slant, was burnishing
      its base, till it glowed of a deep sherry colour. &ldquo;In the next world!&rdquo;
       What strange words of Noel&rsquo;s! His eyes caught the glimmer of the
      organ-pipes; and, mounting to the loft, he began to play soft chords
      wandering into each other. He finished, and stood gazing down. This space
      within high walls, under high vaulted roof, where light was toned to a
      perpetual twilight, broken here and there by a little glow of colour from
      glass and flowers, metal, and dark wood, was his home, his charge, his
      refuge. Nothing moved down there, and yet&mdash;was not emptiness
      mysteriously living, the closed-in air imprinted in strange sort, as
      though the drone of music and voices in prayer and praise clung there
      still? Had not sanctity a presence? Outside, a barrel-organ drove its tune
      along; a wagon staggered on the paved street, and the driver shouted to
      his horses; some distant guns boomed out in practice, and the rolling of
      wheels on wheels formed a net of sound. But those invading noises were
      transmuted to a mere murmuring in here; only the silence and the twilight
      were real to Pierson, standing there, a little black figure in a great
      empty space.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he left the church, it was still rather early to go to Leila&rsquo;s
      hospital; and, having ordered the new hymn-books, he called in at the
      house of a parishioner whose son had been killed in France. He found her
      in her kitchen; an oldish woman who lived by charing. She wiped a seat for
      the Vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just makin&rsquo; meself a cup o&rsquo; tea, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! What a comfort tea is, Mrs. Soles!&rdquo; And he sat down, so that she
      should feel &ldquo;at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it gives me &lsquo;eart-burn; I take eight or ten cups a day, now. I take
      &lsquo;em strong, too. I don&rsquo;t seem able to get on without it. I &lsquo;ope the young
      ladies are well, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, thank you. Miss Noel is going to begin nursing, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deary-me! She&rsquo;s very young; but all the young gells are doin&rsquo; something
      these days. I&rsquo;ve got a niece in munitions-makin&rsquo; a pretty penny she is.
      I&rsquo;ve been meanin&rsquo; to tell you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t come to church now; since my
      son was killed, I don&rsquo;t seem to &lsquo;ave the &lsquo;eart to go anywhere&mdash;&rsquo;aven&rsquo;t
      been to a picture-palace these three months. Any excitement starts me
      cryin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; but you&rsquo;d find rest in church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Soles shook her head, and the small twisted bob of her discoloured
      hair wobbled vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take any recreation,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather sit &lsquo;ere, or be at
      work. My son was a real son to me. This tea&rsquo;s the only thing that does me
      any good. I can make you a fresh cup in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Soles, but I must be getting on. We must all look forward
      to meeting our beloved again, in God&rsquo;s mercy. And one of these days soon I
      shall be seeing you in church, shan&rsquo;t I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Soles shifted her weight from one slippered foot to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! let&rsquo;s &lsquo;ope so,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I dunno when I shall &lsquo;ave the
      spirit. Good day, sir, and thank you kindly for calling, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson walked away with a very faint smile. Poor queer old soul!&mdash;she
      was no older than himself, but he thought of her as ancient&mdash;cut off
      from her son, like so many&mdash;so many; and how good and patient! The
      melody of an anthem began running in his head. His fingers moved on the
      air beside him, and he stood still, waiting for an omnibus to take him to
      St. John&rsquo;s Wood. A thousand people went by while he was waiting, but he
      did not notice them, thinking of that anthem, of his daughters, and the
      mercy of God; and on the top of his &lsquo;bus, when it came along, he looked
      lonely and apart, though the man beside him was so fat that there was
      hardly any seat left to sit on. Getting down at Lord&rsquo;s Cricket-ground, he
      asked his way of a lady in a nurse&rsquo;s dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll come with me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Do you happen to know a Mrs. Lynch who nurses&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mrs. Lynch. Why, you&rsquo;re Edward Pierson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked into her face, which he had not yet observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leila!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Leila! How awfully nice of you to come, Edward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They continued to stand, searching each for the other&rsquo;s youth, till she
      murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of your beard, I should have known you anywhere!&rdquo; But she
      thought: &lsquo;Poor Edward! He is old, and monk-like!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Pierson, in answer, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very little changed, Leila! We haven&rsquo;t, seen each other since my
      youngest girl was born. She&rsquo;s just a little like you.&rdquo; But he thought: &lsquo;My
      Nollie! So much more dewy; poor Leila!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on, talking of his daughters, till they reached the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll wait here a minute, I&rsquo;ll take you over my wards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had left him in a bare hall, holding his hat in one hand and touching
      his gold cross with the other; but she soon came hack, and a little warmth
      crept about his heart. How works of mercy suited women! She looked so
      different, so much softer, beneath the white coif, with a white apron over
      the bluish frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the change in his face, a little warmth crept about Leila, too, just
      where the bib of her apron stopped; and her eyes slid round at him while
      they went towards what had once been a billiard-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My men are dears,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;they love to be talked to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under a skylight six beds jutted out from a green distempered wall,
      opposite to six beds jutting out from another green distempered wall, and
      from each bed a face was turned towards them young faces, with but little
      expression in them. A nurse, at the far end, looked round, and went on
      with her work. The sight of the ward was no more new to Pierson than to
      anyone else in these days. It was so familiar, indeed, that it had
      practically no significance. He stood by the first bed, and Leila stood
      alongside. The man smiled up when she spoke, and did not smile when he
      spoke, and that again was familiar to him. They passed from bed to bed,
      with exactly the same result, till she was called away, and he sat down by
      a young soldier with a long, very narrow head and face, and a heavily
      bandaged shoulder. Touching the bandage reverently, Pierson said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear fellow-still bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied the soldier. &ldquo;Shrapnel wound: It&rsquo;s cut the flesh properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not the spirit, I can see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young soldier gave him a quaint look, as much as to say: &ldquo;Not &lsquo;arf
      bad!&rdquo; and a gramophone close to the last bed began to play: &ldquo;God bless
      Daddy at the war!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you fond of music?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like it well enough. Passes the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the time hangs heavy in hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it hangs a bit &lsquo;eavy; it&rsquo;s just &lsquo;orspital life. I&rsquo;ve been wounded
      before, you see. It&rsquo;s better than bein&rsquo; out there. I expect I&rsquo;ll lose the
      proper use o&rsquo; this arm. I don&rsquo;t worry; I&rsquo;ll get my discharge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got some good nurses here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I like Mrs. Lynch; she&rsquo;s the lady I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you come in together. I see everything &lsquo;ere. I think a lot, too.
      Passes the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they let you smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! They let us smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have one of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young soldier smiled for the first time. &ldquo;Thank you; I&rsquo;ve got plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse came by, and smiled at Pierson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of our blase ones; been in before, haven&rsquo;t you, Simson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson looked at the young man, whose long, narrow face; where one
      sandy-lashed eyelid drooped just a little, seemed armoured with a sort of
      limited omniscience. The gramophone had whirred and grunted into &ldquo;Sidi
      Brahim.&rdquo; The nurse passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Seedy Abram,&rsquo;.rdquo; said the young soldier. &ldquo;The Frenchies sing it; they
      takes it up one after the other, ye know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured Pierson; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s pretty.&rdquo; And his fingers drummed on the
      counterpane, for the tune was new to him. Something seemed to move in the
      young man&rsquo;s face, as if a blind had been drawn up a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind France,&rdquo; he said abruptly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the shells and
      that; but I can&rsquo;t stick the mud. There&rsquo;s a lot o&rsquo; wounded die in the mud;
      can&rsquo;t get up&mdash;smothered.&rdquo; His unwounded arm made a restless movement.
      &ldquo;I was nearly smothered myself. Just managed to keep me nose up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson shuddered. &ldquo;Thank God you did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I didn&rsquo;t like that. I told Mrs. Lynch about that one day when I had
      the fever. She&rsquo;s a nice lady; she&rsquo;s seen a lot of us boys: That mud&rsquo;s not
      right, you know.&rdquo; And again his unwounded arm made that restless movement;
      while the gramophone struck up: &ldquo;The boys in brown.&rdquo; The movement of the
      arm affected Pierson horribly; he rose and, touching the bandaged
      shoulder, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye; I hope you&rsquo;ll soon be quite recovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young soldier&rsquo;s lips twisted in the semblance of a smile; his drooped
      eyelid seemed to try and raise itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson went back to the hall. The sunlight fell in a pool just inside the
      open door, and an uncontrollable impulse made him move into it, so that it
      warmed him up to the waist. The mud! How ugly life was! Life and Death!
      Both ugly! Poor boys! Poor boys!
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice behind him said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! There you are, Edward! Would you like to see the other ward, or shall
      I show you our kitchen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson took her hand impulsively. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing a noble work, Leila. I
      wanted to ask you: Could you arrange for Noel to come and get trained
      here? She wants to begin at once. The fact is, a boy she is attracted to
      has just gone out to the Front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured Leila, and her eyes looked very soft. &ldquo;Poor child! We shall
      be wanting an extra hand next week. I&rsquo;ll see if she could come now. I&rsquo;ll
      speak to our Matron, and let you know to-night.&rdquo; She squeezed his hand
      hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Edward, I&rsquo;m so glad to see you again. You&rsquo;re the first of our family
      I&rsquo;ve seen for sixteen years. I wonder if you&rsquo;d bring Noel to have supper
      at my flat to-night&mdash;Just nothing to eat, you know! It&rsquo;s a tiny
      place. There&rsquo;s a Captain Fort coming; a nice man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson accepted, and as he walked away he thought: &lsquo;Dear Leila! I believe
      it was Providence. She wants sympathy. She wants to feel the past is the
      past. How good women are!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sun, blazing suddenly out of a cloud, shone on his black figure
      and the little gold cross, in the middle of Portland Place.

    <p>
      Men, even if they are not artistic, who have been in strange places and
      known many nooks of the world, get the scenic habit, become open to
      pictorial sensation. It was as a picture or series of pictures that Jimmy
      Fort ever afterwards remembered his first supper at Leila&rsquo;s. He happened
      to have been all day in the open, motoring about to horse farms under a
      hot sun; and Leila&rsquo;s hock cup possessed a bland and subtle strength. The
      scenic sense derived therefrom had a certain poignancy, the more so
      because the tall child whom he met there did not drink it, and her father
      seemed but to wet his lips, so that Leila and he had all the rest. Rather
      a wonderful little scene it made in his mind, very warm, glowing, yet with
      a strange dark sharpness to it, which came perhaps from the black walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flat had belonged to an artist who was at the war. It was but a pocket
      dwelling on the third floor. The two windows of the little square
      sitting-room looked out on some trees and a church. But Leila, who hated
      dining by daylight, had soon drawn curtains of a deep blue over them. The
      picture which Fort remembered was this: A little four-square table of dark
      wood, with a Chinese mat of vivid blue in the centre, whereon stood a
      silver lustre bowl of clove carnations; some greenish glasses with hock
      cup in them; on his left, Leila in a low lilac frock, her neck and
      shoulders very white, her face a little powdered, her eyes large, her lips
      smiling; opposite him a black-clothed padre with a little gold cross, over
      whose thin darkish face, with its grave pointed beard, passed little
      gentle smiles, but whose deep sunk grey eyes were burnt and bright; on his
      right, a girl in a high grey frock, almost white, just hollowed at the
      neck, with full sleeves to the elbow, so that her slim arms escaped; her
      short fair hair a little tumbled; her big grey eyes grave; her full lips
      shaping with a strange daintiness round every word&mdash;and they not
      many; brilliant red shades over golden lights dotting the black walls; a
      blue divan; a little black piano flush with the wall; a dark polished
      floor; four Japanese prints; a white ceiling. He was conscious that his
      own khaki spoiled something as curious and rare as some old Chinese
      tea-chest. He even remembered what they ate; lobster; cold pigeon pie;
      asparagus; St. Ivel cheese; raspberries and cream. He did not remember
      half so well what they talked of, except that he himself told them stories
      of the Boer War, in which he had served in the Yeomanry, and while he was
      telling them, the girl, like a child listening to a fairy-tale, never
      moved her eyes from his face. He remembered that after supper they all
      smoked cigarettes, even the tall child, after the padre had said to her
      mildly, &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; and she had answered: &ldquo;I simply must, Daddy, just one.&rdquo;
       He remembered Leila brewing Turkish coffee&mdash;very good, and how
      beautiful her white arms looked, hovering about the cups. He remembered
      her making the padre sit down at the piano, and play to them. And she and
      the girl on the divan together, side by side, a strange contrast; with
      just as strange a likeness to each other. He always remembered how fine
      and rare that music sounded in the little room, flooding him with a dreamy
      beatitude. Then&mdash;he remembered&mdash;Leila sang, the padre
      standing-by; and the tall child on the divan bending forward over her
      knees, with her chin on her hands. He remembered rather vividly how Leila
      turned her neck and looked up, now at the padre, now at himself; and, all
      through, the delightful sense of colour and warmth, a sort of glamour over
      all the evening; and the lingering pressure of Leila&rsquo;s hand when he said
      good-bye and they went away, for they all went together. He remembered
      talking a great deal to the padre in the cab, about the public school they
      had both been at, and thinking: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a good padre&mdash;this!&rsquo; He
      remembered how their taxi took them to an old Square which he did not
      know, where the garden trees looked densely black in the starshine. He
      remembered that a man outside the house had engaged the padre in earnest
      talk, while the tall child and himself stood in the open doorway, where
      the hall beyond was dark. Very exactly he remembered the little
      conversation which then took place between them, while they waited for her
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it very horrid in the trenches, Captain Fort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Pierson; it is very horrid, as a rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it dangerous all the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do officers run more risks than the men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless there&rsquo;s an attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there attacks very often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had seemed to him so strangely primitive a little catechism, that he
      had smiled. And, though it was so dark, she had seen that smile, for her
      face went proud and close all of a sudden. He had cursed himself, and said
      gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a brother out there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But someone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Someone! He had heard that answer with a little shock. This child&mdash;this
      fairy princess of a child already to have someone! He wondered if she went
      about asking everyone these questions, with that someone in her thoughts.
      Poor child! And quickly he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, look at me! I was out there a year, and here I am with only
      half a game leg; times were a lot worse, then, too. I often wish I were
      back there. Anything&rsquo;s better than London and the War Office.&rdquo; But just
      then he saw the padre coming, and took her hand. &ldquo;Good night, Miss
      Pierson. Don&rsquo;t worry. That does no good, and there isn&rsquo;t half the risk you
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand stirred, squeezed his gratefully, as a child&rsquo;s would squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;thank you awfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in the dark cab again, he remembered thinking: &lsquo;Fancy that child! A
      jolly lucky boy, out there! Too bad! Poor little fairy princess!&rsquo;

      To wash up is not an exciting operation. To wash up in August became for
      Noel a process which taxed her strength and enthusiasm. She combined it
      with other forms of instruction in the art of nursing, had very little
      leisure, and in the evenings at home would often fall asleep curled up in
      a large chintz-covered chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      George and Gratian had long gone back to their respective hospitals, and
      she and her father had the house to themselves. She received many letters
      from Cyril which she carried about with her and read on her way to and
      from the hospital; and every other day she wrote to him. He was not yet in
      the firing line; his letters were descriptive of his men, his food, or the
      natives, or reminiscent of Kestrel; hers descriptive of washing up, or
      reminiscent of Kestrel. But in both there was always some little word of
      the longing within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was towards the end of August when she had the letter which said that
      he had been moved up. From now on he would be in hourly danger! That
      evening after dinner she did not go to sleep in the chair, but sat under
      the open window, clenching her hands, and reading &ldquo;Pride and Prejudice&rdquo;
       without understanding a word. While she was so engaged her father came up
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Fort, Nollie. Will you give him some coffee? I&rsquo;m afraid I must go
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Noel looked at her visitor drinking his coffee. He had
      been out there, too, and he was alive; with only a little limp. The
      visitor smiled and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you thinking about when we came in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any news of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel frowned, she hated to show her feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! he&rsquo;s gone to the Front. Won&rsquo;t you have a cigarette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want one awfully. I think sitting still and waiting is more dreadful
      than anything in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except, knowing that others are waiting. When I was out there I used to
      worry horribly over my mother. She was ill at the time. The cruelest thing
      in war is the anxiety of people about each other&mdash;nothing touches
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words exactly summed up Noel&rsquo;s hourly thought. He said nice things,
      this man with the long legs and the thin brown bumpy face!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were a man,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think women have much the worst time
      in the war. Is your mother old?&rdquo; But of course she was old why he was old
      himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She died last Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lost your mother when you were a babe, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s her portrait.&rdquo; At the end of the room, hanging on a strip of
      black velvet was a pastel, very faint in colouring, as though faded, of a
      young woman, with an eager, sweet face, dark eyes, and bent a little
      forward, as if questioning her painter. Fort went up to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bit like you. But she must have been a very sweet woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sort of presence in the room. I wish I were like her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort turned. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;no. Better as you are. It would only have
      spoiled a complete thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no. I get a devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Why, you&rsquo;re out of a fairy-tale!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes from Daddy&mdash;only he doesn&rsquo;t know, because he&rsquo;s a perfect
      saint; but I know he&rsquo;s had a devil somewhere, or he couldn&rsquo;t be the saint
      he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Fort. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very deep: and I believe it&rsquo;s true&mdash;the
      saints did have devils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Daddy&rsquo;s devil has been dead ages. It&rsquo;s been starved out of him, I
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your devil ever get away with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel felt her cheeks growing red under his stare, and she turned to the
      window:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s a real devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vividly there had come before her the dark Abbey, and the moon balancing
      over the top of the crumbling wall, and the white owl flying across. And,
      speaking to the air, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes you do things that you want to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wondered if he would laugh&mdash;it sounded so silly. But he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And damn the consequences? I know. It&rsquo;s rather a jolly thing to have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel shook her head. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Daddy coming back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stay. Good night; and don&rsquo;t worry too much, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kept her hand rather a long time, and gave it a hard squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t worry! What advice! Ah! if she could see Cyril just for a minute!
    </p>
    <p>
      2
    </p>
    <p>
      In September, 1916, Saturday still came before Sunday, in spite of the
      war. For Edward Pierson this Saturday had been a strenuous day, and even
      now, at nearly midnight, he was still conning his just-completed sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A patriot of patriots, he had often a passionate longing to resign his
      parish, and go like his curate for a chaplain at the Front. It seemed to
      him that people must think his life idle and sheltered and useless. Even
      in times of peace he had been sensitive enough to feel the cold draughty
      blasts which the Church encounters in a material age. He knew that nine
      people out of ten looked on him as something of a parasite, with no real
      work in the world. And since he was nothing if not conscientious, he
      always worked himself to the bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day he had risen at half-past six, and after his bath and exercises,
      had sat down to his sermon&mdash;for, even now, he wrote a new sermon once
      a month, though he had the fruits of twenty-six years to choose from.
      True, these new sermons were rather compiled than written, because, bereft
      of his curate, he had not time enough for fresh thought on old subjects.
      At eight he had breakfasted with Noel, before she went off to her
      hospital, whence she would return at eight in the evening. Nine to ten was
      his hour for seeing parishioners who had troubles, or wanted help or
      advice, and he had received three to-day who all wanted help, which he had
      given. From ten to eleven he had gone back to his sermon, and had spent
      from eleven to one at his church, attending to small matters, writing
      notices, fixing hymns, holding the daily half-hour Service instituted
      during wartime, to which but few ever came. He had hurried back to lunch,
      scamping it so that he might get to his piano for an hour of
      forgetfulness. At three he had christened a very noisy baby, and been
      detained by its parents who wished for information on a variety of topics.
      At half-past four he had snatched a cup of tea, reading the paper; and had
      spent from five to seven visiting two Parish Clubs, and those whose
      war-pension matters he had in hand, and filling up forms which would be
      kept in official places till such time as the system should be changed and
      a fresh set of forms issued. From seven to eight he was at home again, in
      case his flock wanted to see him; to-day four sheep had come, and gone
      away, he was afraid, but little the wiser. From half-past eight to
      half-past nine he had spent in choir practice, because the organist was on
      his holiday. Slowly in the cool of the evening he had walked home, and
      fallen asleep in his chair on getting in. At eleven he had woken with a
      start, and, hardening his heart, had gone back to his sermon. And now, at
      nearly midnight, it was still less than twenty minutes long. He lighted
      one of his rare cigarettes, and let thought wander. How beautiful those
      pale pink roses were in that old silver bowl-like a little strange poem,
      or a piece of Debussy music, or a Mathieu Maris picture-reminding him
      oddly of the word Leila. Was he wrong in letting Noel see so much of
      Leila? But then she was so improved&mdash;dear Leila!... The pink roses
      were just going to fall! And yet how beautiful!... It was quiet to-night;
      he felt very drowsy.... Did Nollie still think of that young man, or had
      it passed? She had never confided in him since! After the war, it would be
      nice to take her to Italy, to all the little towns. They would see the
      Assisi of St. Francis. The Little Flowers of St. Francis. The Little
      Flowers!... His hand dropped, the cigarette went out. He slept with his
      face in shadow. Slowly into the silence of his sleep little sinister
      sounds intruded. Short concussions, dragging him back out of that deep
      slumber. He started up. Noel was standing at the door, in a long coat. She
      said in her calm voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zeps, Daddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear. Where are the maids?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An Irish voice answered from the hall: &ldquo;Here, sir; trustin&rsquo; in God; but
      &lsquo;tis better on the ground floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw a huddle of three figures, queerly costumed, against the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Yes, Bridgie; you&rsquo;re safe down here.&rdquo; Then he noticed that Noel was
      gone. He followed her out into the Square, alive with faces faintly
      luminous in the darkness, and found her against the garden railings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come back in, Nollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Cyril has this every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood beside her; not loth, for excitement had begun to stir his blood.
      They stayed there for some minutes, straining their eyes for sight of
      anything save the little zagged splashes of bursting shrapnel, while
      voices buzzed, and muttered: &ldquo;Look! There! There! There it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the seers had eyes of greater faith than Pierson&rsquo;s, for he saw
      nothing: He took her arm at last, and led her in. In the hall she broke
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up on the roof, Daddy!&rdquo; and ran upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he followed, mounting by a ladder, through a trapdoor on to the
      roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s splendid up here!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see her eyes blazing, and thought: &lsquo;How my child does love
      excitement&mdash;it&rsquo;s almost terrible!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the wide, dark, star-strewn sky travelling searchlights, were
      lighting up the few little clouds; the domes and spires rose from among
      the spread-out roofs, all fine and ghostly. The guns had ceased firing, as
      though puzzled. One distant bang rumbled out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bomb! Oh! If we could only get one of the Zeps!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A furious outburst of firing followed, lasting perhaps a minute, then
      ceased as if by magic. They saw two searchlights converge and meet right
      overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s above us!&rdquo; murmured Noel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson put his arm round her waist. &lsquo;She feels no fear!&rsquo; he thought. The
      search-lights switched apart; and suddenly, from far away, came a
      confusion of weird sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? They&rsquo;re cheering. Oh! Daddy, look!&rdquo; There in the heavens,
      towards the east, hung a dull red thing, lengthening as they gazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got it. It&rsquo;s on fire! Hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the dark firmament that fiery orange shape began canting downward;
      and the cheering swelled in a savage frenzy of sound. And Pierson&rsquo;s arm
      tightened on her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bright oblong seemed to break and spread, tilted down below the level
      of the roofs; and suddenly the heavens flared, as if some huge jug of
      crimson light had been flung out on them. Something turned over in
      Pierson&rsquo;s heart; he flung up his hand to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor men in it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel&rsquo;s voice answered, hard and pitiless:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They needn&rsquo;t have come. They&rsquo;re murderers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, they were murderers&mdash;but how terrible! And he stood quivering,
      with his hands pressed to his face, till the cheering had died out into
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pray, Nollie!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;O God, Who in Thy great mercy hath
      delivered us from peril, take into Thy keeping the souls of these our
      enemies, consumed by Thy wrath before our eyes; give us the power to pity
      them&mdash;men like ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But even while he prayed he could see Noel&rsquo;s face flame-white in the
      darkness; and, as that glow in the sky faded out, he felt once more the
      thrill of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went down to tell the maids, and for some time after sat up together,
      talking over what they had seen, eating biscuits and drinking milk, which
      they warmed on an etna. It was nearly two o&rsquo;clock before they went to bed.
      Pierson fell asleep at once, and never turned till awakened at half-past
      six by his alarum. He had Holy Communion to administer at eight, and he
      hurried to get early to his church and see that nothing untoward had
      happened to it. There it stood in the sunlight; tall, grey, quiet,
      unharmed, with bell gently ringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      3
    </p>
    <p>
      And at that hour Cyril Morland, under the parapet of his trench,
      tightening his belt, was looking at his wrist-watch for the hundredth
      time, calculating exactly where he meant to put foot and hand for the
      going over: &lsquo;I absolutely mustn&rsquo;t let those chaps get in front of me,&rsquo; he
      thought. So many yards before the first line of trenches, so many yards to
      the second line, and there stop. So his rehearsals had gone; it was the
      performance now! Another minute before the terrific racket of the
      drum-fire should become the curtain-fire, which would advance before them.
      He ran his eye down the trench. The man next him was licking his two first
      fingers, as if he might be going to bowl at cricket. Further down, a man
      was feeling his puttees. A voice said: &ldquo;Wot price the orchestra nah!&rdquo; He
      saw teeth gleam in faces burnt almost black. Then he looked up; the sky
      was blue beyond the brownish film of dust raised by the striking shells.
      Noel! Noel! Noel!... He dug his fingers deep into the left side of his
      tunic till he could feel the outline of her photograph between his
      dispatch-case and his heart. His heart fluttered just as it used when he
      was stretched out with hand touching the ground, before the start of the
      &ldquo;hundred yards&rdquo; at school. Out of the corner of his eye he caught the
      flash of a man&rsquo;s &ldquo;briquet&rdquo; lighting a cigarette. All right for those
      chaps, but not for him; he wanted all his breath&mdash;this rifle, and kit
      were handicap enough! Two days ago he had been reading in some paper how
      men felt just before an attack. And now he knew. He just felt nervous. If
      only the moment would come, and get itself over! For all the thought he
      gave to the enemy there might have been none&mdash;nothing but shells and
      bullets, with lives of their own. He heard the whistle; his foot was on
      the spot he had marked down; his hand where he had seen it; he called out:
      &ldquo;Now, boys!&rdquo; His head was over the top, his body over; he was conscious of
      someone falling, and two men neck and neck beside him. Not to try and run,
      not to break out of a walk; to go steady, and yet keep ahead! D&mdash;n
      these holes! A bullet tore through his sleeve, grazing his arm&mdash;a
      red-hot sensation, like the touch of an iron. A British shell from close
      over his head burst sixty yards ahead; he stumbled, fell flat, picked
      himself up. Three ahead of him now! He walked faster, and drew alongside.
      Two of them fell. &lsquo;What luck!&rsquo; he thought; and gripping his rifle harder,
      pitched headlong into a declivity. Dead bodies lay there! The first German
      trench line, and nothing alive in it, nothing to clean up, nothing of it
      left! He stopped, getting his wind; watching the men panting and stumbling
      in. The roar of the guns was louder than ever again, barraging the second
      line. So far, good! And here was his captain!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready, boys? On, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time he moved more slowly still, over terrible going, all holes and
      hummocks. Half consciously he took cover all he could. The air was alive
      with the whistle from machine-gun fire storming across zigzag
      fashion-alive it was with bullets, dust, and smoke. &lsquo;How shall I tell
      her?&rsquo; he thought. There would be nothing to tell but just a sort of jagged
      brown sensation. He kept his eyes steadily before him, not wanting to
      seethe men falling, not wanting anything to divert him from getting there.
      He felt the faint fanning of the passing bullets. The second line must be
      close now. Why didn&rsquo;t that barrage lift? Was this new dodge of firing till
      the last second going to do them in? Another hundred yards and he would be
      bang into it. He flung himself flat and waited; looking at his wrist-watch
      he noted that his arm was soaked with blood. He thought: &lsquo;A wound! Now I
      shall go home. Thank God! Oh, Noel!&rsquo; The passing bullets whirled above
      him; he could hear them even through the screech and thunder of the
      shell-fire. &lsquo;The beastly things!&rsquo; he thought: A voice beside him gasped
      out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lifted, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called: &ldquo;Come on, boys!&rdquo; and went forward, stooping. A bullet struck
      his rifle. The shock made him stagger and sent an electric shock spinning
      up his arm. &lsquo;Luck again!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;Now for it! I haven&rsquo;t seen a German
      yet!&rsquo; He leaped forward, spun round, flung up his arms, and fell on his
      back, shot through and through....
    </p>
    <p>
      The position was consolidated, as they say, and in the darkness
      stretcher-bearers were out over the half-mile. Like will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps,
      with their shaded lanterns, they moved, hour after hour, slowly quartering
      the black honeycomb which lay behind the new British line. Now and then in
      the light of some star-shell their figures were disclosed, bending and
      raising the forms of the wounded, or wielding pick and shovel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Officer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the shaded lantern, lowered to just above the body, a yellowish glare
      fell on face and breast. The hands of the searcher moved in that little
      pool of light. The bearer who was taking notes bent down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another boy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That all he has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The searcher raised himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just those, and a photo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dispatch-case; pound loose; cigarette-case; wristwatch; photo. Let&rsquo;s see
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The searcher placed the photo in the pool of light. The tiny face of a
      girl stared up at them, unmoved, from its short hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noel,&rdquo; said the searcher, reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Take care of it. Stick it in his case. Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pool of light dissolved, and darkness for ever covered Cyril Morland.

      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      When those four took their seats in the Grand Circle at Queen&rsquo;s Hall the
      programme was already at the second number, which, in spite of all the
      efforts of patriotism, was of German origin&mdash;a Brandenburg concerto
      by Bach. More curious still, it was encored. Pierson did not applaud, he
      was too far gone in pleasure, and sat with a rapt smile on his face,
      oblivious of his surroundings. He remained thus removed from mortal joys
      and sorrows till the last applause had died away, and Leila&rsquo;s voice said
      in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a wonderful audience, Edward? Look at all that khaki. Who&rsquo;d have
      thought those young men cared for music&mdash;good music&mdash;German
      music, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson looked down at the patient mass of standing figures in straw hats
      and military caps, with faces turned all one way, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could get an audience like that in my church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile crept out at the corner of Leila&rsquo;s lips. She was thinking: &lsquo;Ah!
      Your Church is out of date, my dear, and so are you! Your Church, with its
      smell of mould and incense, its stained-glass, and narrowed length and
      droning organ. Poor Edward, so out of the world!&rsquo; But she only pressed his
      arm, and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at Noel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was talking to Jimmy Fort. Her cheeks were gushed, and she looked
      prettier than Pierson had seen her look for a long time now, ever since
      Kestrel, indeed. He heard Leila sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she get news of her boy? Do you remember that May Week, Edward? We
      were very young then; even you were young. That was such a pretty little
      letter you wrote me. I can see you still-wandering in your dress clothes
      along the river, among the &lsquo;holy&rsquo; cows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But her eyes slid round again, watching her other neighbour and the girl.
      A violinist had begun to play the Cesar Franck Sonata. It was Pierson&rsquo;s
      favourite piece of music, bringing him, as it were, a view of heaven, of
      devotional blue air where devout stars were shining in a sunlit noon,
      above ecstatic trees and waters where ecstatic swans were swimming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer world, Mr. Pierson! Fancy those boys having to go back to barrack
      life after listening to that! What&rsquo;s your feeling? Are we moving back to
      the apes? Did we touch top note with that Sonata?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson turned and contemplated his questioner shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Captain Fort, I do not think we are moving back to the apes; if we
      ever came from them. Those boys have the souls of heroes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, sir, perhaps better than you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes,&rdquo; said Pierson humbly, &ldquo;I forgot, of course.&rdquo; But he still looked
      at his neighbour doubtfully. This Captain Fort, who was a friend of
      Leila&rsquo;s, and who had twice been to see them, puzzled him. He had a frank
      face, a frank voice, but queer opinions, or so it seemed to, Pierson&mdash;little
      bits of Moslemism, little bits of the backwoods, and the veldt; queer
      unexpected cynicisms, all sorts of side views on England had lodged in
      him, and he did not hide them. They came from him like bullets, in that
      frank voice, and drilled little holes in the listener. Those critical
      sayings flew so much more poignantly from one who had been through the
      same educational mill as himself, than if they had merely come from some
      rough diamond, some artist, some foreigner, even from a doctor like
      George. And they always made him uncomfortable, like the touch of a
      prickly leaf; they did not amuse him. Certainly Edward Pierson shrank from
      the rough touches of a knock-about philosophy. After all, it was but
      natural that he should.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Noel left after the first part of the concert, parting from the
      other two at the door. He slipped his hand through her arm; and, following
      out those thoughts of his in the concert-hall, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like Captain Fort, Nollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he&rsquo;s a nice man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems a nice man, certainly; he has a nice smile, but strange views,
      I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks the Germans are not much worse than we are; he says that a good
      many of us are bullies too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is the sort of thing I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are we, Daddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A policeman I talked to once said the same. Captain Fort says that very
      few men can stand having power put into their hands without being spoiled.
      He told me some dreadful stories. He says we have no imagination, so that
      we often do things without seeing how brutal they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not perfect, Nollie; but on the whole I think we&rsquo;re a kind people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel was silent a moment, then said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind people often think others are kind too, when they really aren&rsquo;t.
      Captain Fort doesn&rsquo;t make that mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s a little cynical, and a little dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are all people dangerous who don&rsquo;t think like others, Daddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson, incapable of mockery, was not incapable of seeing when he was
      being mocked. He looked at his daughter with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite so bad as that, Nollie; but Mr. Fort is certainly subversive. I
      think perhaps he has seen too many queer sides of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like him the better for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; Pierson answered absently. He had work to do in preparation
      for a Confirmation Class, and sought his study on getting in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel went to the dining-room to drink her hot milk. The curtains were not
      drawn, and bright moonlight was coming in. Without lighting up, she set
      the etna going, and stood looking at the moon-full for the second time
      since she and Cyril had waited for it in the Abbey. And pressing her hands
      to her breast, she shivered. If only she could summon him from the
      moonlight out there; if only she were a witch-could see him, know where he
      was, what doing! For a fortnight now she had received no letter. Every day
      since he had left she had read the casualty lists, with the superstitious
      feeling that to do so would keep him out of them. She took up the Times.
      There was just enough light, and she read the roll of honour&mdash;till
      the moon shone in on her, lying on the floor, with the dropped journal....
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was proud, and soon took grief to her room, as on that night after
      he left her, she had taken love. No sign betrayed to the house her
      disaster; the journal on the floor, and the smell of the burnt milk which
      had boiled over, revealed nothing. After all, she was but one of a
      thousand hearts which spent that moonlit night in agony. Each night, year
      in, year out, a thousand faces were buried in pillows to smother that
      first awful sense of desolation, and grope for the secret spirit-place
      where bereaved souls go, to receive some feeble touch of healing from
      knowledge of each other&rsquo;s trouble....
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning she got up from her sleepless bed, seemed to eat her
      breakfast, and went off to her hospital. There she washed up plates and
      dishes, with a stony face, dark under the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news came to Pierson in a letter from Thirza, received at lunch-time.
      He read it with a dreadful aching. Poor, poor little Nollie! What an awful
      trouble for her! And he, too, went about his work with the nightmare
      thought that he had to break the news to her that evening. Never had he
      felt more lonely, more dreadfully in want of the mother of his children.
      She would have known how to soothe, how to comfort. On her heart the child
      could have sobbed away grief. And all that hour, from seven to eight, when
      he was usually in readiness to fulfil the functions of God&rsquo;s substitute to
      his parishioners, he spent in prayer of his own, for guidance how to
      inflict and heal this blow. When, at last, Noel came, he opened the door
      to her himself, and, putting back the hair from her forehead, said: &ldquo;Come
      in here a moment, my darling!&rdquo; Noel followed him into the study, and sat
      down. &ldquo;I know already, Daddy.&rdquo; Pierson was more dismayed by this stoicism
      than he would have been by any natural out burst. He stood, timidly
      stroking her hair, murmuring to her what he had said to Gratian, and to so
      many others in these days: &ldquo;There is no death; look forward to seeing him
      again; God is merciful&rdquo; And he marvelled at the calmness of that pale face&mdash;so
      young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very brave, my child!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else to be, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there anything I can do for you, Nollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Daddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night.&rdquo; She had already known for twenty-four hours without telling
      him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you prayed, my darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try, Nollie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, try!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be ridiculous, Daddy; you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grievously upset and bewildered, Pierson moved away from her, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look dreadfully tired. Would you like a hot bath, and your dinner in
      bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like some tea; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; And she went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had seen that the tea had gone up to her, he too went out; and,
      moved by a longing for woman&rsquo;s help, took a cab to Leila&rsquo;s flat.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      On leaving the concert Leila and Jimmy Fort had secured a taxi; a vehicle
      which, at night, in wartime, has certain advantages for those who desire
      to become better acquainted. Vibration, sufficient noise, darkness, are
      guaranteed; and all that is lacking for the furtherance of emotion is the
      scent of honeysuckle and roses, or even of the white flowering creeper
      which on the stoep at High Constantia had smelled so much sweeter than
      petrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Leila found herself with Fort in that loneliness to which she had
      been looking forward, she was overcome by an access of nervous silence.
      She had been passing through a strange time for weeks past. Every night
      she examined her sensations without quite understanding them as yet. When
      a woman comes to her age, the world-force is liable to take possession,
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were young, you were beautiful, you still have beauty, you are not,
      cannot be, old. Cling to youth, cling to beauty; take all you can get,
      before your face gets lines and your hair grey; it is impossible that you
      have been loved for the last time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To see Jimmy Fort at the concert, talking to Noel, had brought this
      emotion to a head. She was not of a grudging nature, and could genuinely
      admire Noel, but the idea that Jimmy Fort might also admire disturbed her
      greatly. He must not; it was not fair; he was too old&mdash;besides, the
      girl had her boy; and she had taken care that he should know it. So,
      leaning towards him, while a bare-shouldered young lady sang, she had
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he had whispered back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That had comforted her. She would make him take her home. It was time she
      showed her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, in the cab, resolved to make her feelings known, in sudden
      shyness she found it very difficult. Love, to which for quite three years
      she had been a stranger, was come to life within her. The knowledge was at
      once so sweet, and so disturbing, that she sat with face averted, unable
      to turn the precious minutes to account. They arrived at the flat without
      having done more than agree that the streets were dark, and the moon
      bright. She got out with a sense of bewilderment, and said rather
      desperately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come up and have a cigarette. It&rsquo;s quite early, still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait just a minute,&rdquo; said Leila.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting there with his drink and his cigarette, he stared at some
      sunflowers in a bowl&mdash;Famille Rose&mdash;and waited just ten; smiling
      a little, recalling the nose of the fairy princess, and the dainty way her
      lips shaped the words she spoke. If she had not had that lucky young devil
      of a soldier boy, one would have wanted to buckle her shoes, lay one&rsquo;s
      coat in the mud for her, or whatever they did in fairytales. One would
      have wanted&mdash;ah! what would one not have wanted! Hang that soldier
      boy! Leila said he was twenty-two. By George! how old it made a man feel
      who was rising forty, and tender on the off-fore! No fairy princesses for
      him! Then a whiff of perfume came to his nostrils; and, looking up, he saw
      Leila standing before him, in a long garment of dark silk, whence her
      white arms peeped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another penny? Do you remember these things, Jimmy? The Malay women used
      to wear them in Cape Town. You can&rsquo;t think what a relief it is to get out
      of my slave&rsquo;s dress. Oh! I&rsquo;m so sick of nursing! Jimmy, I want to live
      again a little!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The garment had taken fifteen years off her age, and a gardenia, just
      where the silk crossed on her breast, seemed no whiter than her skin. He
      wondered whimsically whether it had dropped to her out of the dark!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Live?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why! Don&rsquo;t you always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her hands so that the dark silk fell, back from the whole
      length of those white arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t lived for two years. Oh, Jimmy! Help me to live a little!
      Life&rsquo;s so short, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes disturbed him, strained and pathetic; the sight of her arms; the
      scent of the flower disturbed him; he felt his cheeks growing warm, and
      looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped suddenly forward on to her knees at his feet, took his hand,
      pressed it with both of hers, and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love me a little! What else is there? Oh! Jimmy, what else is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with the scent of the flower, crushed by their hands, stirring his
      senses, Fort thought: &lsquo;Ah, what else is there, in these forsaken days?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jimmy Fort, who had a sense of humour, and was in some sort a
      philosopher, the haphazard way life settled things seldom failed to seem
      amusing. But when he walked away from Leila&rsquo;s he was pensive. She was a
      good sort, a pretty creature, a sportswoman, an enchantress; but&mdash;she
      was decidedly mature. And here he was&mdash;involved in helping her to
      &ldquo;live&rdquo;; involved almost alarmingly, for there had been no mistaking the
      fact that she had really fallen in love with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was flattering and sweet. Times were sad, and pleasure scarce, but&mdash;!
      The roving instinct which had kept him, from his youth up, rolling about
      the world, shied instinctively at bonds, however pleasant, the strength
      and thickness of which he could not gauge; or, was it that perhaps for the
      first time in his life he had been peeping into fairyland of late, and
      this affair with Leila was by no means fairyland? He had another reason,
      more unconscious, for uneasiness. His heart, for all his wanderings, was
      soft, he had always found it difficult to hurt anyone, especially anyone
      who did him the honour to love him. A sort of presentiment weighed on him
      while he walked the moonlit streets at this most empty hour, when even the
      late taxis had ceased to run. Would she want him to marry her? Would it be
      his duty, if she did? And then he found himself thinking of the concert,
      and that girl&rsquo;s face, listening to the tales he was telling her. &lsquo;Deuced
      queer world,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;the way things go! I wonder what she would
      think of us, if she knew&mdash;and that good padre! Phew!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made such very slow progress, for fear of giving way in his leg, and
      having to spend the night on a door-step, that he had plenty of time for
      rumination; but since it brought him no confidence whatever, he began at
      last to feel: &lsquo;Well; it might be a lot worse. Take the goods the gods send
      you and don&rsquo;t fuss!&rsquo; And suddenly he remembered with extreme vividness
      that night on the stoep at High Constantia, and thought with dismay: &lsquo;I
      could have plunged in over head and ears then; and now&mdash;I can&rsquo;t!
      That&rsquo;s life all over! Poor Leila! Me miserum, too, perhaps&mdash;who
      knows!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Leila opened her door to Edward Pierson, her eyes were smiling, and
      her lips were soft. She seemed to smile and be soft all over, and she took
      both his hands. Everything was a pleasure to her that day, even the sight
      of this sad face. She was in love and was loved again; had a present and a
      future once more, not only her own full past; and she must finish with
      Edward in half an hour, for Jimmy was coming. She sat down on the divan,
      took his hand in a sisterly way, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Edward; I can see you&rsquo;re in trouble. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noel. The boy she was fond of has been killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Poor child! It&rsquo;s too cruel!&rdquo; Tears started up in her grey eyes,
      and she touched them with a tiny handkerchief. &ldquo;Poor, poor little Noel!
      Was she very fond of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very sudden, short engagement; but I&rsquo;m afraid she takes it desperately
      to heart. I don&rsquo;t know how to comfort her; only a woman could. I came to
      ask you: Do you think she ought to go on with her work? What do you think,
      Leila? I feel lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila, gazing at him, thought: &lsquo;Lost? Yes, you look lost, my poor Edward!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should let her go on,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;it helps; it&rsquo;s the only thing that
      does help. I&rsquo;ll see if I can get them to let her come into the wards. She
      ought to be in touch with suffering and the men; that kitchen work will
      try her awfully just now: Was he very young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They wanted to get married. I was opposed to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila&rsquo;s lip curled ever so little. &lsquo;You would be!&rsquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t bear to think of Nollie giving herself hastily, like that;
      they had only known each other three weeks. It was very hard for me,
      Leila. And then suddenly he was sent to the front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Resentment welled up in Leila. The kill-Joys! As if life didn&rsquo;t kill joy
      fast enough! Her cousin&rsquo;s face at that moment was almost abhorrent to her,
      its gentle perplexed goodness darkened and warped by that monkish look.
      She turned away, glanced at the clock over the hearth, and thought: &lsquo;Yes,
      and he would stop Jimmy and me! He would say: &ldquo;Oh, no! dear Leila&mdash;you
      mustn&rsquo;t love&mdash;it&rsquo;s sin!&rdquo; How I hate that word!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the most dreadful thing in life,&rdquo; she said abruptly, &ldquo;is the way
      people suppress their natural instincts; what they suppress in themselves
      they make other people suppress too, if they can; and that&rsquo;s the cause of
      half the misery in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then at the surprise on his face at this little outburst, whose cause he
      could not know, she added hastily: &ldquo;I hope Noel will get over it quickly,
      and find someone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. If they had been married&mdash;how much worse it would have been.
      Thank God, they weren&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. They would have had an hour of bliss. Even an hour of bliss
      is worth something in these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To those who only believe in this &lsquo;life&mdash;perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ten minutes more!&rsquo; she thought: &lsquo;Oh, why doesn&rsquo;t he go?&rsquo; But at that very
      moment he got up, and instantly her heart went out to him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Edward. If I can help in any way&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try my best
      with Noel to-morrow; and do come to me whenever you feel inclined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took his hand in hers; afraid that he would sit down again, she yet
      could not help a soft glance into his eyes, and a little rush of pitying
      warmth in the pressure of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson smiled; the smile which always made her sorry for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Leila; you&rsquo;re very good and kind to me. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her bosom swelled with relief and compassion; and&mdash;she let him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running upstairs again she thought: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve just time. What shall I put on?
      Poor Edward, poor Noel! What colour does Jimmy like? Oh! Why didn&rsquo;t I keep
      him those ten years ago&mdash;what utter waste!&rsquo; And, feverishly adorning
      herself, she came back to the window, and stood there in the dark to
      watch, while some jasmine which grew below sent up its scent to her.
      &lsquo;Would I marry him?&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;if he asked me? But he won&rsquo;t ask me&mdash;why
      should he now? Besides, I couldn&rsquo;t bear him to feel I wanted position or
      money from him. I only want love&mdash;love&mdash;love!&rsquo; The silent
      repetition of that word gave her a wonderful sense of solidity and
      comfort. So long as she only wanted love, surely he would give it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall figure turned down past the church, coming towards her. It was he!
      And suddenly she bethought herself. She went to the little black piano,
      sat down, and began to sing the song she had sung to him ten years ago:
      &ldquo;If I could be the falling dew and fall on thee all day!&rdquo; She did not even
      look round when he came in, but continued to croon out the words,
      conscious of him just behind her shoulder in the dark. But when she had
      finished, she got up and threw her arms round him, strained him to her,
      and burst into tears on his shoulder; thinking of Noel and that dead boy,
      thinking of the millions of other boys, thinking of her own happiness,
      thinking of those ten years wasted, of how short was life, and love;
      thinking&mdash;hardly knowing what she thought! And Jimmy Fort, very moved
      by this emotion which he only half understood, pressed her tightly in his
      arms, and kissed her wet cheeks and her neck, pale and warm in the
      darkness.

    <p>
      Noel went on with her work for a month, and then, one morning, fainted
      over a pile of dishes. The noise attracted attention, and Mrs. Lynch was
      summoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of her lying there so deadly white taxed Leila&rsquo;s nerves
      severely. But the girl revived quickly, and a cab was sent for. Leila went
      with her, and told the driver to stop at Camelot Mansions. Why take her
      home in this state, why not save the jolting, and let her recover
      properly? They went upstairs arm in arm. Leila made her lie down on the
      divan, and put a hot-water bottle to her feet. Noel was still so passive
      and pale that even to speak to her seemed a cruelty. And, going to her
      little sideboard, Leila stealthily extracted a pint bottle of some
      champagne which Jimmy Fort had sent in, and took it with two glasses and a
      corkscrew into her bedroom. She drank a little herself, and came out
      bearing a glass to the girl. Noel shook her head, and her eyes seemed to
      say: &ldquo;Do you really think I&rsquo;m so easily mended?&rdquo; But Leila had been
      through too much in her time to despise earthly remedies, and she held it
      to the girl&rsquo;s lips until she drank. It was excellent champagne, and, since
      Noel had never yet touched alcohol, had an instantaneous effect. Her eyes
      brightened; little red spots came up in her cheeks. And suddenly she
      rolled over and buried her face deep in a cushion. With her short hair,
      she looked so like a child lying there, that Leila knelt down, stroking
      her head, and saying: &ldquo;There, there; my love! There, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last the girl raised herself; now that the pallid, masklike despair of
      the last month was broken, she seemed on fire, and her face had a wild
      look. She withdrew herself from Leila&rsquo;s touch, and, crossing her arms
      tightly across her chest, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it; I can&rsquo;t sleep. I want him back; I hate life&mdash;I hate
      the world. We hadn&rsquo;t done anything&mdash;only just loved each other. God
      likes punishing; just because we loved each other; we had only one day to
      love each other&mdash;only one day&mdash;only one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila could see the long white throat above those rigid arms straining and
      swallowing; it gave her a choky feeling to watch it. The voice, uncannily
      dainty for all the wildness of the words and face, went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to live. If there&rsquo;s another life, I shall go
      to him. And if there isn&rsquo;t&mdash;it&rsquo;s just sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila put out her hand to ward of these wild wanderings. Like most women
      who live simply the life of their senses and emotions, she was orthodox;
      or rather never speculated on such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about yourself and him,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel fastened her great eyes on her cousin. &ldquo;We loved each other; and
      children are born, aren&rsquo;t they, after you&rsquo;ve loved? But mine won&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;
       From the look on her face rather than from her words, the full reality of
      her meaning came to Leila, vanished, came again. Nonsense! But&mdash;what
      an awful thing, if true! That which had always seemed to her such an
      exaggerated occurrence in the common walks of life&mdash;why! now, it was
      a tragedy! Instinctively she raised herself and put her arms round the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor dear!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re fancying things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colour had faded out of Noel&rsquo;s face, and, with her head thrown back
      and her eyelids half-closed, she looked like a scornful young ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is&mdash;I shan&rsquo;t live. I don&rsquo;t mean to&mdash;it&rsquo;s easy to die. I
      don&rsquo;t mean Daddy to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear, my dear!&rdquo; was all Leila could stammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it wrong, Leila?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong? I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;wrong? If it really is so&mdash;it was&mdash;unfortunate.
      But surely, surely&mdash;you&rsquo;re mistaken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel shook her head. &ldquo;I did it so that we should belong to each other.
      Nothing could have taken him from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila caught at the girl&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t quite gone from you, you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel&rsquo;s lips formed a &ldquo;No&rdquo; which was inaudible. &ldquo;But Daddy!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward&rsquo;s face came before Leila so vividly that she could hardly see the
      girl for the tortured shape of it. Then the hedonist in her revolted
      against that ascetic vision. Her worldly judgment condemned and deplored
      this calamity, her instinct could not help applauding that hour of life
      and love, snatched out of the jaws of death. &ldquo;Need he ever know?&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could never lie to Daddy. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Why should one go on
      living, when life is rotten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside the sun was shining brightly, though it was late October. Leila
      got up from her knees. She stood at the window thinking hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t get morbid. Look at me! I&rsquo;ve had
      two husbands, and&mdash;and&mdash;well, a pretty stormy up and down time
      of it; and I daresay I&rsquo;ve got lots of trouble before me. But I&rsquo;m not going
      to cave in. Nor must you. The Piersons have plenty of pluck; you mustn&rsquo;t
      be a traitor to your blood. That&rsquo;s the last thing. Your boy would have
      told you to stick it. These are your &lsquo;trenches,&rsquo; and you&rsquo;re not going to
      be downed, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After she had spoken there was a long silence, before Noel said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a cigarette, Leila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila produced the little flat case she carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s brave,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s incurable at your age. Only one
      thing&rsquo;s incurable&mdash;getting old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s curable too, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not without surrender.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a silence, while the blue fume from two cigarettes
      fast-smoked, rose towards the low ceiling. Then Noel got up from the
      divan, and went over to the piano. She was still in her hospital dress of
      lilac-coloured linen, and while she stood there touching the keys, playing
      a chord now, and then, Leila&rsquo;s heart felt hollow from compassion; she was
      so happy herself just now, and this child so very wretched!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play to me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;no&mdash;don&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;ll play to you.&rdquo; And sitting
      down, she began to play and sing a little French song, whose first line
      ran: &ldquo;Si on est jolie, jolie comme vous.&rdquo; It was soft, gay, charming. If
      the girl cried, so much the better. But Noel did not cry. She seemed
      suddenly to have recovered all her self-possession. She spoke calmly,
      answered Leila&rsquo;s questions without emotion, and said she would go home.
      Leila went out with her, and walked some way in the direction of her home;
      distressed, but frankly at a loss. At the bottom of Portland Place Noel
      stopped and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite all right now, Leila; thank you awfully. I
      shall just go home and lie down. And I shall come to-morrow, the same as
      usual. Goodbye!&rdquo; Leila could only grasp the girl&rsquo;s hand, and say: &ldquo;My
      dear, that&rsquo;s splendid. There&rsquo;s many a slip&mdash;besides, it&rsquo;s war-time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that saying, enigmatic even to herself, she watched the girl moving
      slowly away; and turned back herself towards her hospital, with a
      disturbed and compassionate heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      2
    </p>
    <p>
      But Noel did not go east; she walked down Regent Street. She had received
      a certain measure of comfort, been steadied by her experienced cousin&rsquo;s
      vitality, and the new thoughts suggested by those words: &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t quite
      gone from you, has he?&rdquo; &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s war-time.&rdquo; Leila had spoken freely,
      too, and the physical ignorance in which the girl had been groping these
      last weeks was now removed. Like most proud natures, she did not naturally
      think much about the opinion of other people; besides, she knew nothing of
      the world, its feelings and judgments. Her nightmare was the thought of
      her father&rsquo;s horror and grief. She tried to lessen that nightmare by
      remembering his opposition to her marriage, and the resentment she had
      felt. He had never realised, never understood, how she and Cyril loved.
      Now, if she were really going to have a child, it would be Cyril&rsquo;s&mdash;Cyril&rsquo;s
      son&mdash;Cyril over again. The instinct stronger than reason, refinement,
      tradition, upbringing, which had pushed her on in such haste to make sure
      of union&mdash;the irrepressible pulse of life faced with annihilation&mdash;seemed
      to revive within her, and make her terrible secret almost precious. She
      had read about &ldquo;War babies&rdquo; in the papers, read with a dull curiosity; but
      now the atmosphere, as it were, of those writings was illumined for her.
      These babies were wrong, were a &ldquo;problem,&rdquo; and yet, behind all that, she
      seemed now to know that people were glad of them; they made up, they
      filled the gaps. Perhaps, when she had one, she would be proud, secretly
      proud, in spite of everyone, in spite of her father! They had tried to
      kill Cyril&mdash;God and everyone; but they hadn&rsquo;t been able, he was alive
      within her! A glow came into her face, walking among the busy shopping
      crowd, and people turned to look at her; she had that appearance of seeing
      no one, nothing, which is strange and attractive to those who have a
      moment to spare from contemplation of their own affairs. Fully two hours
      she wandered thus, before going in, and only lost that exalted feeling
      when, in her own little room, she had taken up his photograph, and was
      sitting on her bed gazing at it. She had a bad breakdown then. Locked in
      there, she lay on her bed, crying, dreadfully lonely, till she fell asleep
      exhausted, with the tear-stained photograph clutched in her twitching
      fingers. She woke with a start. It was dark, and someone was knocking on
      her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Noel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Childish perversity kept her silent. Why couldn&rsquo;t they leave her alone?
      They would leave her alone if they knew. Then she heard another kind of
      knocking, and her father&rsquo;s voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie! Nollie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She scrambled up, and opened. He looked scared, and her heart smote her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Daddy; I was asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I&rsquo;m sorry, but dinner&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any dinner; I think I&rsquo;ll go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The frown between his brows deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t lock your door, Nollie: I was quite frightened. I went
      round to the hospital to bring you home, and they told me about your
      fainting. I want you to see a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel shook her head vigorously. &ldquo;Oh, no! It&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing? To faint like that? Come, my child. To please me.&rdquo; He took her
      face in his hands. Noel shrank away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Daddy. I won&rsquo;t see a doctor. Extravagance in wartime! I won&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s
      no good trying to make me. I&rsquo;ll come down if you like; I shall be all
      right to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this Pierson had to be content; but, often that evening, she saw him
      looking at her anxiously. And when she went up, he came out of his study,
      followed to her room, and insisted on lighting her fire. Kissing her at
      the door, he said very quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could be a mother to you, my child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment it flashed through Noel: &lsquo;He knows!&rsquo; then, by the puzzled
      look on his face, she knew that he did not. If only he did know; what a
      weight it would be off her mind! But she answered quietly too; &ldquo;Good
      night, Daddy dear!&rdquo; kissed him, and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down before the little new fire, and spread her hands out to it;
      all was so cold and wintry in her heart. And the firelight flickered on
      her face, where shadows lay thick under her eyes, for all the roundness of
      her cheeks, and on her slim pale hands, and the supple grace of her young
      body. And out in the night, clouds raced over the moon, which had come
      full once more.

    <p>
      1
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson went back to his study, and wrote to Gratian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can get leave for a few days, my dear, I want you at home. I am
      troubled about Nollie. Ever since that disaster happened to her she has
      been getting paler; and to-day she fainted. She won&rsquo;t see a doctor, but
      perhaps you could get her to see George. If you come up, he will surely be
      able to run up to us for a day or two. If not, you must take her down to
      him at the sea. I have just seen the news of your second cousin Charlie
      Pierson&rsquo;s death; he was killed in one of the last attacks on the Somme; he
      was nephew of my cousin Leila whom, as you know, Noel sees every day at
      her hospital. Bertram has the D. S. O. I have been less hard-pressed
      lately; Lauder has been home on leave and has taken some Services for me.
      And now the colder weather has come, I am feeling much fresher. Try your
      best to come. I am seriously concerned for our beloved child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your affectionate father
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;EDWARD PIERSON.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian answered that she could get week-end leave, and would come on
      Friday. He met her at the station, and they drove thence straight to the
      hospital, to pick up Noel. Leila came to them in the waiting-room, and
      Pierson, thinking they would talk more freely about Noel&rsquo;s health if he
      left them alone, went into the recreation room, and stood watching a game
      of bagatelle between two convalescents. When he returned to the little
      sitting-room they were still standing by the hearth, talking in low
      voices. Gratian must surely have been stooping over the fire, for her face
      was red, almost swollen, and her eyes looked as if she had scorched them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leila said lightly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Edward, aren&rsquo;t the men delightful? When are we going to another
      concert together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She, too, was flushed and looking almost young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! If we could do the things we want to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very pretty, Edward; but you should, you know&mdash;for a tonic.&rdquo;
       He shook his head and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a temptress, Leila. Will you let Nollie know, please, that we can
      take her back with us? Can you let her off to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For as long as you like; she wants a rest. I&rsquo;ve been talking to Gratian.
      We oughtn&rsquo;t to have let her go on after a shock like that&mdash;my fault,
      I&rsquo;m afraid. I thought that work might be best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson was conscious of Gratian walking past him out of the room. He held
      out his hand to Leila, and followed. A small noise occurred behind him
      such as a woman makes when she has put a foot through her own skirt, or
      has other powerful cause for dismay. Then he saw Noel in the hall, and was
      vaguely aware of being the centre of a triangle of women whose eyes were
      playing catch-glance. His daughters kissed each other; and he became
      seated between them in the taxi. The most unobservant of men, he parted
      from them in the hall without having perceived anything except that they
      were rather silent; and, going to his study, he took up a Life of Sir
      Thomas More. There was a passage therein which he itched to show George
      Laird, who was coming up that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gratian and Noel had mounted the stairs with lips tight set, and eyes
      averted; both were very pale. When they reached the door of Gratian&rsquo;s room
      the room which had been their mother&rsquo;s&mdash;Noel was for passing on, but
      Gratian caught her by the arm, and said: &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; The fire was burning
      brightly in there, and the two sisters stood in front of it, one on each
      side, their hands clutching the mantel-shelf, staring at the flames. At
      last Noel put one hand in front of her eyes, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked her to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian made the movement of one who is gripped by two strong emotions,
      and longs to surrender to one or to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too horrible,&rdquo; was all she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel turned towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Nollie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel stopped with her hand on the door knob. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be forgiven
      and sympathised with. I just want to be let alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you be let alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tide of misery surged up in Noel, and she cried out passionately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate sympathy from people who can&rsquo;t understand. I don&rsquo;t want anyone&rsquo;s.
      I can always go away, and lose myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words &ldquo;can&rsquo;t understand&rdquo; gave Gratian a shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t; you never saw him. You never saw&mdash;&rdquo; her lips quivered so
      that she had to stop and bite them, to keep back a rush of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides you would never have done it yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian went towards her, but stopped, and sat down on the bed. It was
      true. She would never have done it herself; it was just that which, for
      all her longing to help her sister, iced her love and sympathy. How
      terrible, wretched, humiliating! Her own sister, her only sister, in the
      position of all those poor, badly brought up girls, who forgot themselves!
      And her father&mdash;their father! Till that moment she had hardly thought
      of him, too preoccupied by the shock to her own pride. The word: &ldquo;Dad!&rdquo;
       was forced from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That boy!&rdquo; said Gratian suddenly; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t forgive him. If you didn&rsquo;t
      know&mdash;he did. It was&mdash;it was&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped at the sight of
      Noel&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was I. He was my husband, as much as yours is.
      If you say a word against him, I&rsquo;ll never speak to you again: I&rsquo;m glad,
      and you would be, if you were going to have one. What&rsquo;s the difference,
      except that you&rsquo;ve had luck, and I&mdash;haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Her lips quivered
      again, and she was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gratian stared up at her. She had a longing for George&mdash;to know what
      he thought and felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind if I tell George?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel shook her head. &ldquo;No! not now. Tell anybody.&rdquo; And suddenly the misery
      behind the mask of her face went straight to Gratian&rsquo;s heart. She got up
      and put her arms round her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie dear, don&rsquo;t look like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel suffered the embrace without response, but when it was over, went to
      her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gratian stayed, sorry, sore and vexed, uncertain, anxious. Her pride was
      deeply wounded, her heart torn; she was angry with herself. Why couldn&rsquo;t
      she have been more sympathetic? And yet, now that Noel was no longer
      there, she again condemned the dead. What he had done was unpardonable.
      Nollie was such&mdash;a child! He had committed sacrilege. If only George
      would come, and she could talk it all out with him! She, who had married
      for love and known passion, had insight enough to feel that Noel&rsquo;s love
      had been deep&mdash;so far as anything, of course, could be deep in such a
      child. Gratian was at the mature age of twenty. But to have forgotten
      herself like that! And this boy! If she had known him, that feeling might
      have been mitigated by the personal element, so important to all human
      judgment; but never having seen him, she thought of his conduct as
      &ldquo;caddish.&rdquo; And she knew that this was, and would be, the trouble between
      her and her sister. However she might disguise it, Noel would feel that
      judgment underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stripped off her nurse&rsquo;s garb, put on an evening frock, and fidgeted
      about the room. Anything rather than go down and see her father again
      before she must. This, which had happened, was beyond words terrible for
      him; she dreaded the talk with him about Noel&rsquo;s health which would have to
      come. She could say nothing, of course, until Noel wished; and, very
      truthful by nature, the idea, of having to act a lie distressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went down at last, and found them both in the drawing-room already;
      Noel in a frilly evening frock, sitting by the fire with her chin on her
      hand, while her father was reading out the war news from the evening
      paper. At sight of that cool, dainty, girlish figure brooding over the
      fire, and of her father&rsquo;s worn face, the tragedy of this business thrust
      itself on her with redoubled force. Poor Dad! Poor Nollie! Awful! Then
      Noel turned, and gave a little shake of her head, and her eyes said,
      almost as plainly as lips could have said it: &lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; Gratian nodded,
      and came forward to the fire. And so began one of those calm, domestic
      evenings, which cover sometimes such depths of heartache.
    </p>
    <p>
      2
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel stayed up until her father went to bed, then went upstairs at once.
      She had evidently determined that they should not talk about her. Gratian
      sat on alone, waiting for her husband! It was nearly midnight when he
      came, and she did not tell him the family news till next morning. He
      received it with a curious little grunt. Gratian saw his eyes contract, as
      they might have, perhaps, looking at some bad and complicated wound, and
      then stare steadily at the ceiling. Though they had been married over a
      year, she did not yet know what he thought about many things, and she
      waited with a queer sinking at her heart. This skeleton in the family
      cupboard was a test of his affection for herself, a test of the quality of
      the man she had married. He did not speak for a little, and her anxiety
      grew. Then his hand sought hers, and gave it a hard squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little Nollie! This is a case for Mark Tapleyism. But cheer up,
      Gracie! We&rsquo;ll get her through somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But father! It&rsquo;s impossible to keep it from him, and impossible to tell
      him! Oh George! I never knew what family pride was till now. It&rsquo;s
      incredible. That wretched boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;De mortuis.&rsquo; Come, Gracie! In the midst of death we are in life! Nollie
      was a plumb little idiot. But it&rsquo;s the war&mdash;the war! Your father must
      get used to it; it&rsquo;s a rare chance for his Christianity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad will be as sweet as anything&mdash;that&rsquo;s what makes it so horrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Laird redoubled his squeeze. &ldquo;Quite right! The old-fashioned father
      could let himself go. But need he know? We can get her away from London,
      and later on, we must manage somehow. If he does hear, we must make him
      feel that Nollie was &lsquo;doing her bit.&rsquo;.rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian withdrew her hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said in a muffled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Laird turned and looked at her. He was greatly upset himself,
      realising perhaps more truly than his young wife the violence of this
      disaster; he was quite capable, too, of feeling how deeply she was stirred
      and hurt; but, a born pragmatist, confronting life always in the
      experimental spirit, he was impatient of the: &ldquo;How awful!&rdquo; attitude. And
      this streak of her father&rsquo;s ascetic traditionalism in Gratian always
      roused in him a wish to break it up. If she had not been his wife he would
      have admitted at once that he might just as well try and alter the
      bone-formation of her head, as break down such a fundamental trait of
      character, but, being his wife, he naturally considered alteration as
      possible as putting a new staircase in a house, or throwing two rooms into
      one. And, taking her in his arms, he said: &ldquo;I know; but it&rsquo;ll all come
      right, if we put a good face on it. Shall I talk to Nollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian assented, from the desire to be able to say to her father: &ldquo;George
      is seeing her!&rdquo; and so stay the need for a discussion. But the whole thing
      seemed to her more and more a calamity which nothing could lessen or
      smooth away.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Laird had plenty of cool courage, invaluable in men who have to
      inflict as well as to alleviate pain, but he did not like his mission &ldquo;a
      little bit&rdquo; as he would have said; and he proposed a walk because he
      dreaded a scene. Noel accepted for the same reason. She liked George, and
      with the disinterested detachment of a sister-in-law, and the shrewdness
      of extreme youth, knew him perhaps better than did his wife. She was sure,
      at all events, of being neither condemned nor sympathised with.
    </p>
    <p>
      They might have gone, of course, in any direction, but chose to make for
      the City. Such deep decisions are subconscious. They sought, no doubt, a
      dry, unemotional region; or perhaps one where George, who was in uniform,
      might rest his arm from the automatic-toy game which the military play.
      They had reached Cheapside before he was conscious to the full of the
      bizarre nature of this walk with his pretty young sister-in-law among all
      the bustling, black-coated mob of money-makers. &lsquo;I wish the devil we
      hadn&rsquo;t come out!&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;it would have been easier indoors, after
      all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He cleared his throat, however, and squeezing her arm gently, began:
      &ldquo;Gratian&rsquo;s told me, Nollie. The great thing is to keep your spirit up, and
      not worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you couldn&rsquo;t cure me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words, in that delicate spurning voice, absolutely staggered George;
      but he said quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the question, Nollie; impossible! What are you thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words: &ldquo;D&mdash;n Daddy!&rdquo; rose to his teeth; he bit them off, and
      said: &ldquo;Bless him! We shall have to see to all that. Do you really want to
      keep it from him? It must be one way or the other; no use concealing it,
      if it&rsquo;s to come out later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stole a look at her. She was gazing straight before her. How damnably
      young she was, how pretty! A lump came up in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t do anything yet,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;too early. Later on, if you&rsquo;d
      like me to tell him. But that&rsquo;s entirely up to you, my dear; he need never
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not follow her thought. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gratian condemns Cyril. Don&rsquo;t let her. I won&rsquo;t have him badly thought of.
      It was my doing. I wanted to make sure of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George answered stoutly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracie&rsquo;s upset, of course, but she&rsquo;ll soon be all right. You mustn&rsquo;t let
      it come between you. The thing you&rsquo;ve got to keep steadily before you is
      that life&rsquo;s a huge wide adaptable thing. Look at all these people! There&rsquo;s
      hardly one of them who hasn&rsquo;t got now, or hasn&rsquo;t had, some personal
      difficulty or trouble before them as big as yours almost; bigger perhaps.
      And here they are as lively as fleas. That&rsquo;s what makes the fascination of
      life&mdash;the jolly irony of it all. It would do you good to have a turn
      in France, and see yourself in proportion to the whole.&rdquo; He felt her
      fingers suddenly slip under his arm, and went on with greater confidence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s going to be the important thing in the future, Nollie; not comfort
      and cloistered virtue and security; but living, and pressure to the square
      inch. Do you twig? All the old hard-and-fast traditions and drags on life
      are in the melting-pot. Death&rsquo;s boiling their bones, and they&rsquo;ll make
      excellent stock for the new soup. When you prune and dock things, the sap
      flows quicker. Regrets and repinings and repressions are going out of
      fashion; we shall have no time or use for them in the future. You&rsquo;re going
      to make life&mdash;well, that&rsquo;s something to be thankful for, anyway.
      You&rsquo;ve kept Cyril Morland alive. And&mdash;well, you know, we&rsquo;ve all been
      born; some of us properly, and some improperly, and there isn&rsquo;t a ha&rsquo;porth
      of difference in the value of the article, or the trouble of bringing it
      into the world. The cheerier you are the better your child will be, and
      that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to think about. You needn&rsquo;t begin to trouble at all
      for another couple of months, at least; after that, just let us know where
      you&rsquo;d like to go, and I&rsquo;ll arrange it somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked round at him, and under that young, clear, brooding gaze he had
      the sudden uncomfortable feeling of having spoken like a charlatan. Had he
      really touched the heart of the matter? What good were his generalities to
      this young, fastidiously nurtured girl, brought up to tell the truth, by a
      father so old-fashioned and devoted, whom she loved? It was George&rsquo;s
      nature, too, to despise words; and the conditions of his life these last
      two years had given him a sort of horror of those who act by talking. He
      felt inclined to say: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t pay the slightest attention to me; it&rsquo;s all
      humbug; what will be will be, and there&rsquo;s an end of it:
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell Daddy or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to say: &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but somehow couldn&rsquo;t. After all, the
      straightforward course was probably the best. For this would have to be a
      lifelong concealment. It was impossible to conceal a thing for ever;
      sooner or later he would find out. But the doctor rose up in him, and he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to meet trouble, Nollie; it&rsquo;ll be time enough in two months.
      Then tell him, or let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;No; I will, if it is to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand on hers, within his arm, and gave it a squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do till then?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a week&rsquo;s complete rest, and then go on where you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel was silent a minute, then said: &ldquo;Yes; I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They spoke no more on the subject, and George exerted himself to talk
      about hospital experiences, and that phenomenon, the British soldier. But
      just before they reached home he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Nollie! If you&rsquo;re not ashamed of yourself, no one will be
      ashamed of you. If you put ashes on your own head, your fellow-beings
      will, assist you; for of such is their charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, receiving another of those clear, brooding looks, he left her with
      the thought: &lsquo;A lonely child!&rsquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Noel went back to her hospital after a week&rsquo;s rest. George had done more
      for her than he suspected, for his saying: &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s a huge wide adaptable
      thing!&rdquo; had stuck in her mind. Did it matter what happened to her? And she
      used to look into the faces of the people she met, and wonder what was
      absorbing them. What secret griefs and joys were they carrying about with
      them? The loneliness of her own life now forced her to this speculation
      concerning others, for she was extraordinarily lonely; Gratian and George
      were back at work, her father must be kept at bay; with Leila she felt ill
      at ease, for the confession had hurt her pride; and family friends and
      acquaintances of all sorts she shunned like the plague. The only person
      she did not succeed in avoiding was Jimmy Fort, who came in one evening
      after dinner, bringing her a large bunch of hothouse violets. But then, he
      did not seem to matter&mdash;too new an acquaintance, too detached.
      Something he said made her aware that he had heard of her loss, and that
      the violets were a token of sympathy. He seemed awfully kind that evening,
      telling her &ldquo;tales of Araby,&rdquo; and saying nothing which would shock her
      father. It was wonderful to be a man and roll about the world as he had,
      and see all life, and queer places, and people&mdash;Chinamen, and
      Gauchos, and Boers, and Mexicans. It gave her a kind of thirst. And she
      liked to watch his brown, humorous face; which seemed made of dried
      leather. It gave her the feeling that life and experience were all that
      mattered, doing and seeing things; it made her own trouble seem smaller;
      less important. She squeezed his hand when she said good night: &ldquo;Thank you
      for my violets and for coming; it was awfully kind of you! I wish I could
      have adventures!&rdquo; And he answered: &ldquo;You will, my dear fairy princess!&rdquo; He
      said it queerly and very kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairy Princess! What a funny thing to call her! If he had only known!
    </p>
    <p>
      There were not many adventures to be had in those regions where she washed
      up. Not much &ldquo;wide and adaptable life&rdquo; to take her thoughts off herself.
      But on her journeys to and from the hospital she had more than one odd
      little experience. One morning she noticed a poorly dressed woman with a
      red and swollen face, flapping along Regent Street like a wounded bird,
      and biting strangely at her hand. Hearing her groan, Noel asked her what
      the matter was. The woman held out the hand. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;I was
      scrubbin&rsquo; the floor and I got this great needle stuck through my &lsquo;and, and
      it&rsquo;s broke off, and I can&rsquo;t get it out. Oh! Oh!&rdquo; She bit at the
      needle-end, not quite visible, but almost within reach of teeth, and
      suddenly went very white. In dismay, Noel put an arm round her, and turned
      her into a fine chemist&rsquo;s shop. Several ladies were in there, buying
      perfumes, and they looked with acerbity at this disordered dirty female
      entering among them. Noel went up to a man behind the counter. &ldquo;Please
      give me something quick, for this poor woman, I think she&rsquo;s going to
      faint. She&rsquo;s run a needle through her hand, and can&rsquo;t get it out.&rdquo; The man
      gave her &ldquo;something quick,&rdquo; and Noel pushed past two of the dames back to
      where the woman was sitting. She was still obstinately biting at her hand,
      and suddenly her chin flew up, and there, between her teeth, was the
      needle. She took it from them with her other hand, stuck it proudly in the
      front of her dress, and out tumbled the words: &ldquo;Oh! there&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had swallowed the draught, she looked round her, bewildered, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you kindly, miss!&rdquo; and shuffled out. Noel paid for the draught, and
      followed; and, behind her, the shining shop seemed to exhale a perfumed
      breath of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go back to work,&rdquo; she said to the woman. &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ornsey, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take a &lsquo;bus and go straight home, and put your hand at once into
      weak Condy&rsquo;s fluid and water. It&rsquo;s swelling. Here&rsquo;s five shillings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss; thank you, miss, I&rsquo;m sure. It&rsquo;s very kind of you. It does ache
      cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not better this afternoon, you must go to a doctor. Promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, yes. &lsquo;Ere&rsquo;s my &lsquo;bus. Thank you kindly, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel saw her borne away, still sucking at her dirty swollen hand. She
      walked on in a glow of love for the poor woman, and hate for the ladies in
      the chemist&rsquo;s shop, and forgot her own trouble till she had almost reached
      the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another November day, a Saturday, leaving early, she walked to Hyde Park.
      The plane-trees were just at the height of their spotted beauty. Few&mdash;very
      few-yellow leaves still hung; and the slender pretty trees seemed
      rejoicing in their freedom from summer foliage. All their delicate boughs
      and twigs were shaking and dancing in the wind; and their rain-washed
      leopard-like bodies had a lithe un-English gaiety. Noel passed down their
      line, and seated herself on a bench. Close by, an artist was painting. His
      easel was only some three yards away from her, and she could see the
      picture; a vista of the Park Lane houses through, the gay plane-tree
      screen. He was a tall man, about forty, evidently foreign, with a thin,
      long, oval, beardless face, high brow, large grey eyes which looked as if
      he suffered from headaches and lived much within himself. He cast many
      glances at her, and, pursuant of her new interest in &ldquo;life&rdquo; she watched
      him discreetly; a little startled however, when, taking off his
      broad-brimmed squash hat, he said in a broken accent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me the liberty I take, mademoiselle, but would you so very kindly
      allow me to make a sketch of you sitting there? I work very quick. I beg
      you will let me. I am Belgian, and have no manners, you see.&rdquo; And he
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said Noel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you very much:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shifted his easel, and began to draw. She felt flattered, and a little
      fluttered. He was so pale, and had a curious, half-fed look, which moved
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been long in England?&rdquo; she said presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since the first months of the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very homesick at first. But I live in my pictures; there are
      wonderful things in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you want to sketch me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter smiled again. &ldquo;Mademoiselle, youth is so mysterious. Those
      young trees I have been painting mean so much more than the old big trees.
      Your eyes are seeing things that have not yet happened. There is Fate in
      them, and a look of defending us others from seeing it. We have not such
      faces in my country; we are simpler; we do not defend our expressions. The
      English are very mysterious. We are like children to them. Yet in some
      ways you are like children to us. You are not people of the world at all.
      You English have been good to us, but you do not like us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose you do not like us, either?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled again, and she noticed how white his teeth were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not very much. The English do things from duty, but their hearts
      they keep to themselves. And their Art&mdash;well, that is really
      amusing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about Art,&rdquo; Noel murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the world to me,&rdquo; said the painter, and was silent, drawing with
      increased pace and passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so difficult to get subjects,&rdquo; he remarked abruptly. &ldquo;I cannot
      afford to pay models, and they are not fond of me painting out of doors.
      If I had always a subject like you! You&mdash;you have a grief, have you
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that startling little question, Noel looked up, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody has, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter grasped his chin; his eyes had suddenly become tragical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;everybody. Tragedy is daily bread. I have lost my family;
      they are in Belgium. How they live I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry; very sorry, too, if we aren&rsquo;t nice to you, here. We ought to
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;What would you have? We are different. That is
      unpardonable. An artist is always lonely, too; he has a skin fewer than
      other people, and he sees things that they do not. People do not like you
      to be different. If ever in your life you act differently from others, you
      will find it so, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel felt herself flushing. Was he reading her secret? His eyes had such a
      peculiar, secondsighted look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nearly finished?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mademoiselle; I could go on for hours; but I do not wish to keep you.
      It is cold for you, sitting there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel got up. &ldquo;May I look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not quite recognise herself&mdash;who does?&mdash;but she saw a
      face which affected her oddly, of a girl looking at something which was,
      and yet was not, in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Lavendie,&rdquo; the painter said; &ldquo;my wife and I live here,&rdquo; and he
      gave her a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel could not help answering: &ldquo;My name is Noel Pierson; I live with my
      father; here&rsquo;s the address&rdquo;&mdash;she found her case, and fished out a
      card. &ldquo;My father is a clergyman; would you care to come and see him? He
      loves music and painting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a great pleasure; and perhaps I might be allowed to paint
      you. Alas! I have no studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel drew back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that I work in a hospital all day, and&mdash;and
      I don&rsquo;t want to be painted, thank you. But, Daddy would like to meet you,
      I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter bowed again; she saw that he was hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I can see that you&rsquo;re a very fine painter,&rdquo; she said quickly;
      &ldquo;only&mdash;only&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to, you see. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to
      paint Daddy; he&rsquo;s got a most interesting face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter smiled. &ldquo;He is your father, mademoiselle. May I ask you one
      question? Why do you not want to be painted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;because I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo; She held out her hand. The
      painter bowed over it. &ldquo;Au revoir, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Noel; &ldquo;it was awfully interesting.&rdquo; And she walked away.
      The sky had become full of clouds round the westerly sun; and the foreign
      crinkled tracery of the plane-tree branches against that French-grey,
      golden-edged mass, was very lovely. Beauty, and the troubles of others,
      soothed her. She felt sorry for the painter, but his eyes saw too much!
      And his words: &ldquo;If ever you act differently from others,&rdquo; made her feel
      him uncanny. Was it true that people always disliked and condemned those
      who acted differently? If her old school-fellows now knew what was before
      her, how would they treat her? In her father&rsquo;s study hung a little
      reproduction of a tiny picture in the Louvre, a &ldquo;Rape of Europa,&rdquo; by an
      unknown painter&mdash;a humorous delicate thing, of an enraptured;
      fair-haired girl mounted on a prancing white bull, crossing a shallow
      stream, while on the bank all her white girl-companions were gathered,
      turning half-sour, half-envious faces away from that too-fearful
      spectacle, while one of them tried with timid desperation to mount astride
      of a sitting cow, and follow. The face of the girl on the bull had once
      been compared by someone with her own. She thought of this picture now,
      and saw her school fellows-a throng of shocked and wondering girls.
      Suppose one of them had been in her position! &lsquo;Should I have been turning
      my face away, like the rest? I wouldn&rsquo;t no, I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;I
      should have understood!&rsquo; But she knew there was a kind of false emphasis
      in her thought. Instinctively she felt the painter right. One who acted
      differently from others, was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told her father of the encounter, adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect he&rsquo;ll come, Daddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson answered dreamily: &ldquo;Poor fellow, I shall be glad to see him if he
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll sit to him, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear&mdash;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lonely, you know, and people aren&rsquo;t nice to him. Isn&rsquo;t it hateful
      that people should hurt others, because they&rsquo;re foreign or different?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw his eyes open with mild surprise, and went on: &ldquo;I know you think
      people are charitable, Daddy, but they aren&rsquo;t, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not exactly charitable, Nollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know they&rsquo;re not. I think sin often just means doing things
      differently. It&rsquo;s not real sin when it only hurts yourself; but that
      doesn&rsquo;t prevent people condemning you, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Nollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel bit her lips, and murmured: &ldquo;Are you sure we&rsquo;re really Christians,
      Daddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was so startling, from his own daughter, that Pierson took
      refuge in an attempt at wit. &ldquo;I should like notice of that question,
      Nollie, as they say in Parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson flushed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re fallible enough; but, don&rsquo;t get such ideas into
      your head, my child. There&rsquo;s a lot of rebellious talk and writing in these
      days....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel clasped her hands behind her head. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, looking
      straight before her, and speaking to the air, &ldquo;that Christianity is what
      you do, not what you think or say. And I don&rsquo;t believe people can be
      Christians when they act like others&mdash;I mean, when they join together
      to judge and hurt people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson rose and paced the room. &ldquo;You have not seen enough of life to talk
      like that,&rdquo; he said. But Noel went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the men in her hospital told Gratian about the treatment of
      conscientious objectors&mdash;it was horrible. Why do they treat them like
      that, just because they disagree? Captain Fort says it&rsquo;s fear which makes
      people bullies. But how can it be fear when they&rsquo;re hundreds to one? He
      says man has domesticated his animals but has never succeeded in
      domesticating himself. Man must be a wild beast, you know, or the world
      couldn&rsquo;t be so awfully brutal. I don&rsquo;t see much difference between being
      brutal for good reasons, and being brutal for bad ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson looked down at her with a troubled smile. There was something
      fantastic to him in this sudden philosophising by one whom he had watched
      grow up from a tiny thing. Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings&mdash;sometimes!
      But then the young generation was always something of a sealed book to
      him; his sensitive shyness, and, still more, his cloth, placed a sort of
      invisible barrier between him and the hearts of others, especially the
      young. There were so many things of which he was compelled to disapprove,
      or which at least he couldn&rsquo;t discuss. And they knew it too well. Until
      these last few months he had never realised that his own daughters had
      remained as undiscovered by him as the interior of Brazil. And now that he
      perceived this, he was bewildered, yet could not imagine how to get on
      terms with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he stood looking at Noel, intensely puzzled, suspecting nothing of the
      hard fact which was altering her&mdash;vaguely jealous, anxious, pained.
      And when she had gone up to bed, he roamed up and down the room a long
      time, thinking. He longed for a friend to confide in, and consult; but he
      knew no one. He shrank from them all, as too downright, bluff, and active;
      too worldly and unaesthetic; or too stiff and narrow. Amongst the younger
      men in his profession he was often aware of faces which attracted him, but
      one could not confide deep personal questions to men half one&rsquo;s age. But
      of his own generation, or his elders, he knew not one to whom he could
      have gone.

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leila was deep in her new draught of life. When she fell in love it had
      always been over head and ears, and so far her passion had always burnt
      itself out before that of her partner. This had been, of course, a great
      advantage to her. Not that Leila had ever expected her passions to burn
      themselves out. When she fell in love she had always thought it was for
      always. This time she was sure it was, surer than she had ever been. Jimmy
      Fort seemed to her the man she had been looking for all her life. He was
      not so good-looking as either Farie or Lynch, but beside him these others
      seemed to her now almost ridiculous. Indeed they did not figure at all,
      they shrank, they withered, they were husks, together with the others for
      whom she had known passing weaknesses. There was only one man in the world
      for her now, and would be for evermore. She did not idealise him either,
      it was more serious than that; she was thrilled by his voice, and his
      touch, she dreamed of him, longed for him when he was not with her. She
      worried, too, for she was perfectly aware that he was not half as fond of
      her as she was of him. Such a new experience puzzled her, kept her
      instincts painfully on the alert. It was perhaps just this uncertainty
      about his affection which made him seem more precious than any of the
      others. But there was ever the other reason, too-consciousness that Time
      was after her, and this her last grand passion. She watched him as a
      mother-cat watches her kitten, without seeming to, of course, for she had
      much experience. She had begun to have a curious secret jealousy of Noel
      though why she could not have said. It was perhaps merely incidental to
      her age, or sprang from that vague resemblance between her and one who
      outrivalled even what she had been as a girl; or from the occasional
      allusions Fort made to what he called &ldquo;that little fairy princess.&rdquo;
       Something intangible, instinctive, gave her that jealousy. Until the death
      of her young cousin&rsquo;s lover she had felt safe, for she knew that Jimmy
      Fort would not hanker after another man&rsquo;s property; had he not proved that
      in old days, with herself, by running away from her? And she had often
      regretted having told him of Cyril Morland&rsquo;s death. One day she determined
      to repair that error. It was at the Zoo, where they often went on Sunday
      afternoons. They were standing before a creature called the meercat, which
      reminded them both of old days on the veldt. Without turning her head she
      said, as if to the little animal: &ldquo;Do you know that your fairy princess,
      as you call her, is going to have what is known as a war-baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of his &ldquo;What!&rdquo; gave her quite a stab. It was so utterly
      horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said stubbornly: &ldquo;She came and told me all about it. The boy is dead,
      as you know. Yes, terrible, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; And she looked at him. His face was
      almost comic, so wrinkled up with incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That lovely child! But it&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The impossible is sometimes true, Jimmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse to believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you it is so,&rdquo; she said angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a ghastly shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was her own doing; she said so, herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her father&mdash;the padre! My God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila was suddenly smitten with a horrible doubt. She had thought it would
      disgust him, cure him of any little tendency to romanticise that child;
      and now she perceived that it was rousing in him, instead, a dangerous
      compassion. She could have bitten her tongue out for having spoken. When
      he got on the high horse of some championship, he was not to be trusted,
      she had found that out; was even finding it out bitterly in her own
      relations with him, constantly aware that half her hold on him, at least,
      lay in his sense of chivalry, aware that he knew her lurking dread of
      being flung on the beach, by age. Only ten minutes ago he had uttered a
      tirade before the cage of a monkey which seemed unhappy. And now she had
      roused that dangerous side of him in favour of Noel. What an idiot she had
      been!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look like that, Jimmy. I&rsquo;m sorry I told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand did not answer her pressure in the least, but he muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do think that&rsquo;s the limit. What&rsquo;s to be done for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila answered softly: &ldquo;Nothing, I&rsquo;m afraid. Do you love me?&rdquo; And she
      pressed his hand hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Leila thought: &lsquo;If I were that meercat he&rsquo;d have taken more notice of
      my paw!&rsquo; Her heart began suddenly to ache, and she walked on to the next
      cage with head up, and her mouth hard set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy Fort walked away from Camelot Mansions that evening in extreme
      discomfort of mind. Leila had been so queer that he had taken leave
      immediately after supper. She had refused to talk about Noel; had even
      seemed angry when he had tried to. How extraordinary some women were! Did
      they think that a man could hear of a thing like that about such a dainty
      young creature without being upset! It was the most perfectly damnable
      news! What on earth would she do&mdash;poor little fairy princess! Down
      had come her house of cards with a vengeance! The whole of her life&mdash;the
      whole of her life! With her bringing-up and her father and all&mdash;it
      seemed inconceivable that she could ever survive it. And Leila had been
      almost callous about the monstrous business. Women were hard to each
      other! Bad enough, these things, when it was a simple working girl, but
      this dainty, sheltered, beautiful child! No, it was altogether too strong&mdash;too
      painful! And following an impulse which he could not resist, he made his
      way to the old Square. But having reached the house, he nearly went away
      again. While he stood hesitating with his hand on the bell, a girl and a
      soldier passed, appearing as if by magic out of the moonlit November mist,
      blurred and solid shapes embraced, then vanished into it again, leaving
      the sound of footsteps. Fort jerked the bell. He was shown into what
      seemed, to one coming out of that mist, to be a brilliant, crowded room,
      though in truth there were but two lamps and five people in it. They were
      sitting round the fire, talking, and paused when he came in. When he had
      shaken hands with Pierson and been introduced to &ldquo;my daughter Gratian&rdquo; and
      a man in khaki &ldquo;my son-in-law George Laird,&rdquo; to a tall thin-faced,
      foreign-looking man in a black stock and seemingly no collar, he went up
      to Noel, who had risen from a chair before the fire. &lsquo;No!&rsquo; he thought,
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve dreamed it, or Leila has lied!&rsquo; She was so perfectly the
      self-possessed, dainty maiden he remembered. Even the feel of her hand was
      the same-warm and confident; and sinking into a chair, he said: &ldquo;Please go
      on, and let me chip in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were quarrelling about the Universe, Captain Fort,&rdquo; said the man in
      khaki; &ldquo;delighted to have your help. I was just saying that this
      particular world has no particular importance, no more than a
      newspaper-seller would accord to it if it were completely destroyed
      tomorrow&mdash;&rsquo;&rsquo;.rrible catastrophe, total destruction of the world&mdash;six
      o&rsquo;clock edition-pyper!&rsquo; I say that it will become again the nebula out of
      which it was formed, and by friction with other nebula re-form into a
      fresh shape and so on ad infinitum&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t explain why. My wife
      wonders if it exists at all except in the human mind&mdash;but she can&rsquo;t
      explain what the human mind is. My father-in-law thinks that it is God&rsquo;s
      hobby&mdash;but he can&rsquo;t explain who or what God is. Nollie is silent. And
      Monsieur Lavendie hasn&rsquo;t yet told us what he thinks. What do you think,
      monsieur?&rdquo; The thin-faced, big-eyed man put up his hand to his high,
      veined brow as if he had a headache, reddened, and began to speak in
      French, which Fort followed with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me the Universe is a limitless artist, monsieur, who from all time
      and to all time is ever expressing himself in differing forms&mdash;always
      trying to make a masterpiece, and generally failing. For me this world,
      and all the worlds, are like ourselves, and the flowers and trees&mdash;little
      separate works of art, more or less perfect, whose little lives run their
      course, and are spilled or powdered back into this Creative Artist, whence
      issue ever fresh attempts at art. I agree with Monsieur Laird, if I
      understand him right; but I agree also with Madame Laird, if I understand
      her. You see, I think mind and matter are one, or perhaps there is no such
      thing as either mind or matter, only growth and decay and growth again,
      for ever and ever; but always conscious growth&mdash;an artist expressing
      himself in millions of ever-changing forms; decay and death as we call
      them, being but rest and sleep, the ebbing of the tide, which must ever
      come between two rising tides, or the night which comes between two days.
      But the next day is never the same as the day before, nor the tide as the
      last tide; so the little shapes of the world and of ourselves, these works
      of art by the Eternal Artist, are never renewed in the same form, are
      never twice alike, but always fresh-fresh worlds, fresh individuals, fresh
      flowers, fresh everything. I do not see anything depressing in that. To me
      it would be depressing to think that I would go on living after death, or
      live again in a new body, myself yet not myself. How stale that would be!
      When I finish a picture it is inconceivable to me that this picture should
      ever become another picture, or that one can divide the expression from
      the mind-stuff it has expressed. The Great Artist who is the whole of
      Everything, is ever in fresh effort to achieve new things. He is as a
      fountain who throws up new drops, no two ever alike, which fall back into
      the water, flow into the pipe, and so are thrown up again in fresh-shaped
      drops. But I cannot explain why there should be this Eternal Energy, ever
      expressing itself in fresh individual shapes, this Eternal Working Artist,
      instead of nothing at all&mdash;just empty dark for always; except indeed
      that it must be one thing or the other, either all or nothing; and it
      happens to be this and not that, the all and not the nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped speaking, and his big eyes, which had fixed themselves on
      Fort&rsquo;s face, seemed to the latter not to be seeing him at all, but to rest
      on something beyond. The man in khaki, who had risen and was standing with
      his hand on his wife&rsquo;s shoulder, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, monsieur; Jolly well put from the artist&rsquo;s point of view. The idea
      is pretty, anyway; but is there any need for an idea at all? Things are;
      and we have just to take them.&rdquo; Fort had the impression of something dark
      and writhing; the thin black form of his host, who had risen and come
      close to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot admit,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;the identity of the Creator with the
      created. God exists outside ourselves. Nor can I admit that there is no
      defnite purpose and fulfilment. All is shaped to His great ends. I think
      we are too given to spiritual pride. The world has lost reverence; I
      regret it, I bitterly regret it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rejoice at it,&rdquo; said the man in khaki. &ldquo;Now, Captain Fort, your turn to
      bat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort, who had been looking at Noel, gave himself a shake, and said: &ldquo;I
      think what monsieur calls expression, I call fighting. I suspect the
      Universe of being simply a long fight, a sum of conquests and defeats.
      Conquests leading to defeats, defeats to conquests. I want to win while
      I&rsquo;m alive, and because I want to win, I want to live on after death. Death
      is a defeat. I don&rsquo;t want to admit it. While I have that instinct, I don&rsquo;t
      think I shall really die; when I lose it, I think I shall.&rdquo; He was
      conscious of Noel&rsquo;s face turning towards him, but had the feeling that she
      wasn&rsquo;t really listening. &ldquo;I suspect that what we call spirit is just the
      fighting instinct; that what we call matter is the mood of lying down.
      Whether, as Mr. Pierson says, God is outside us, or, as monsieur thinks,
      we are all part of God, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! There we are!&rdquo; said the man in khaki. &ldquo;We all speak after our
      temperaments, and none of us know. The religions of the world are just the
      poetic expressions of certain strongly marked temperaments. Monsieur was a
      poet just now, and his is the only temperament which has never yet been
      rammed down the world&rsquo;s throat in the form of religion. Go out and
      proclaim your views from the housetops, monsieur, and see what happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter shook his head with a smile which seemed to Fort very bright
      on the surface, and very sad underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Non, monsieur,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the artist does not wish to impose his
      temperament. Difference of temperament is the very essence of his joy, and
      his belief in life. Without difference there would be no life for him.
      &lsquo;Tout casse, tout lasse,&rsquo; but change goes on for ever: We artists
      reverence change, monsieur; we reverence the newness of each morning, of
      each night, of each person, of each expression of energy. Nothing is final
      for us; we are eager for all and always for more. We are in love, you see,
      even with-death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence; then Fort heard Pierson murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is beautiful, monsieur; but oh! how wrong!&rdquo; &ldquo;And what do you think,
      Nollie?&rdquo; said the man in khaki suddenly. The girl had been sitting very
      still in her low chair, with her hands crossed in her lap, her eyes on the
      fire, and the lamplight shining down on her fair hair; she looked up,
      startled, and her eyes met Fort&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I wasn&rsquo;t listening.&rdquo; Something moved in him, a kind of
      burning pity, a rage of protection. He said quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are times of action. Philosophy seems to mean nothing nowadays. The
      one thing is to hate tyranny and cruelty, and protect everything that&rsquo;s
      weak and lonely. It&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s left to make life worth living, when all
      the packs of all the world are out for blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel was listening now, and he went on fervently: &ldquo;Why! Even we who
      started out to fight this Prussian pack, have caught the pack feeling&mdash;so
      that it&rsquo;s hunting all over the country, on every sort of scent. It&rsquo;s a
      most infectious thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see that we are being infected, Captain Fort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we are, Mr. Pierson. The great majority of people are always
      inclined to run with the hounds; the pressure&rsquo;s great just now; the pack
      spirit&rsquo;s in the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson shook his head. &ldquo;No, I cannot see it,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;it seems to
      me that we are all more brotherly, and more tolerant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur le cure,&rdquo; Fort heard the painter say very gently, &ldquo;it is
      difficult for a good man to see the evil round him. There are those whom
      the world&rsquo;s march leaves apart, and reality cannot touch. They walk with
      God, and the bestialities of us animals are fantastic to them. The spirit
      of the pack, as monsieur says, is in the air. I see all human nature now,
      running with gaping mouths and red tongues lolling out, their breath and
      their cries spouting thick before them. On whom they will fall next&mdash;one
      never knows; the innocent with the guilty. Perhaps if you were to see some
      one dear to you devoured before your eyes, monsieur le cure, you would
      feel it too; and yet I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort saw Noel turn her face towards her father; her expression at that
      moment was very strange, searching, half frightened. No! Leila had not
      lied, and he had not dreamed! That thing was true!
    </p>
    <p>
      When presently he took his leave, and was out again in the Square, he
      could see nothing but her face and form before him in the moonlight: its
      soft outline, fair colouring, slender delicacy, and the brooding of the
      big grey eyes. He had already crossed New Oxford Street and was some way
      down towards the Strand, when a voice behind him murmured: &ldquo;Ah! c&rsquo;est
      vous, monsieur!&rdquo; and the painter loomed up at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going my way?&rdquo; said Fort. &ldquo;I go slowly, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The slower the better, monsieur. London is so beautiful in the dark. It
      is the despair of the painter&mdash;these moonlit nights. There are
      moments when one feels that reality does not exist. All is in dreams&mdash;like
      the face of that young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort stared sharply round at him. &ldquo;Oh! She strikes you like that, does
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! What a charming figure! What an atmosphere of the past and future
      round her! And she will not let me paint her! Well, perhaps only Mathieu
      Maris.&rdquo; He raised his broad Bohemian hat, and ran his fingers through his
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fort, &ldquo;she&rsquo;d make a wonderful picture. I&rsquo;m not a judge of Art,
      but I can see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter smiled, and went on in his rapid French:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has youth and age all at once&mdash;that is rare. Her father is an
      interesting man, too; I am trying to paint him; he is very difficult. He
      sits lost in some kind of vacancy of his own; a man whose soul has gone
      before him somewhere, like that of his Church, escaped from this age of
      machines, leaving its body behind&mdash;is it not? He is so kind; a saint,
      I think. The other clergymen I see passing in the street are not at all
      like him; they look buttoned-up and busy, with faces of men who might be
      schoolmasters or lawyers, or even soldiers&mdash;men of this world. Do you
      know this, monsieur&mdash;it is ironical, but it is true, I think a man
      cannot be a successful priest unless he is a man of this world. I do not
      see any with that look of Monsieur Pierson, a little tortured within, and
      not quite present. He is half an artist, really a lover of music, that
      man. I am painting him at the piano; when he is playing his face is alive,
      but even then, so far away. To me, monsieur, he is exactly like a
      beautiful church which knows it is being deserted. I find him pathetic. Je
      suis socialiste, but I have always an aesthetic admiration for that old
      Church, which held its children by simple emotion. The times have changed;
      it can no longer hold them so; it stands in the dusk, with its spire to a
      heaven which exists no more, its bells, still beautiful but out of tune
      with the music of the streets. It is something of that which I wish to get
      into my picture of Monsieur Pierson; and sapristi! it is difficult!&rdquo; Fort
      grunted assent. So far as he could make out the painter&rsquo;s words, it seemed
      to him a large order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do it, you see,&rdquo; went on the painter, &ldquo;one should have the proper
      background&mdash;these currents of modern life and modern types, passing
      him and leaving him untouched. There is no illusion, and no dreaming, in
      modern life. Look at this street. La, la!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the darkened Strand, hundreds of khaki-clad figures and girls were
      streaming by, and all their voices had a hard, half-jovial vulgarity. The
      motor-cabs and buses pushed along remorselessly; newspaper-sellers
      muttered their ceaseless invitations. Again the painter made his gesture
      of despair: &ldquo;How am I to get into my picture this modern life, which
      washes round him as round that church, there, standing in the middle of
      the street? See how the currents sweep round it, as if to wash it away;
      yet it stands, seeming not to see them. If I were a phantasist, it would
      be easy enough: but to be a phantasist is too simple for me&mdash;those
      romantic gentlemen bring what they like from anywhere, to serve their
      ends. Moi, je suis realiste. And so, monsieur, I have invented an idea. I
      am painting over his head while he sits there at the piano a picture
      hanging on the wall&mdash;of one of these young town girls who have no
      mysteriousness at all, no youth; nothing but a cheap knowledge and
      defiance, and good humour. He is looking up at it, but he does not see it.
      I will make the face of that girl the face of modern life, and he shall
      sit staring at it, seeing nothing. What do you think of my idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Fort had begun to feel something of the revolt which the man of action
      so soon experiences when he listens to an artist talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds all right,&rdquo; he said abruptly; &ldquo;all the same, monsieur, all my
      sympathy is with modern life. Take these young girls, and these Tommies.
      For all their feather-pated vulgarity and they are damned vulgar, I must
      say&mdash;they&rsquo;re marvellous people; they do take the rough with the
      smooth; they&rsquo;re all &lsquo;doing their bit,&rsquo; you know, and facing this
      particularly beastly world. Aesthetically, I daresay, they&rsquo;re deplorable,
      but can you say that on the whole their philosophy isn&rsquo;t an advance on
      anything we&rsquo;ve had up till now? They worship nothing, it&rsquo;s true; but they
      keep their ends up marvellously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter, who seemed to feel the wind blowing cold on his ideas,
      shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not concerned with that, monsieur; I set down what I see; better or
      worse, I do not know. But look at this!&rdquo; And he pointed down the darkened
      and moonlit street. It was all jewelled and enamelled with little spots
      and splashes of subdued red and green-blue light, and the downward orange
      glow of the high lamps&mdash;like an enchanted dream-street peopled by
      countless moving shapes, which only came to earth-reality when seen close
      to. The painter drew his breath in with a hiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what beauty! And they don&rsquo;t see it&mdash;not one in a
      thousand! Pity, isn&rsquo;t it? Beauty is the holy thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort, in his turn, shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Every man to his vision!&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;My leg&rsquo;s beginning to bother me; I&rsquo;m afraid I must take a cab.
      Here&rsquo;s my address; any time you like to come. I&rsquo;m often in about seven. I
      can&rsquo;t take you anywhere, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks, monsieur; but I go north. I loved your words about the
      pack. I often wake at night and hear the howling of all the packs of the
      world. Those who are by nature gentle nowadays feel they are strangers in
      a far land. Good night, monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took off his queer hat, bowed low, and crossed out into the Strand,
      like one who had come in a dream, and faded out with the waking. Fort
      hailed a cab, and went home, still seeing Noel&rsquo;s face. There was one, if
      you liked, waiting to be thrown to the wolves, waiting for the world&rsquo;s
      pack to begin howling round her&mdash;that lovely child; and the first,
      the loudest of all the pack, perhaps, must be her own father, the lean,
      dark figure with the gentle face, and the burnt bright eyes. What a
      ghastly business! His dreams that night were not such as Leila would have
      approved.

      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      When in the cupboard there is a real and very bony skeleton, carefully
      kept from the sight of a single member of the family, the position of that
      member is liable to become lonely. But Pierson, who had been lonely
      fifteen years, did not feel it so much, perhaps, as most men would have.
      In his dreamy nature there was a curious self-sufficiency, which only
      violent shocks disturbed, and he went on with his routine of duty, which
      had become for him as set as the pavements he trod on his way to and from
      it. It was not exactly true, as the painter had said, that this routine
      did not bring him into touch with life. After all he saw people when they
      were born, when they married, when they died. He helped them when they
      wanted money, and when they were ill; he told their children Bible stories
      on Sunday afternoons; he served those who were in need with soup and bread
      from his soup kitchen. He never spared himself in any way, and his ears
      were always at the service of their woes. And yet he did not understand
      them, and they knew that. It was as though he, or they, were colour-blind.
      The values were all different. He was seeing one set of objects, they
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      One street of his parish touched a main line of thoroughfare, and formed a
      little part of the new hunting-grounds of women, who, chased forth from
      their usual haunts by the Authorities under pressure of the country&rsquo;s
      danger, now pursued their calling in the dark. This particular evil had
      always been a sort of nightmare to Pierson. The starvation which ruled his
      own existence inclined him to a particularly severe view and severity was
      not his strong point. In consequence there was ever within him a sort of
      very personal and poignant struggle going on beneath that seeming attitude
      of rigid disapproval. He joined the hunters, as it were, because he was
      afraid-not, of course, of his own instincts, for he was fastidious, a
      gentleman, and a priest, but of being lenient to a sin, to something which
      God abhorred: He was, as it were, bound to take a professional view of
      this particular offence. When in his walks abroad he passed one of these
      women, he would unconsciously purse his lips, and frown. The darkness of
      the streets seemed to lend them such power, such unholy sovereignty over
      the night. They were such a danger to the soldiers, too; and in turn, the
      soldiers were such a danger to the lambs of his flock. Domestic disasters
      in his parish came to his ears from time to time; cases of young girls
      whose heads were turned by soldiers, so that they were about to become
      mothers. They seemed to him pitiful indeed; but he could not forgive them
      for their giddiness, for putting temptation in the way of brave young men,
      fighting, or about to fight. The glamour which surrounded soldiers was not
      excuse enough. When the babies were born, and came to his notice, he
      consulted a Committee he had formed, of three married and two maiden
      ladies, who visited the mothers, and if necessary took the babies into a
      creche; for those babies had a new value to the country, and were not&mdash;poor
      little things!&mdash;to be held responsible for their mothers&rsquo; faults. He
      himself saw little of the young mothers; shy of them, secretly afraid,
      perhaps, of not being censorious enough. But once in a way Life set him
      face to face with one.
    </p>
    <p>
      On New Year&rsquo;s Eve he was sitting in his study after tea, at that hour
      which he tried to keep for his parishioners, when a Mrs. Mitchett was
      announced, a small bookseller&rsquo;s wife, whom he knew for an occasional
      Communicant. She came in, accompanied by a young dark-eyed girl in a loose
      mouse-coloured coat. At his invitation they sat down in front of the long
      bookcase on the two green leather chairs which had grown worn in the
      service of the parish; and, screwed round in his chair at the bureau, with
      his long musician&rsquo;s fingers pressed together, he looked at them and
      waited. The woman had taken out her handkerchief, and was wiping her eyes;
      but the girl sat quiet, as the mouse she somewhat resembled in that coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Mitchett?&rdquo; He said gently, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman put away her handkerchief, sniffed resolutely, and began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ilda, sir. Such a thing Mitchett and me never could &lsquo;ave expected,
      comin&rsquo; on us so sudden. I thought it best to bring &lsquo;er round, poor girl.
      Of course, it&rsquo;s all the war. I&rsquo;ve warned &lsquo;er a dozen times; but there it
      is, comin&rsquo; next month, and the man in France.&rdquo; Pierson instinctively
      averted his gaze from the girl, who had not moved her eyes from his face,
      which she scanned with a seeming absence of interest, as if she had long
      given up thinking over her lot, and left it now to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is sad,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;very, very sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Mitchett; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I tell &lsquo;Ilda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s glance, lowered for a second, resumed its impersonal scrutiny
      of Pierson&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the man&rsquo;s name and regiment? Perhaps we can get leave for him to
      come home and marry Hilda at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mitchett sniffed. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t give it, sir. Now, &lsquo;Ilda, give it to Mr.
      Pierson.&rdquo; And her voice had a real note of entreaty. The girl shook her
      head. Mrs. Mitchett murmured dolefully: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s &lsquo;ow she is, sir; not a
      word will she say. And as I tell her, we can only think there must &lsquo;ave
      been more than one. And that does put us to shame so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But still the girl made no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak to her, sir; I&rsquo;m really at my wit&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you tell us?&rdquo; said Pierson. &ldquo;The man will want to do the right
      thing, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook her head, and spoke for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mitchett&rsquo;s face twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;Think of that! She&rsquo;s never said as much to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not know his name?&rdquo; Pierson murmured. &ldquo;But how&mdash;how could you&mdash;&rdquo;
       he stopped, but his face had darkened. &ldquo;Surely you would never have done
      such a thing without affection? Come, tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; the girl repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s these Parks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mitchett, from behind her handkerchief. &ldquo;And
      to think that this&rsquo;ll be our first grandchild and all! &lsquo;Ilda is difficult;
      as quiet, as quiet; but that stubborn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson looked at the girl, who seemed, if anything, less interested than
      ever. This impenetrability and something mulish in her attitude annoyed
      him. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how you could so have forgotten yourself.
      It&rsquo;s truly grievous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mitchett murmured: &ldquo;Yes, sir; the girls gets it into their heads that
      there&rsquo;s going to be no young men for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the girl sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson&rsquo;s lips grew tighter. &ldquo;Well, what can I do for you, Mrs. Mitchett?&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;Does your daughter come to church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mitchett shook her head mournfully. &ldquo;Never since she had her byke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson rose from his chair. The old story! Control and discipline
      undermined, and these bitter apples the result!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you need our creche, you have only to come to me,&rdquo;
       and he turned to the girl. &ldquo;And you&mdash;won&rsquo;t you let this dreadful
      experience move your heart? My dear girl, we must all master ourselves,
      our passions, and our foolish wilfulness, especially in these times when
      our country needs us strong, and self-disciplined, not thinking of
      ourselves. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re a good girl at heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s dark eyes, unmoved from his face, roused in him a spasm of
      nervous irritation. &ldquo;Your soul is in great danger, and you&rsquo;re very
      unhappy, I can see. Turn to God for help, and in His mercy everything will
      be made so different for you&mdash;so very different! Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl said with a sort of surprising quietness: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the
      baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remark staggered him, almost as if she had uttered a hideous oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ilda was in munitions,&rdquo; said her mother in an explanatory voice:
      &ldquo;earnin&rsquo; a matter of four pound a week. Oh! dear, it is a waste an&rsquo; all!&rdquo;
       A queer, rather terrible little smile curled Pierson&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A judgment!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good evening, Mrs. Mitchett. Good evening, Hilda.
      If you want me when the time comes, send for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood up; he shook hands with them; and was suddenly aware that the
      door was open, and Noel standing there. He had heard no sound; and how
      long she had been there he could not tell. There was a singular fixity in
      her face and attitude. She was staring at the girl, who, as she passed,
      lifted her face, so that the dark eyes and the grey eyes met. The door was
      shut, and Noel stood there alone with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you early, my child?&rdquo; said Pierson. &ldquo;You came in very quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight shock went through him at the tone of her voice; her face had
      that possessed look which he always dreaded. &ldquo;What did you hear?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you say: &lsquo;A judgment!&rsquo; You&rsquo;ll say the same to me, won&rsquo;t you?
      Only, I do want my baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was standing with her back to the door, over which a dark curtain
      hung; her face looked young and small against its stuff, her eyes very
      large. With one hand she plucked at her blouse, just over her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson stared at her, and gripped the back of the chair he had been
      sitting in. A lifetime of repression served him in the half-realised
      horror of that moment. He stammered out the single word&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true,&rdquo; she said, turned round, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson had a sort of vertigo; if he had moved, he must have fallen down.
      Nollie! He slid round and sank into his chair, and by some horrible cruel
      fiction of his nerves, he seemed to feel Noel on his knee, as, when a
      little girl, she had been wont to sit, with her fair hair fluffing against
      his cheek. He seemed to feel that hair tickling his skin; it used to be
      the greatest comfort he had known since her mother died. At that moment
      his pride shrivelled like a flower held to a flame; all that abundant
      secret pride of a father who loves and admires, who worships still a dead
      wife in the children she has left him; who, humble by nature, yet never
      knows how proud he is till the bitter thing happens; all the long pride of
      the priest who, by dint of exhortation and remonstrance has coated himself
      in a superiority he hardly suspects&mdash;all this pride shrivelled in
      him. Then something writhed and cried within, as a tortured beast cries,
      at loss to know why it is being tortured. How many times has not a man
      used those words: &ldquo;My God! My God! Why hast Thou forsaken me!&rdquo; He sprang
      up and tried to pace his way out of this cage of confusion: His thoughts
      and feelings made the strangest medley, spiritual and worldly&mdash;Social
      ostracism&mdash;her soul in peril&mdash;a trial sent by God! The future!
      Imagination failed him. He went to his little piano, opened it, closed it
      again; took his hat, and stole out. He walked fast, without knowing where.
      It was very cold&mdash;a clear, bitter evening. Silent rapid motion in the
      frosty air was some relief. As Noel had fled from him, having uttered her
      news, so did he fly from her. The afflicted walk fast. He was soon down by
      the river, and turned West along its wall. The moon was up, bright and
      nearly full, and the steel-like shimmer of its light burnished the ebbing
      water. A cruel night! He came to the Obelisk, and leaned against it,
      overcome by a spasm of realisation. He seemed to see his dead wife&rsquo;s face
      staring at him out of the past, like an accusation. &ldquo;How have you cared
      for Nollie, that she should have come to this?&rdquo; It became the face of the
      moonlit sphinx, staring straight at him, the broad dark face with wide
      nostrils, cruel lips, full eyes blank of pupils, all livened and whitened
      by the moonlight&mdash;an embodiment of the marvellous unseeing energy of
      Life, twisting and turning hearts without mercy. He gazed into those eyes
      with a sort of scared defiance. The great clawed paws of the beast, the
      strength and remorseless serenity of that crouching creature with human
      head, made living by his imagination and the moonlight, seemed to him like
      a temptation to deny God, like a refutation of human virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the sense of beauty stirred in him; he moved where he could see its
      flanks coated in silver by the moonlight, the ribs and the great muscles,
      and the tail with tip coiled over the haunch, like the head of a serpent.
      It was weirdly living; fine and cruel, that great man-made thing. It
      expressed something in the soul of man, pitiless and remote from love&mdash;or
      rather, the remorselessness which man had seen, lurking within man&rsquo;s fate.
      Pierson recoiled from it, and resumed his march along the Embankment,
      almost deserted in the bitter cold. He came to where, in the opening of
      the Underground railway, he could see the little forms of people moving,
      little orange and red lights glowing. The sight arrested him by its warmth
      and motion. Was it not all a dream? That woman and her daughter, had they
      really come? Had not Noel been but an apparition, her words a trick which
      his nerves had played him? Then, too vividly again, he saw her face
      against the dark stuff of the curtain, the curve of her hand plucking at
      her blouse, heard the sound of his own horrified: &ldquo;Nollie!&rdquo; No illusion,
      no deception! The edifice of his life was in the dust. And a queer and
      ghastly company of faces came about him; faces he had thought friendly, of
      good men and women whom he knew, yet at that moment did not know, all
      gathered round Noel, with fingers pointing at her. He staggered back from
      that vision, could not bear it, could not recognise this calamity. With a
      sort of comfort, yet an aching sense of unreality, his mind flew to all
      those summer holidays spent in Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall, Wales, by
      mountain and lake, with his two girls; what sunsets, and turning leaves,
      birds, beasts, and insects they had watched together! From their youthful
      companionship, their eagerness, their confidence in him, he had known so
      much warmth and pleasure. If all those memories were true, surely this
      could not be true. He felt suddenly that he must hurry back, go straight
      to Noel, tell her that she had been cruel to him, or assure himself that,
      for the moment, she had been insane: His temper rose suddenly, took fire.
      He felt anger against her, against every one he knew, against life itself.
      Thrusting his hands deep into the pockets of his thin black overcoat, he
      plunged into that narrow glowing tunnel of the station booking-office,
      which led back to the crowded streets. But by the time he reached home his
      anger had evaporated; he felt nothing but utter lassitude. It was nine
      o&rsquo;clock, and the maids had cleared the dining table. In despair Noel had
      gone up to her room. He had no courage left, and sat down supperless at
      his little piano, letting his fingers find soft painful harmonies, so that
      Noel perhaps heard the faint far thrumming of that music through uneasy
      dreams. And there he stayed, till it became time for him to go forth to
      the Old Year&rsquo;s Midnight Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned, Pierson wrapped himself in a rug and lay down on the old
      sofa in his study. The maid, coming in next morning to &ldquo;do&rdquo; the grate,
      found him still asleep. She stood contemplating him in awe; a broad-faced,
      kindly, fresh-coloured girl. He lay with his face resting on his hand, his
      dark, just grizzling hair unruffled, as if he had not stirred all night;
      his other hand clutched the rug to his chest, and his booted feet
      protruded beyond it. To her young eyes he looked rather appallingly
      neglected. She gazed with interest at the hollows in his cheeks, and the
      furrows in his brow, and the lips, dark-moustached and bearded, so tightly
      compressed, even in sleep. Being holy didn&rsquo;t make a man happy, it seemed!
      What fascinated her were the cindery eyelashes resting on the cheeks, the
      faint movement of face and body as he breathed, the gentle hiss of breath
      escaping through the twitching nostrils. She moved nearer, bending down
      over him, with the childlike notion of counting those lashes. Her lips
      parted in readiness to say: &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; if he waked. Something in his face, and
      the little twitches which passed over it, made her feel &ldquo;that sorry&rdquo; for
      him. He was a gentleman, had money, preached to her every Sunday, and was
      not so very old&mdash;what more could a man want? And yet&mdash;he looked
      so tired, with those cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pitied him; helpless and lonely he seemed to her, asleep there instead
      of going to bed properly. And sighing, she tiptoed towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Bessie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned: &ldquo;Yes, sir. I&rsquo;m sorry I woke you, sir. &lsquo;Appy New Year,
      sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes. A Happy New Year, Bessie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw his usual smile, saw it die, and a fixed look come on his face; it
      scared her, and she hurried away. Pierson had remembered. For full five
      minutes he lay there staring at nothing. Then he rose, folded the rug
      mechanically, and looked at the clock. Eight! He went upstairs, knocked on
      Noel&rsquo;s door, and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blinds were drawn up, but she was still in bed. He stood looking down
      at her. &ldquo;A Happy New Year, my child!&rdquo; he said; and he trembled all over,
      shivering visibly. She looked so young and innocent, so round-faced and
      fresh, after her night&rsquo;s sleep, that the thought sprang up in him again:
      &lsquo;It must have been a dream!&rsquo; She did not move, but a slow flush came up in
      her cheeks. No dream&mdash;dream! He said tremulously: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t realise. I&mdash;I
      hoped I had heard wrong. Didn&rsquo;t I, Nollie? Didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She just shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me&mdash;everything,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw her lips moving, and caught the murmur: &ldquo;There &lsquo;s nothing more.
      Gratian and George know, and Leila. It can&rsquo;t be undone, Daddy. Perhaps I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to make sure, if you hadn&rsquo;t tried to stop Cyril and
      me&mdash;and I&rsquo;m glad sometimes, because I shall have something of his&mdash;&rdquo;
       She looked up at him. &ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s the same, really; only, there&rsquo;s no
      ring. It&rsquo;s no good talking to me now, as if I hadn&rsquo;t been thinking of this
      for ages. I&rsquo;m used to anything you can say; I&rsquo;ve said it to myself, you
      see. There&rsquo;s nothing but to make the best of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hot hand came out from under the bedclothes, and clutched his very
      tight. Her flush had deepened, and her eyes seemed to him to glitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Daddy! You do look tired! Haven&rsquo;t you been to bed? Poor Daddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That hot clutch, and the words: &ldquo;Poor Daddy!&rdquo; brought tears into his eyes.
      They rolled slowly down to his beard, and he covered his face with the
      other hand. Her grip tightened convulsively; suddenly she dragged it to
      her lips, kissed it, and let it drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said, and turned away her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson effaced his emotion, and said quite calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you wish to be at home, my dear, or to go elsewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel had begun to toss her head on her pillow, like a feverish child whose
      hair gets in its eyes and mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know; what does it matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kestrel; would you like to go there? Your aunt&mdash;I could write to
      her.&rdquo; Noel stared at him a moment; a struggle seemed going on within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I would. Only, not Uncle Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps your uncle would come up here, and keep me company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face away, and that tossing movement of the limbs beneath
      the clothes began again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;anywhere&mdash;it
      doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson put his chilly hand on her forehead. &ldquo;Gently!&rdquo; he said, and knelt
      down by the bed. &ldquo;Merciful Father,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;give us strength to bear
      this dreadful trial. Keep my beloved child safe, and bring her peace; and
      give me to understand how I have done wrong, how I have failed towards
      Thee, and her. In all things chasten and strengthen her, my child, and
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts moved on in the confused, inarticulate suspense of prayer,
      till he heard her say: &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t failed; why do you talk of failing&mdash;it
      isn&rsquo;t true; and don&rsquo;t pray for me, Daddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson raised himself, and moved back from the bed. Her words confounded
      him, yet he was afraid to answer. She pushed her head deep into the
      pillow, and lay looking up at the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have a son; Cyril won&rsquo;t quite have died. And I don&rsquo;t want to be
      forgiven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dimly perceived what long dumb processes of thought and feeling had
      gone on in her to produce this hardened state of mind, which to him seemed
      almost blasphemous. And in the very midst of this turmoil in his heart, he
      could not help thinking how lovely her face looked, lying back so that the
      curve of her throat was bared, with the short tendrils of hair coiling
      about it. That flung-back head, moving restlessly from side to side in the
      heat of the soft pillow, had such a passion of protesting life in it! And
      he kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to know it was all me. But I can&rsquo;t pretend. Of course I&rsquo;ll try
      and not let it hurt you more than I possibly can. I&rsquo;m sorry for you, poor
      Daddy; oh! I&rsquo;m sorry for you!&rdquo; With a movement incredibly lithe and swift,
      she turned and pressed her face down in the pillow, so that all he could
      see was her tumbled hair and the bedclothes trembling above her shoulders.
      He tried to stroke that hair, but she shook her head free, and he stole
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not come to breakfast; and when his own wretched meal was over,
      the mechanism of his professional life caught him again at once. New
      Year&rsquo;s Day! He had much to do. He had, before all, to be of a cheerful
      countenance before his flock, to greet all and any with an air of hope and
      courage.

    <p>
      Thirza Pierson, seeing her brother-in-law&rsquo;s handwriting, naturally said:
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter from Ted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob Pierson, with a mouth full of sausage, as naturally responded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In reading on, she found that to answer that question was one of the most
      difficult tasks ever set her. Its news moved and disturbed her deeply.
      Under her wing this disaster had happened! Down here had been wrought this
      most deplorable miracle, fraught with such dislocation of lives! Noel&rsquo;s
      face, absorbed and passionate, outside the door of her room on the night
      when Cyril Morland went away&mdash;her instinct had been right!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants you to go up and stay with him, Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not both of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants Nollie to come down to me; she&rsquo;s not well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not well? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To tell him seemed disloyalty to her sex; not to tell him, disloyalty to
      her husband. A simple consideration of fact and not of principle, decided
      her. He would certainly say in a moment: &lsquo;Here! Pitch it over!&rsquo; and she
      would have to. She said tranquilly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember that night when Cyril Morland went away, and Noel behaved so
      strangely. Well, my dear; she is going to have a child at the beginning of
      April. The poor boy is dead, Bob; he died for the Country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw the red tide flow up into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Edward is dreadfully upset. We must do what we can. I blame myself.&rdquo;
       By instinct she used those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blame yourself? Stuff! That young&mdash;!&rdquo; He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirza said quietly: &ldquo;No, Bob; of the two, I&rsquo;m sure it was Noel; she was
      desperate that day. Don&rsquo;t you remember her face? Oh! this war! It&rsquo;s turned
      the whole world upside down. That&rsquo;s the only comfort; nothing&rsquo;s normal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob Pierson possessed beyond most men the secret of happiness, for he was
      always absorbed in the moment, to the point of unself-consciousness.
      Eating an egg, cutting down a tree, sitting on a Tribunal, making up his
      accounts, planting potatoes, looking at the moon, riding his cob, reading
      the Lessons&mdash;no part of him stood aside to see how he was doing it,
      or wonder why he was doing it, or not doing it better. He grew like a
      cork-tree, and acted like a sturdy and well-natured dog. His griefs,
      angers, and enjoyments were simple as a child&rsquo;s, or as his somewhat noisy
      slumbers. They were notably well-suited, for Thirza had the same secret of
      happiness, though her, absorption in the moment did not&mdash;as became a
      woman&mdash;prevent her being conscious of others; indeed, such formed the
      chief subject of her absorptions. One might say that they neither of them
      had philosophy yet were as philosophic a couple as one could meet on this
      earth of the self-conscious. Daily life to these two was still of simple
      savour. To be absorbed in life&mdash;the queer endless tissue of moments
      and things felt and done and said and made, the odd inspiriting
      conjunctions of countless people&mdash;was natural to them; but they never
      thought whether they were absorbed or not, or had any particular attitude
      to Life or Death&mdash;a great blessing at the epoch in which they were
      living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob Pierson, then, paced the room, so absorbed in his dismay and concern,
      that he was almost happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what a ghastly thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie, of all people! I feel perfectly wretched, Thirza; wretched beyond
      words.&rdquo; But with each repetition his voice grew cheerier, and Thirza felt
      that he was already over the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your coffee&rsquo;s getting cold!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you advise? Shall I go up, heh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll be a godsend to poor Ted; you&rsquo;ll keep his spirits up. Eve
      won&rsquo;t get any leave till Easter; and I can be quite alone, and see to
      Nollie here. The servants can have a holiday&mdash;, Nurse and I will run
      the house together. I shall enjoy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good woman, Thirza!&rdquo; Taking his wife&rsquo;s hand, he put it to his
      lips. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t another woman like you in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thirza&rsquo;s eyes smiled. &ldquo;Pass me your cup; I&rsquo;ll give you some fresh coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was decided to put the plan into operation at mid-month, and she bent
      all her wits to instilling into her husband the thought that a baby more
      or less was no great matter in a world which already contained twelve
      hundred million people. With a man&rsquo;s keener sense of family propriety, he
      could not see that this baby would be the same as any other baby. &ldquo;By
      heaven!&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;I simply can&rsquo;t get used to it; in our family! And
      Ted a parson! What the devil shall we do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Nollie will let us, why shouldn&rsquo;t we adopt it? It&rsquo;ll be something to
      take my thoughts off the boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea! But Ted&rsquo;s a funny fellow. He&rsquo;ll have some doctrine of
      atonement, or other in his bonnet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; said Thirza with asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of sojourning in town for a spell was not unpleasant to Bob
      Pierson. His Tribunal work was over, his early, potatoes in, and he had
      visions of working for the Country, of being a special constable, and
      dining at his Club. The nearer he was to the front, and the more he could
      talk about the war, the greater the service he felt he would be doing. He
      would ask for a job where his brains would be of use. He regretted keenly
      that Thirza wouldn&rsquo;t be with him; a long separation like this would be a
      great trial. And he would sigh and run his fingers through his whiskers.
      Still for the Country, and for Nollie, one must put up with it!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Thirza finally saw him into the train, tears stood in the eyes of
      both, for they were honestly attached, and knew well enough that this job,
      once taken in hand, would have to be seen through; a three months&rsquo;
      separation at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall write every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So shall I, Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t fret, old girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only if you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be up at 5.5, and she&rsquo;ll be down at 4.50. Give us a kiss&mdash;damn
      the porters. God bless you! I suppose she&rsquo;d mind if&mdash;I&mdash;were to
      come down now and then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she would. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;well, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Yes; I do.&rdquo; And he really did; for underneath, he had true delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her last words: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very sweet, Bob,&rdquo; remained in his ears all the way
      to Severn Junction.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back to the house, emptied of her husband, daughter, boys, and
      maids; only the dogs left and the old nurse whom she had taken into
      confidence. Even in that sheltered, wooded valley it was very cold this
      winter. The birds hid themselves, not one flower bloomed, and the
      red-brown river was full and swift. The sound of trees being felled for
      trench props, in the wood above the house resounded all day long in the
      frosty air. She meant to do the cooking herself; and for the rest of the
      morning and early afternoon she concocted nice things, and thought out how
      she herself would feel if she were Noel and Noel she, so as to smooth out
      of the way anything which would hurt the girl. In the afternoon she went
      down to the station in the village car, the same which had borne Cyril
      Morland away that July night, for their coachman had been taken for the
      army, and the horses were turned out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel looked tired and white, but calm&mdash;too calm. Her face seemed to
      Thirza to have fined down, and with those brooding eyes, to be more
      beautiful. In the car she possessed herself of the girl&rsquo;s hand, and
      squeezed it hard; their only allusion to the situation, except Noel&rsquo;s
      formal:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you so much, Auntie, for having me; it&rsquo;s most awfully sweet of you
      and Uncle Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one in the house, my dear, except old Nurse. It&rsquo;ll be very
      dull for you; but I thought I&rsquo;d teach you to cook; it&rsquo;s rather useful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile which slipped on to Noel&rsquo;s face gave Thirza quite a turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had assigned the girl a different room, and had made it
      extraordinarily cheerful with a log fire, chrysanthemums, bright copper
      candlesticks, warming-pans, and such like.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went up with her at bedtime, and standing before the fire, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Nollie, I absolutely refuse to regard this as any sort of
      tragedy. To bring life into the worlds in these days, no matter how, ought
      to make anyone happy. I only wish I could do it again, then I should feel
      some use. Good night dear; and if you want anything, knock on the wall.
      I&rsquo;m next door. Bless you!&rdquo; She saw that the girl was greatly moved,
      underneath her pale mask; and went out astonished at her niece&rsquo;s powers of
      self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not sleep at all well; for in imagination, she kept on seeing
      Noel turning from side to side in the big bed, and those great eyes of
      hers staring at the dark.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      The meeting of the brothers Pierson took place at the dinner-hour, and was
      characterised by a truly English lack of display. They were so extremely
      different, and had been together so little since early days in their old
      Buckinghamshire home, that they were practically strangers, with just the
      potent link of far-distant memories in common. It was of these they
      talked, and about the war. On this subject they agreed in the large, and
      differed in the narrow. For instance, both thought they knew about Germany
      and other countries, and neither of course had any real knowledge of any
      country outside their own; for, though both had passed through
      considerable tracts of foreign ground at one time or another, they had
      never remarked anything except its surface,&mdash;its churches, and its
      sunsets. Again, both assumed that they were democrats, but neither knew
      the meaning of the word, nor felt that the working man could be really
      trusted; and both revered Church and, King: Both disliked conscription,
      but considered it necessary. Both favoured Home Rule for Ireland, but
      neither thought it possible to grant it. Both wished for the war to end,
      but were for prosecuting it to Victory, and neither knew what they meant
      by that word. So much for the large. On the narrower issues, such as
      strategy, and the personality of their country&rsquo;s leaders, they were
      opposed. Edward was a Westerner, Robert an Easterner, as was natural in
      one who had lived twenty-five years in Ceylon. Edward favoured the fallen
      government, Robert the risen. Neither had any particular reasons for their
      partisanship except what he had read in the journals. After all&mdash;what
      other reasons could they have had? Edward disliked the Harmsworth Press;
      Robert thought it was doing good. Robert was explosive, and rather vague;
      Edward dreamy, and a little didactic. Robert thought poor Ted looking like
      a ghost; Edward thought poor Bob looking like the setting sun. Their faces
      were indeed as curiously contrasted as their views and voices; the
      pale-dark, hollowed, narrow face of Edward, with its short, pointed beard,
      and the red-skinned, broad, full, whiskered face of Robert. They parted
      for the night with an affectionate hand-clasp. So began a queer
      partnership which consisted, as the days went on, of half an hour&rsquo;s
      companionship at breakfast, each reading the paper; and of dinner together
      perhaps three times a week. Each thought his brother very odd, but
      continued to hold the highest opinion of him. And, behind it all, the deep
      tribal sense that they stood together in trouble, grew. But of that
      trouble they never spoke, though not seldom Robert would lower his
      journal, and above the glasses perched on his well-shaped nose,
      contemplate his brother, and a little frown of sympathy would ridge his
      forehead between his bushy eyebrows. And once in a way he would catch
      Edward&rsquo;s eyes coming off duty from his journal, to look, not at his
      brother, but at&mdash;the skeleton; when that happened, Robert would
      adjust his glasses hastily, damn the newspaper type, and apologise to
      Edward for swearing. And he would think: &lsquo;Poor Ted! He ought to drink
      port, and&mdash;and enjoy himself, and forget it. What a pity he&rsquo;s a
      parson!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In his letters to Thirza he would deplore Edward&rsquo;s asceticism. &ldquo;He eats
      nothing, he drinks nothing, he smokes a miserable cigarette once in a blue
      moon. He&rsquo;s as lonely as a coot; it&rsquo;s a thousand pities he ever lost his
      wife. I expect to see his wings sprout any day; but&mdash;dash it all I&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s got the flesh to grow them on. Send him up some clotted
      cream; I&rsquo;ll see if I can get him to eat it.&rdquo; When the cream came, he got
      Edward to eat some the first morning, and at tea time found that he had
      finished it himself. &ldquo;We never talk about Nollie,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always
      meaning to have it out with him and tell him to buck up, but when it comes
      to the point I dry up; because, after all, I feel it too; it sticks in my
      gizzard horribly. We Piersons are pretty old, and we&rsquo;ve always been
      respectable, ever since St. Bartholomew, when that Huguenot chap came over
      and founded us. The only black sheep I ever heard of is Cousin Leila. By
      the way, I saw her the other day; she came round here to see Ted. I
      remember going to stay with her and her first husband; young Fane, at
      Simla, when I was coming home, just before we were married. Phew! That was
      a queer menage; all the young chaps fluttering round her, and young Fane
      looking like a cynical ghost. Even now she can&rsquo;t help setting her cap a
      little at Ted, and he swallows her whole; thinks her a devoted creature
      reformed to the nines with her hospital and all that. Poor old Ted; he is
      the most dreamy chap that ever was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had Gratian and her husband up for the week-end,&rdquo; he wrote a
      little later; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like her so well as Nollie; too serious and
      downright for me. Her husband seems a sensible fellow, though; but the
      devil of a free-thinker. He and poor Ted are like cat and dog. We had
      Leila in to dinner again on Saturday, and a man called Fort came too.
      She&rsquo;s sweet on him, I could see with half an eye, but poor old Ted can&rsquo;t.
      The doctor and Ted talked up hill and down dale. The doctor said a thing
      which struck me. &lsquo;What divides us from the beasts? Will power: nothing
      else. What&rsquo;s this war, really, but a death carnival of proof that man&rsquo;s
      will is invincible?&rsquo; I stuck it down to tell you, when I got upstairs.
      He&rsquo;s a clever fellow. I believe in God, as you know, but I must say when
      it comes to an argument, poor old Ted does seem a bit weak, with his:
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re told this,&rsquo; and &lsquo;We&rsquo;re told that: Nobody mentioned Nollie. I must
      have the whole thing out with Ted; we must know how to act when it&rsquo;s all
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But not till the middle of March, when the brothers had been sitting
      opposite each other at meals for two months, was the subject broached
      between them, and then not by Robert. Edward, standing by the hearth after
      dinner, in his familiar attitude, one foot on the fender, one hand
      grasping the mantel-shelf, and his eyes fixed on the flames, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      never asked your forgiveness, Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robert, lingering at the table over his glass of port, started, looked at
      Edward&rsquo;s back in its parson&rsquo;s coat, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear old chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been very difficult to speak of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course!&rdquo; And there was a silence, while Robert&rsquo;s eyes
      travelled round the walls for inspiration. They encountered only the
      effigies of past Piersons very oily works, and fell back on the
      dining-table. Edward went on speaking to the fire:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It still seems to me incredible. Day and night I think of what it&rsquo;s my
      duty to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; ejaculated Robert. &ldquo;Leave the baby with Thirza; we&rsquo;ll take care
      of it, and when Nollie&rsquo;s fit, let her go back to work in a hospital again.
      She&rsquo;ll soon get over it.&rdquo; He saw his brother shake his head, and thought:
      &lsquo;Ah! yes; now there&rsquo;s going to be some d&mdash;d conscientious
      complication.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward turned round on him: &ldquo;That is very sweet of you both, but it would
      be wrong and cowardly for me to allow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The resentment which springs up in fathers when other fathers dispose of
      young lives, rose in Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dash it all, my dear Ted, that&rsquo;s for Nollie to say. She&rsquo;s a woman now,
      remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile went straying about in the shadows of his brother&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;A
      woman? Little Nollie! Bob, I&rsquo;ve made a terrible mess of it with my girls.&rdquo;
       He hid his lips with his hand, and turned again to the flames. Robert felt
      a lump in his throat. &ldquo;Oh! Hang it, old boy, I don&rsquo;t think that. What else
      could you have done? You take too much on yourself. After all, they&rsquo;re
      fine girls. I&rsquo;m sure Nollie&rsquo;s a darling. It&rsquo;s these modern notions, and
      this war. Cheer up! It&rsquo;ll all dry straight.&rdquo; He went up to his brother and
      put a hand on his shoulder. Edward seemed to stiffen under that touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing comes straight,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;unless it&rsquo;s faced; you know that,
      Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robert&rsquo;s face was a study at that moment. His cheeks filled and collapsed
      again like a dog&rsquo;s when it has been rebuked. His colour deepened, and he
      rattled some money in a trouser pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something in that, of course,&rdquo; he said gruffly. &ldquo;All the same, the
      decision&rsquo;s with Nollie. We&rsquo;ll see what Thirza says. Anyway, there&rsquo;s no
      hurry. It&rsquo;s a thousand pities you&rsquo;re a parson; the trouble&rsquo;s enough
      without that:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edward shook his head. &ldquo;My position is nothing; it&rsquo;s the thought of my
      child, my wife&rsquo;s child. It&rsquo;s sheer pride; and I can&rsquo;t subdue it. I can&rsquo;t
      fight it down. God forgive me, I rebel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Robert thought: &lsquo;By George, he does take it to heart! Well, so should
      I! I do, as it is!&rsquo; He took out his pipe, and filled it, pushing the
      tobacco down and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a man of the world,&rdquo; he heard his brother say; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of touch
      with many things. It&rsquo;s almost unbearable to me to feel that I&rsquo;m joining
      with the world to condemn my own daughter; not for their reasons, perhaps&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know; I hope not, but still, I&rsquo;m against her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robert lit his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, old man!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a misfortune. But if I were you I should
      feel: &lsquo;She&rsquo;s done a wild, silly thing, but, hang it, if anybody says a
      word against her, I&rsquo;ll wring his neck.&rsquo; And what&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll feel much
      the same, when it comes to the point.&rdquo; He emitted a huge puff of smoke,
      which obscured his brother&rsquo;s face, and the blood, buzzing in his temples,
      seemed to thicken the sound of Edward&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I&rsquo;ve tried to see clearly. I have prayed to be shown what
      her duty is, and mine. It seems to me there can be no peace for her until
      she has atoned, by open suffering; that the world&rsquo;s judgment is her cross,
      and she must bear it; especially in these days, when all the world is
      facing suffering so nobly. And then it seems so hard-so bitter; my poor
      little Nollie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence, broken only by the gurgling of Robert&rsquo;s pipe, till he
      said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t follow you, Ted; no, I don&rsquo;t. I think a man should screen his
      children all he can. Talk to her as you like, but don&rsquo;t let the world do
      it. Dash it, the world&rsquo;s a rotten gabbling place. I call myself a man of
      the world, but when it comes to private matters&mdash;well, then I draw
      the line. It seems to me it seems to me inhuman. What does George Laird
      think about it? He&rsquo;s a knowing chap. I suppose you&rsquo;ve&mdash;no, I suppose
      you haven&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; For a peculiar smile had come on Edward&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should hardly ask George Laird&rsquo;s opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Robert realised suddenly the stubborn loneliness of that thin black
      figure, whose fingers were playing with a little gold cross. &lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; he
      thought, &lsquo;I believe old Ted&rsquo;s like one of those Eastern chaps who go into
      lonely places. He&rsquo;s got himself surrounded by visions of things that
      aren&rsquo;t there. He lives in unreality&mdash;something we can&rsquo;t understand. I
      shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he heard voices, like&mdash;&rsquo;who was it? Tt, tt!
      What a pity!&rsquo; Ted was deceptive. He was gentle and&mdash;all that, a
      gentleman of course, and that disguised him; but underneath; what was
      there&mdash;a regular ascetic, a fakir! And a sense of bewilderment, of
      dealing with something which he could not grasp, beset Bob Pierson, so
      that he went back to the table, and sat down again beside his port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he said rather gruffly, &ldquo;that the chicken had better be
      hatched before we count it.&rdquo; And then, sorry for his brusqueness, emptied
      his glass. As the fluid passed over his palate, he thought: &lsquo;Poor old Ted!
      He doesn&rsquo;t even drink&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t a pleasure in life, so far as I can
      see, except doing his duty, and doesn&rsquo;t even seem to know what that is.
      There aren&rsquo;t many like him&mdash;luckily! And yet I love him&mdash;pathetic
      chap!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;pathetic chap&rdquo; was still staring at the flames. 3
    </p>
    <p>
      And at this very hour, when the brothers were talking&mdash;for thought
      and feeling do pass mysteriously over the invisible wires of space Cyril
      Morland&rsquo;s son was being born of Noel, a little before his time.

    <p>
      Down by the River Wye, among plum-trees in blossom, Noel had laid her baby
      in a hammock, and stood reading a letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAREST NOLLIE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that you are strong again, I feel that I must put before you my
      feeling as to your duty in this crisis of your life. Your aunt and uncle
      have made the most kind and generous offer to adopt your little boy. I
      have known that this was in their minds for some time, and have thought it
      over day and night for weeks. In the worldly sense it would be the best
      thing, no doubt. But this is a spiritual matter. The future of our souls
      depends on how we meet the consequences of our conduct. And painful,
      dreadful, indeed, as they must be, I am driven to feel that you can only
      reach true peace by facing them in a spirit of brave humility. I want you
      to think and think&mdash;till you arrive at a certainty which satisfies
      your conscience. If you decide, as I trust you will, to come back to me
      here with your boy, I shall do all in my power to make you happy while we
      face the future together. To do as your aunt and uncle in their kindness
      wish, would, I am sore afraid, end in depriving you of the inner strength
      and happiness which God only gives to those who do their duty and try
      courageously to repair their errors. I have confidence in you, my dear
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever your most loving father,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;EDWARD PIERSON.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read it through a second time, and looked at her baby. Daddy seemed to
      think that she might be willing to part from this wonderful creature!
      Sunlight fell through the plum blossom, in an extra patchwork quilt over
      the bundle lying there, touched the baby&rsquo;s nose and mouth, so that he
      sneezed. Noel laughed, and put her lips close to his face. &lsquo;Give you up!&rsquo;
      she thought: &lsquo;Oh, no! And I&rsquo;m going to be happy too. They shan&rsquo;t stop me:
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to the letter she said simply that she was coming up; and a week
      later she went, to the dismay of her uncle and aunt. The old nurse went
      too. Everything had hitherto been so carefully watched and guarded against
      by Thirza, that Noel did not really come face to face with her position
      till she reached home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gratian, who had managed to get transferred to a London Hospital, was now
      living at home. She had provided the house with new maids against her
      sister&rsquo;s return; and though Noel was relieved not to meet her old
      familiars, she encountered with difficulty the stolid curiosity of new
      faces. That morning before she left Kestrel, her aunt had come into her
      room while she was dressing, taken her left hand and slipped a little gold
      band on to its third finger. &ldquo;To please me, Nollie, now that you&rsquo;re going,
      just for the foolish, who know nothing about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel had suffered it with the thought: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all very silly!&rsquo; But now,
      when the new maid was pouring out her hot water, she was suddenly aware of
      the girl&rsquo;s round blue eyes wandering, as it were, mechanically to her
      hand. This little hoop of gold, then, had an awful power! A rush of
      disgust came over her. All life seemed suddenly a thing of forms and sham.
      Everybody then would look at that little ring; and she was a coward,
      saving herself from them! When she was alone again, she slipped it off,
      and laid it on the washstand, where the sunlight fell. Only this little
      shining band of metal, this little yellow ring, stood between her and the
      world&rsquo;s hostile scorn! Her lips trembled. She took up the ring, and went
      to the open window; to throw it out. But she did not, uncertain and
      unhappy&mdash;half realising the cruelty of life. A knock at the door sent
      her flying back to the washstand. The visitor was Gratian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking at him,&rdquo; she said softly; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s like you, Nollie,
      except for his nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s hardly got one yet. But aren&rsquo;t his eyes intelligent? I think they&rsquo;re
      wonderful.&rdquo; She held up the ring: &ldquo;What shall I do about this, Gratian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian flushed. &ldquo;Wear it. I don&rsquo;t see why outsiders should know. For the
      sake of Dad I think you ought. There&rsquo;s the parish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel slipped the ring back on to her finger. &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell. I think I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel laughed suddenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get cynical; I can feel it in my
      bones. How is Daddy looking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very thin; Mr. Lauder is back again from the Front for a bit, and taking
      some of the work now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I hurt him very much still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s awfully pleased that you&rsquo;ve come. He&rsquo;s as sweet as he can be about
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Noel, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s dreadful. I&rsquo;m glad he wasn&rsquo;t in when
      I came. Has he told anyone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anybody knows; unless&mdash;perhaps
      Captain Fort. He came in again the other night; and somehow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel flushed. &ldquo;Leila!&rdquo; she said enigmatically. &ldquo;Have you seen her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to her flat last week with Dad&mdash;he likes her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delilah is her real name, you know. All men like her. And Captain Fort is
      her lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian gasped. Noel would say things sometimes which made her feel the
      younger of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he is,&rdquo; went on Noel in a hard voice. &ldquo;She has no men friends;
      her sort never have, only lovers. Why do you think he knows about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he asked after you he looked&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ve seen him look like that when he&rsquo;s sorry for anything. I don&rsquo;t
      care. Has Monsieur Lavendie been in lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he looks awfully unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife drugs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Nollie! How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw her once; I&rsquo;m sure she does; there was a smell; and she&rsquo;s got
      wandering eyes that go all glassy. He can paint me now, if he likes. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t let him before. Does he know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows there was something; he&rsquo;s got second sight, I think. But I mind
      him less than anybody. Is his picture of Daddy good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Powerful, but it hurts, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down and see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The picture was hung in the drawing-room, and its intense modernity made
      that old-fashioned room seem lifeless and strange. The black figure, with
      long pale fingers touching the paler piano keys, had a frightening
      actuality. The face, three-quarters full, was raised as if for
      inspiration, and the eyes rested, dreamy and unseeing, on the face of a
      girl painted and hung on a background of wall above the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the face of that girl,&rdquo; said Gratian, when they had looked at the
      picture for some time in silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Noel, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the look in his eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did he choose such a horrid, common girl? Isn&rsquo;t she fearfully
      alive, though? She looks as if she were saying: &lsquo;Cheerio!&rsquo;.rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is; it&rsquo;s awfully pathetic, I think. Poor Daddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a libel,&rdquo; said Gratian stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s what hurts. He isn&rsquo;t quite&mdash;quite all there. Will he be
      coming in soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian took her arm, and pressed it hard. &ldquo;Would you like me at dinner or
      not; I can easily be out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good to funk it. He wanted me, and now he&rsquo;s
      got me. Oh! why did he? It&rsquo;ll be awful for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried my best, but he always said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve thought so
      long about it all that I can&rsquo;t think any longer. I can only feel the
      braver course is the best. When things are bravely and humbly met, there
      will be charity and forgiveness.&rsquo;.rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Noel, &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s a saint, and he doesn&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is a saint. But one must think for oneself&mdash;one simply must.
      I can&rsquo;t believe as he does, any more; can you, Nollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. When I was going through it, I prayed; but I don&rsquo;t know
      whether I really believed. I don&rsquo;t think I mind much about that, one way
      or the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mind terribly,&rdquo; said Gratian, &ldquo;I want the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I want,&rdquo; said Noel slowly, &ldquo;except that sometimes I
      want&mdash;life; awfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the two sisters were silent, looking at each other with a sort of
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel had a fancy to put on a bright-coloured blue frock that evening, and
      at her neck she hung a Breton cross of old paste, which had belonged to
      her mother. When she had finished dressing she went into the nursery and
      stood by the baby&rsquo;s cot. The old nurse who was sitting there beside him,
      got up at once and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sleeping beautiful&mdash;the lamb. I&rsquo;ll go down and get a cup o&rsquo;
      tea, and come up, ma&rsquo;am, when the gong goes.&rdquo; In the way peculiar to those
      who have never to initiate, but only to support positions in which they
      are placed by others, she had adopted for herself the theory that Noel was
      a real war-widow. She knew the truth perfectly; for she had watched that
      hurried little romance at Kestrel, but by dint of charity and blurred
      meditations it was easy for her to imagine the marriage ceremony which
      would and should have taken place; and she was zealous that other people
      should imagine it too. It was so much more regular and natural like that,
      and &ldquo;her&rdquo; baby invested with his proper dignity. She went downstairs to
      get a &ldquo;cup o&rsquo; tea,&rdquo; thinking: &lsquo;A picture they make&mdash;that they do,
      bless his little heart; and his pretty little mother&mdash;no more than a
      child, all said and done.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel had been standing there some minutes in the failing light, absorbed
      in the face of the sleeping baby, when, raising her eyes, she saw in a
      mirror the refection of her father&rsquo;s dark figure by the door. She could
      hear him breathing as if the ascent of the stairs had tired him; and
      moving to the head of the cot, she rested her hand on it, and turned her
      face towards him. He came up and stood beside her, looking silently down
      at the baby. She saw him make the sign of the Cross above it, and the
      movement of his lips in prayer. Love for her father, and rebellion against
      this intercession for her perfect baby fought so hard in the girl&rsquo;s heart
      that she felt suffocated, and glad of the dark, so that he could not see
      her eyes. Then he took her hand and put it to his lips, but still without
      a word; and for the life of her she could not speak either. In silence, he
      kissed her forehead; and there mounted in Noel a sudden passion of longing
      to show him her pride and love for her baby. She put her finger down and
      touched one of his hands. The tiny sleeping fingers uncurled and, like
      some little sea anemone, clutched round it. She heard her father draw his
      breath in; saw him turn away quickly, silently, and go out. And she
      stayed, hardly breathing, with the hand of her baby squeezing her finger.

    <p>
      When Edward Pierson, afraid of his own emotion, left the twilit nursery,
      he slipped into his own room, and fell on his knees beside his bed,
      absorbed in the vision he had seen. That young figure in Madonna blue,
      with the halo of bright hair; the sleeping babe in the fine dusk; the
      silence, the adoration in that white room! He saw, too; a vision of the
      past, when Noel herself had been the sleeping babe within her mother&rsquo;s
      arm, and he had stood beside them, wondering and giving praise. It passed
      with its other-worldliness and the fine holiness which belongs to beauty,
      passed and left the tormenting realism of life. Ah! to live with only the
      inner meaning, spiritual and beautifed, in a rare wonderment such as he
      had experienced just now!
    </p>
    <p>
      His alarum clock, while he knelt in his narrow, monkish little room&mdash;ticked
      the evening hour away into darkness. And still he knelt, dreading to come
      back into it all, to face the world&rsquo;s eyes, and the sound of the world&rsquo;s
      tongue, and the touch of the rough, the gross, the unseemly. How could he
      guard his child? How preserve that vision in her life, in her spirit,
      about to enter such cold, rough waters? But the gong sounded; he got up,
      and went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this first family moment, which all had dreaded, was relieved, as
      dreaded moments so often are, by the unexpected appearance of the Belgian
      painter. He had a general invitation, of which he often availed himself;
      but he was so silent, and his thin, beardless face, which seemed all eyes
      and brow, so mournful, that all three felt in the presence of a sorrow
      deeper even than their own family grief. During the meal he gazed silently
      at Noel. Once he said: &ldquo;You will let me paint you now, mademoiselle, I
      hope?&rdquo; and his face brightened a little when she nodded. There was never
      much talk when he came, for any depth of discussion, even of art, brought
      out at once too wide a difference. And Pierson could never avoid a vague
      irritation with one who clearly had spirituality, but of a sort which he
      could not understand. After dinner he excused himself, and went off to his
      study. Monsieur would be happier alone with the two girls! Gratian, too,
      got up. She had remembered Noel&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;I mind him less than anybody.&rdquo;
       It was a chance for Nollie to break the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      2
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen you for a long time, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the painter,
      when they were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel was sitting in front of the empty drawing-room hearth, with her arms
      stretched out as if there had been a fire there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been away. How are you going to paint me, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that dress, mademoiselle; Just as you are now, warming yourself at the
      fire of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, fires soon go out. Mademoiselle, will you come and see my wife? She
      is ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now?&rdquo; asked Noel, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, now. She is really ill, and I have no one there. That is what I came
      to ask of your sister; but&mdash;now you are here, it&rsquo;s even better. She
      likes you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel got up. &ldquo;Wait one minute!&rdquo; she said, and ran upstairs. Her baby was
      asleep, and the old nurse dozing. Putting on a cloak and cap of grey
      rabbit&rsquo;s fur, she ran down again to the hall where the painter was
      waiting; and they went out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know if I am to blame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my wife has been no real wife
      to me since she knew I had a mistress and was no real husband to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel stared round at his face lighted by a queer, smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;from that has come her tragedy. But she should have
      known before I married her. Nothing was concealed. Bon Dieu! she should
      have known! Why cannot a woman see things as they are? My mistress,
      mademoiselle, is not a thing of flesh. It is my art. It has always been
      first with me, and always will. She has never accepted that, she is
      incapable of accepting it. I am sorry for her. But what would you? I was a
      fool to marry her. Chere mademoiselle, no troubles are anything beside the
      trouble which goes on day and night, meal after meal, year, after year,
      between two people who should never have married, because one loves too
      much and requires all, and the other loves not at all&mdash;no, not at
      all, now, it is long dead&mdash;and can give but little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you separate?&rdquo; asked Noel, wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hard to separate from one who craves for you as she craves her
      drugs&mdash;yes, she takes drugs now, mademoiselle. It is impossible for
      one who has any compassion in his soul. Besides, what would she do? We
      live from hand to mouth, in a strange land. She has no friends here, not
      one. How could I leave her while this war lasts? As well could two persons
      on a desert island separate. She is killing herself, too, with these
      drugs, and I cannot stop her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor madame!&rdquo; murmured Noel. &ldquo;Poor monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter drew his hand across his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot change my nature,&rdquo; he said in a stifled voice, &ldquo;nor she hers. So
      we go on. But life will stop suddenly some day for one of us. After all,
      it is much worse for her than for me. Enter, mademoiselle. Do not tell her
      I am going to paint you; she likes you, because you refused to let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel went up the stairs, shuddering; she had been there once before, and
      remembered that sickly scent of drugs. On the third floor they entered a
      small sitting-room whose walls were covered with paintings and drawings;
      from one corner a triangular stack of canvases jutted out. There was
      little furniture save an old red sofa, and on this was seated a stoutish
      man in the garb of a Belgian soldier, with his elbows on his knees and his
      bearded cheeks resting on his doubled fists. Beside him on the sofa,
      nursing a doll, was a little girl, who looked up at Noel. She had a most
      strange, attractive, pale little face, with pointed chin and large eyes,
      which never moved from this apparition in grey rabbits&rsquo; skins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Barra! You here!&rdquo; said the painter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, this is Monsieur Barra, a friend of ours from the front;
      and this is our landlady&rsquo;s little girl. A little refugee, too, aren&rsquo;t you,
      Chica?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child gave him a sudden brilliant smile and resumed her grave scrutiny
      of the visitor. The soldier, who had risen heavily, offered Noel one of
      his podgy hands, with a sad and heavy giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Lavendie, placing a chair for her: &ldquo;I will
      bring my wife in,&rdquo; and he went out through some double doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel sat down. The soldier had resumed his old attitude, and the little
      girl her nursing of the doll, though her big eyes still watched the
      visitor. Overcome by strangeness, Noel made no attempt to talk. And
      presently through the double doors the painter and his wife came in. She
      was a thin woman in a red wrapper, with hollow cheeks, high cheek-bones,
      and hungry eyes; her dark hair hung loose, and one hand played restlessly
      with a fold of her gown. She took Noel&rsquo;s hand; and her uplifted eyes
      seemed to dig into the girl&rsquo;s face, to let go suddenly, and flutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; she said in English. &ldquo;So Pierre brought you, to see me
      again. I remember you so well. You would not let him paint you. Ah! que
      c&rsquo;est drole! You are so pretty, too. Hein, Monsieur Barra, is not
      mademoiselle pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier gave his heavy giggle, and resumed his scrutiny of the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henriette,&rdquo; said Lavendie, &ldquo;sit down beside Chica&mdash;you must not
      stand. Sit down, mademoiselle, I beg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry you&rsquo;re not well,&rdquo; said Noel, and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter stood leaning against the wall, and his wife looked up at his
      tall, thin figure, with eyes which had in them anger, and a sort of
      cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great painter, my husband, is he not?&rdquo; she said to Noel. &ldquo;You would not
      imagine what that man can do. And how he paints&mdash;all day long; and
      all night in his head. And so you would not let him paint you, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavendie said impatiently: &ldquo;Voyons, Henriette, causez d&rsquo;autre chose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife plucked nervously at a fold in her red gown, and gave him the
      look of a dog that has been rebuked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a prisoner here, mademoiselle, I never leave the house. Here I live
      day after day&mdash;my husband is always painting. Who would go out alone
      under this grey sky of yours, and the hatreds of the war in every face? I
      prefer to keep my room. My husband goes painting; every face he sees
      interests him, except that which he sees every day. But I am a prisoner.
      Monsieur Barra is our first visitor for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier raised his face from his fists. &ldquo;Prisonnier, madame! What
      would you say if you were out there?&rdquo; And he gave his thick giggle. &ldquo;We
      are the prisoners, we others. What would you say to imprisonment by
      explosion day and night; never a minute free. Bom! Bom! Bom! Ah! les
      tranchees! It&rsquo;s not so free as all that, there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one has his own prison,&rdquo; said Lavendie bitterly. &ldquo;Mademoiselle
      even, has her prison&mdash;and little Chica, and her doll. Every one has
      his prison, Barra. Monsieur Barra is also a painter, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moi!&rdquo; said Barra, lifting his heavy hairy hand. &ldquo;I paint puddles,
      star-bombs, horses&rsquo; ribs&mdash;I paint holes and holes and holes, wire and
      wire and wire, and water&mdash;long white ugly water. I paint splinters,
      and men&rsquo;s souls naked, and men&rsquo;s bodies dead, and nightmare&mdash;nightmare&mdash;all
      day and all night&mdash;I paint them in my head.&rdquo; He suddenly ceased
      speaking and relapsed into contemplation of the carpet, with his bearded
      cheeks resting on his fists. &ldquo;And their souls as white as snow, les
      camarades,&rdquo; he added suddenly and loudly, &ldquo;millions of Belgians, English,
      French, even the Boches, with white souls. I paint those souls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little shiver ran through Noel, and she looked appealingly at Lavendie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barra,&rdquo; he said, as if the soldier were not there, &ldquo;is a great painter,
      but the Front has turned his head a little. What he says is true, though.
      There is no hatred out there. It is here that we are prisoners of hatred,
      mademoiselle; avoid hatreds&mdash;they are poison!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife put out her hand and touched the child&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we not hate?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Who killed Chica&rsquo;s father, and blew
      her home to-rags? Who threw her out into this horrible England&mdash;pardon,
      mademoiselle, but it is horrible. Ah! les Boches! If my hatred could
      destroy them there would not be one left. Even my husband was not so mad
      about his painting when we lived at home. But here&mdash;!&rdquo; Her eyes
      darted at his face again, and then sank as if rebuked. Noel saw the
      painter&rsquo;s lips move. The sick woman&rsquo;s whole figure writhed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is mania, your painting!&rdquo; She looked at Noel with a smile. &ldquo;Will you
      have some tea, mademoiselle? Monsieur Barra, some tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier said thickly: &ldquo;No, madame; in the trenches we have tea enough.
      It consoles us. But when we get away&mdash;give us wine, le bon vin; le
      bon petit vin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get some wine, Pierre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel saw from the painter&rsquo;s face that there was no wine, and perhaps no
      money to get any; but he went quickly out. She rose and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be going, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Lavendie leaned forward and clutched her wrist. &ldquo;Wait a little,
      mademoiselle. We shall have some wine, and Pierre shall take you back
      presently. You cannot go home alone&mdash;you are too pretty. Is she not,
      Monsieur Barra?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier looked up: &ldquo;What would you say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to bottles of wine
      bursting in the air, bursting red and bursting white, all day long, all
      night long? Great steel bottles, large as Chica: bits of bottles, carrying
      off men&rsquo;s heads? Bsum, garra-a-a, and a house comes down, and little bits
      of people ever so small, ever so small, tiny bits in the air and all over
      the ground. Great souls out there, madame. But I will tell you a secret,&rdquo;
       and again he gave his heavy giggle, &ldquo;all a little, little mad; nothing to
      speak of&mdash;just a little bit mad; like a watch, you know, that you can
      wind for ever. That is the discovery of this war, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said,
      addressing Noel for the first time, &ldquo;you cannot gain a great soul till you
      are a little mad.&rdquo; And lowering his piggy grey eyes at once, he resumed
      his former attitude. &ldquo;It is that madness I shall paint some day,&rdquo; he
      announced to the carpet; &ldquo;lurking in one tiny corner of each soul of all
      those millions, as it creeps, as it peeps, ever so sudden, ever so little
      when we all think it has been put to bed, here&mdash;there, now&mdash;then,
      when you least think; in and out like a mouse with bright eyes. Millions
      of men with white souls, all a little mad. A great subject, I think,&rdquo; he
      added heavily. Involuntarily Noel put her hand to her heart, which was
      beating fast. She felt quite sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been at the Front, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two years, mademoiselle. Time to go home and paint, is it not? But art&mdash;!&rdquo;
       he shrugged his heavy round shoulders, his whole bear-like body. &ldquo;A little
      mad,&rdquo; he muttered once more. &ldquo;I will tell you a story. Once in winter
      after I had rested a fortnight, I go back to the trenches at night, and I
      want some earth to fill up a hole in the ground where I was sleeping; when
      one has slept in a bed one becomes particular. Well, I scratch it from my
      parapet, and I come to something funny. I strike my briquet, and there is
      a Boche&rsquo;s face all frozen and earthy and dead and greeny-white in the
      flame from my briquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but yes, mademoiselle; true as I sit here. Very useful in the parapet&mdash;dead
      Boche. Once a man like me. But in the morning I could not stand him; we
      dug him out and buried him, and filled the hole up with other things. But
      there I stood in the night, and my face as close to his as this&rdquo;&mdash;and
      he held his thick hand a foot before his face. &ldquo;We talked of our homes; he
      had a soul, that man. &lsquo;Il me disait des choses&rsquo;, how he had suffered; and
      I, too, told him my sufferings. Dear God, we know all; we shall never know
      more than we know out there, we others, for we are mad&mdash;nothing to
      speak of, but just a little, little mad. When you see us, mademoiselle,
      walking the streets, remember that.&rdquo; And he dropped his face on to his
      fists again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence had fallen in the room-very queer and complete. The little girl
      nursed her doll, the soldier gazed at the floor, the woman&rsquo;s mouth moved
      stealthily, and in Noel the thought rushed continually to the verge of
      action: &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I get up and run downstairs?&rsquo; But she sat on, hypnotised
      by that silence, till Lavendie reappeared with a bottle and four glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To drink our health, and wish us luck, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel raised the glass he had given her. &ldquo;I wish you all happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, mademoiselle,&rdquo; the two men murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drank a little, and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Lavendie, &ldquo;if you must go, I will see you
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel took Madame Lavendie&rsquo;s hand; it was cold, and returned no pressure;
      her eyes had the glazed look that she remembered. The soldier had put his
      empty glass down on the floor, and was regarding it unconscious of her.
      Noel turned quickly to the door; the last thing she saw was the little
      girl nursing her doll.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the street the painter began at once in his rapid French:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought not to have asked you to come, mademoiselle; I did not know our
      friend Barra was there. Besides, my wife is not fit to receive a lady;
      vous voyez qu&rsquo;il y a de la manie dans cette pauvre tote. I should not have
      asked you; but I was so miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Noel, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In our home over there she had interests. In this great town she can only
      nurse her grief against me. Ah! this war! It seems to me we are all in the
      stomach of a great coiling serpent. We lie there, being digested. In a way
      it is better out there in the trenches; they are beyond hate, they have
      attained a height that we have not. It is wonderful how they still can be
      for going on till they have beaten the Boche; that is curious and it is
      very great. Did Barra tell you how, when they come back&mdash;all these
      fighters&mdash;they are going to rule, and manage the future of the world?
      But it will not be so. They will mix in with life, separate&mdash;be
      scattered, and they will be ruled as they were before. The tongue and the
      pen will rule them: those who have not seen the war will rule them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&rsquo; cried Noel, &ldquo;surely they will be the bravest and strongest in the
      future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War makes men simple,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;elemental; life in peace is neither
      simple nor elemental, it is subtle, full of changing environments, to
      which man must adapt himself; the cunning, the astute, the adaptable, will
      ever rule in times of peace. It is pathetic, the belief of those brave
      soldiers that the-future is theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said, a strange thing,&rdquo; murmured Noel; &ldquo;that they were all a little
      mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a man of queer genius&mdash;Barra; you should see some of his
      earlier pictures. Mad is not quite the word, but something is loosened, is
      rattling round in them, they have lost proportion, they are being forced
      in one direction. I tell you, mademoiselle, this war is one great
      forcing-house; every living plant is being made to grow too fast, each
      quality, each passion; hate and love, intolerance and lust and avarice,
      courage and energy; yes, and self-sacrifice&mdash;all are being forced and
      forced beyond their strength, beyond the natural flow of the sap, forced
      till there has come a great wild luxuriant crop, and then&mdash;Psum!
      Presto! The change comes, and these plants will wither and rot and stink.
      But we who see Life in forms of Art are the only ones who feel that; and
      we are so few. The natural shape of things is lost. There is a mist of
      blood before all eyes. Men are afraid of being fair. See how we all hate
      not only our enemies, but those who differ from us. Look at the streets
      too&mdash;see how men and women rush together, how Venus reigns in this
      forcing-house. Is it not natural that Youth about to die should yearn for
      pleasure, for love, for union, before death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel stared up at him. &lsquo;Now!&rsquo; she thought: I will.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know that&rsquo;s true, because I rushed, myself. I&rsquo;d like
      you to know. We couldn&rsquo;t be married&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t time. And&mdash;he
      was killed. But his son is alive. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been away so long. I
      want every one to know.&rdquo; She spoke very calmly, but her cheeks felt
      burning hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter had made an upward movement of his hands, as if they had been
      jerked by an electric current, then he said quite quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My profound respect, mademoiselle, and my great sympathy. And your
      father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter said gently: &ldquo;Ah! mademoiselle, I am not so sure. Perhaps he
      does not suffer so greatly. Perhaps not even your trouble can hurt him
      very much. He lives in a world apart. That, I think, is his true tragedy
      to be alive, and yet not living enough to feel reality. Do you know
      Anatole France&rsquo;s description of an old woman: &lsquo;Elle vivait, mais si peu.&rsquo;
      Would that not be well said of the Church in these days: &lsquo;Elle vivait,
      mais si peu.&rsquo; I see him always like a rather beautiful dark spire in the
      night-time when you cannot see how it is attached to the earth. He does
      not know, he never will know, Life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel looked round at him. &ldquo;What do you mean by Life, monsieur? I&rsquo;m always
      reading about Life, and people talk of seeing Life! What is it&mdash;where
      is it? I never see anything that you could call Life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To &lsquo;see life&rsquo;.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ah! that is different. To enjoy yourself! Well,
      it is my experience that when people are &lsquo;seeing life&rsquo; as they call it,
      they are not enjoying themselves. You know when one is very thirsty one
      drinks and drinks, but the thirst remains all the same. There are places
      where one can see life as it is called, but the only persons you will see
      enjoying themselves at such places are a few humdrums like myself, who go
      there for a talk over a cup of coffee. Perhaps at your age, though, it is
      different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel clasped her hands, and her eyes seemed to shine in the gloom. &ldquo;I want
      music and dancing and light, and beautiful things and faces; but I never
      get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there does not exist in this town, or in any other, a place which
      will give you that. Fox-trots and ragtime and paint and powder and glare
      and half-drunken young men, and women with red lips you can get them in
      plenty. But rhythm and beauty and charm never. In Brussels when I was
      younger I saw much &lsquo;life&rsquo; as they call it, but not one lovely thing
      unspoiled; it was all as ashes in the mouth. Ah! you may smile, but I know
      what I am talking of. Happiness never comes when you are looking for it,
      mademoiselle; beauty is in Nature and in real art, never in these false
      silly make believes. There is a place just here where we Belgians go;
      would you like to see how true my words are?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tres-bien! Let us go in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed into a revolving doorway with little glass compartments which
      shot them out into a shining corridor. At the end of this the painter
      looked at Noel and seemed to hesitate, then he turned off from the room
      they were about to enter into a room on the right. It was large, full of
      gilt and plush and marble tables, where couples were seated; young men in
      khaki and older men in plain clothes, together or with young women. At
      these last Noel looked, face after face, while they were passing down a
      long way to an empty table. She saw that some were pretty, and some only
      trying to be, that nearly all were powdered and had their eyes darkened
      and their lips reddened, till she felt her own face to be dreadfully
      ungarnished: Up in a gallery a small band was playing an attractive
      jingling hollow little tune; and the buzz of talk and laughter was almost
      deafening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you have, mademoiselle?&rdquo; said the painter. &ldquo;It is just nine
      o&rsquo;clock; we must order quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I have one of those green things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deux cremes de menthe,&rdquo; said Lavendie to the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel was too absorbed to see the queer, bitter little smile hovering about
      his face. She was busy looking at the faces of women whose eyes, furtively
      cold and enquiring, were fixed on her; and at the faces of men with eyes
      that were furtively warm and wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Daddy was ever in a place like this?&rdquo; she said, putting the
      glass of green stuff to her lips. &ldquo;Is it nice? It smells of peppermint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful colour. Good luck, mademoiselle!&rdquo; and he chinked his glass
      with hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel sipped, held it away, and sipped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice; but awfully sticky. May I have a cigarette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Des cigarettes,&rdquo; said Lavendie to the waiter, &ldquo;Et deux cafes noirs. Now,
      mademoiselle,&rdquo; he murmured when they were brought, &ldquo;if we imagine that we
      have drunk a bottle of wine each, we shall have exhausted all the
      preliminaries of what is called Vice. Amusing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He shrugged his
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face struck Noel suddenly as tarnished and almost sullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, monsieur, it&rsquo;s all new to me, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter smiled, his bright, skin-deep smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon! I forget myself. Only, it hurts me to see beauty in a place like
      this. It does not go well with that tune, and these voices, and these
      faces. Enjoy yourself, mademoiselle; drink it all in! See the way these
      people look at each other; what love shines in their eyes! A pity, too, we
      cannot hear what they are saying. Believe me, their talk is most subtle,
      tres-spirituel. These young women are &lsquo;doing their bit,&rsquo; as you call it;
      bringing le plaisir to all these who are serving their country. Eat,
      drink, love, for tomorrow we die. Who cares for the world simple or the
      world beautiful, in days like these? The house of the spirit is empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at her sidelong as if he would enter her very soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel got up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to go, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put her cloak on her shoulders, paid the bill, and they went out,
      threading again through the little tables, through the buzz of talk and
      laughter and the fumes of tobacco, while another hollow little tune
      jingled away behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through there,&rdquo; said the painter, pointing to another door, &ldquo;they dance.
      So it goes. London in war-time! Well, after all, it is never very
      different; no great town is. Did you enjoy your sight of &lsquo;life,&rsquo;
      mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think one must dance, to be happy. Is that where your friends go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! To a room much rougher, and play dominoes, and drink coffee and
      beer, and talk. They have no money to throw away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you show me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, in that room you might see someone perhaps whom one day you
      would meet again; in the place we visited you were safe enough at least I
      hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel shrugged. &ldquo;I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t matter now, what I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a rush of emotion caught at her throat&mdash;a wave from the past&mdash;the
      moonlit night, the dark old Abbey, the woods and the river. Two tears
      rolled down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of&mdash;something,&rdquo; she said in a muffled voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chere mademoiselle!&rdquo; Lavendie murmured; and all the way home he was timid
      and distressed. Shaking his hand at the door, she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I was such a fool; and thank you awfully, monsieur. Good
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night; and better dreams. There is a good time coming&mdash;Peace
      and Happiness once more in the world. It will not always be this
      Forcing-House. Good night, chere mademoiselle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel went up to the nursery, and stole in. A night-light was burning,
      Nurse and baby were fast asleep. She tiptoed through into her own room.
      Once there, she felt suddenly so tired that she could hardly undress; and
      yet curiously rested, as if with that rush of emotion, Cyril and the past
      had slipped from her for ever.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Noel&rsquo;s first encounter with Opinion took place the following day. The baby
      had just come in from its airing; she had seen it comfortably snoozing,
      and was on her way downstairs, when a voice from the hall said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; and she saw the khaki-clad figure of Adrian Lauder, her
      father&rsquo;s curate! Hesitating just a moment, she finished her descent, and
      put her fingers in his. He was a rather heavy, dough-coloured young man of
      nearly thirty, unsuited by khaki, with a round white collar buttoned
      behind; but his aspiring eyes redeemed him, proclaiming the best
      intentions in the world, and an inclination towards sentiment in the
      presence of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you for ages,&rdquo; he said rather fatuously, following her
      into her father&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Noel. &ldquo;How&mdash;do you like being at the Front?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re wonderful!&rdquo; And his eyes shone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so nice to
      see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed puzzled by that answer; stammered, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know your sister had a baby. A jolly baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lauder&rsquo;s mouth opened. &lsquo;A silly mouth,&rsquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is it a protegee&mdash;Belgian or something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s mine; my own.&rdquo; And, turning round, she slipped the little ring
      off her finger. When she turned back to him, his face had not recovered
      from her words. It had a hapless look, as of one to whom such a thing
      ought not to have happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look like that,&rdquo; said Noel. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you understand? It&rsquo;s
      mine-mine.&rdquo; She put out her left hand. &ldquo;Look! There&rsquo;s no ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stammered: &ldquo;I say, you oughtn&rsquo;t to&mdash;you oughtn&rsquo;t to&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joke about&mdash;about such things; ought you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t joke if one&rsquo;s had a baby without being married, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lauder went suddenly slack. A shell might have burst a few paces from him.
      And then, just as one would in such a case, he made an effort, braced
      himself, and said in a curious voice, both stiff and heavy: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;one
      doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;it&rsquo;s not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Noel. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe me, ask Daddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand up to his round collar; and with the wild thought that he
      was going to tear it off, she cried: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You! But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel turned away from him to the window: She stood looking out, but saw
      nothing whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it hidden,&rdquo; she said without turning round, &ldquo;I want every
      one to know. It&rsquo;s stupid as it is&mdash;stupid!&rdquo; and she stamped her foot.
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see how stupid it is&mdash;everybody&rsquo;s mouth falling open!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He uttered a little sound which had pain in it, and she felt a real pang
      of compunction. He had gripped the back of a chair; his face had lost its
      heaviness. A dull flush coloured his cheeks. Noel had a feeling, as if she
      had been convicted of treachery. It was his silence, the curious look of
      an impersonal pain beyond power of words; she felt in him something much
      deeper than mere disapproval&mdash;something which echoed within herself.
      She walked quickly past him and escaped. She ran upstairs and threw
      herself on her bed. He was nothing: it was not that! It was in herself,
      the awful feeling, for the first time developed and poignant, that she had
      betrayed her caste, forfeited the right to be thought a lady, betrayed her
      secret reserve and refinement, repaid with black ingratitude the love
      lavished on her up bringing, by behaving like any uncared-for common girl.
      She had never felt this before&mdash;not even when Gratian first heard of
      it, and they had stood one at each end of the hearth, unable to speak.
      Then she still had her passion, and her grief for the dead. That was gone
      now as if it had never been; and she had no defence, nothing between her
      and this crushing humiliation and chagrin. She had been mad! She must have
      been mad! The Belgian Barra was right: &ldquo;All a little mad&rdquo; in this
      &ldquo;forcing-house&rdquo; of a war! She buried her face deep in the pillow, till it
      almost stopped her power of breathing; her head and cheeks and ears seemed
      to be on fire. If only he had shown disgust, done something which roused
      her temper, her sense of justice, her feeling that Fate had been too cruel
      to her; but he had just stood there, bewilderment incarnate, like a
      creature with some very deep illusion shattered. It was horrible! Then,
      feeling that she could not stay still, must walk, run, get away somehow
      from this feeling of treachery and betrayal, she sprang up. All was quiet
      below, and she slipped downstairs and out, speeding along with no
      knowledge of direction, taking the way she had taken day after day to her
      hospital. It was the last of April, trees and shrubs were luscious with
      blossom and leaf; the dogs ran gaily; people had almost happy faces in the
      sunshine. &lsquo;If I could get away from myself, I wouldn&rsquo;t care,&rsquo; she thought.
      Easy to get away from people, from London, even from England perhaps; but
      from oneself&mdash;impossible! She passed her hospital; and looked at it
      dully, at the Red Cross flag against its stucco wall, and a soldier in his
      blue slops and red tie, coming out. She had spent many miserable hours
      there, but none quite so miserable as this. She passed the church opposite
      to the flats where Leila lived, and running suddenly into a tall man
      coming round the corner, saw Fort. She bent her head, and tried to hurry
      past. But his hand was held out, she could not help putting hers into it;
      and looking up hardily, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know about me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face, naturally so frank, seemed to clench up, as if he were riding at
      a fence. &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll tell a lie,&rsquo; she thought bitterly. But he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Leila told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she thought: &lsquo;I suppose he&rsquo;ll try and pretend that I&rsquo;ve not been a
      beast!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admire your pluck,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never know ourselves, do we? I suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t walk my pace a
      minute or two, would you? I&rsquo;m going the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which way I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my case, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked on in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to God I were back in France,&rdquo; said Fort abruptly. &ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t
      feel clean here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel&rsquo;s heart applauded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! to get away&mdash;away from oneself! But at the thought of her baby,
      her heart fell again. &ldquo;Is your leg quite hopeless?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be horrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hundreds of thousands would look on it as splendid luck; and so it is if
      you count it better to be alive than dead, which I do, in spite of the
      blues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Cousin Leila?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. She goes on pegging away at the hospital; she&rsquo;s a brick.&rdquo; But
      he did not look at her, and again there was silence, till he stopped by
      Lord&rsquo;s Cricket-ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t keep you crawling along at this pace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wanted to say that if I can be of any service to you at any time
      in any way whatever, please command me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her hand a squeeze, took his hat off; and Noel walked slowly on.
      The little interview, with its suppressions, and its implications, had but
      exasperated her restlessness, and yet, in a way, it had soothed the
      soreness of her heart. Captain Fort at all events did not despise her; and
      he was in trouble like herself. She felt that somehow by the look of his
      face, and the tone of his voice when he spoke of Leila. She quickened her
      pace. George&rsquo;s words came back to her: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not ashamed of yourself,
      no one will be of you!&rdquo; How easy to say! The old days, her school, the
      little half grown-up dances she used to go to, when everything was happy.
      Gone! All gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      But her meetings with Opinion were not over for the day, for turning again
      at last into the home Square, tired out by her three hours&rsquo; ramble, she
      met an old lady whom she and Gratian had known from babyhood&mdash;a
      handsome dame, the widow of an official, who spent her days, which showed
      no symptom of declining, in admirable works. Her daughter, the widow of an
      officer killed at the Marne, was with her, and the two greeted Noel with a
      shower of cordial questions: So she was back from the country, and was she
      quite well again? And working at her hospital? And how was her dear
      father? They had thought him looking very thin and worn. But now Gratian
      was at home&mdash;How dreadfully the war kept husbands and wives apart!
      And whose was the dear little baby they had in the house?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; said Noel, walking straight past them with her head up. In every
      fibre of her being she could feel the hurt, startled, utterly bewildered
      looks of those firm friendly persons left there on the pavement behind
      her; could feel the way they would gather themselves together, and walk
      on, perhaps without a word, and then round the corner begin: &ldquo;What has
      come to Noel? What did she mean?&rdquo; And taking the little gold hoop out of
      her pocket, she flung it with all her might into the Square Garden. The
      action saved her from a breakdown; and she went in calmly. Lunch was long
      over, but her father had not gone out, for he met her in the hall and drew
      her into the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must eat, my child,&rdquo; he said. And while she was swallowing down what
      he had caused to be kept back for her, he stood by the hearth in that
      favourite attitude of his, one foot on the fender, and one hand gripping
      the mantel-shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your wish, Daddy,&rdquo; she said dully: &ldquo;Everybody knows now. I&rsquo;ve
      told Mr. Lauder, and Monsieur, and the Dinnafords.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw his fingers uncrisp, then grip the shelf again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Thirza gave me a ring to wear, but I&rsquo;ve thrown it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest child,&rdquo; he began, but could not go on, for the quivering of
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to say once more, Daddy, that I&rsquo;m fearfully sorry about you. And
      I am ashamed of myself; I thought I wasn&rsquo;t, but I am&mdash;only, I think
      it was cruel, and I&rsquo;m not penitent to God; and it&rsquo;s no good trying to make
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson turned and looked at her. For a long time after, she could not get
      that look out of her memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy Fort had turned away from Noel feeling particularly wretched. Ever
      since the day when Leila had told him of the girl&rsquo;s misfortune he had been
      aware that his liaison had no decent foundation, save a sort of pity. One
      day, in a queer access of compunction, he had made Leila an offer of
      marriage. She had refused; and he had respected her the more, realising by
      the quiver in her voice and the look in her eyes that she refused him, not
      because she did not love him well enough, but because she was afraid of
      losing any of his affection. She was a woman of great experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day he had taken advantage of the luncheon interval to bring her some
      flowers, with a note to say that he could not come that evening. Letting
      himself in with his latchkey, he had carefully put those Japanese azaleas
      in the bowl &ldquo;Famille Rose,&rdquo; taking water from her bedroom. Then he had sat
      down on the divan with his head in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he had rolled so much about the world, he had never had much to do
      with women. And there was nothing in him of the Frenchman, who takes what
      life puts in his way as so much enjoyment on the credit side, and accepts
      the ends of such affairs as they naturally and rather rapidly arrive. It
      had been a pleasure, and was no longer a pleasure; but this apparently did
      not dissolve it, or absolve him. He felt himself bound by an obscure but
      deep instinct to go on pretending that he was not tired of her, so long as
      she was not tired of him. And he sat there trying to remember any sign,
      however small, of such a consummation, quite without success. On the
      contrary, he had even the wretched feeling that if only he had loved her,
      she would have been much more likely to have tired of him by now. For her
      he was still the unconquered, in spite of his loyal endeavour to seem
      conquered. He had made a fatal mistake, that evening after the concert at
      Queen&rsquo;s Hall, to let himself go, on a mixed tide of desire and pity!
    </p>
    <p>
      His folly came to him with increased poignancy after he had parted from
      Noel. How could he have been such a base fool, as to have committed
      himself to Leila on an evening when he had actually been in the company of
      that child? Was it the vague, unseizable likeness between them which had
      pushed him over the edge? &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been an ass,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;a horrible
      ass.&rsquo; I would always have given every hour I&rsquo;ve ever spent with Leila, for
      one real smile from that girl.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This sudden sight of Noel after months during which he had tried loyally
      to forget her existence, and not succeeded at all, made him realise as he
      never had yet that he was in love with her; so very much in love with her
      that the thought of Leila was become nauseating. And yet the instincts of
      a gentleman seemed to forbid him to betray that secret to either of them.
      It was an accursed coil! He hailed a cab, for he was late; and all the way
      back to the War Office he continued to see the girl&rsquo;s figure and her face
      with its short hair. And a fearful temptation rose within him. Was it not
      she who was now the real object for chivalry and pity? Had he not the
      right to consecrate himself to championship of one in such a deplorable
      position? Leila had lived her life; but this child&rsquo;s life&mdash;pretty
      well wrecked&mdash;was all before her. And then he grinned from sheer
      disgust. For he knew that this was Jesuitry. Not chivalry was moving him,
      but love! Love! Love of the unattainable! And with a heavy heart, indeed,
      he entered the great building, where, in a small room, companioned by the
      telephone, and surrounded by sheets of paper covered with figures, he
      passed his days. The war made everything seem dreary, hopeless. No wonder
      he had caught at any distraction which came along&mdash;caught at it, till
      it had caught him!

    <p>
      To find out the worst is, for human nature, only a question of time. But
      where the &ldquo;worst&rdquo; is attached to a family haloed, as it were, by the
      authority and reputation of an institution like the Church, the process of
      discovery has to break through many a little hedge. Sheer unlikelihood,
      genuine respect, the defensive instinct in those identified with an
      institution, who will themselves feel weaker if its strength be
      diminished, the feeling that the scandal is too good to be true&mdash;all
      these little hedges, and more, had to be broken through. To the
      Dinnafords, the unholy importance of what Noel had said to them would have
      continued to keep them dumb, out of self-protection; but its monstrosity
      had given them the feeling that there must be some mistake, that the girl
      had been overtaken by a wild desire to &ldquo;pull their legs&rdquo; as dear Charlie
      would say. With the hope of getting this view confirmed, they lay in wait
      for the old nurse who took the baby out, and obtained the information,
      shortly imparted: &ldquo;Oh, yes; Miss Noel&rsquo;s. Her &lsquo;usband was killed&mdash;poor
      lamb!&rdquo; And they felt rewarded. They had been sure there was some mistake.
      The relief of hearing that word &ldquo;&lsquo;usband&rdquo; was intense. One of these hasty
      war marriages, of which the dear Vicar had not approved, and so it had
      been kept dark. Quite intelligible, but so sad! Enough misgiving however
      remained in their minds, to prevent their going to condole with the dear
      Vicar; but not enough to prevent their roundly contradicting the rumours
      and gossip already coming to their ears. And then one day, when their
      friend Mrs. Curtis had said too positively: &ldquo;Well, she doesn&rsquo;t wear a
      wedding-ring, that I&rsquo;ll swear, because I took very good care to look!&rdquo;
       they determined to ask Mr. Lauder. He would&mdash;indeed must&mdash;know;
      and, of course, would not tell a story. When they asked him it was so
      manifest that he did know, that they almost withdrew the question. The
      poor young man had gone the colour of a tomato.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer not to answer,&rdquo; he said. The rest of a very short interview was
      passed in exquisite discomfort. Indeed discomfort, exquisite and
      otherwise, within a few weeks of Noel&rsquo;s return, had begun to pervade all
      the habitual congregation of Pierson&rsquo;s church. It was noticed that neither
      of the two sisters attended Service now. Certain people who went in the
      sincere hope of seeing Noel, only fell off again when she did not appear.
      After all, she would not have the face! And Gratian was too ashamed, no
      doubt. It was constantly remarked that the Vicar looked very grave and
      thin, even for him. As the rumours hardened into certainty, the feeling
      towards him became a curious medley of sympathy and condemnation. There
      was about the whole business that which English people especially resent.
      By the very fact of his presence before them every Sunday, and his public
      ministrations, he was exhibiting to them, as it were, the seamed and
      blushing face of his daughter&rsquo;s private life, besides affording one long
      and glaring demonstration of the failure of the Church to guide its flock:
      If a man could not keep his own daughter in the straight path&mdash;whom
      could he? Resign! The word began to be thought about, but not yet spoken.
      He had been there so long; he had spent so much money on the church and
      the parish; his gentle dreamy manner was greatly liked. He was a
      gentleman; and had helped many people; and, though his love of music and
      vestments had always caused heart-burnings, yet it had given a certain
      cachet to the church. The women, at any rate, were always glad to know
      that the church they went to was capable of drawing their fellow women
      away from other churches. Besides, it was war-time, and moral delinquency
      which in time of peace would have bulked too large to neglect, was now
      less insistently dwelt on, by minds preoccupied by food and air-raids.
      Things, of course, could not go on as they were; but as yet they did go
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talked-about is always the last to hear the talk; and nothing concrete
      or tangible came Pierson&rsquo;s way. He went about his usual routine without
      seeming change. And yet there was a change, secret and creeping. Wounded
      almost to death himself, he felt as though surrounded by one great wound
      in others; but it was some weeks before anything occurred to rouse within
      him the weapon of anger or the protective impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then one day a little swift brutality shook him to the very soul. He
      was coming home from a long parish round, and had turned into the Square,
      when a low voice behind him said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot price the little barstard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cold, sick feeling stifled his very breathing; he gasped, and spun
      round, to see two big loutish boys walking fast away. With swift and
      stealthy passion he sprang after them, and putting his hands on their two
      neighbouring shoulders, wrenched them round so that they faced him, with
      mouths fallen open in alarm. Shaking them with all his force, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you&mdash;how dare you use that word?&rdquo; His face and voice must
      have been rather terrible, for the scare in their faces brought him to
      sudden consciousness of his own violence, and he dropped his hands. In two
      seconds they were at the corner. They stopped there for a second; one of
      them shouted &ldquo;Gran&rsquo;pa&rdquo;; then they vanished. He was left with lips and
      hands quivering, and a feeling that he had not known for years&mdash;the
      weak white empty feeling one has after yielding utterly to sudden
      murderous rage. He crossed over, and stood leaning against the Garden
      railings, with the thought: &lsquo;God forgive me! I could have killed them&mdash;I
      could have killed them!&rsquo; There had been a devil in him. If he had had
      something in his hand, he might now have been a murderer: How awful! Only
      one had spoken; but he could have killed them both! And the word was true,
      and was in all mouths&mdash;all low common mouths, day after day, of his
      own daughter&rsquo;s child! The ghastliness of this thought, brought home so
      utterly, made him writhe, and grasp the railings as if he would have bent
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day on, a creeping sensation of being rejected of men, never
      left him; the sense of identification with Noel and her tiny outcast
      became ever more poignant, more real; the desire to protect them ever more
      passionate; and the feeling that round about there were whispering voices,
      pointing fingers, and a growing malevolence was ever more sickening. He
      was beginning too to realise the deep and hidden truth: How easily the
      breath of scandal destroys the influence and sanctity of those endowed
      therewith by vocation; how invaluable it is to feel untarnished, and how
      difficult to feel that when others think you tarnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to be with Noel as much as possible; and in the evenings they
      sometimes went walks together, without ever talking of what was always in
      their minds. Between six and eight the girl was giving sittings to
      Lavendie in the drawing-room, and sometimes Pierson would come there and
      play to them. He was always possessed now by a sense of the danger Noel
      ran from companionship with any man. On three occasions, Jimmy Fort made
      his appearance after dinner. He had so little to say that it was difficult
      to understand why he came; but, sharpened by this new dread for his
      daughter, Pierson noticed his eyes always following her. &lsquo;He admires her,&rsquo;
      he thought; and often he would try his utmost to grasp the character of
      this man, who had lived such a roving life. &lsquo;Is he&mdash;can he be the
      sort of man I would trust Nollie to?&rsquo; he would think. &lsquo;Oh, that I should
      have to hope like this that some good man would marry her&mdash;my little
      Nollie, a child only the other day!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In these sad, painful, lonely weeks he found a spot of something like
      refuge in Leila&rsquo;s sitting-room, and would go there often for half an hour
      when she was back from her hospital. That little black-walled room with
      its Japanese prints and its flowers, soothed him. And Leila soothed him,
      innocent as he was of any knowledge of her latest aberration, and perhaps
      conscious that she herself was not too happy. To watch her arranging
      flowers, singing her little French songs, or to find her beside him,
      listening to his confidences, was the only real pleasure he knew in these
      days. And Leila, in turn, would watch him and think: &lsquo;Poor Edward! He has
      never lived; and never will; now!&rsquo; But sometimes the thought would shoot
      through her: &lsquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s to be envied. He doesn&rsquo;t feel what I feel,
      anyway. Why did I fall in love again?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not speak of Noel as a rule, but one evening she expressed her
      views roundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a great mistake to make Noel come back. Edward. It was Quixotic.
      You&rsquo;ll be lucky if real mischief doesn&rsquo;t come of it. She&rsquo;s not a patient
      character; one day she&rsquo;ll do something rash. And, mind you, she&rsquo;ll be much
      more likely to break out if she sees the world treating you badly than if
      it happens to herself. I should send her back to the country, before she
      makes bad worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that, Leila. We must live it down together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong, Edward. You should take things as they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a heavy sigh Pierson answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could see her future. She&rsquo;s so attractive. And her defences are
      gone. She&rsquo;s lost faith, and belief in all that a good woman should be. The
      day after she came back she told me she was ashamed of herself. But since&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      not given a sign. She&rsquo;s so proud&mdash;my poor little Nollie. I see how
      men admire her, too. Our Belgian friend is painting her. He&rsquo;s a good man;
      but he finds her beautiful, and who can wonder. And your friend Captain
      Fort. Fathers are supposed to be blind, but they see very clear
      sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila rose and drew down a blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This sun,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Does Jimmy Fort come to you&mdash;often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no; very seldom. But still&mdash;I can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You bat&mdash;you blunderer!&rsquo; thought Leila: &lsquo;See! You can&rsquo;t even see
      this beside you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect he&rsquo;s sorry for her,&rdquo; she said in a queer voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he be sorry? He doesn&rsquo;t know:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! He knows; I told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Leila repeated stubbornly; &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s sorry for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And even then &ldquo;this monk&rdquo; beside her did not see, and went blundering on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; it&rsquo;s not merely that he&rsquo;s sorry. By the way he looks at her, I
      know I&rsquo;m not mistaken. I&rsquo;ve wondered&mdash;what do you think, Leila. He&rsquo;s
      too old for her; but he seems an honourable, kind man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a most honourable, kind man.&rdquo; But only by pressing her hand against
      her lips had she smothered a burst of bitter laughter. He, who saw
      nothing, could yet notice Fort&rsquo;s eyes when he looked at Noel, and be
      positive that he was in love with her! How plainly those eyes must speak!
      Her control gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is very interesting,&rdquo; she said, spurning her words like Noel,
      &ldquo;considering that he&rsquo;s more than my friend, Edward.&rdquo; It gave her a sort of
      pleasure to see him wince. &lsquo;These blind bats!&rsquo; she thought, terribly stung
      that he should so clearly assume her out of the running. Then she was
      sorry, his face had become so still and wistful. And turning away, she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I shan&rsquo;t break my heart; I&rsquo;m a good loser. And I&rsquo;m a good fighter,
      too; perhaps I shan&rsquo;t lose.&rdquo; And snapping off a sprig of geranium, she
      pressed it to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; said Pierson slowly; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m stupid. I thought
      your love for your poor soldiers had left no room for other feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila uttered a shrill laugh. &ldquo;What have they to do with each other? Did
      you never hear of passion, Edward? Oh! Don&rsquo;t look at me like that. Do you
      think a woman can&rsquo;t feel passion at my age? As much as ever, more than
      ever, because it&rsquo;s all slipping away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took her hand from her lips, but a geranium petal was left clinging
      there, like a bloodstain. &ldquo;What has your life been all these years,&rdquo; she
      went on vehemently&mdash;&ldquo;suppression of passion, nothing else! You monks
      twist Nature up with holy words, and try to disguise what the eeriest
      simpleton can see. Well, I haven&rsquo;t suppressed passion, Edward. That&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you happier for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was; and I shall be again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little smile curled Pierson&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Shall be?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope so.
      It&rsquo;s just two ways of looking at things, Leila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Edward! Don&rsquo;t be so gentle! I suppose you don&rsquo;t think a person like
      me can ever really love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was standing before her with his head down, and a sense that, naive and
      bat-like as he was, there was something in him she could not reach or
      understand, made her cry out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been nice to you. Forgive me, Edward! I&rsquo;m so unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a Greek who used to say: &lsquo;God is the helping of man by man.&rsquo; It
      isn&rsquo;t true, but it&rsquo;s beautiful. Good-bye, dear Leila, and don&rsquo;t be
      sorrowful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She squeezed his hand, and turned to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood there watching his black figure cross the road in the sunshine,
      and pass round the corner by the railings of the church. He walked
      quickly, very upright; there was something unseeing even about that back
      view of him; or was it that he saw-another world? She had never lost the
      mental habits of her orthodox girlhood, and in spite of all impatience,
      recognised his sanctity. When he had disappeared she went into her
      bedroom. What he had said, indeed, was no discovery. She had known. Oh!
      She had known. &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I accept Jimmy&rsquo;s offer? Why didn&rsquo;t I marry him?
      Is it too late?&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;Could I? Would he&mdash;even now?&rsquo; But then
      she started away from her own thought. Marry him! knowing his heart was
      with this girl?
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked long at her face in the mirror, studying with a fearful
      interest the little hard lines and markings there beneath their light
      coating of powder. She examined the cunning touches of colouring matter
      here and there in her front hair. Were they cunning enough? Did they
      deceive? They seemed to her suddenly to stare out. She fingered and
      smoothed the slight looseness and fulness of the skin below her chin. She
      stretched herself, and passed her hands down over her whole form,
      searching as it were for slackness, or thickness. And she had the bitter
      thought: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m all out. I&rsquo;m doing all I can.&rsquo; The lines of a little poem
      Fort had showed her went thrumming through her head:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         &ldquo;Time, you old gipsy man
            Will you not stay
          Put up your caravan
            Just for a day?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      What more could she do? He did not like to see her lips reddened. She had
      marked his disapprovals, watched him wipe his mouth after a kiss, when he
      thought she couldn&rsquo;t see him. &lsquo;I need&rsquo;nt!&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;Noel&rsquo;s lips are
      no redder, really. What has she better than I? Youth&mdash;dew on the
      grass!&rsquo; That didn&rsquo;t last long! But long enough to &ldquo;do her in&rdquo; as her
      soldier-men would say. And, suddenly she revolted against herself, against
      Fort, against this chilled and foggy country; felt a fierce nostalgia for
      African sun, and the African flowers; the happy-go-lucky, hand-to-mouth
      existence of those five years before the war began. High Constantia at
      grape harvest! How many years ago&mdash;ten years, eleven years! Ah! To
      have before her those ten years, with him! Ten years in the sun! He would
      have loved her then, and gone on loving her! And she would not have tired
      of him, as she had tired of those others. &lsquo;In half an hour,&rsquo; she thought,
      &lsquo;he&rsquo;ll be here, sit opposite me; I shall see him struggling forcing
      himself to seem affectionate! It&rsquo;s too humbling! But I don&rsquo;t care; I want
      him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She searched her wardrobe, for some garment or touch of colour, novelty of
      any sort, to help her. But she had tried them all&mdash;those little
      tricks&mdash;was bankrupt. And such a discouraged, heavy mood came on her,
      that she did not even &ldquo;change,&rdquo; but went back in her nurse&rsquo;s dress and lay
      down on the divan, pretending to sleep, while the maid set out the supper.
      She lay there moody and motionless, trying to summon courage, feeling that
      if she showed herself beaten she was beaten; knowing that she only held
      him by pity. But when she heard his footstep on the stairs she swiftly
      passed her hands over her cheeks, as if to press the blood out of them,
      and lay absolutely still. She hoped that she was white, and indeed she
      was, with finger-marks under the eyes, for she had suffered greatly this
      last hour. Through her lashes she saw him halt, and look at her in
      surprise. Asleep, or-ill, which? She did not move. She wanted to watch
      him. He tiptoed across the room and stood looking down at her. There was a
      furrow between his eyes. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;it would suit you, if I were
      dead, my kind friend.&rsquo; He bent a little towards her; and she wondered
      suddenly whether she looked graceful lying there, sorry now that she had
      not changed her dress. She saw him shrug his shoulders ever so faintly
      with a puzzled little movement. He had not seen that she was shamming. How
      nice his face was&mdash;not mean, secret, callous! She opened her eyes,
      which against her will had in them the despair she was feeling. He went on
      his knees, and lifting her hand to his lips, hid them with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an awful bore to you. Poor Jimmy! No! Don&rsquo;t
      pretend! I know what I know!&rdquo; &lsquo;Oh, God! What am I saying?&rsquo; she thought.
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s fatal-fatal. I ought never!&rsquo; And drawing his head to her, she put it
      to her heart. Then, instinctively aware that this moment had been pressed
      to its uttermost, she scrambled up, kissed his forehead, stretched
      herself, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was asleep, dreaming; dreaming you loved me. Wasn&rsquo;t it funny? Come
      along. There are oysters, for the last time this season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that evening, as if both knew they had been looking over a precipice,
      they seemed to be treading warily, desperately anxious not to rouse
      emotion in each other, or touch on things which must bring a scene. And
      Leila talked incessantly of Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you long for the sun, Jimmy? Couldn&rsquo;t we&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t you go? Oh!
      why doesn&rsquo;t this wretched war end? All that we&rsquo;ve got here at home every
      scrap of wealth, and comfort, and age, and art, and music, I&rsquo;d give it all
      for the light and the sun out there. Wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Fort said he would, knowing well of one thing which he would not give.
      And she knew that, as well as he.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both gayer than they had been for a long time; so that when he
      had gone, she fell back once more on to the divan, and burying her face in
      a cushion, wept bitterly.

    <p>
      It was not quite disillusionment that Pierson felt while he walked away.
      Perhaps he had not really believed in Leila&rsquo;s regeneration. It was more an
      acute discomfort, an increasing loneliness. A soft and restful spot was
      now denied him; a certain warmth and allurement had gone out of his life.
      He had not even the feeling that it was his duty to try and save Leila by
      persuading her to marry Fort. He had always been too sensitive, too much
      as it were of a gentleman, for the robuster sorts of evangelism. Such
      delicacy had been a stumbling-block to him all through professional life.
      In the eight years when his wife was with him, all had been more certain,
      more direct and simple, with the help of her sympathy, judgment; and
      companionship. At her death a sort of mist had gathered in his soul. No
      one had ever spoken plainly to him. To a clergyman, who does? No one had
      told him in so many words that he should have married again&mdash;that to
      stay unmarried was bad for him, physically and spiritually, fogging and
      perverting life; not driving him, indeed, as it drove many, to intolerance
      and cruelty, but to that half-living dreaminess, and the vague unhappy
      yearnings which so constantly beset him. All these celibate years he had
      really only been happy in his music, or in far-away country places, taking
      strong exercise, and losing himself in the beauties of Nature; and since
      the war began he had only once, for those three days at Kestrel, been out
      of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked home, going over in his mind very anxiously all the evidence he
      had of Fort&rsquo;s feeling for Noel. How many times had he been to them since
      she came back? Only three times&mdash;three evening visits! And he had not
      been alone with her a single minute! Before this calamity befell his
      daughter, he would never have observed anything in Fort&rsquo;s demeanour; but,
      in his new watchfulness, he had seen the almost reverential way he looked
      at her, noticed the extra softness of his voice when he spoke to her, and
      once a look of sudden pain, a sort of dulling of his whole self, when Noel
      had got up and gone out of the room. And the girl herself? Twice he had
      surprised her gazing at Fort when he was not looking, with a sort of
      brooding interest. He remembered how, as a little girl, she would watch a
      grown-up, and then suddenly one day attach herself to him, and be quite
      devoted. Yes, he must warn her, before she could possibly become
      entangled. In his fastidious chastity, the opinion he had held of Fort was
      suddenly lowered. He, already a free-thinker, was now revealed as a
      free-liver. Poor little Nollie! Endangered again already! Every man a kind
      of wolf waiting to pounce on her!
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Lavendie and Noel in the drawing-room, standing before the
      portrait which was nearing completion. He looked at it for a long minute,
      and turned away:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s like me, Daddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you; but it hurts me. I can&rsquo;t tell why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw the smile of a painter whose picture is being criticised come on
      Lavendie&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perhaps the colouring which does not please you, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; deeper. The expression; what is she waiting for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The defensive smile died on Lavendie&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as I see her, monsieur le cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson turned again to the picture, and suddenly covered his eyes. &ldquo;She
      looks &lsquo;fey,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, and went out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavendie and Noel remained staring at the picture. &ldquo;Fey? What does that
      mean, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possessed, or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they continued to stare at the picture, till Lavendie said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there is still a little too much light on that ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same evening, at bedtime, Pierson called Noel back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie, I want you to know something. In all but the name, Captain Fort
      is a married man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw her flush, and felt his own face darkening with colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said calmly: &ldquo;I know; to Leila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean she has told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed. Daddy, don&rsquo;t treat me as a child any more. What&rsquo;s the use,
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in the chair before the hearth, and covered his face with his
      hands. By the quivering of those hands, and the movement of his shoulders,
      she could tell that he was stifling emotion, perhaps even crying; and
      sinking down on his knees she pressed his hands and face to her,
      murmuring: &ldquo;Oh, Daddy dear! Oh, Daddy dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his arms round her, and they sat a long time with their cheeks
      pressed together, not speaking a word.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h3>
      1
    </h3>
    <p>
      The day after that silent outburst of emotion in the drawing-room was a
      Sunday. And, obeying the longing awakened overnight to be as good as she
      could to her father; Noel said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like me to come to Church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Nollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How could he have answered otherwise? To him Church was the home of
      comfort and absolution, where people must bring their sins and troubles&mdash;a
      haven of sinners, the fount of charity, of forgiveness, and love. Not to
      have believed that, after all these years, would have been to deny all his
      usefulness in life, and to cast a slur on the House of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Noel walked there with him, for Gratian had gone down to George,
      for the week-end. She slipped quietly up the side aisle to their empty
      pew, under the pulpit. Never turning her eyes from the chancel, she
      remained unconscious of the stir her presence made, during that hour and
      twenty minutes. Behind her, the dumb currents of wonder, disapproval, and
      resentment ran a stealthy course. On her all eyes were fixed sooner or
      later, and every mind became the play ground of judgments. From every
      soul, kneeling, standing, or sitting, while the voice of the Service
      droned, sang, or spoke, a kind of glare radiated on to that one small
      devoted head, which seemed so ludicrously devout. She disturbed their
      devotions, this girl who had betrayed her father, her faith, her class.
      She ought to repent, of course, and Church was the right place; yet there
      was something brazen in her repenting there before their very eyes; she
      was too palpable a flaw in the crystal of the Church&rsquo;s authority, too
      visible a rent in the raiment of their priest. Her figure focused all the
      uneasy amazement and heart searchings of these last weeks. Mothers
      quivered with the knowledge that their daughters could see her; wives with
      the idea that their husbands were seeing her. Men experienced sensations
      varying from condemnation to a sort of covetousness. Young folk wondered,
      and felt inclined to giggle. Old maids could hardly bear to look. Here and
      there a man or woman who had seen life face to face, was simply sorry! The
      consciousness of all who knew her personally was at stretch how to behave
      if they came within reach of her in going out. For, though only half a
      dozen would actually rub shoulders with her, all knew that they might be,
      and many felt it their duty to be, of that half-dozen, so as to establish
      their attitude once for all. It was, in fact, too severe a test for human
      nature and the feelings which Church ought to arouse. The stillness of
      that young figure, the impossibility of seeing her face and judging of her
      state of mind thereby; finally, a faint lurking shame that they should be
      so intrigued and disturbed by something which had to do with sex, in this
      House of Worship&mdash;all combined to produce in every mind that
      herd-feeling of defence, which so soon becomes, offensive. And, half
      unconscious, half aware of it all, Noel stood, and sat, and knelt. Once or
      twice she saw her father&rsquo;s eyes fixed on her; and, still in the glow of
      last night&rsquo;s pity and remorse, felt a kind of worship for his thin grave
      face. But for the most part, her own wore the expression Lavendie had
      translated to his canvas&mdash;the look of one ever waiting for the
      extreme moments of life, for those few and fleeting poignancies which
      existence holds for the human heart. A look neither hungry nor
      dissatisfied, but dreamy and expectant, which might blaze into warmth and
      depth at any moment, and then go back to its dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last notes of the organ died away she continued to sit very
      still, without looking round.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no second Service, and the congregation melted out behind her,
      and had dispersed into the streets and squares long before she came forth.
      After hesitating whether or no to go to the vestry door, she turned away
      and walked home alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this deliberate evasion of all contact which probably clinched the
      business. The absence of vent, of any escape-pipe for the feelings, is
      always dangerous. They felt cheated. If Noel had come out amongst all
      those whose devotions her presence had disturbed, if in that exit, some
      had shown and others had witnessed one knows not what of a manifested
      ostracism, the outraged sense of social decency might have been appeased
      and sleeping dogs allowed to lie, for we soon get used to things; and,
      after all, the war took precedence in every mind even over social decency.
      But none of this had occurred, and a sense that Sunday after Sunday the
      same little outrage would happen to them, moved more than a dozen quite
      unrelated persons, and caused the posting that evening of as many letters,
      signed and unsigned, to a certain quarter. London is no place for parish
      conspiracy, and a situation which in the country would have provoked
      meetings more or less public, and possibly a resolution, could perhaps
      only thus be dealt with. Besides, in certain folk there is ever a
      mysterious itch to write an unsigned letter&mdash;such missives satisfy
      some obscure sense of justice, some uncontrollable longing to get even
      with those who have hurt or disturbed them, without affording the
      offenders chance for further hurt or disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letters which are posted often reach their destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Wednesday morning Pierson was sitting in his study at the hour devoted
      to the calls of his parishioners, when the maid announced, &ldquo;Canon
      Rushbourne, sir,&rdquo; and he saw before him an old College friend whom he had
      met but seldom in recent years. His visitor was a short, grey-haired man
      of rather portly figure, whose round, rosy, good-humoured face had a look
      of sober goodness, and whose light-blue eyes shone a little. He grasped
      Pierson&rsquo;s hand, and said in a voice to whose natural heavy resonance
      professional duty had added a certain unction:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Edward, how many years it is since we met! Do you remember dear
      old Blakeway? I saw him only yesterday. He&rsquo;s just the same. I&rsquo;m delighted
      to see you again,&rdquo; and he laughed a little soft nervous laugh. Then for a
      few moments he talked of the war and old College days, and Pierson looked
      at him and thought: &lsquo;What has he come for?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve something to say to me, Alec,&rdquo; he said, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canon Rushbourne leaned forward in his chair, and answered with evident
      effort: &ldquo;Yes; I wanted to have a little talk with you, Edward. I hope you
      won&rsquo;t mind. I do hope you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Canon Rushbourne&rsquo;s eyes shone more than ever, there was real friendliness
      in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve every right to say to me: &lsquo;Mind your own business.&rsquo; But I
      made up my mind to come as a friend, hoping to save you from&mdash;er&rdquo; he
      stammered, and began again: &ldquo;I think you ought to know of the feeling in
      your parish that&mdash;er&mdash;that&mdash;er&mdash;your position is very
      delicate. Without breach of confidence I may tell you that letters have
      been sent to headquarters; you can imagine perhaps what I mean. Do
      believe, my dear friend, that I&rsquo;m actuated by my old affection for you;
      nothing else, I do assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the silence, his breathing could be heard, as of a man a little touched
      with asthma, while he continually smoothed his thick black knees, his
      whole face radiating an anxious kindliness. The sun shone brightly on
      those two black figures, so very different, and drew out of their
      well-worn garments the faint latent green mossiness which. underlies the
      clothes of clergymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Pierson said: &ldquo;Thank you, Alec; I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Canon uttered a resounding sigh. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t realise how very easily
      people misinterpret her being here with you; it seems to them a kind&mdash;a
      kind of challenge. They were bound, I think, to feel that; and I&rsquo;m afraid,
      in consequence&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, moved by the fact that Pierson had
      closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to choose, you mean, between my daughter and my parish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Canon seemed, with a stammer of words, to try and blunt the edge of
      that clear question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My visit is quite informal, my dear fellow; I can&rsquo;t say at all. But there
      is evidently much feeling; that is what I wanted you to know. You haven&rsquo;t
      quite seen, I think, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson raised his hand. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Canon rose. &ldquo;Believe me, Edward, I sympathise deeply. I felt I had to
      warn you.&rdquo; He held out his hand. &ldquo;Good-bye, my dear friend, do forgive
      me&rdquo;; and he went out. In the hall an adventure befell him so plump, and
      awkward, that he could barely recite it to Mrs. Rushbourne that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming out from my poor friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ran into a baby&rsquo;s
      perambulator and that young mother, whom I remember as a little thing&rdquo;&mdash;he
      held his hand at the level of his thigh&mdash;&ldquo;arranging it for going out.
      It startled me; and I fear I asked quite foolishly: &lsquo;Is it a boy?&rsquo; The
      poor young thing looked up at me. She has very large eyes, quite
      beautiful, strange eyes. &lsquo;Have you been speaking to Daddy about me?&rsquo; &lsquo;My
      dear young lady,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m such an old friend, you see. You must
      forgive me.&rsquo; And then she said: &lsquo;Are they going to ask him to resign?&rsquo;
      &lsquo;That depends on you,&rsquo; I said. Why do I say these things, Charlotte? I
      ought simply to have held my tongue. Poor young thing; so very young! And
      the little baby!&rdquo; &ldquo;She has brought it on herself, Alec,&rdquo; Mrs. Rushbourne
      replied.

    <p>
      The moment his visitor had vanished, Pierson paced up and down the study,
      with anger rising in his, heart. His daughter or his parish! The old saw,
      &ldquo;An Englishman&rsquo;s house is his castle!&rdquo; was being attacked within him. Must
      he not then harbour his own daughter, and help her by candid atonement to
      regain her inward strength and peace? Was he not thereby acting as a true
      Christian, in by far the hardest course he and she could pursue? To go
      back on that decision and imperil his daughter&rsquo;s spirit, or else resign
      his parish&mdash;the alternatives were brutal! This was the centre of his
      world, the only spot where so lonely a man could hope to feel even the
      semblance of home; a thousand little threads tethered him to his church,
      his parishioners, and this house&mdash;for, to live on here if he gave up
      his church was out of the question. But his chief feeling was a bewildered
      anger that for doing what seemed to him his duty, he should be attacked by
      his parishioners.
    </p>
    <p>
      A passion of desire to know what they really thought and felt&mdash;these
      parishioners of his, whom he had befriended, and for whom he had worked so
      long&mdash;beset him now, and he went out. But the absurdity of his quest
      struck him before he had gone the length of the Square. One could not go
      to people and say: &ldquo;Stand and deliver me your inmost judgments.&rdquo; And
      suddenly he was aware of how far away he really was from them. Through all
      his ministrations had he ever come to know their hearts? And now, in this
      dire necessity for knowledge, there seemed no way of getting it. He went
      at random into a stationer&rsquo;s shop; the shopman sang bass in his choir.
      They had met Sunday after Sunday for the last seven years. But when, with
      this itch for intimate knowledge on him, he saw the man behind the
      counter, it was as if he were looking on him for the first time. The
      Russian proverb, &ldquo;The heart of another is a dark forest,&rdquo; gashed into his
      mind, while he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Hodson, what news of your son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more, Mr. Pierson, thank you, sir, nothing more at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it seemed to Pierson, gazing at the man&rsquo;s face clothed in a short,
      grizzling beard cut rather like his own, that he must be thinking: &lsquo;Ah!
      sir, but what news of your daughter?&rsquo; No one would ever tell him to his
      face what he was thinking. And buying two pencils, he went out. On the
      other side of the road was a bird-fancier&rsquo;s shop, kept by a woman whose
      husband had been taken for the Army. She was not friendly towards him, for
      it was known to her that he had expostulated with her husband for keeping
      larks, and other wild birds. And quite deliberately he crossed the road,
      and stood looking in at the window, with the morbid hope that from this
      unfriendly one he might hear truth. She was in her shop, and came to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any news of your husband, Mrs. Cherry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Pierson, I &lsquo;ave not; not this week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t gone out yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Pierson; &lsquo;e &lsquo;as not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no expression on her face, perfectly blank it was&mdash;Pierson
      had a mad longing to say &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, woman, speak out what&rsquo;s in your
      mind; tell me what you think of me and my daughter. Never mind my cloth!&rsquo;
      But he could no more say it than the woman could tell him what was in her
      mind. And with a &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; he passed on. No man or woman would tell
      him anything, unless, perhaps, they were drunk. He came to a public house,
      and for a moment even hesitated before it, but the thought of insult aimed
      at Noel stopped him, and he passed that too. And then reality made itself
      known to him. Though he had come out to hear what they were thinking, he
      did not really want to hear it, could not endure it if he did. He had been
      too long immune from criticism, too long in the position of one who may
      tell others what he thinks of them. And standing there in the crowded
      street, he was attacked by that longing for the country which had always
      come on him when he was hard pressed. He looked at his memoranda. By
      stupendous luck it was almost a blank day. An omnibus passed close by
      which would take him far out. He climbed on to it, and travelled as far as
      Hendon; then getting down, set forth on foot. It was bright and hot, and
      the May blossom in full foam. He walked fast along the perfectly straight
      road till he came to the top of Elstree Hill. There for a few moments he
      stood gazing at the school chapel, the cricket-field, the wide land
      beyond. All was very quiet, for it was lunch-time. A horse was tethered
      there, and a strolling cat, as though struck by the tall black incongruity
      of his figure, paused in her progress, then, slithering under the wicket
      gate, arched her back and rubbed herself against his leg, crinkling and
      waving the tip of her tail. Pierson bent down and stroked the creature&rsquo;s
      head; but uttering a faint miaou, the cat stepped daintily across the
      road, Pierson too stepped on, past the village, and down over the stile,
      into a field path. At the edge of the young clover, under a bank of
      hawthorn, he lay down on his back, with his hat beside him and his arms
      crossed over his chest, like the effigy of some crusader one may see
      carved on an old tomb. Though he lay quiet as that old knight, his eyes
      were not closed, but fixed on the blue, where a lark was singing. Its song
      refreshed his spirit; its passionate light-heartedness stirred all the
      love of beauty in him, awoke revolt against a world so murderous and
      uncharitable. Oh! to pass up with that song into a land of bright spirits,
      where was nothing ugly, hard, merciless, and the gentle face of the
      Saviour radiated everlasting love! The scent of the mayflowers, borne down
      by the sun shine, drenched his senses; he closed his eyes, and, at once,
      as if resenting that momentary escape, his mind resumed debate with
      startling intensity. This matter went to the very well-springs, had a
      terrible and secret significance. If to act as conscience bade him
      rendered him unfit to keep his parish, all was built on sand, had no deep
      reality, was but rooted in convention. Charity, and the forgiveness of
      sins honestly atoned for&mdash;what became of them? Either he was wrong to
      have espoused straightforward confession and atonement for her, or they
      were wrong in chasing him from that espousal. There could be no making
      those extremes to meet. But if he were wrong, having done the hardest
      thing already&mdash;where could he turn? His Church stood bankrupt of
      ideals. He felt as if pushed over the edge of the world, with feet on
      space, and head in some blinding cloud. &lsquo;I cannot have been wrong,&rsquo; he
      thought; &lsquo;any other course was so much easier. I sacrificed my pride, and
      my poor girl&rsquo;s pride; I would have loved to let her run away. If for this
      we are to be stoned and cast forth, what living force is there in the
      religion I have loved; what does it all come to? Have I served a sham? I
      cannot and will not believe it. Something is wrong with me, something is
      wrong&mdash;but where&mdash;what?&rsquo; He rolled over, lay on his face, and
      prayed. He prayed for guidance and deliverance from the gusts of anger
      which kept sweeping over him; even more for relief from the feeling of
      personal outrage, and the unfairness of this thing. He had striven to be
      loyal to what he thought the right, had sacrificed all his sensitiveness,
      all his secret fastidious pride in his child and himself. For that he was
      to be thrown out! Whether through prayer, or in the scent and feel of the
      clover, he found presently a certain rest. Away in the distance he could
      see the spire of Harrow Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church! No! She was not, could not be, at fault. The fault was in
      himself. &lsquo;I am unpractical,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;It is so, I know. Agnes used to
      say so, Bob and Thirza think so. They all think me unpractical and dreamy.
      Is it a sin&mdash;I wonder?&rsquo; There were lambs in the next field; he
      watched their gambollings and his heart relaxed; brushing the clover dust
      off his black clothes, he began to retrace his steps. The boys were
      playing cricket now, and he stood a few minutes watching them. He had not
      seen cricket played since the war began; it seemed almost otherworldly,
      with the click of the bats, and the shrill young &lsquo;voices, under the
      distant drone of that sky-hornet threshing along to Hendon. A boy made a
      good leg hit. &ldquo;Well played!&rdquo; he called. Then, suddenly conscious of his
      own incongruity and strangeness in that green spot, he turned away on the
      road back to London. To resign; to await events; to send Noel away&mdash;of
      those three courses, the last alone seemed impossible. &lsquo;Am I really so far
      from them,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;that they can wish me to go, for this? If so, I
      had better go. It will be just another failure. But I won&rsquo;t believe it
      yet; I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat was sweltering, and he became very tired before at last he
      reached his omnibus, and could sit with the breeze cooling his hot face.
      He did not reach home till six, having eaten nothing since breakfast.
      Intending to have a bath and lie down till dinner, he went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unwonted silence reigned. He tapped on the nursery door. It was deserted;
      he passed through to Noel&rsquo;s room; but that too was empty. The wardrobe
      stood open as if it had been hastily ransacked, and her dressing-table was
      bare. In alarm he went to the bell and pulled it sharply. The
      old-fashioned ring of it jingled out far below. The parlour-maid came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are Miss Noel and Nurse, Susan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were in, sir. Miss Noel left me this note to give you.
      They&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson stopped her with his hand. &ldquo;Thank you, Susan; get me some tea,
      please.&rdquo; With the note unopened in his hand, he waited till she was gone.
      His head was going round, and he sat down on the side of Noel&rsquo;s bed to
      read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DARLING DADDY,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who came this morning told me of what is going to happen. I
      simply won&rsquo;t have it. I&rsquo;m sending Nurse and baby down to Kestrel at once,
      and going to Leila&rsquo;s for the night, until I&rsquo;ve made up my mind what to do.
      I knew it was a mistake my coming back. I don&rsquo;t care what happens to me,
      but I won&rsquo;t have you hurt. I think it&rsquo;s hateful of people to try and
      injure you for my fault. I&rsquo;ve had to borrow money from Susan&mdash;six
      pounds. Oh! Daddy dear, forgive me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your loving
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NOLLIE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read it with unutterable relief; at all events he knew where she was&mdash;poor,
      wilful, rushing, loving-hearted child; knew where she was, and could get
      at her. After his bath and some tea, he would go to Leila&rsquo;s and bring her
      back. Poor little Nollie, thinking that by just leaving his house she
      could settle this deep matter! He did not hurry, feeling decidedly
      exhausted, and it was nearly eight before he set out, leaving a message
      for Gratian, who did not as a rule come in from her hospital till past
      nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was still glowing, and now, in the cool of evening, his refreshed
      senses soaked up its beauty. &lsquo;God has so made this world,&rsquo; he thought,
      &lsquo;that, no matter what our struggles and sufferings, it&rsquo;s ever a joy to
      live when the sun shines, or the moon is bright, or the night starry. Even
      we can&rsquo;t spoil it.&rsquo; In Regent&rsquo;s Park the lilacs and laburnums were still
      in bloom though June had come, and he gazed at them in passing, as a lover
      might at his lady. His conscience pricked him suddenly. Mrs. Mitchett and
      the dark-eyed girl she had brought to him on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, the very
      night he had learned of his own daughter&rsquo;s tragedy&mdash;had he ever
      thought of them since? How had that poor girl fared? He had been too
      impatient of her impenetrable mood. What did he know of the hearts of
      others, when he did not even know his own, could not rule his feelings of
      anger and revolt, had not guided his own daughter into the waters of
      safety! And Leila! Had he not been too censorious in thought? How
      powerful, how strange was this instinct of sex, which hovered and swooped
      on lives, seized them, bore them away, then dropped them exhausted and
      defenceless! Some munition-wagons, painted a dull grey, lumbered past,
      driven by sunburned youths in drab. Life-force, Death-force&mdash;was it
      all one; the great unknowable momentum from which there was but the one
      escape, in the arms of their Heavenly Father? Blake&rsquo;s little old stanzas
      came into his mind:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;And we are put on earth a little space,
     That we may learn to bear the beams of love;
     And these black bodies and this sunburnt face
     Are but a cloud, and like a shady grove.

    &ldquo;For when our souls have learned the heat to bear,
     The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,
     Saying: Come out from the grove, my love and care,
     And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Learned the heat to bear! Those lambs he had watched in a field that
      afternoon, their sudden little leaps and rushes, their funny quivering
      wriggling tails, their tiny nuzzling black snouts&mdash;what little
      miracles of careless joy among the meadow flowers! Lambs, and flowers, and
      sunlight! Famine, lust, and the great grey guns! A maze, a wilderness; and
      but for faith, what issue, what path for man to take which did not keep
      him wandering hopeless, in its thicket? &lsquo;God preserve our faith in love,
      in charity, and the life to come!&rsquo; he thought. And a blind man with a dog,
      to whose neck was tied a little deep dish for pennies, ground a
      hurdy-gurdy as he passed. Pierson put a shilling in the dish. The man
      stopped playing, his whitish eyes looked up. &ldquo;Thank you kindly, sir; I&rsquo;ll
      go home now. Come on, Dick!&rdquo; He tapped his way round the corner, with his
      dog straining in front. A blackbird hidden among the blossoms of an
      acacia, burst into evening song, and another great grey munition-wagon
      rumbled out through the Park gate. 2
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church-clock was striking nine when he reached Leila&rsquo;s flat, went up,
      and knocked. Sounds from-a piano ceased; the door was opened by Noel. She
      recoiled when she saw who it was, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you come, Daddy? It was much better not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you alone here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Leila gave me her key. She has to be at the hospital till ten
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come home with me, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel closed the piano, and sat down on the divan. Her face had the same
      expression as when he had told her that she could not marry Cyril Morland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Nollie,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be unreasonable. We must see this through
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, that&rsquo;s childish. Do you think the mere accident of your being or
      not being at home can affect my decision as to what my duty is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s my being there that matters. Those people don&rsquo;t care, so long
      as it isn&rsquo;t an open scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is so, Daddy. Of course it&rsquo;s so, and you know it. If I&rsquo;m away
      they&rsquo;ll just pity you for having a bad daughter. And quite right too. I am
      a bad daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson smiled. &ldquo;Just like when you were a tiny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were a tiny again, or ten years older. It&rsquo;s this half age&mdash;But
      I&rsquo;m not coming back with you, Daddy; so it&rsquo;s no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson sat down beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking this over all day,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Perhaps in my
      pride I made a mistake when I first knew of your trouble. Perhaps I ought
      to have accepted the consequences of my failure, then, and have given up,
      and taken you away at once. After all, if a man is not fit to have the
      care of souls, he should have the grace to know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are fit,&rdquo; cried Noel passionately; &ldquo;Daddy, you are fit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. There is something wanting in me, I don&rsquo;t know exactly
      what; but something very wanting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s only that you&rsquo;re too good&mdash;that&rsquo;s why!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson shook his head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Nollie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; cried Noel. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too gentle, and you&rsquo;re too good. You&rsquo;re
      charitable, and you&rsquo;re simple, and you believe in another world; that&rsquo;s
      what&rsquo;s the matter with you, Daddy. Do you think they do, those people who
      want to chase us out? They don&rsquo;t even begin to believe, whatever they say
      or think. I hate them, and sometimes I hate the Church; either it&rsquo;s hard
      and narrow, or else it&rsquo;s worldly.&rdquo; She stopped at the expression on her
      father&rsquo;s face, the most strange look of pain, and horror, as if an
      unspoken treachery of his own had been dragged forth for his inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking wildly,&rdquo; he said, but his lips were trembling. &ldquo;You
      mustn&rsquo;t say things like that; they&rsquo;re blasphemous and wicked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel bit her lips, sitting very stiff and still, against a high blue
      cushion. Then she burst out again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve slaved for those people years and years, and you&rsquo;ve had no
      pleasure and you&rsquo;ve had no love; and they wouldn&rsquo;t care that if you broke
      your heart. They don&rsquo;t care for anything, so long as it all seems proper.
      Daddy, if you let them hurt you, I won&rsquo;t forgive you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what if you hurt me now, Nollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel pressed his hand against her warm cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Oh, no! I don&rsquo;t&mdash;I won&rsquo;t. Not again. I&rsquo;ve done that
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my dear! then come home with me, and we&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s best to
      be done. It can&rsquo;t be settled by running away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel dropped his hand. &ldquo;No. Twice I&rsquo;ve done what you wanted, and it&rsquo;s been
      a mistake. If I hadn&rsquo;t gone to Church on Sunday to please you, perhaps it
      would never have come to this. You don&rsquo;t see things, Daddy. I could tell,
      though I was sitting right in front. I knew what their faces were like,
      and what they were thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must do right, Nollie, and not mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but what is right? It&rsquo;s not right for me to hurt you, and I&rsquo;m not
      going to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson understood all at once that it was useless to try and move her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I shall go to Kestrel to-morrow. Auntie will have me, I know; I
      shall talk to Leila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you do, promise to let me know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy, you&mdash;look awfully, awfully tired. I&rsquo;m going to give you some
      medicine.&rdquo; She went to a little three-cornered cupboard, and bent down.
      Medicine! The medicine he wanted was not for the body; knowledge of what
      his duty was&mdash;that alone could heal him!
    </p>
    <p>
      The loud popping of a cork roused him. &ldquo;What are you doing, Nollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel rose with a flushed face, holding in one hand a glass of champagne,
      in the other a biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re to take this; and I&rsquo;m going to have some myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Pierson bewildered; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink it; Daddy! Don&rsquo;t you know that Leila would never forgive me if I
      let you go home looking like that. Besides, she told me I was to eat.
      Drink it. You can send her a nice present. Drink it!&rdquo; And she stamped her
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson took the glass, and sat there nibbling and sipping. It was nice,
      very! He had not quite realised how much he needed food and drink. Noel
      returned from the cupboard a second time; she too had a glass and a
      biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you look better already. Now you&rsquo;re to go home at once, in a cab
      if you can get one; and tell Gratian to make you feed up, or you won&rsquo;t
      have a body at all; you can&rsquo;t do your duty if you haven&rsquo;t one, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson smiled, and finished the champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel took the glass from him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my child to-night, and I&rsquo;m going to
      send you to bed. Don&rsquo;t worry, Daddy; it&rsquo;ll all come right.&rdquo; And, taking
      his arm, she went downstairs with him, and blew him a kiss from the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked away in a sort of dream. Daylight was not quite gone, but the
      moon was up, just past its full, and the search-lights had begun their
      nightly wanderings. It was a sky of ghosts and shadows, fitting to the
      thought which came to him. The finger of Providence was in all this,
      perhaps! Why should he not go out to France! At last; why not? Some better
      man, who understood men&rsquo;s hearts, who knew the world, would take his
      place; and he could go where death made all things simple, and he could
      not fail. He walked faster and faster, full of an intoxicating relief.
      Thirza and Gratian would take care of Nollie far better than he. Yes,
      surely it was ordained! Moonlight had the town now; and all was steel
      blue, the very air steel-blue; a dream-city of marvellous beauty, through
      which he passed, exalted. Soon he would be where that poor boy, and a
      million others, had given their lives; with the mud and the shells and the
      scarred grey ground, and the jagged trees, where Christ was daily
      crucified&mdash;there where he had so often longed to be these three years
      past. It was ordained!
    </p>
    <p>
      And two women whom he met looked at each other when he had gone by, and
      those words &lsquo;the blighted crow&rsquo; which they had been about to speak, died
      on their lips.

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Noel felt light-hearted too, as if she had won a victory. She found some
      potted meat, spread it on another biscuit, ate it greedily, and finished
      the pint bottle of champagne. Then she hunted for the cigarettes, and sat
      down at the piano. She played old tunes&mdash;&ldquo;There is a Tavern in the
      Town,&rdquo; &ldquo;Once I Loved a Maiden Fair,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mowing the Barley,&rdquo; &ldquo;Clementine,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Lowlands,&rdquo; and sang to them such words as she remembered. There was a
      delicious running in her veins, and once she got up and danced. She was
      kneeling at the window, looking out, when she heard the door open, and
      without getting up, cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a gorgeous night! I&rsquo;ve had Daddy here. I gave him some of your
      champagne, and drank the rest&mdash;&rdquo; then was conscious of a figure far
      too tall for Leila, and a man&rsquo;s voice saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry. It&rsquo;s only I, Jimmy Fort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel scrambled up. &ldquo;Leila isn&rsquo;t in; but she will be directly&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      past ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was standing stock-still in the middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down? Oh! and won&rsquo;t you have a cigarette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the flash of his briquette she saw his face clearly; the look on it
      filled her with a sort of malicious glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Would you mind telling Leila that I found I
      couldn&rsquo;t stop?&rdquo; She made towards the divan to get her hat. When she had
      put it on, she found him standing just in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noel-if you don&rsquo;t mind me calling you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go; I&rsquo;m going myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Not for worlds.&rdquo; She tried to slip past, but he took hold of her
      wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please; just one minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel stayed motionless, looking at him, while his hand still held her
      wrist. He said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind telling me why you came here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just to see Leila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things have come to a head at home, haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came for refuge, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry; from the need of hurting your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it would come to that. What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enjoy myself.&rdquo; She was saying something fatuous, yet she meant it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s absurd. Don&rsquo;t be angry! You&rsquo;re quite right. Only, you must begin
      at the right end, mustn&rsquo;t you? Sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel tried to free her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; sit down, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel sat down; but as he loosed her wrist, she laughed. This was where he
      sat with Leila, where they would sit when she was gone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully
      funny, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny?&rdquo; he muttered savagely. &ldquo;Most things are, in this funny world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of a taxi stopping not far off had come to her ears, and she
      gathered her feet under her, planting them firmly. If she sprang up, could
      she slip by him before he caught her arm again, and get that taxi?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I go now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you promise me to stop till you&rsquo;ve seen
      Leila?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s foolish. Come, promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel shook her head. She felt a perverse pleasure at his embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leila&rsquo;s lucky, isn&rsquo;t she? No children, no husband, no father, no
      anything. Lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw his arm go up as if to ward off a blow. &ldquo;Poor Leila!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you sorry for her? She has freedom! And she has you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew it would hurt; but she wanted to hurt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t envy her for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had just spoken, when Noel saw a figure over by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She jumped up, and said breathlessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here you are, Leila! Father&rsquo;s been here, and we&rsquo;ve had some of your
      champagne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital! You are in the dark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel felt the blood rush into her cheeks. The light leaped up, and Leila
      came forward. She looked extremely pale, calm, and self-contained, in her
      nurse&rsquo;s dress; her full lips were tightly pressed together, but Noel could
      see her breast heaving violently. A turmoil of shame and wounded pride
      began raging in the girl. Why had she not flown long ago? Why had she let
      herself be trapped like this? Leila would think she had been making up to
      him! Horrible! Disgusting! Why didn&rsquo;t he&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t some one, speak?
      Then Leila said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you, Jimmy; I&rsquo;m glad you haven&rsquo;t been dull. Noel is
      staying here to-night. Give me a cigarette. Sit down, both of you. I&rsquo;m
      awfully tired!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank into a chair, leaning back, with her knees crossed; and at that
      moment Noel admired her. She had said it beautifully; she looked so calm.
      Fort was lighting her cigarette; his hand was shaking, his face all sorry
      and mortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give Noel one, too, and draw the curtains, Jimmy. Quick! Not that it
      makes any difference; it&rsquo;s as light as day. Sit down, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Noel remained standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been talking of? Love and Chinese lanterns, or only me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At those words Fort, who was drawing the last curtain, turned round; his
      tall figure was poised awkwardly against the wall, his face, unsuited to
      diplomacy, had a look as of flesh being beaten. If weals had started up
      across it, Noel would not have been surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said with painful slowness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know; we had hardly begun, had we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night is young,&rdquo; said Leila. &ldquo;Go on while I just take off my things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose with the cigarette between her lips, and went into the inner
      room. In passing, she gave Noel a look. What there was in that look, the
      girl could never make clear even to herself. Perhaps a creature shot would
      gaze like that, with a sort of profound and distant questioning, reproach,
      and anger, with a sort of pride, and the quiver of death. As the door
      closed, Fort came right across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to her;&rdquo; cried Noel; &ldquo;she wants you. Can&rsquo;t you see, she wants you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And before he could move, she was at the door. She flew downstairs, and
      out into the moonlight. The taxi, a little way off, was just beginning to
      move away; she ran towards it, calling out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere! Piccadilly!&rdquo; and jumping in, blotted herself against the
      cushions in the far corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not come to herself, as it were, for several minutes, and then
      feeling she &lsquo;could no longer bear the cab, stopped it, and got out. Where
      was she? Bond Street! She began, idly, wandering down its narrow length;
      the fullest street by day, the emptiest by night. Oh! it had been
      horrible! Nothing said by any of them&mdash;nothing, and yet everything
      dragged out&mdash;of him, of Leila, of herself! She seemed to have no
      pride or decency left, as if she had been caught stealing. All her happy
      exhilaration was gone, leaving a miserable recklessness. Nothing she did
      was right, nothing turned out well, so what did it all matter? The
      moonlight flooding down between the tall houses gave her a peculiar heady
      feeling. &ldquo;Fey&rdquo; her father had called her. She laughed. &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m not going
      home,&rsquo; she thought. Bored with the street&rsquo;s length; she turned off, and
      was suddenly in Hanover Square. There was the Church, grey-white, where
      she had been bridesmaid to a second cousin, when she was fifteen. She
      seemed to see it all again&mdash;her frock, the lilies in her hand, the
      surplices of the choir, the bride&rsquo;s dress, all moonlight-coloured, and
      unreal. &lsquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s become of her!&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead, I
      expect, like Cyril!&rsquo; She saw her father&rsquo;s face as he was marrying them,
      heard his voice: &ldquo;For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in
      sickness and in health, till death do you part.&rdquo; And the moonlight on the
      Church seemed to shift and quiver-some pigeons perhaps had been disturbed
      up there. Then instead of that wedding vision, she saw Monsieur Barra,
      sitting on his chair, gazing at the floor, and Chica nursing her doll.
      &ldquo;All mad, mademoiselle, a little mad. Millions of men with white souls,
      but all a little tiny bit mad, you know.&rdquo; Then Leila&rsquo;s face came before
      her, with that look in her eyes. She felt again the hot clasp of Fort&rsquo;s
      fingers on her wrist, and walked on, rubbing it with the other hand. She
      turned into Regent Street. The wide curve of the Quadrant swept into a sky
      of unreal blue, and the orange-shaded lamps merely added to the unreality.
      &lsquo;Love and Chinese lanterns! I should like some coffee,&rsquo; she thought
      suddenly. She was quite close to the place where Lavendie had taken her.
      Should she go in there? Why not? She must go somewhere. She turned into
      the revolving cage of glass. But no sooner was she imprisoned there than
      in a flash Lavendie&rsquo;s face of disgust; and the red-lipped women, the green
      stuff that smelled of peppermint came back, filling her with a rush of
      dismay. She made the full circle in the revolving cage; and came out into
      the street again with a laugh. A tall young man in khaki stood there:
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come in and dance!&rdquo; She started, recoiled from him and
      began to walk away as fast as ever she could. She passed a woman whose
      eyes seemed to scorch her. A woman like a swift vision of ruin with those
      eyes, and thickly powdered cheeks, and loose red mouth. Noel shuddered and
      fled along, feeling that her only safety lay in speed. But she could not
      walk about all night. There would be no train for Kestrel till the morning&mdash;and
      did she really want to go there, and eat her heart out? Suddenly she
      thought of George. Why should she not go down to him? He would know what
      was best for her to do. At the foot of the steps below the Waterloo Column
      she stood still. All was quiet there and empty, the great buildings
      whitened, the trees blurred and blue; and sweeter air was coming across
      their flowering tops. The queer &ldquo;fey&rdquo; moony sensation was still with her;
      so that she felt small and light, as if she could have floated through a
      ring. Faint rims of light showed round the windows of the Admiralty. The
      war! However lovely the night, however sweet the lilac smelt-that never
      stopped! She turned away and passed out under the arch, making for the
      station. The train of the wounded had just come in, and she stood in the
      cheering crowd watching the ambulances run out. Tears of excited emotion
      filled her eyes, and trickled down. Steady, smooth, grey, one after the
      other they came gliding, with a little burst of cheers greeting each one.
      All were gone now, and she could pass in. She went to the buffet and got a
      large cup of coffee, and a bun. Then, having noted the time of her early
      morning train, she sought the ladies&rsquo; waiting-room, and sitting down in a
      corner, took out her purse and counted her money. Two pounds
      fifteen-enough to go to the hotel, if she liked. But, without luggage&mdash;it
      was so conspicuous, and she could sleep in this corner all right, if she
      wanted. What did girls do who had no money, and no friends to go to?
      Tucked away in the corner of that empty, heavy, varnished room, she seemed
      to see the cruelty and hardness of life as she had never before seen it,
      not even when facing her confinement. How lucky she had been, and was!
      Everyone was good to her. She had no real want or dangers, to face. But,
      for women&mdash;yes, and men too&mdash;who had no one to fall back on,
      nothing but their own hands and health and luck, it must be awful. That
      girl whose eyes had scorched her&mdash;perhaps she had no one&mdash;nothing.
      And people who were born ill, and the millions of poor women, like those
      whom she had gone visiting with Gratian sometimes in the poorer streets of
      her father&rsquo;s parish&mdash;for the first time she seemed to really know and
      feel the sort of lives they led. And then, Leila&rsquo;s face came back to her
      once more&mdash;Leila whom she had robbed. And the worst of it was, that,
      alongside her remorseful sympathy, she felt a sort of satisfaction. She
      could not help his not loving Leila, she could not help it if he loved
      herself! And he did&mdash;she knew it! To feel that anyone loved her was
      so comforting. But it was all awful! And she&mdash;the cause of it! And
      yet&mdash;she had never done or said anything to attract him. No! She
      could not have helped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had begun to feel drowsy, and closed her eyes. And gradually there
      came on her a cosey sensation, as if she were leaning up against someone
      with her head tucked in against his shoulder, as she had so often leaned
      as a child against her father, coming back from some long darkening drive
      in Wales or Scotland. She seemed even to feel the wet soft Westerly air on
      her face and eyelids, and to sniff the scent of a frieze coat; to hear the
      jog of hoofs and the rolling of the wheels; to feel the closing in of the
      darkness. Then, so dimly and drowsily, she seemed to know that it was not
      her father, but someone&mdash;someone&mdash;then no more, no more at all.

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      She was awakened by the scream of an engine, and looked around her amazed.
      Her neck had fallen sideways while she slept, and felt horridly stiff; her
      head ached, and she was shivering. She saw by the clock that it was past
      five. &lsquo;If only I could get some tea!&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;Anyway I won&rsquo;t stay
      here any longer!&rsquo; When she had washed, and rubbed some of the stiffness
      out of her neck, the tea renewed her sense of adventure wonderfully. Her
      train did not start for an hour; she had time for a walk, to warm herself,
      and went down to the river. There was an early haze, and all looked a
      little mysterious; but people were already passing on their way to work.
      She walked along, looking at the water flowing up under the bright mist to
      which the gulls gave a sort of hovering life. She went as far as
      Blackfriars Bridge, and turning back, sat down on a bench under a
      plane-tree, just as the sun broke through. A little pasty woman with a
      pinched yellowish face was already sitting there, so still, and seeming to
      see so little, that Noel wondered of what she could be thinking. While she
      watched, the woman&rsquo;s face began puckering, and tears rolled slowly, down,
      trickling from pucker to pucker, till, summoning up her courage, Noel
      sidled nearer, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears seemed to stop from sheer surprise; little grey eyes gazed
      round, patient little eyes from above an almost bridgeless nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ad a baby. It&rsquo;s dead.... its father&rsquo;s dead in France.... I was goin&rsquo; in
      the water, but I didn&rsquo;t like the look of it, and now I never will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That &ldquo;Now I never will,&rdquo; moved Noel terribly. She slid her arm along the
      back of the bench and clasped the skinniest of shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my first. I&rsquo;m thirty-eight. I&rsquo;ll never &lsquo;ave another. Oh! Why
      didn&rsquo;t I go in the water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face puckered again, and the squeezed-out tears ran down. &lsquo;Of course
      she must cry,&rsquo; thought Noel; &lsquo;cry and cry till it feels better.&rsquo; And she
      stroked the shoulder of the little woman, whose emotion was disengaging
      the scent of old clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The father of my baby was killed in France, too,&rdquo; she said at last. The
      little sad grey eyes looked curiously round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was &lsquo;e? &lsquo;Ave you got your baby still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, oh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that. It &lsquo;urts so bad, it does. I&rsquo;d rather lose me &lsquo;usband
      than me baby, any day.&rdquo; The sun was shining now on a cheek of that
      terribly patient face; its brightness seemed cruel perching there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I do anything to help you?&rdquo; Noel murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, miss. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; &lsquo;ome now. I don&rsquo;t live far. Thank you
      kindly.&rdquo; And raising her eyes for one more of those half-bewildered looks,
      she moved away along the Embankment wall. When she was out of sight, Noel
      walked back to the station. The train was in, and she took her seat. She
      had three fellow passengers, all in khaki; very silent and moody, as men
      are when they have to get up early. One was tall, dark, and perhaps
      thirty-five; the second small, and about fifty, with cropped, scanty grey
      hair; the third was of medium height and quite sixty-five, with a long row
      of little coloured patches on his tunic, and a bald, narrow, well-shaped
      head, grey hair brushed back at the sides, and the thin, collected
      features and drooping moustache of the old school. It was at him that Noel
      looked. When he glanced out of the window, or otherwise retired within
      himself, she liked his face; but when he turned to the ticket-collector or
      spoke to the others, she did not like it half so much. It was as if the
      old fellow had two selves, one of which he used when alone, the other in
      which he dressed every morning to meet the world. They had begun to talk
      about some Tribunal on which they had to sit. Noel did not listen, but a
      word or two carried to her now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many to-day?&rdquo; she heard the old fellow ask, and the little cropped
      man answering: &ldquo;Hundred and fourteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fresh from the sight of the poor little shabby woman and her grief, she
      could not help a sort of shrinking from that trim old soldier, with his
      thin, regular face, who held the fate of a &ldquo;Hundred and fourteen&rdquo; in his
      firm, narrow grasp, perhaps every day. Would he understand their troubles
      or wants? Of course he wouldn&rsquo;t! Then, she saw him looking at her
      critically with his keen eyes. If he had known her secret, he would be
      thinking: &lsquo;A lady and act like that! Oh, no! Quite-quite out of the
      question!&rsquo; And she felt as if she could, sink under the seat with shame.
      But no doubt he was only thinking: &lsquo;Very young to be travelling by herself
      at this hour of the morning. Pretty too!&rsquo; If he knew the real truth of her&mdash;how
      he would stare! But why should this utter stranger, this old
      disciplinarian, by a casual glance, by the mere form of his face, make her
      feel more guilty and ashamed than she had yet felt? That puzzled her. He
      was, must be, a narrow, conventional old man; but he had this power to
      make her feel ashamed, because she felt that he had faith in his gods, and
      was true to them; because she knew he would die sooner than depart from
      his creed of conduct. She turned to the window, biting her lips-angry and
      despairing. She would never&mdash;never get used to her position; it was
      no good! And again she had the longing of her dream, to tuck her face away
      into that coat, smell the scent of the frieze, snuggle in, be protected,
      and forget. &lsquo;If I had been that poor lonely little woman,&rsquo; she thought,
      &lsquo;and had lost everything, I should have gone into the water. I should have
      rushed and jumped. It&rsquo;s only luck that I&rsquo;m alive. I won&rsquo;t look at that old
      man again: then I shan&rsquo;t feel so bad.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had bought some chocolate at the station, and nibbled it, gazing
      steadily at the fields covered with daisies and the first of the
      buttercups and cowslips. The three soldiers were talking now in carefully
      lowered voices. The words: &ldquo;women,&rdquo; &ldquo;under control,&rdquo; &ldquo;perfect plague,&rdquo;
       came to her, making her ears burn. In the hypersensitive mood caused by
      the strain of yesterday, her broken night, and the emotional meeting with
      the little woman, she felt as if they were including her among those
      &ldquo;women.&rdquo; &lsquo;If we stop, I&rsquo;ll get out,&rsquo; she thought. But when the train did
      stop it was they who got out. She felt the old General&rsquo;s keen veiled
      glance sum her up for the last time, and looked full at him just for a
      moment. He touched his cap, and said: &ldquo;Will you have the window up or
      down?&rdquo; and lingered to draw it half-way up.&rsquo; His punctiliousness made her
      feel worse than ever. When the train had started again she roamed up and
      down her empty carriage; there was no more a way out of her position than
      out of this rolling cushioned carriage! And then she seemed to hear Fort&rsquo;s
      voice saying: &lsquo;Sit down, please!&rsquo; and to feel his fingers clasp her wrist,
      Oh! he was nice and comforting; he would never reproach or remind her! And
      now, probably, she would never see him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train drew up at last. She did not know where George lodged, and would
      have to go to his hospital. She planned to get there at half past nine,
      and having eaten a sort of breakfast at the station, went forth into the
      town. The seaside was still wrapped in the early glamour which haunts
      chalk of a bright morning. But the streets were very much alive. Here was
      real business of the war. She passed houses which had been wrecked. Trucks
      clanged and shunted, great lorries rumbled smoothly by. Sea&mdash;and
      Air-planes were moving like great birds far up in the bright haze, and
      khaki was everywhere. But it was the sea Noel wanted. She made her way
      westward to a little beach; and, sitting down on a stone, opened her arms
      to catch the sun on her face and chest. The tide was nearly up, with the
      wavelets of a blue bright sea. The great fact, the greatest fact in the
      world, except the sun; vast and free, making everything human seem small
      and transitory! It did her good, like a tranquillising friend. The sea
      might be cruel and terrible, awful things it could do, and awful things
      were being done on it; but its wide level line, its never-ending song, its
      sane savour, were the best medicine she could possibly have taken. She
      rubbed the Shelly sand between her fingers in absurd ecstasy; took off her
      shoes and stockings, paddled, and sat drying her legs in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she left the little beach, she felt as if someone had said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your troubles are very little. There&rsquo;s the sun, the sea, the air; enjoy
      them. They can&rsquo;t take those from you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hospital she had to wait half an hour in a little bare room before
      George came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie! Splendid. I&rsquo;ve got an hour. Let&rsquo;s get out of this cemetery. We&rsquo;ll
      have time for a good stretch on the tops. Jolly of you to have come to me.
      Tell us all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had finished, he squeezed her arm. 348
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Your Dad forgot that he&rsquo;s a public figure, and
      must expect to be damned accordingly. But though you&rsquo;ve cut and run, he&rsquo;ll
      resign all the same, Nollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; cried Noel.
    </p>
    <p>
      George shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;ll resign, you&rsquo;ll see, he&rsquo;s got no worldly sense; not a grain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall have spoiled his life, just as if&mdash;oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down here. I must be back at eleven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat down on a bench, where the green cliff stretched out before them,
      over a sea quite clear of haze, far down and very blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he resign,&rdquo; cried Noel again, &ldquo;now that I&rsquo;ve gone? He&rsquo;ll be
      lost without it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Found, my dear. He&rsquo;ll be where he ought to be, Nollie, where the Church
      is, and the Churchmen are not&mdash;in the air!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Noel passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;m not chaffing. There&rsquo;s no room on earth for saints in
      authority. There&rsquo;s use for a saintly symbol, even if one doesn&rsquo;t hold with
      it, but there&rsquo;s no mortal use for those who try to have things both ways&mdash;to
      be saints and seers of visions, and yet to come the practical and worldly
      and rule ordinary men&rsquo;s lives. Saintly example yes; but not saintly
      governance. You&rsquo;ve been his deliverance, Nollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Daddy loves his Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George frowned. &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;ll be a wrench. A man&rsquo;s bound to have a
      cosey feeling about a place where he&rsquo;s been boss so long; and there is
      something about a Church&mdash;the drone, the scent, the half darkness;
      there&rsquo;s beauty in it, it&rsquo;s a pleasant drug. But he&rsquo;s not being asked to
      give up the drug habit; only to stop administering drugs to others. Don&rsquo;t
      worry, Nollie; I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s ever suited him, it wants a thicker
      skin than he&rsquo;s got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all the people he helps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No reason he shouldn&rsquo;t go on helping people, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to go on living there, without&mdash;Mother died there, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George grunted. &ldquo;Dreams, Nollie, all round him; of the past and the
      future, of what people are and what he can do with them. I never see him
      without a skirmish, as you know, and yet I&rsquo;m fond of him. But I should be
      twice as fond, and half as likely to skirmish, if he&rsquo;d drop the habits of
      authority. Then I believe he&rsquo;d have some real influence over me; there&rsquo;s
      something beautiful about him, I know that quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Noel fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a queer mixture,&rdquo; mused George. &ldquo;Clean out of his age; chalks
      above most of the parsons in a spiritual sense and chalks below most of
      them in the worldly. And yet I believe he&rsquo;s in the right of it. The Church
      ought to be a forlorn hope, Nollie; then we should believe in it. Instead
      of that, it&rsquo;s a sort of business that no one can take too seriously. You
      see, the Church spiritual can&rsquo;t make good in this age&mdash;has no chance
      of making good, and so in the main it&rsquo;s given it up for vested interests
      and social influence. Your father is a symbol of what the Church is not.
      But what about you, my dear? There&rsquo;s a room at my boarding-house, and only
      one old lady besides myself, who knits all the time. If Grace can get
      shifted we&rsquo;ll find a house, and you can have the baby. They&rsquo;ll send your
      luggage on from Paddington if you write; and in the meantime Gracie&rsquo;s got
      some things here that you can have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to send a wire to Daddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that. You come to my diggings at half past one, and I&rsquo;ll settle
      you in. Until then, you&rsquo;d better stay up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone she roamed a little farther, and lay down on the short
      grass, where the chalk broke through in patches. She could hear a distant
      rumbling, very low, travelling in that grass, the long mutter of the
      Flanders guns. &lsquo;I wonder if it&rsquo;s as beautiful a day there,&rsquo; she thought.
      &lsquo;How dreadful to see no green, no butterflies, no flowers-not even sky-for
      the dust of the shells. Oh! won&rsquo;t it ever, ever end?&rsquo; And a sort of
      passion for the earth welled up in her, the warm grassy earth along which
      she lay, pressed so close that she could feel it with every inch of her
      body, and the soft spikes of the grass against her nose and lips. An
      aching sweetness tortured her, she wanted the earth to close its arms
      about her, she wanted the answer to her embrace of it. She was alive, and
      wanted love. Not death&mdash;not loneliness&mdash;not death! And out
      there, where the guns muttered, millions of men would be thinking that
      same thought!

      Pierson had passed nearly the whole night with the relics of his past, the
      records of his stewardship, the tokens of his short married life. The idea
      which had possessed him walking home in the moonlight sustained him in
      that melancholy task of docketing and destruction. There was not nearly so
      much to do as one would have supposed, for, with all his dreaminess, he
      had been oddly neat and businesslike in all parish matters. But a hundred
      times that night he stopped, overcome by memories. Every corner, drawer,
      photograph, paper was a thread in the long-spun web of his life in this
      house. Some phase of his work, some vision of his wife or daughters
      started forth from each bit of furniture, picture, doorway. Noiseless, in
      his slippers, he stole up and down between the study, diningroom,
      drawing-room, and anyone seeing him at his work in the dim light which
      visited the staircase from above the front door and the upper-passage
      window, would have thought: &lsquo;A ghost, a ghost gone into mourning for the
      condition of the world.&rsquo; He had to make this reckoning to-night, while the
      exaltation of his new idea was on him; had to rummage out the very depths
      of old association, so that once for all he might know whether he had
      strength to close the door on the past. Five o&rsquo;clock struck before he had
      finished, and, almost dropping from fatigue, sat down at his little piano
      in bright daylight. The last memory to beset him was the first of all; his
      honeymoon, before they came back to live in this house, already chosen,
      furnished, and waiting for them. They had spent it in Germany&mdash;the
      first days in Baden-baden, and each morning had been awakened by a Chorale
      played down in the gardens of the Kurhaus, a gentle, beautiful tune, to
      remind them that they were in heaven. And softly, so softly that the tunes
      seemed to be but dreams he began playing those old Chorales, one after
      another, so that the stilly sounds floated out, through the opened window,
      puzzling the early birds and cats and those few humans who were abroad as
      yet.....
    </p>
    <p>
      He received the telegram from Noel in the afternoon of the same day, just
      as he was about to set out for Leila&rsquo;s to get news of her; and close on
      the top of it came Lavendie. He found the painter standing disconsolate in
      front of his picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle has deserted me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we shall all desert you soon, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am leaving here. I hope to go to France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is at the sea with my son-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter ran his hands through his hair, but stopped them half-way, as
      if aware that he was being guilty of ill-breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon dieu!&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Is this not a calamity for you, monsieur le cure?&rdquo;
       But his sense of the calamity was so patently limited to his unfinished
      picture that Pierson could not help a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, monsieur!&rdquo; said the painter, on whom nothing was lost. &ldquo;Comme je suis
      egoiste! I show my feelings; it is deplorable. My disappointment must seem
      a bagatelle to you, who will be so distressed at leaving your old home.
      This must be a time of great trouble. Believe me; I understand. But to
      sympathise with a grief which is not shown would be an impertinence, would
      it not? You English gentlefolk do not let us share your griefs; you keep
      them to yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson stared. &ldquo;True,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Quite true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no judge of Christianity, monsieur, but for us artists the doors of
      the human heart stand open, our own and others. I suppose we have no pride&mdash;c&rsquo;est
      tres-indelicat. Tell me, monsieur, you would not think it worthy of you to
      speak to me of your troubles, would you, as I have spoken of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson bowed his head, abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You preach of universal charity and love,&rdquo; went on Lavendie; &ldquo;but how can
      there be that when you teach also secretly the keeping of your troubles to
      yourselves? Man responds to example, not to teaching; you set the example
      of the stranger, not the brother. You expect from others what you do not
      give. Frankly, monsieur, do you not feel that with every revelation of
      your soul and feelings, virtue goes out of you? And I will tell you why,
      if you will not think it an offence. In opening your hearts you feel that
      you lose authority. You are officers, and must never forget that. Is it
      not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson grew red. &ldquo;I hope there is another feeling too. I think we feel
      that to speak of our sufferings or, deeper feelings is to obtrude oneself,
      to make a fuss, to be self-concerned, when we might be concerned with
      others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, au fond we are all concerned with self. To seem selfless is but
      your particular way of cultivating the perfection of self. You admit that
      not to obtrude self is the way to perfect yourself. Eh bien! What is that
      but a deeper concern with self? To be free of this, there is no way but to
      forget all about oneself in what one is doing, as I forget everything when
      I am painting. But,&rdquo; he added, with a sudden smile, &ldquo;you would not wish to
      forget the perfecting of self&mdash;it would not be right in your
      profession. So I must take away this picture, must I not? It is one of my
      best works: I regret much not to have finished it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day! The picture will stand still, but mademoiselle will not. She
      will rush at something, and behold! this face will be gone. No; I prefer
      to keep it as it is. It has truth now.&rdquo; And lifting down the canvas, he
      stood it against the wall and folded up the easel. &ldquo;Bon soir, monsieur,
      you have been very good to me.&rdquo; He wrung Pierson&rsquo;s hand; and his face for
      a moment seemed all eyes and spirit. &ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; Pierson murmured. &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I have great confidence in Him,&rdquo; replied Lavendie, &ldquo;but I
      shall ever remember that so good a man as you has wished it. To
      mademoiselle my distinguished salutations, if you please. If you will
      permit me, I will come back for my other things to-morrow.&rdquo; And carrying
      easel and canvas, he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson stayed in the old drawing-room, waiting for Gratian to come in,
      and thinking over the painter&rsquo;s words. Had his education and position
      really made it impossible for him to be brotherly? Was this the secret of
      the impotence which he sometimes felt; the reason why charity and love
      were not more alive in the hearts of his congregation? &lsquo;God knows I&rsquo;ve no
      consciousness of having felt myself superior,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;and yet I
      would be truly ashamed to tell people of my troubles and of my struggles.
      Can it be that Christ, if he were on earth, would count us Pharisees,
      believing ourselves not as other men? But surely it is not as Christians
      but rather as gentlemen that we keep ourselves to ourselves. Officers, he
      called us. I fear&mdash;I fear it is true.&rsquo; Ah, well! There would not be
      many more days now. He would learn out there how to open the hearts of
      others, and his own. Suffering and death levelled all barriers, made all
      men brothers. He was still sitting there when Gratian came in; and taking
      her hand, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noel has gone down to George, and I want you to get transferred and go to
      them, Gracie. I&rsquo;m giving up the parish and asking for a chaplaincy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giving up? After all this time? Is it because of Nollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I think not; I think the time has come. I feel my work here is
      barren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! And even if it is, it&rsquo;s only because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson smiled. &ldquo;Because of what, Gracie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve felt in myself. We want to think and decide things
      for ourselves, we want to own our consciences, we can&rsquo;t take things at
      second-hand any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson&rsquo;s face darkened. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to have lost faith is a grievous
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gaining charity,&rdquo; cried Gratian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two things are not opposed, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in theory; but in practice I think they often are. Oh, Dad! you look
      so tired. Have you really made up your mind? Won&rsquo;t you feel lost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a little. I shall find myself, out there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the look on his face was too much for Gratian&rsquo;s composure, and she
      turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson went down to his study to write his letter of resignation. Sitting
      before that blank sheet of paper, he realised to the full how strongly he
      had resented the public condemnation passed on his own flesh and blood,
      how much his action was the expression of a purely mundane championship of
      his daughter; of a mundane mortification. &lsquo;Pride,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;Ought I to
      stay and conquer it?&rsquo; Twice he set his pen down, twice took it up again.
      He could not conquer it. To stay where he was not wanted, on a sort of
      sufferance&mdash;never! And while he sat before that empty sheet of paper
      he tried to do the hardest thing a man can do&mdash;to see himself as
      others see him; and met with such success as one might expect&mdash;harking
      at once to the verdicts, not of others at all, but of his own conscience;
      and coming soon to that perpetual gnawing sense which had possessed him
      ever since the war began, that it was his duty to be dead. This feeling
      that to be alive was unworthy of him when so many of his flock had made
      the last sacrifice, was reinforced by his domestic tragedy and the bitter
      disillusionment it had brought. A sense of having lost caste weighed on
      him, while he sat there with his past receding from him, dusty and unreal.
      He had the queerest feeling of his old life falling from him, dropping
      round his feet like the outworn scales of a serpent, rung after rung of
      tasks and duties performed day after day, year after year. Had they ever
      been quite real? Well, he had shed them now, and was to move out into life
      illumined by the great reality-death! And taking up his pen, he wrote his
      resignation.

      XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1
    </h3>
    <p>
      The last Sunday, sunny and bright! Though he did not ask her to go,
      Gratian went to every Service that day. And the sight of her, after this
      long interval, in their old pew, where once he had been wont to see his
      wife&rsquo;s face, and draw refreshment therefrom, affected Pierson more than
      anything else. He had told no one of his coming departure, shrinking from
      the falsity and suppression which must underlie every allusion and
      expression of regret. In the last minute of his last sermon he would tell
      them! He went through the day in a sort of dream. Truly proud and
      sensitive, under this social blight, he shrank from all alike, made no
      attempt to single out supporters or adherents from those who had fallen
      away. He knew there would be some, perhaps many, seriously grieved that he
      was going; but to try and realise who they were, to weigh them in the
      scales against the rest and so forth, was quite against his nature. It was
      all or nothing. But when for the last time of all those hundreds, he
      mounted the steps of his dark pulpit, he showed no trace of finality, did
      not perhaps even feel it yet. For so beautiful a summer evening the
      congregation was large. In spite of all reticence, rumour was busy and
      curiosity still rife. The writers of the letters, anonymous and otherwise,
      had spent a week, not indeed in proclaiming what they had done, but in
      justifying to themselves the secret fact that they had done it. And this
      was best achieved by speaking to their neighbours of the serious and
      awkward situation of the poor Vicar. The result was visible in a better
      attendance than had been seen since summer-time began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson had never been a great preacher, his voice lacked resonance and
      pliancy, his thought breadth and buoyancy, and he was not free from, the
      sing-song which mars the utterance of many who have to speak
      professionally. But he always made an impression of goodness and
      sincerity. On this last Sunday evening he preached again the first sermon
      he had ever preached from that pulpit, fresh from the honeymoon with his
      young wife. &ldquo;Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.&rdquo;
       It lacked now the happy fervour of that most happy of all his days, yet
      gained poignancy, coming from so worn a face and voice. Gratian, who knew
      that he was going to end with his farewell, was in a choke of emotion long
      before he came to it. She sat winking away her tears, and not till he
      paused, for so long that she thought his strength had failed, did she look
      up. He was leaning a little forward, seeming to see nothing; but his
      hands, grasping the pulpit&rsquo;s edge, were quivering. There was deep silence
      in the Church, for the look of his face and figure was strange, even to
      Gratian. When his lips parted again to speak, a mist covered her eyes, and
      she lost sight of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends, I am leaving you; these are the last words I shall ever speak in
      this place. I go to other work. You have been very good to me. God has
      been very good to me. I pray with my whole heart that He may bless you
      all. Amen! Amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mist cleared into tears, and she could see him again gazing down at
      her. Was it at her? He was surely seeing something&mdash;some vision
      sweeter than reality, something he loved more dearly. She fell on her
      knees, and buried her face in her hand. All through the hymn she knelt,
      and through his clear slow Benediction: &ldquo;The peace of God, which passeth
      all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of
      God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and the blessing of God
      Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you and
      remain with you always.&rdquo; And still she knelt on; till she was alone in the
      Church. Then she rose and stole home. He did not come in; she did not
      expect him. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s over,&rsquo; she kept thinking; &lsquo;all over. My beloved Daddy!
      Now he has no home; Nollie and I have pulled him down. And yet I couldn&rsquo;t
      help it, and perhaps she couldn&rsquo;t. Poor Nollie!...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      2
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson had stayed in the vestry, talking with his choir and wardens;
      there was no hitch, for his resignation had been accepted, and he had
      arranged with a friend to carry on till the new Vicar was appointed. When
      they were gone he went back into the empty Church, and mounted to the
      organ-loft. A little window up there was open, and he stood leaning
      against the stone, looking out, resting his whole being. Only now that it
      was over did he know what stress he had been through. Sparrows were
      chirping, but sound of traffic had almost ceased, in that quiet Sunday
      hour of the evening meal. Finished! Incredible that he would never come up
      here again, never see those roof-lines, that corner of Square Garden, and
      hear this familiar chirping of the sparrows. He sat down at the organ and
      began to play. The last time the sound would roll out and echo &lsquo;round the
      emptied House of God. For a long time he played, while the building
      darkened slowly down there below him. Of all that he would leave, he would
      miss this most&mdash;the right to come and play here in the darkening
      Church, to release emotional sound in this dim empty space growing ever
      more beautiful. From chord to chord he let himself go deeper and deeper
      into the surge and swell of those sound waves, losing all sense of
      actuality, till the music and the whole dark building were fused in one
      rapturous solemnity. Away down there the darkness crept over the Church,
      till the pews, the altar-all was invisible, save the columns; and the
      walls. He began playing his favourite slow movement from Beethoven&rsquo;s
      Seventh Symphony&mdash;kept to the end, for the visions it ever brought
      him. And a cat, which had been stalking the sparrows, crept in through the
      little window, and crouched, startled, staring at him with her green eyes.
      He closed the organ, went quickly down, and locked up his Church for the
      last time. It was warmer outside than in, and lighter, for daylight was
      not quite gone. He moved away a few yards, and stood looking up. Walls,
      buttresses, and spire were clothed in milky shadowy grey. The top of the
      spire seemed to touch a star. &lsquo;Goodbye, my Church!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;Good-bye,
      good-bye!&rsquo; He felt his face quiver; clenched his teeth, and turned away.

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Noel fled, Fort had started forward to stop her; then, realising that
      with his lameness he could never catch her, he went back and entered
      Leila&rsquo;s bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had taken off her dress, and was standing in front of her glass, with
      the cigarette still in her mouth; and the only movement was the curling of
      its blue smoke. He could see her face reflected, pale, with a little spot
      of red in each cheek, and burning red ears. She had not seemed to hear him
      coming in, but he saw her eyes change when they caught his reflection in
      the mirror. From lost and blank, they became alive and smouldering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noel&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered, as if to his reflection in the glass
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t gone too? Ah, no! Of course&mdash;your leg! She fled, I
      suppose? It was rather a jar, my coming in, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it was my coming in that was the jar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila turned round. &ldquo;Jimmy! I wonder you could discuss me. The rest&mdash;&rdquo;
       She shrugged her shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;But that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not discussing you. I merely said you were not to be envied for
      having me. Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment he had spoken, he was sorry. The anger in her eyes changed
      instantly, first to searching, then to misery. She cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was to be envied. Oh! Jimmy; I was!&rdquo; and flung herself face down on the
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through Fort&rsquo;s mind went the thought: &lsquo;Atrocious!&rsquo; How could he soothe&mdash;make
      her feel that he loved her, when he didn&rsquo;t&mdash;that he wanted her, when
      he wanted Noel. He went up to the bedside and touched her timidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leila, what is it? You&rsquo;re overtired. What&rsquo;s the matter? I couldn&rsquo;t help
      the child&rsquo;s being here. Why do you let it upset you? She&rsquo;s gone. It&rsquo;s all
      right. Things are just as they were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; came the strangled echo; &ldquo;just!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knelt down and stroked her arm. It shivered under the touch, seemed to
      stop shivering and wait for the next touch, as if hoping it might be
      warmer; shivered again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What is it you want? I&rsquo;m ready to do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and drew herself up on the bed, screwing herself back against
      the pillow as if for support, with her knees drawn under her. He was
      astonished at the strength of her face and figure, thus entrenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jimmy!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want you to do nothing but get me another
      cigarette. At my age one expects no more than one gets!&rdquo; She held out her
      thumb and finger: &ldquo;Do you mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort turned away to get the cigarette. With what bitter restraint and
      curious little smile she had said that! But no sooner was he out of the
      room and hunting blindly for the cigarettes, than his mind was filled with
      an aching concern for Noel, fleeing like that, reckless and hurt, with
      nowhere to go. He found the polished birch-wood box which held the
      cigarettes, and made a desperate effort to dismiss the image of the girl
      before he again reached Leila. She was still sitting there, with her arms
      crossed, in the stillness of one whose every nerve and fibre was stretched
      taut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have one yourself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The pipe of peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort lit the cigarettes, and sat down on the edge of the bed; and his mind
      at once went back to Noel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said suddenly; &ldquo;I wonder where she&rsquo;s gone. Can you see her? She
      might do something reckless a second time. Poor Jimmy! It would be a pity.
      And so that monk&rsquo;s been here, and drunk champagne. Good idea! Get me some,
      Jimmy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Fort went, and with him the image of the girl. When he came back the
      second time; she had put on that dark silk garment in which she had
      appeared suddenly radiant the fatal night after the Queen&rsquo;s Hall concert.
      She took the wineglass, and passed him, going into the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and sit down,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is your leg hurting you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more than usual,&rdquo; and he sat down beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have some? &lsquo;In vino veritas;&rsquo; my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head, and said humbly: &ldquo;I admire you, Leila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s lucky. I don&rsquo;t know anyone else who, would.&rdquo; And she drank her
      champagne at a draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;that I had been one of those
      wonderful New Women, all brain and good works. How I should have talked
      the Universe up and down, and the war, and Causes, drinking tea, and never
      boring you to try and love me. What a pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But to Fort there had come Noel&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully funny, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leila,&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;something&rsquo;s got to be done. So long as you
      don&rsquo;t wish me to, I&rsquo;ll promise never to see that child again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, she&rsquo;s not a child. She&rsquo;s ripe for love; and&mdash;I&rsquo;m too
      ripe for love. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter, and I&rsquo;ve got to lump it.&rdquo; She
      wrenched her hand out of his and, dropping the empty glass, covered her
      face. The awful sensation which visits the true Englishman when a scene
      stares him in the face spun in Fort&rsquo;s brain. Should he seize her hands,
      drag them down, and kiss her? Should he get up and leave her alone? Speak,
      or keep silent; try to console; try to pretend? And he did absolutely
      nothing. So far as a man can understand that moment in a woman&rsquo;s life when
      she accepts the defeat of Youth and Beauty, he understood perhaps; but it
      was only a glimmering. He understood much better how she was recognising
      once for all that she loved where she was not loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I can&rsquo;t help that,&rsquo; he thought dumbly; &lsquo;simply can&rsquo;t help that!&rsquo;
      Nothing he could say or do would alter it. No words can convince a woman
      when kisses have lost reality. Then, to his infinite relief, she took her
      hands from her face, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very dull. I think you&rsquo;d better go, Jimmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made an effort to speak, but was too afraid of falsity in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very nearly a scene!&rdquo; said Leila. &ldquo;My God!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How men hate them! So do I. I&rsquo;ve had too many in my time; nothing comes
      of them but a headache next morning. I&rsquo;ve spared you that, Jimmy. Give me
      a kiss for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent down and put his lips to hers. With all his heart he tried to
      answer the passion in her kiss. She pushed him away suddenly, and said
      faintly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; you did try!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort dashed his hand across his eyes. The sight of her face just then
      moved him horribly. What a brute he felt! He took her limp hand, put it to
      his lips, and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall come in to-morrow. We&rsquo;ll go to the theatre, shall we? Good night,
      Leila!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, in opening the door, he caught sight of her face, staring at him,
      evidently waiting for him to turn; the eyes had a frightened look. They
      went suddenly soft, so soft as to give his heart a squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her hand, blew him a kiss, and he saw her smiling. Without
      knowing what his own lips answered, he went out. He could not make up his
      mind to go away, but, crossing to the railings, stood leaning against
      them, looking up at her windows. She had been very good to him. He felt
      like a man who has won at cards, and sneaked away without giving the loser
      his revenge. If only she hadn&rsquo;t loved him; and it had been a soulless
      companionship, a quite sordid business. Anything rather than this! English
      to the backbone, he could not divest himself of a sense of guilt. To see
      no way of making up to her, of straightening it out, made him feel
      intensely mean. &lsquo;Shall I go up again?&rsquo; he thought. The window-curtain
      moved. Then the shreds of light up there vanished. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s gone to bed,&rsquo; he
      thought. &lsquo;I should only upset her worse. Where is Noel, now, I wonder? I
      shall never see her again, I suppose. Altogether a bad business. My God,
      yes! A bad-bad business!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, painfully, for his leg was hurting him, he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leila was only too well aware of a truth that feelings are no less real,
      poignant, and important to those outside morality&rsquo;s ring fence than to
      those within. Her feelings were, indeed, probably even more real and
      poignant, just as a wild fruit&rsquo;s flavour is sharper than that of the tame
      product. Opinion&mdash;she knew&mdash;would say, that having wilfully
      chosen a position outside morality she had not half the case for
      brokenheartedness she would have had if Fort had been her husband: Opinion&mdash;she
      knew&mdash;would say she had no claim on him, and the sooner an illegal
      tie was broken, the better! But she felt fully as wretched as if she had
      been married. She had not wanted to be outside morality; never in her life
      wanted to be that. She was like those who by confession shed their sins
      and start again with a clear conscience. She never meant to sin, only to
      love, and when she was in love, nothing else mattered for the moment. But,
      though a gambler, she had always so far paid up. Only, this time the
      stakes were the heaviest a woman can put down. It was her last throw; and
      she knew it. So long as a woman believed in her attraction, there was
      hope, even when the curtain fell on a love-affair! But for Leila the lamp
      of belief had suddenly gone out, and when this next curtain dropped she
      felt that she must sit in the dark until old age made her indifferent. And
      between forty-four and real old age a gulf is fixed. This was the first
      time a man had tired of her. Why! he had been tired before he began, or so
      she felt. In one swift moment as of a drowning person, she saw again all
      the passages of their companionship, knew with certainty that it had never
      been a genuine flame. Shame ran, consuming, in her veins. She buried her
      face in the cushions. This girl had possessed his real heart all the time.
      With a laugh she thought: &lsquo;I put my money on the wrong horse; I ought to
      have backed Edward. I could have turned that poor monk&rsquo;s head. If only I
      had never seen Jimmy again; if I had torn his letter up, I could have made
      poor Edward love me!&rsquo; Ifs! What folly! Things happened as they must!
    </p>
    <p>
      And, starting up, she began to roam the little room. Without Jimmy she
      would be wretched, with him she would be wretched too! &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to
      see his face,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;and I can&rsquo;t live here without him! It&rsquo;s
      really funny!&rsquo; The thought of her hospital filled her with loathing. To go
      there day after day with this despair eating at her heart&mdash;she simply
      could not. She went over her resources. She had more money than she
      thought; Jimmy had given her a Christmas present of five hundred pounds.
      She had wanted to tear up the cheque, or force him to take it back; but
      the realities of the previous five years had prevailed with her, and she
      had banked it. She was glad now. She had not to consider money. Her mind
      sought to escape in the past. She thought of her first husband, Ronny
      Fane; of their mosquito-curtained rooms in that ghastly Madras heat. Poor
      Ronny! What a pale, cynical young ghost started up under that name. She
      thought of Lynch, his horsey, matter-of-fact solidity. She had loved them
      both&mdash;for a time. She thought of the veldt, of Constantia, and the
      loom of Table Mountain under the stars; and the first sight of Jimmy, his
      straight look, the curve of his crisp head, the kind, fighting-schoolboy
      frankness of his face. Even now, after all those months of their
      companionship, that long-ago evening at grape harvest, when she sang to
      him under the scented creepers, was the memory of him most charged with
      real feeling. That one evening at any rate he had longed for her, eleven:
      years ago, when she was in her prime. She could have held her own then;
      Noel would have come in vain. To think that this girl had still fifteen
      years before she would be even in her prime. Fifteen years of witchery;
      and then another ten before she was on the shelf. Why! if Noel married
      Jimmy, he would be an old man doting on her still, by the time she had
      reached this fatal age of forty-four: She felt as if she must scream, and;
      stuffing her handkerchief into her mouth, turned out the light. Darkness
      cooled her, a little. She pulled aside the curtains, and let in the moon
      light. Jimmy and that girl were out in it some where, seeking each other,
      if not in body, then in thought. And soon, somehow, somewhere, they would
      come together&mdash;come together because Fate meant them to! Fate which
      had given her young cousin a likeness to herself; placed her, too, in just
      such a hopeless position as appealed to Jimmy, and gave him a chance
      against younger men. She saw it with bitter surety. Good gamblers cut
      their losses! Yes, and proud women did not keep unwilling lovers! If she
      had even an outside chance, she would trail her pride, drag it through the
      mud, through thorns! But she had not. And she clenched her fist, and
      struck out at the night, as though at the face of that Fate which one
      could never reach&mdash;impalpable, remorseless, surrounding Fate with its
      faint mocking smile, devoid of all human warmth. Nothing could set back
      the clock, and give her what this girl had. Time had &ldquo;done her in,&rdquo; as it
      &ldquo;did in&rdquo; every woman, one by one. And she saw herself going down the
      years, powdering a little more, painting a little more, touching up her
      hair, till it was all artifice, holding on by every little device&mdash;and
      all, to what end? To see his face get colder and colder, hear his voice
      more and more constrained to gentleness; and know that underneath,
      aversion was growing with the thought &lsquo;You are keeping me from life, and
      love!&rsquo; till one evening, in sheer nerve-break, she would say or do some
      fearful thing, and he would come no more. &lsquo;No, Jimmy!&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;find
      her, and stay with her. You&rsquo;re not worth all that!&rsquo; And puffing to the
      curtains, as though with that gesture she could shut out her creeping
      fate, she turned up the light and sat down at her writing table. She
      stayed some minutes motionless, her chin resting on her hands, the dark
      silk fallen down from her arms. A little mirror, framed in curiously
      carved ivory, picked up by her in an Indian bazaar twenty-five years ago,
      hung on a level with her face and gave that face back to her. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not
      ugly,&rsquo; she thought passionately, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not. I still have some looks left.
      If only that girl hadn&rsquo;t come. And it was all my doing. Oh, what made me
      write to both of them, Edward and Jimmy?&rsquo; She turned the mirror aside, and
      took up a pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR JIMMY,&rdquo; she wrote: &ldquo;It will be better for us both if you take a
      holiday from here. Don&rsquo;t come again till I write for you. I&rsquo;m sorry I made
      you so much disturbance to-night. Have a good time, and a good rest; and
      don&rsquo;t worry. Your&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So far she had written when a tear dropped on the page, and she had to
      tear it up and begin again. This time she wrote to the end&mdash;&ldquo;Your
      Leila.&rdquo; &lsquo;I must post it now,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;or he may not get it before
      to-morrow evening. I couldn&rsquo;t go through with this again.&rsquo; She hurried out
      with it and slipped it in a pillar box. The night smelled of flowers; and,
      hastening back, she lay down, and stayed awake for hours, tossing, and
      staring at the dark.

    <p>
      Leila had pluck, but little patience. Her one thought was to get away and
      she at once began settling up her affairs and getting a permit to return
      to South Africa. The excitements of purchase and preparation were as good
      an anodyne as she could have taken. The perils of the sea were at full
      just then, and the prospect of danger gave her a sort of pleasure. &lsquo;If I
      go down,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;all the better; brisk, instead of long and
      dreary.&rsquo; But when she had the permit and her cabin was booked, the
      irrevocability of her step came to her with full force. Should she see him
      again or no? Her boat started in three days, and she must decide. If in
      compunction he were to be affectionate, she knew she would never keep to
      her decision, and then the horror would begin again, till again she was
      forced to this same action. She let the hours go and go till the very day
      before, when the ache to see him and the dread of it had become so
      unbearable that she could not keep quiet. Late that afternoon&mdash;everything,
      to the last label, ready&mdash;she went out, still undecided. An itch to
      turn the dagger in her wound, to know what had become of Noel, took her to
      Edward&rsquo;s house. Almost unconsciously she had put on her prettiest frock,
      and spent an hour before the glass. A feverishness of soul, more than of
      body, which had hung about her ever since that night, gave her colour. She
      looked her prettiest; and she bought a gardenia at a shop in Baker Street
      and fastened it in her dress. Reaching the old Square, she was astonished
      to see a board up with the words: &ldquo;To let,&rdquo; though the house still looked
      inhabited. She rang, and was shown into the drawing-room. She had only
      twice been in this house before; and for some reason, perhaps because of
      her own unhappiness, the old, rather shabby room struck her as pathetic,
      as if inhabited by the past. &lsquo;I wonder what his wife was like,&rsquo; she
      thought: And then she saw, hanging against a strip of black velvet on the
      wall, that faded colour sketch of the slender young woman leaning forward,
      with her hands crossed in her lap. The colouring was lavender and old
      ivory, with faint touches of rose. The eyes, so living, were a little like
      Gratian&rsquo;s; the whole face delicate, eager, good. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;he
      must have loved you very much. To say good-bye must have been hard.&rsquo; She
      was still standing before it when Pierson came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dear face, Edward. I&rsquo;ve come to say good-bye. I&rsquo;m leaving for
      South Africa to-morrow.&rdquo; And, as her hand touched his, she thought: &lsquo;I
      must have been mad to think I could ever have made him love me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you&mdash;are you leaving him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila nodded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very brave, and wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no. Needs must when the devil drives&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. I don&rsquo;t give
      up happiness of my own accord. That&rsquo;s not within a hundred miles of the
      truth. What I shall become, I don&rsquo;t know, but nothing better, you may be
      sure. I give up because I can&rsquo;t keep, and you know why. Where is Noel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down at the sea, with George and Gratian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at her in wonder; and the pained, puzzled expression on his
      face angered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see the house is to let. Who&rsquo;d have thought a child like that could
      root up two fossils like us? Never mind, Edward, there&rsquo;s the same blood in
      us. We&rsquo;ll keep our ends up in our own ways. Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll give me a chaplaincy in the East, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a wild moment Leila thought: &lsquo;Shall I offer to go with him&mdash;the
      two lost dogs together?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would have happened, Edward, if you had proposed to me that May
      week, when we were&mdash;a little bit in love? Which would it have been,
      worst for, you or me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have taken me, Leila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, one never knows. But you&rsquo;d never have been a priest then, and you&rsquo;d
      never have become a saint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use that silly word. If you knew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do; I can see that you&rsquo;ve been half burned alive; half burned and half
      buried! Well, you have your reward, whatever it is, and I mine. Good-bye,
      Edward!&rdquo; She took his hand. &ldquo;You might give me your blessing; I want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson put his other hand on her shoulder and, bending forward, kissed
      her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears rushed up in Leila&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Ah me!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a sad
      world!&rdquo; And wiping the quivering off her lips with the back of her gloved
      hand, she went quickly past him to the door. She looked back from there.
      He had not stirred, but his lips were moving. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s praying for me!&rsquo; she
      thought. &lsquo;How funny!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      2
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment she was outside, she forgot him; the dreadful ache for Fort
      seemed to have been whipped up within her, as if that figure of lifelong
      repression had infuriated the love of life and pleasure in her. She must
      and would see Jimmy again, if she had to wait and seek for him all night!
      It was nearly seven, he would surely have finished at the War Office; he
      might be at his Club or at his rooms. She made for the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little street near Buckingham Gate, where no wag had chalked &ldquo;Peace&rdquo;
       on the doors for nearly a year now, had an arid look after a hot day&rsquo;s
      sun. The hair-dresser&rsquo;s shop below his rooms was still open, and the
      private door ajar: &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t ring,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go straight up.&rsquo;
      While she was mounting the two flights of stairs, she stopped twice,
      breathless, from a pain in her side. She often had that pain now, as if
      the longing in her heart strained it physically. On the modest landing at
      the top, outside his rooms, she waited, leaning against the wall, which
      was covered with a red paper. A window at the back was open and the
      confused sound of singing came in&mdash;a chorus &ldquo;Vive-la, vive-la,
      vive-la ve. Vive la compagnie.&rdquo; So it came to her. &lsquo;O God!&rsquo; she thought:
      &lsquo;Let him be in, let him be nice to me. It&rsquo;s the last time.&rsquo; And, sick from
      anxiety, she opened the door. He was in&mdash;lying on a wicker-couch
      against the wall in the far corner, with his arms crossed behind his head,
      and a pipe in his mouth; his eyes were closed, and he neither moved, nor
      opened them, perhaps supposing her to be the servant. Noiseless as a cat,
      Leila crossed the room till she stood above him. And waiting for him to
      come out of that defiant lethargy, she took her fill of his thin, bony
      face, healthy and hollow at the same time. With teeth clenched on the pipe
      it had a look of hard resistance, as of a man with his head back, his arms
      pinioned to his sides, stiffened against some creature, clinging and
      climbing and trying to drag him down. The pipe was alive, and dribbled
      smoke; and his leg, the injured one, wriggled restlessly, as if worrying
      him; but the rest of him was as utterly and obstinately still as though he
      were asleep. His hair grew thick and crisp, not a thread of grey in it,
      the teeth which held the pipe glinted white and strong. His face was
      young; so much younger than hers. Why did she love it&mdash;the face of a
      man who couldn&rsquo;t love her? For a second she felt as if she could seize the
      cushion which had slipped down off the couch, and smother him as he lay
      there, refusing, so it seemed to her, to come to consciousness. Love
      despised! Humiliation! She nearly turned and stole away. Then through the
      door, left open, behind her, the sound of that chorus: &ldquo;Vive-la, vive-la,
      vive-la ve!&rdquo; came in and jolted her nerves unbearably. Tearing the
      gardenia from her breast, she flung it on to his upturned face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort struggled up, and stared at her. His face was comic from
      bewilderment, and she broke into a little nervous laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t dreaming of me, dear Jimmy, that&rsquo;s certain. In what garden
      were you wandering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leila! You! How&mdash;how jolly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;how jolly! I wanted to see you, so I came. And I have seen you,
      as you are, when you aren&rsquo;t with me. I shall remember it; it was good for
      me&mdash;awfully good for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far, far away, my dear. Put my gardenia in, your buttonhole. Stop, I&rsquo;ll
      pin it in. Have you had a good rest all this week? Do you like my dress?
      It&rsquo;s new. You wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed it, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have noticed. I think it&rsquo;s charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy, I believe that nothing&mdash;nothing will ever shake your
      chivalry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chivalry? I have none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to shut the door, do you mind?&rdquo; But he went to the door
      himself, shut it, and came back to her. Leila looked up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy, if ever you loved me a little bit, be nice to me today. And if I
      say things&mdash;if I&rsquo;m bitter&mdash;don&rsquo;t mind; don&rsquo;t notice it.
      Promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took off her hat and sat leaning against him on the couch, so that she
      could not see his face. And with his arm round her, she let herself go,
      deep into the waters of illusion; down-down, trying to forget there was a
      surface to which she must return; like a little girl she played that game
      of make-believe. &lsquo;He loves me-he loves me&mdash;he loves me!&rsquo; To lose
      herself like that for, just an hour, only an hour; she felt that she would
      give the rest of the time vouchsafed to her; give it all and willingly.
      Her hand clasped his against her heart, she turned her face backward, up
      to his, closing her eyes so as still not to see his face; the scent of the
      gardenia in his coat hurt her, so sweet and strong it was.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When with her hat on she stood ready to go, it was getting dark. She had
      come out of her dream now, was playing at make-believe no more. And she
      stood with a stony smile, in the half-dark, looking between her lashes at
      the mortified expression on his unconscious face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Jimmy!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to keep you from dinner any longer.
      No, don&rsquo;t come with me. I&rsquo;m going alone; and don&rsquo;t light up, for heaven&rsquo;s
      sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand on the lapel of his coat. &ldquo;That flower&rsquo;s gone brown at
      the edges. Throw it away; I can&rsquo;t bear faded flowers. Nor can you. Get
      yourself a fresh one tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled the flower from his buttonhole and, crushing it in her hand,
      held her face up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, kiss me once more; it won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For one moment her lips clung to his with all their might. She wrenched
      them away, felt for the handle blindly, opened the door, and, shutting it
      in his face, went slowly, swaying a little, down the stairs. She trailed a
      gloved hand along the wall, as if its solidity could help her. At the last
      half-landing, where a curtain hung, dividing off back premises, she
      stopped and listened. There wasn&rsquo;t a sound. &lsquo;If I stand here behind this
      curtain,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;I shall see him again.&rsquo; She slipped behind the
      curtain, close drawn but for a little chink. It was so dark there that she
      could not see her own hand. She heard the door open, and his slow
      footsteps coming down the stairs. His feet, knees, whole figure came into
      sight, his face just a dim blur. He passed, smoking a cigarette. She
      crammed her hand against her mouth to stop herself from speaking and the
      crushed gardenia filled her nostrils with its cold, fragrant velvet. He
      was gone, the door below was shut. A wild, half-stupid longing came on her
      to go up again, wait till he came in, throw herself upon him, tell him she
      was going, beg him to keep her with him. Ah! and he would! He would look
      at her with that haggard pity she could not bear, and say, &ldquo;Of course,
      Leila, of course.&rdquo; No! By God, no! &ldquo;I am going quietly home,&rdquo; she
      muttered; &ldquo;just quietly home! Come along, be brave; don&rsquo;t be a fool! Come
      along!&rdquo; And she went down into the street: At the entrance to the Park she
      saw him, fifty yards in front, dawdling along. And, as if she had been his
      shadow lengthened out to that far distance, she moved behind him. Slowly,
      always at that distance, she followed him under the plane-trees, along the
      Park railings, past St. James&rsquo;s Palace, into Pall Mall. He went up some
      steps, and vanished into his Club. It was the end. She looked up at the
      building; a monstrous granite tomb, all dark. An emptied cab was just
      moving from the door. She got in. &ldquo;Camelot Mansions, St. John&rsquo;s Wood.&rdquo; And
      braced against the cushions, panting, and clenching her hands, she
      thought: &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve seen him again. Hard crust&rsquo;s better than no bread.
      Oh, God! All finished&mdash;not a crumb, not a crumb! Vive-la, vive-la,
      vive-la ve. Vive-la compagnie!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fort had been lying there about an hour, sleeping and awake, before that
      visit: He had dreamed a curious and wonderfully emotionalising dream. A
      long grey line, in a dim light, neither of night nor morning, the whole
      length of the battle-front in France, charging in short drives, which
      carried the line a little forward, with just a tiny pause and suck-back;
      then on again irresistibly, on and on; and at each rush, every voice, his
      own among them, shouted &ldquo;Hooray! the English! Hooray! the English!&rdquo; The
      sensation of that advancing tide of dim figures in grey light, the throb
      and roar, the wonderful, rhythmic steady drive of it, no more to be
      stopped than the waves of an incoming tide, was gloriously fascinating;
      life was nothing, death nothing. &ldquo;Hooray, the English!&rdquo; In that dream, he
      was his country, he was every one of that long charging line, driving
      forward in. those great heaving pulsations, irresistible, on and on. Out
      of the very centre of this intoxicating dream he had been dragged by some
      street noise, and had closed his eyes again, in the vain hope that he
      might dream it on to its end. But it came no more; and lighting his pipe,
      he lay there wondering at its fervid, fantastic realism. Death was
      nothing, if his country lived and won. In waking hours he never had quite
      that single-hearted knowledge of himself. And what marvellously real
      touches got mixed into the fantastic stuff of dreams, as if something were
      at work to convince the dreamer in spite of himself&mdash;&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; not
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; Just common &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; And &ldquo;the English,&rdquo; not the literary
      &ldquo;British.&rdquo; And then the soft flower had struck his forehead, and Leila&rsquo;s
      voice cried: &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she left him, his thought was just a tired: &lsquo;Well, so it&rsquo;s begun
      again!&rsquo; What did it matter, since common loyalty and compassion cut him
      off from what his heart desired; and that desire was absurd, as little
      likely of attainment as the moon. What did it matter? If it gave her any
      pleasure to love him, let it go on! Yet, all the time that he was walking
      across under the plane trees, Noel seemed to walk in front of him, just
      out of reach, so that he ached with the thought that he would never catch
      her up, and walk beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, on reaching his rooms in the evening, he found this letter
      on ship&rsquo;s note-paper, with the Plymouth postmark&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Fare thee well, and if for ever,
     Then for ever fare thee well&rdquo;
                          &ldquo;Leila&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He read it with a really horrible feeling, for all the world as if he had
      been accused of a crime and did not know whether he had committed it or
      not. And, trying to collect his thoughts, he took a cab and drove to her
      fiat. It was closed, but her address was given him; a bank in Cape Town.
      He had received his release. In his remorse and relief, so confusing and
      so poignant, he heard the driver of the cab asking where he wanted to go
      now. &ldquo;Oh, back again!&rdquo; But before they had gone a mile he corrected the
      address, in an impulse of which next moment he felt thoroughly ashamed.
      What he was doing indeed, was as indecent as if he were driving from the
      funeral of his wife to the boudoir of another woman. When he reached the
      old Square, and the words &ldquo;To let&rdquo; stared him in the face, he felt a
      curious relief, though it meant that he would not see her whom to see for
      ten minutes he felt he would give a year of life. Dismissing his cab, he
      stood debating whether to ring the bell. The sight of a maid&rsquo;s face at the
      window decided him. Mr. Pierson was out, and the young ladies were away.
      He asked for Mrs. Laird&rsquo;s address, and turned away, almost into the arms
      of Pierson himself. The greeting was stiff and strange. &lsquo;Does he know that
      Leila&rsquo;s gone?&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;If so, he must think me the most awful skunk.
      And am I? Am I?&rsquo; When he reached home, he sat down to write to Leila. But
      having stared at the paper for an hour and written these three lines&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR LEILA,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot express to you the feelings with which I received your letter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      he tore it up. Nothing would be adequate, nothing would be decent. Let the
      dead past bury its dead&mdash;the dead past which in his heart had never
      been alive! Why pretend? He had done his best to keep his end up. Why
      pretend?

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the boarding-house, whence the Lairds had not yet removed, the old lady
      who knitted, sat by the fireplace, and light from the setting sun threw
      her shadow on the wall, moving spidery and grey, over the yellowish
      distemper, in time to the tune of her needles. She was a very old lady&mdash;the
      oldest lady in the world, Noel thought&mdash;and she knitted without
      stopping, without breathing, so that the girl felt inclined to scream. In
      the evening when George and Gratian were not in, Noel would often sit
      watching the needles, brooding over her as yet undecided future. And now
      and again the old lady would look up above her spectacles; move the
      corners of her lips ever so slightly, and drop her gaze again. She had
      pitted herself against Fate; so long as she knitted, the war could not
      stop&mdash;such was the conclusion Noel had come to. This old lady knitted
      the epic of acquiescence to the tune of her needles; it was she who kept
      the war going such a thin old lady! &lsquo;If I were to hold her elbows from
      behind,&rsquo; the girl used to think, &lsquo;I believe she&rsquo;d die. I expect I ought
      to; then the war would stop. And if the war stopped, there&rsquo;d be love and
      life again.&rsquo; Then the little silvery tune would click itself once more
      into her brain, and stop her thinking. In her lap this evening lay a
      letter from her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAREST NOLLIE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to say I have my chaplaincy, and am to start for Egypt very
      soon. I should have wished to go to France, but must take what I can get,
      in view of my age, for they really don&rsquo;t want us who are getting on, I
      fear. It is a great comfort to me to think that Gratian is with you, and
      no doubt you will all soon be in a house where my little grandson can join
      you. I have excellent accounts of him in a letter from your aunt, just
      received: My child, you must never again think that my resignation has
      been due to you. It is not so. You know, or perhaps you don&rsquo;t, that ever
      since the war broke out, I have chafed over staying at home, my heart has
      been with our boys out there, and sooner or later it must have come to
      this, apart from anything else. Monsieur Lavendie has been round in the
      evening, twice; he is a nice man, I like him very much, in spite of our
      differences of view. He wanted to give me the sketch he made of you in the
      Park, but what can I do with it now? And to tell you the truth, I like it
      no better than the oil painting. It is not a likeness, as I know you. I
      hope I didn&rsquo;t hurt his feelings, the feelings of an artist are so very
      easily wounded. There is one thing I must tell you. Leila has gone back to
      South Africa; she came round one evening about ten days ago, to say
      goodbye. She was very brave, for I fear it means a great wrench for her. I
      hope and pray she may find comfort and tranquillity out there. And now, my
      dear, I want you to promise me not to see Captain Fort. I know that he
      admires you. But, apart from the question of his conduct in regard to
      Leila, he made the saddest impression on me by coming to our house the
      very day after her departure. There is something about that which makes me
      feel he cannot be the sort of man in whom I could feel any confidence. I
      don&rsquo;t suppose for a moment that he is in your thoughts, and yet before
      going so far from you, I feel I must warn you. I should rejoice to see you
      married to a good man; but, though I don&rsquo;t wish to think hardly of anyone,
      I cannot believe Captain Fort is that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall come down to you before I start, which may be in quite a short
      time now. My dear love to you and Gracie, and best wishes to George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ever loving father,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;EDWARD PIERSON&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Across this letter lying on her knees, Noel gazed at the spidery movement
      on the wall. Was it acquiescence that the old lady knitted, or was it
      resistance&mdash;a challenge to death itself, a challenge dancing to the
      tune of the needles like the grey ghost of human resistance to Fate! She
      wouldn&rsquo;t give in, this oldest lady in the world, she meant to knit till
      she fell into the grave. And so Leila had gone! It hurt her to know that;
      and yet it pleased her. Acquiescence&mdash;resistance! Why did Daddy
      always want to choose the way she should go? So gentle he was, yet he
      always wanted to! And why did he always make her feel that she must go the
      other way? The sunlight ceased to stream in, the old lady&rsquo;s shadow faded
      off the wall, but the needles still sang their little tune. And the girl
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you enjoy knitting, Mrs. Adam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady looked at her above the spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enjoy, my dear? It passes the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you want the time to pass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer for a moment, and Noel thought: &lsquo;How dreadful of me to
      have said that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said: Isn&rsquo;t it very tiring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when I don&rsquo;t think about it, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady cackled gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;well!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Noel thought: &lsquo;It must be dreadful to grow old, and pass the time!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She took up her father&rsquo;s letter, and bent it meditatively against her
      chin. He wanted her to pass the time&mdash;not to live, not to enjoy! To
      pass the time. What else had he been doing himself, all these years, ever
      since she could remember, ever since her mother died, but just passing the
      time? Passing the time because he did not believe in this life; not living
      at all, just preparing for the life he did believe in. Denying himself
      everything that was exciting and nice, so that when he died he might pass
      pure and saintly to his other world. He could not believe Captain Fort a
      good man, because he had not passed the time, and resisted Leila; and
      Leila was gone! And now it was a sin for him to love someone else; he must
      pass the time again. &lsquo;Daddy doesn&rsquo;t believe in life,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
      monsieur&rsquo;s picture. Daddy&rsquo;s a saint; but I don&rsquo;t want to be a saint, and
      pass the time. He doesn&rsquo;t mind making people unhappy, because the more
      they&rsquo;re repressed, the saintlier they&rsquo;ll be. But I can&rsquo;t bear to be
      unhappy, or to see others unhappy. I wonder if I could bear to be unhappy
      to save someone else&mdash;as Leila is? I admire her! Oh! I admire her!
      She&rsquo;s not doing it because she thinks it good for her soul; only because
      she can&rsquo;t bear making him unhappy. She must love him very much. Poor
      Leila! And she&rsquo;s done it all by herself, of her own accord.&rsquo; It was like
      what George said of the soldiers; they didn&rsquo;t know why they were heroes,
      it was not because they&rsquo;d been told to be, or because they believed in a
      future life. They just had to be, from inside somewhere, to save others.
      &lsquo;And they love life as much as I do,&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;What a beast it makes
      one feel!&rsquo; Those needles! Resistance&mdash;acquiescence? Both perhaps. The
      oldest lady in the world, with her lips moving at the corners, keeping
      things in, had lived her life, and knew it. How dreadful to live on when
      you were of no more interest to anyone, but must just &ldquo;pass the time&rdquo; and
      die. But how much more dreadful to &ldquo;pass the time&rdquo; when you were strong,
      and life and love were yours for the taking! &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t answer Daddy,&rsquo; she
      thought.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The maid, who one Saturday in July opened the door to Jimmy Fort, had
      never heard the name of Laird, for she was but a unit in the ceaseless
      procession which pass through the boarding-houses of places subject to
      air-raids. Placing him in a sitting-room, she said she would find Miss
      &lsquo;Allow. There he waited, turning the leaves of an illustrated Journal,
      wherein Society beauties; starving Servians, actresses with pretty legs,
      prize dogs, sinking ships, Royalties, shells bursting, and padres reading
      funeral services, testified to the catholicity of the public taste, but
      did not assuage his nerves. What if their address were not known here?
      Why, in his fear of putting things to the test, had he let this month go
      by? An old lady was sitting by the hearth, knitting, the click of whose
      needles blended with the buzzing of a large bee on the window-pane. &lsquo;She
      may know,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;she looks as if she&rsquo;d been here for ever.&rsquo; And
      approaching her, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can assure you those socks are very much appreciated, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady bridled over her spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It passes the time,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, more than that; it helps to win the war, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady&rsquo;s lips moved at the corners; she did not answer. &lsquo;Deaf!&rsquo; he
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask if you knew my friends, Doctor and Mrs. Laird, and Miss
      Pierson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady cackled gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! A pretty young girl; as pretty as life. She used to sit with me.
      Quite a pleasure to watch her; such large eyes she had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have they gone? Can you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a little cold douche on his heart. He longed to say: &lsquo;Stop knitting
      a minute, please. It&rsquo;s my life, to know.&rsquo; But the tune of the needles
      answered: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my life to knit.&rsquo; And he turned away to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She used to sit just there; quite still; quite still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort looked down at the window-seat. So, she used to sit just here, quite
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a dreadful war this is!&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;Have you been at the
      front?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think of the poor young girls who&rsquo;ll never have husbands! I&rsquo;m sure I
      think it&rsquo;s dreadful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fort; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dreadful&mdash;&rdquo; And then a voice from the doorway
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you want Doctor and Mrs. Laird, sir? East Bungalow their address is;
      it&rsquo;s a little way out on the North Road. Anyone will tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh of relief Fort looked gratefully at the old lady who had
      called Noel as pretty as life. &ldquo;Good afternoon, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good afternoon.&rdquo; The needles clicked, and little movements occurred at
      the corners of her mouth. Fort went out. He could not find a vehicle, and
      was a long time walking. The Bungalow was ugly, of yellow brick pointed
      with red. It lay about two-thirds up between the main road and cliffs, and
      had a rock-garden and a glaring, brand-new look, in the afternoon
      sunlight. He opened the gate, uttering one of those prayers which come so
      glibly from unbelievers when they want anything. A baby&rsquo;s crying answered
      it, and he thought with ecstasy: &lsquo;Heaven, she is here!&rsquo; Passing the
      rock-garden he could see a lawn at the back of the house and a
      perambulator out there under a holm-oak tree, and Noel&mdash;surely Noel
      herself! Hardening his heart, he went forward. In a lilac sunbonnet she
      was bending over the perambulator. He trod softly on the grass, and was
      quite close before she heard him. He had prepared no words, but just held
      out his hand. The baby, interested in the shadow failing across its pram,
      ceased crying. Noel took his hand. Under the sunbonnet, which hid her
      hair, she seemed older and paler, as if she felt the heat. He had no
      feeling that she was glad to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do? Have you seen Gratian; she ought to be in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come to see her; I came to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel turned to the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort stood at the end of the perambulator, and looked at that other
      fellow&rsquo;s baby. In the shade of the hood, with the frilly clothes, it
      seemed to him lying with its head downhill. It had scratched its snub nose
      and bumpy forehead, and it stared up at its mother with blue eyes, which
      seemed to have no underlids so fat were its cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what they think about,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel put her finger into the baby&rsquo;s fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They only think when they want some thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a deep saying: but his eyes are awfully interested in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel smiled; and very slowly the baby&rsquo;s curly mouth unclosed, and
      discovered his toothlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a darling,&rdquo; she said in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so are you,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;if only I dared say it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy is here,&rdquo; she said suddenly, without looking up. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sailing for
      Egypt the day after to-morrow. He doesn&rsquo;t like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort&rsquo;s heart gave a jump. Why did she tell him that, unless&mdash;unless
      she was just a little on his side?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sinner, as you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel looked up at him. &ldquo;Sin!&rdquo; she said, and bent again over her baby. The
      word, the tone in which she said it, crouching over her baby, gave him the
      thought: &lsquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for that little creature, I shouldn&rsquo;t have a dog&rsquo;s
      chance.&rsquo; He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see your father. Is he in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sunday; and Daddy&rsquo;s last day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Of course.&rdquo; He did not dare look back, to see if her gaze was
      following him, but he thought: &lsquo;Chance or no chance, I&rsquo;m going to fight
      for her tooth and nail.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a room darkened against the evening sun Pierson was sitting on a sofa
      reading. The sight of that figure in khaki disconcerted Fort, who had not
      realised that there would be this metamorphosis. The narrow face,
      clean-shaven now, with its deep-set eyes and compressed lips, looked more
      priestly than ever, in spite of this brown garb. He felt his hope suddenly
      to be very forlorn indeed. And rushing at the fence, he began abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to ask you, sir, for your permission to marry Noel, if she will
      have me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had thought Pierson&rsquo;s face gentle; it was not gentle now. &ldquo;Did you know
      I was here, then, Captain Fort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Noel in the garden. I&rsquo;ve said nothing to her, of course. But she
      told me you were starting to-morrow for Egypt, so I shall have no other
      chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry you have come. It is not for me to judge, but I don&rsquo;t think
      you will make Noel happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask you why, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Fort, the world&rsquo;s judgment of these things is not mine; but since
      you ask me. I will tell you frankly. My cousin Leila has a claim on you.
      It is her you should ask to marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did ask her; she refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. She would not refuse you again if you went out to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not free to go out to her; besides, she would refuse. She knows I
      don&rsquo;t love her, and never have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m a man, I suppose, and a fool&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was simply, &lsquo;because you are a man&rsquo; as you call it, it is clear
      that no principle or faith governs you. And yet you ask me to give you
      Noel; my poor Noel, who wants the love and protection not of a &lsquo;man&rsquo; but
      of a good man. No, Captain Fort, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort bit his lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m clearly not a good man in your sense of the word;
      but I love her terribly, and I would protect her. I don&rsquo;t in the least
      know whether she&rsquo;ll have me. I don&rsquo;t expect her to, naturally. But I warn
      you that I mean to ask her, and to wait for her. I&rsquo;m so much in love that
      I can do nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who is truly in love does what is best for the one he loves.&rdquo;
       Fort bent his head; he felt as if he were at school again, confronting his
      head-master. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I shall never trade on her
      position. If she can&rsquo;t feel anything for me now or in the future, I shan&rsquo;t
      trouble her, you may be sure of that. But if by some wonderful chance she
      should, I know I can make her happy, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s not a child,&rdquo; said Fort stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson touched the lapel of his new tunic. &ldquo;Captain Fort, I am going far
      away from her, and leaving her without protection. I trust to your
      chivalry not to ask her, till I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort threw back his head. &ldquo;No, no, I won&rsquo;t accept that position. With or
      without your presence the facts will be the same. Either she can love me,
      or she can&rsquo;t. If she can, she&rsquo;ll be happier with me. If she can&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s
      an end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson came slowly up to him. &ldquo;In my view,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are as bound to
      Leila as if you were married to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, expect me to take the priest&rsquo;s view, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson&rsquo;s lips trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call it a priest&rsquo;s view; I think it is only the view of a man of
      honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort reddened. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for my conscience,&rdquo; he said stubbornly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      tell you, and I&rsquo;m not going to, how things began. I was a fool. But I did
      my best, and I know that Leila doesn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m bound. If she had, she
      would never have gone. When there&rsquo;s no feeling&mdash;there never was real
      feeling on my side&mdash;and when there&rsquo;s this terribly real feeling for
      Noel, which I never sought, which I tried to keep down, which I ran away
      from&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. To go on with the other was foul. I should have thought you might
      have seen that, sir; but I did go on with it. It was Leila who made an
      end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leila behaved nobly, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was splendid; but that doesn&rsquo;t make me a brute.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierson turned away to the window, whence he must see Noel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is repugnant to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is there never to be any purity in her
      life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there never to be any life for her? At your rate, sir, there will be
      none. I&rsquo;m no worse than other men, and I love her more than they could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For fully a minute Pierson stood silent, before he said: &ldquo;Forgive me if
      I&rsquo;ve spoken harshly. I didn&rsquo;t mean to. I love her intensely; I wish for
      nothing but her good. But all my life I have believed that for a man there
      is only one woman&mdash;for a woman only one man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Sir,&rdquo; Fort burst out, &ldquo;you wish her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson had put his hand up, as if to ward off a blow; and, angry though
      he was, Fort stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all made of flesh and blood,&rdquo; he continued coldly, &ldquo;and it seems
      to me that you think we aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have spirits too, Captain Fort.&rdquo; The voice was suddenly so gentle that
      Fort&rsquo;s anger evaporated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a great respect for you, sir; but a greater love for Noel, and
      nothing in this world will prevent me trying to give my life to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile quivered over Pierson&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;If you try, then I can but pray
      that you will fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fort did not answer, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked slowly away from the bungalow, with his head down, sore, angry,
      and yet-relieved. He knew where he stood; nor did he feel that he had been
      worsted&mdash;those strictures had not touched him. Convicted of
      immorality, he remained conscious of private justifications, in a way that
      human beings have. Only one little corner of memory, unseen and
      uncriticised by his opponent, troubled him. He pardoned himself the rest;
      the one thing he did not pardon was the fact that he had known Noel before
      his liaison with Leila commenced; had even let Leila sweep him away on, an
      evening when he had been in Noel&rsquo;s company. For that he felt a real
      disgust with himself. And all the way back to the station he kept
      thinking: &lsquo;How could I? I deserve to lose her! Still, I shall try; but not
      now&mdash;not yet!&rsquo; And, wearily enough, he took the train back to town.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Both girls rose early that last day, and went with their father to
      Communion. As Gratian had said to George: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to me now, but it
      will mean a lot to him out there, as a memory of us. So I must go.&rdquo; And he
      had answered: &ldquo;Quite right, my dear. Let him have all he can get of you
      both to-day. I&rsquo;ll keep out of the way, and be back the last thing at
      night.&rdquo; Their father&rsquo;s smile when he saw them waiting for him went
      straight to both their hearts. It was a delicious day, and the early
      freshness had not yet dried out of the air, when they were walking home to
      breakfast. Each girl had slipped a hand under his arm. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like Moses or
      was it Aaron?&rsquo; Noel thought absurdly Memory had complete hold of her. All
      the old days! Nursery hours on Sundays after tea, stories out of the huge
      Bible bound in mother-o&rsquo;pearl, with photogravures of the Holy Land&mdash;palms,
      and hills, and goats, and little Eastern figures, and funny boats on the
      Sea of Galilee, and camels&mdash;always camels. The book would be on his
      knee, and they one on each arm of his chair, waiting eagerly for the pages
      to be turned so that a new picture came. And there would be the feel of
      his cheek, prickly against theirs; and the old names with the old glamour&mdash;to
      Gratian, Joshua, Daniel, Mordecai, Peter; to Noel Absalom because of his
      hair, and Haman because she liked the sound, and Ruth because she was
      pretty and John because he leaned on Jesus&rsquo; breast. Neither of them cared
      for Job or David, and Elijah and Elisha they detested because they hated
      the name Eliza. And later days by firelight in the drawing-room, roasting
      chestnuts just before evening church, and telling ghost stories, and
      trying to make Daddy eat his share. And hours beside him at the piano,
      each eager for her special hymns&mdash;for Gratian, &ldquo;Onward, Christian
      Soldiers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lead, Kindly Light,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O God Our Help&rdquo;; for Noel, &ldquo;Nearer,
      My God, to Thee,&rdquo; the one with &ldquo;The Hosts of Midian&rdquo; in it, and &ldquo;For Those
      in Peril on the Sea.&rdquo; And carols! Ah! And Choristers! Noel had loved one
      deeply&mdash;the word &ldquo;chorister&rdquo; was so enchanting; and because of his
      whiteness, and hair which had no grease on it, but stood up all bright;
      she had never spoken to him&mdash;a far worship, like that for a star. And
      always, always Daddy had been gentle; sometimes angry, but always gentle;
      and they sometimes not at all! And mixed up with it all, the dogs they had
      had, and the cats they had had, and the cockatoo, and the governesses, and
      their red cloaks, and the curates, and the pantomimes, and &ldquo;Peter Pan,&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo;&mdash;Daddy sitting between them, so that one
      could snuggle up. And later, the school-days, the hockey, the prizes, the
      holidays, the rush into his arms; and the great and wonderful yearly
      exodus to far places, fishing and bathing; walks and drives; rides and
      climbs, always with him. And concerts and Shakespeare plays in the
      Christmas and Easter holidays; and the walk home through the streets&mdash;all
      lighted in those days&mdash;one on each side of him. And this was the end!
      They waited on him at breakfast: they kept stealing glances at him,
      photographing him in their minds. Gratian got her camera and did actually
      photograph him in the morning sunlight with Noel, without Noel, with the
      baby; against all regulations for the defence of the realm. It was Noel
      who suggested: &ldquo;Daddy, let&rsquo;s take lunch out and go for all day on the
      cliffs, us three, and forget there&rsquo;s a war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So easy to say, so difficult to do, with the boom of the guns travelling
      to their ears along the grass, mingled with the buzz of insects. Yet that
      hum of summer, the innumerable voices of tiny lives, gossamer things all
      as alive as they, and as important to their frail selves; and the white
      clouds, few and so slow-moving, and the remote strange purity which clings
      to the chalky downs, all this white and green and blue of land and sea had
      its peace, which crept into the spirits of those three alone with Nature,
      this once more, the last time for&mdash;who could say how long? They
      talked, by tacit agreement, of nothing but what had happened before the
      war began, while the flock of the blown dandelions drifted past. Pierson
      sat cross-legged on the grass, without his cap, suffering a little still
      from the stiffness of his unwonted garments. And the girls lay one on each
      side of him, half critical, and half admiring. Noel could not bear his
      collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had a soft collar you&rsquo;d be lovely, Daddy. Perhaps out there
      they&rsquo;ll let you take it off. It must be fearfully hot in Egypt. Oh! I wish
      I were going. I wish I were going everywhere in the world. Some day!&rdquo;
       Presently he read to them, Murray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hippolytus&rdquo; of Euripides. And now and
      then Gratian and he discussed a passage. But Noel lay silent, looking at
      the sky. Whenever his voice ceased, there was the song of the larks, and
      very faint, the distant mutter of the guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stayed up there till past six, and it was time to go and have tea
      before Evening Service. Those hours in the baking sun had drawn virtue out
      of them; they were silent and melancholy all the evening. Noel was the
      first to go up to her bedroom. She went without saying good night&mdash;she
      knew her father would come to her room that last evening. George had not
      yet come in; and Gratian was left alone with Pierson in the drawing-room,
      round whose single lamp, in spite of close-drawn curtains, moths were
      circling: She moved over to him on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, promise me not to worry about Nollie; we&rsquo;ll take care of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can only take care of herself, Gracie, and will she? Did you know
      that Captain Fort was here yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is her feeling about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she knows. Nollie dreams along, and then suddenly rushes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish she were safe from that man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Dad, why? George likes him and so do I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A big grey moth was fluttering against the lamp. Pierson got up and caught
      it in the curve of his palm. &ldquo;Poor thing! You&rsquo;re like my Nollie; so soft,
      and dreamy, so feckless, so reckless.&rdquo; And going to the curtains, he
      thrust his hand through, and released the moth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; said Gratian suddenly, &ldquo;we can only find out for ourselves, even if
      we do singe our wings in doing it. We&rsquo;ve been reading James&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;Pragmatism.&rsquo; George says the only chapter that&rsquo;s important is missing&mdash;the
      one on ethics, to show that what we do is not wrong till it&rsquo;s proved wrong
      by the result. I suppose he was afraid to deliver that lecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson&rsquo;s face wore the smile which always came on it when he had to deal
      with George, the smile which said: &ldquo;Ah, George, that&rsquo;s very clever; but I
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that doctrine is the most dangerous in the world. I
      am surprised at George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think George is in danger, Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George is a man of wide experience and strong judgment and character; but
      think how fatal it would be for Nollie, my poor Nollie, whom a little gust
      can blow into the candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said Gratian stubbornly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone can be good
      or worth anything unless they judge for themselves and take risks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson went close to her; his face was quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us differ on this last night; I must go up to Nollie for a
      minute, and then to bed. I shan&rsquo;t see you to-morrow; you mustn&rsquo;t get up; I
      can bear parting better like this. And my train goes at eight. God bless
      you, Gracie; give George my love. I know, I have always known that he&rsquo;s a
      good man, though we do fight so. Good-bye, my darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out with his cheeks wet from Gratian&rsquo;s tears, and stood in the
      porch a minute to recover his composure. The shadow of the house stretched
      velvet and blunt over the rock-garden. A night-jar was spinning; the
      churring sound affected him oddly. The last English night-bird he would
      hear. England! What a night-to say good-bye! &lsquo;My country!&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;my
      beautiful country!&rsquo; The dew was lying thick and silvery already on the
      little patch of grass-the last dew, the last scent of an English night.
      The call of a bugle floated out. &ldquo;England!&rdquo; he prayed; &ldquo;God be about you!&rdquo;
       A little sound answered from across the grass, like an old man&rsquo;s cough,
      and the scrape and rattle of a chain. A face emerged at the edge of the
      house&rsquo;s shadow; bearded and horned like that of Pan, it seemed to stare at
      him. And he saw the dim grey form of the garden goat, heard it scuttle
      round the stake to which it was tethered, as though alarmed at this
      visitor to its&rsquo; domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up the half-flight of stairs to Noel&rsquo;s narrow little room, next
      the nursery. No voice answered his tap. It was dark, but he could see her
      at the window, leaning far out, with her chin on her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered without turning: &ldquo;Such a lovely night, Daddy. Come and look!
      I&rsquo;d like to set the goat free, only he&rsquo;d eat the rock plants. But it is
      his night, isn&rsquo;t it? He ought to be running and skipping in it: it&rsquo;s such
      a shame to tie things up. Did you never, feel wild in your heart, Daddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always, I think, Nollie; too wild. It&rsquo;s been hard to tame oneself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel slipped her hand through his arm. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and take the goat and
      skip together on the hills. If only we had a penny whistle! Did you hear
      the bugle? The bugle and the goat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson pressed the hand against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie, be good while I&rsquo;m away. You know what I don&rsquo;t want. I told you in
      my letter.&rdquo; He looked at her cheek, and dared say no more. Her face had
      its &ldquo;fey&rdquo; look again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;on a night like this, all the
      things, all the things&mdash;the stars have lives, Daddy, and the moon has
      a big life, and the shadows have, and the moths and the birds and the
      goats and the trees, and the flowers, and all of us&mdash;escaped? Oh!
      Daddy, why is there a war? And why are people so bound and so unhappy?
      Don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s God&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson could not answer, for there came into his mind the Greek song he
      had been reading aloud that afternoon&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;O for a deep and dewy Spring,
     With runlets cold to draw and drink,
     And a great meadow blossoming,
     Long-grassed, and poplars in a ring,
     To rest me by the brink.
     O take me to the mountain, O,
     Past the great pines and through the wood,
     Up where the lean hounds softly go,
     A-whine for wild things&rsquo; blood,
     And madly flies the dappled roe,
     O God, to shout and speed them there;
     An arrow by my chestnut hair
     Drawn tight and one keen glimmering spear
     Ah! if I could!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      All that in life had been to him unknown, of venture and wild savour; all
      the emotion he had stifled; the swift Pan he had denied; the sharp fruits,
      the burning suns, the dark pools, the unearthly moonlight, which were not
      of God&mdash;all came with the breath of that old song, and the look on
      the girl&rsquo;s face. And he covered his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel&rsquo;s hand tugged at his arm. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t beauty terribly alive,&rdquo; she
      murmured, &ldquo;like a lovely person? it makes you ache to kiss it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lips felt parched. &ldquo;There is a beauty beyond all that,&rdquo; he said
      stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holiness, duty, faith. O Nollie, my love!&rdquo; But Noel&rsquo;s hand tightened on
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you what I should like?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;To take God&rsquo;s hand
      and show Him things. I&rsquo;m certain He&rsquo;s not seen everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shudder went through Pierson, one of those queer sudden shivers, which
      come from a strange note in a voice, or a new sharp scent or sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, what things you say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But He hasn&rsquo;t, and it&rsquo;s time He did. We&rsquo;d creep, and peep, and see it all
      for once, as He can&rsquo;t in His churches. Daddy, oh! Daddy! I can&rsquo;t bear it
      any more; to think of them being killed on a night like this; killed and
      killed so that they never see it all again&mdash;never see it&mdash;never
      see it!&rdquo; She sank down, and covered her face with her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t! Oh! take it all away, the cruelty! Why does it come&mdash;why
      the stars and the flowers, if God doesn&rsquo;t care any more than that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horribly affected he stood bending over her, stroking her head. Then the
      habit of a hundred death-beds helped him. &ldquo;Come, Nollie! This life is but
      a minute. We must all die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not they&mdash;not so young!&rdquo; She clung to his knees, and looked up.
      &ldquo;Daddy, I don&rsquo;t want you to go; promise me to come back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The childishness of those words brought back his balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sweetheart, of course! Come, Nollie, get up. The sun&rsquo;s been too
      much for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel got up, and put her hands on her father&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Forgive me for
      all my badness, and all my badness to come, especially all my badness to
      come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierson smiled. &ldquo;I shall always forgive you, Nollie; but there won&rsquo;t be&mdash;there
      mustn&rsquo;t be any badness to come. I pray God to keep you, and make you like
      your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother never had a devil, like you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent from surprise. How did this child know the devil of wild
      feeling he had fought against year after year; until with the many years
      he had felt it weakening within him! She whispered on: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate my
      devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&mdash;it&rsquo;s part of me. Every day when the sun sets, I&rsquo;ll
      think of you, Daddy; and you might do the same&mdash;that&rsquo;ll keep me good.
      I shan&rsquo;t come to the station tomorrow, I should only cry. And I shan&rsquo;t say
      good-bye now. It&rsquo;s unlucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung her arms round him; and half smothered by that fervent embrace,
      he kissed her cheeks and hair. Freed of each other at last, he stood for a
      moment looking at her by the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There never was anyone more loving than you; Nollie!&rdquo; he said quietly.
      &ldquo;Remember my letter. And good night, my love!&rdquo; Then, afraid to stay
      another second, he went quickly out of the dark little room....
    </p>
    <p>
      George Laird, returning half an hour later, heard a voice saying softly:
      &ldquo;George, George!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking up, he saw a little white blur at the window, and Noel&rsquo;s face just
      visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, let the goat loose, just for to-night, to please me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in that voice, and in the gesture of her stretched-out arm moved
      George in a queer way, although, as Pierson had once said, he had no music
      in his soul. He loosed the goat.

    <p>
      In the weeks which succeeded Pierson&rsquo;s departure, Gratian and George often
      discussed Noel&rsquo;s conduct and position by the light of the Pragmatic
      theory. George held a suitably scientific view. Just as he would point out
      to his wife&mdash;in the physical world, creatures who diverged from the
      normal had to justify their divergence in competition with their
      environments, or else go under, so in the ethical world it was all a
      question of whether Nollie could make good her vagary. If she could, and
      grew in strength of character thereby, it was ipso facto all right, her
      vagary would be proved an advantage, and the world enriched. If not, the
      world by her failure to make good would be impoverished, and her vagary
      proved wrong. The orthodox and academies&mdash;he insisted&mdash;were
      always forgetting the adaptability of living organisms; how every action
      which was out of the ordinary, unconsciously modified all the other
      actions together with the outlook, and philosophy of the doer. &ldquo;Of course
      Nollie was crazy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but when she did what she did, she at once
      began to think differently about life and morals. The deepest instinct we
      all have is the instinct that we must do what we must, and think that what
      we&rsquo;ve done is really all right; in fact the&mdash;instinct of
      self-preservation. We&rsquo;re all fighting animals; and we feel in our bones
      that if we admit we&rsquo;re beaten&mdash;we are beaten; but that every fight we
      win, especially against odds, hardens those bones. But personally I don&rsquo;t
      think she can make good on her own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian, whose Pragmatism was not yet fully baked, responded doubtfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think she can. And if she could I&rsquo;m not sure. But isn&rsquo;t
      Pragmatism a perfectly beastly word, George? It has no sense of humour in
      it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a bit thick, and in the hands of the young, deuced likely to become
      Prigmatism; but not with Nollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They watched the victim of their discussions with real anxiety. The
      knowledge that she would never be more sheltered than she was with them,
      at all events until she married, gravely impeded the formation of any
      judgment as to whether or no she could make good. Now and again there
      would come to Gratian who after all knew her sister better than George&mdash;the
      disquieting thought that whatever conclusion Noel led them to form, she
      would almost certainly force them to abandon sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days after her father&rsquo;s departure Noel had declared that she wanted
      to work on the land. This George had promptly vetoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t strong enough yet, my dear: Wait till the harvest begins. Then
      you can go and help on the farm here. If you can stand that without
      damage, we&rsquo;ll think about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the weather was wet and harvest late, and Noel had nothing much to do
      but attend to her baby, already well attended to by Nurse, and dream and
      brood, and now and then cook an omelette or do some housework for the sake
      of a gnawing conscience. Since Gratian and George were away in hospital
      all day, she was very much alone. Several times in the evenings Gratian
      tried to come at the core of her thoughts, Twice she flew the kite of
      Leila. The first time Noel only answered: &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s a brick.&rdquo; The second
      time, she said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to think about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, hardening her heart, Gratian went on: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s queer
      we&rsquo;ve never heard from Captain Fort since he came down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her calmest voice Noel answered: &ldquo;Why should we, after being told that
      he wasn&rsquo;t liked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told him that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him, that Daddy didn&rsquo;t; but I expect Daddy said much worse
      things.&rdquo; She gave a little laugh, then softly added: &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s wonderful,
      isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way he drives one to do the other thing. If he hadn&rsquo;t opposed my
      marriage to Cyril, you know, that wouldn&rsquo;t have happened, it just made all
      the difference. It stirred me up so fearfully.&rdquo; Gratian stared at her,
      astonished that she could see herself so clearly. Towards the end of
      August she had a letter from Fort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MRS. LAIRD,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know all about things, of course, except the one thing which to me is
      all important. I can&rsquo;t go on without knowing whether I have a chance with
      your sister. It is against your father&rsquo;s expressed wish that she should
      have anything to do with me, but I told him that I could not and would not
      promise not to ask her. I get my holiday at the end of this month, and am
      coming down to put it to the touch. It means more to me than you can
      possibly imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, dear Mrs. Laird,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your very faithful servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;JAMES FORT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She discussed the letter with George, whose advice was: &ldquo;Answer it
      politely, but say nothing; and nothing to Nollie. I think it would be a
      very good thing. Of course it&rsquo;s a bit of a make-shift&mdash;twice her age;
      but he&rsquo;s a genuine man, if not exactly brilliant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gratian answered almost sullenly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted the very best for
      Nollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George screwed up his steel-coloured eyes, as he might have looked at one
      on whom he had to operate. &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But you must remember,
      Gracie, that out of the swan she was, Nollie has made herself into a lame
      duck. Fifty per cent at least is off her value, socially. We must look at
      things as they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father is dead against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George smiled, on the point of saying: &lsquo;That makes me feel it must be a
      good thing!&rsquo; But he subdued the impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree that we&rsquo;re bound by his absence not to further it actively. Still
      Nollie knows his wishes, and it&rsquo;s up to her and no one else. After all,
      she&rsquo;s no longer a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His advice was followed. But to write that polite letter, which said
      nothing, cost Gratian a sleepless night, and two or three hours&rsquo;
      penmanship. She was very conscientious. Knowledge of this impending visit
      increased the anxiety with which she watched her sister, but the only
      inkling she obtained of Noel&rsquo;s state of mind was when the girl showed her
      a letter she had received from Thirza, asking her to come back to Kestrel.
      A postscript, in Uncle Bob&rsquo;s handwriting, added these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting quite fossilised down here; Eve&rsquo;s gone and left us again.
      We miss you and the youngster awfully. Come along down, Nollie there&rsquo;s a
      dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re darlings,&rdquo; Noel said, &ldquo;but I shan&rsquo;t go. I&rsquo;m too restless, ever
      since Daddy went; you don&rsquo;t know how restless. This rain simply makes me
      want to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      2
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather improved next day, and at the end of that week harvest began.
      By what seemed to Noel a stroke of luck the farmer&rsquo;s binder was broken; he
      could not get it repaired, and wanted all the human binders he could get.
      That first day in the fields blistered her hands, burnt her face and neck,
      made every nerve and bone in her body ache; but was the happiest day she
      had spent for weeks, the happiest perhaps since Cyril Morland left her,
      over a year ago. She had a bath and went to bed the moment she got in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lying there nibbling chocolate and smoking a cigarette, she luxuriated in
      the weariness which had stilled her dreadful restlessness. Watching the
      smoke of her cigarette curl up against the sunset glow which filled her
      window, she mused: If only she could be tired out like this every day! She
      would be all right then, would lose the feeling of not knowing what she
      wanted, of being in a sort o of large box, with the lid slammed down,
      roaming round it like a dazed and homesick bee in an overturned tumbler;
      the feeling of being only half alive, of having a wing maimed so that she
      could only fly a little way, and must then drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slept like a top that night. But the next day&rsquo;s work was real torture,
      and the third not much better. By the end of the week, however, she was no
      longer stiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday was cloudless; a perfect day. The field she was working in lay on
      a slope. It was the last field to be cut, and the best wheat yet, with a
      glorious burnt shade in its gold and the ears blunt and full. She had got
      used now to the feel of the great sheaves in her arms, and the binding
      wisps drawn through her hand till she held them level, below the ears,
      ready for the twist. There was no new sensation in it now; just steady,
      rather dreamy work, to keep her place in the row, to the swish-swish of
      the cutter and the call of the driver to his horses at the turns; with
      continual little pauses, to straighten and rest her back a moment, and
      shake her head free from the flies, or suck her finger, sore from the
      constant pushing of the straw ends under. So the hours went on, rather hot
      and wearisome, yet with a feeling of something good being done, of a job
      getting surely to its end. And gradually the centre patch narrowed, and
      the sun slowly slanted down.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they stopped for tea, instead of running home as usual, she drank it
      cold out of a flask she had brought, ate a bun and some chocolate, and lay
      down on her back against the hedge. She always avoided that group of her
      fellow workers round the tea-cans which the farmer&rsquo;s wife brought out. To
      avoid people, if she could, had become habitual to her now. They must know
      about her, or would soon if she gave them the chance. She had never lost
      consciousness of her ring-finger, expecting every eye to fall on it as a
      matter of course. Lying on her face, she puffed her cigarette into the
      grass, and watched a beetle, till one of the sheep-dogs, scouting for
      scraps, came up, and she fed him with her second bun. Having finished the
      bun, he tried to eat the beetle, and, when she rescued it, convinced that
      she had nothing more to give him, sneezed at her, and went away. Pressing
      the end of her cigarette out against the bank, she turned over. Already
      the driver was perched on his tiny seat, and his companion, whose business
      it was to free the falling corn, was getting up alongside. Swish-swish! It
      had begun again. She rose, stretched herself, and went back to her place
      in the row. The field would be finished to-night; she would have a lovely
      rest-all Sunday I Towards seven o&rsquo;clock a narrow strip, not twenty yards
      broad, alone was left. This last half hour was what Noel dreaded. To-day
      it was worse, for the farmer had no cartridges left, and the rabbits were
      dealt with by hullabaloo and sticks and chasing dogs. Rabbits were vermin,
      of course, and ate the crops, and must be killed; besides, they were good
      food, and fetched two shillings apiece; all this she knew but to see the
      poor frightened things stealing out, pounced on, turned, shouted at,
      chased, rolled over by great swift dogs, fallen on by the boys and killed
      and carried with their limp grey bodies upside down, so dead and soft and
      helpless, always made her feel quite sick. She stood very still, trying
      not to see or hear, and in the corn opposite to her a rabbit stole along,
      crouched, and peeped. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;come out here, bunny. I&rsquo;ll let
      you away&mdash;can&rsquo;t you see I will? It&rsquo;s your only chance. Come out!&rsquo; But
      the rabbit crouched, and gazed, with its little cowed head poked forward,
      and its ears laid flat; it seemed trying to understand whether this still
      thing in front of it was the same as those others. With the thought, &lsquo;Of
      course it won&rsquo;t while I look at it,&rsquo; Noel turned her head away. Out of the
      corner of her eye she could see a man standing a few yards off. The rabbit
      bolted out. Now the man would shout and turn it. But he did not, and the
      rabbit scuttled past him and away to the hedge. She heard a shout from the
      end of the row, saw a dog galloping. Too late! Hurrah! And clasping her
      hands, she looked at the man. It was Fort! With the queerest feeling&mdash;amazement,
      pleasure, the thrill of conspiracy, she saw him coming up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did want that rabbit to get off,&rdquo; she sighed out; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching
      it. Thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her. &ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel&rsquo;s hands flew up to her cheeks. &ldquo;Yes, I know; is my nose very red?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you&rsquo;re as lovely as Ruth, if she was lovely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swish-swish! The cutter came by; Noel started forward to her place in the
      row; but catching her arm, he said: &ldquo;No, let me do this little bit. I
      haven&rsquo;t had a day in the fields since the war began. Talk to me while I&rsquo;m
      binding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood watching him. He made a different, stronger twist from hers, and
      took larger sheaves, so that she felt a sort of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you knew about this sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord, yes! I had a farm once out West. Nothing like field-work, to
      make you feel good. I&rsquo;ve been watching you; you bind jolly well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel gave a sigh of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you come from?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight from the station. I&rsquo;m on my holiday.&rdquo; He looked up at her, and
      they both fell silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swish-swish! The cutter was coming again. Noel went to the beginning of
      her portion of the falling corn, he to the end of it. They worked towards
      each other, and met before the cutter was on them a third time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come in to supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go now, please. I don&rsquo;t want to see any more rabbits killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They spoke very little on the way to the bungalow, but she felt his eyes
      on her all the time. She left him with George and Gratian who had just
      come in, and went up for her bath.
    </p>

      Supper had been laid out in the verandah, and it was nearly dark before
      they had finished. In rhyme with the failing of the light Noel became more
      and more silent. When they went in, she ran up to her baby. She did not go
      down again, but as on the night before her father went away, stood at her
      window, leaning out. A dark night, no moon; in the starlight she could
      only just see the dim garden, where no goat was grazing. Now that her
      first excitement had worn off, this sudden reappearance of Fort filled her
      with nervous melancholy: She knew perfectly well what he had come for, she
      had always known. She had no certain knowledge of her own mind; but she
      knew that all these weeks she had been between his influence and her
      father&rsquo;s, listening to them, as it were, pleading with her. And,
      curiously, the pleading of each, instead of drawing her towards the
      pleader, had seemed dragging her away from him, driving her into the arms
      of the other. To the protection of one or the other she felt she must go;
      and it humiliated her to think that in all the world there was no other
      place for her. The wildness of that one night in the old Abbey seemed to
      have power to govern all her life to come. Why should that one night, that
      one act, have this uncanny power to drive her this way or that, to those
      arms or these? Must she, because of it, always need protection? Standing
      there in the dark it was almost as if they had come up behind her, with
      their pleadings; and a shiver ran down her back. She longed to turn on
      them, and cry out: &ldquo;Go away; oh; go away! I don&rsquo;t want either of you; I
      just want to be left alone!&rdquo; Then something, a moth perhaps, touched her
      neck. She gasped and shook herself. How silly!
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard the back door round the corner of the house opening; a man&rsquo;s low
      voice down in the dark said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the young lady that comes out in the fields?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another voice&mdash;one of the maids&mdash;answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Missis&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say she&rsquo;s got a baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind what she&rsquo;s got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel heard the man&rsquo;s laugh. It seemed to her the most odious laugh she had
      ever heard. She thought swiftly and absurdly: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get away from all
      this.&rsquo; The window was only a few feet up. She got out on to the ledge, let
      herself down, and dropped. There was a flower-bed below, quite soft, with
      a scent of geranium-leaves and earth. She brushed herself, and went
      tiptoeing across the gravel and the little front lawn, to the gate. The
      house was quite dark, quite silent. She walked on, down the road. &lsquo;Jolly!&rsquo;
      she thought. &lsquo;Night after night we sleep, and never see the nights: sleep
      until we&rsquo;re called, and never see anything. If they want to catch me
      they&rsquo;ll have to run.&rsquo; And she began running down the road in her evening
      frock and shoes, with nothing on her head. She stopped after going perhaps
      three hundred yards, by the edge of the wood. It was splendidly dark in
      there, and she groped her way from trunk to trunk, with a delicious,
      half-scared sense of adventure and novelty. She stopped at last by a thin
      trunk whose bark glimmered faintly. She felt it with her cheek, quite
      smooth&mdash;a birch tree; and, with her arms round it, she stood
      perfectly still. Wonderfully, magically silent, fresh and sweet-scented
      and dark! The little tree trembled suddenly within her arms, and she heard
      the low distant rumble, to which she had grown so accustomed&mdash;the
      guns, always at work, killing&mdash;killing men and killing trees, little
      trees perhaps like this within her arms, little trembling trees! Out
      there, in this dark night, there would not be a single unscarred tree like
      this smooth quivering thing, no fields of corn, not even a bush or a blade
      of grass, no leaves to rustle and smell sweet, not a bird, no little
      soft-footed night beasts, except the rats; and she shuddered, thinking of
      the Belgian soldier-painter. Holding the tree tight, she squeezed its
      smooth body against her. A rush of the same helpless, hopeless revolt and
      sorrow overtook her, which had wrung from her that passionate little
      outburst to her father, the night before he went away. Killed, torn, and
      bruised; burned, and killed, like Cyril! All the young things, like this
      little tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rumble! Rumble! Quiver! Quiver! And all else so still, so sweet and still,
      and starry, up there through the leaves.... &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it!&rsquo; she
      thought. She pressed her lips, which the sun had warmed all day, against
      the satiny smooth bark. But the little tree stood within her arms
      insentient, quivering only to the long rumbles. With each of those dull
      mutterings, life and love were going out, like the flames of candles on a
      Christmas-tree, blown, one by one. To her eyes, accustomed by now to the
      darkness in there, the wood seemed slowly to be gathering a sort of life,
      as though it were a great thing watching her; a great thing with hundreds
      of limbs and eyes, and the power of breathing. The little tree, which had
      seemed so individual and friendly, ceased to be a comfort and became a
      part of the whole living wood, absorbed in itself, and coldly watching
      her, this intruder of the mischievous breed, the fatal breed which loosed
      those rumblings on the earth. Noel unlocked her arms, and recoiled. A
      bough scraped her neck, some leaves flew against her eyes; she stepped
      aside, tripped over a root, and fell. A bough had hit her too, and she lay
      a little dazed, quivering at such dark unfriendliness. She held her hands
      up to her face for the mere pleasure of seeing something a little less
      dark; it was childish, and absurd, but she was frightened. The wood seemed
      to have so many eyes, so many arms, and all unfriendly; it seemed waiting
      to give her other blows, other falls, and to guard her within its darkness
      until&mdash;! She got up, moved a few steps, and stood still, she had
      forgotten from where she had come in. And afraid of moving deeper into the
      unfriendly wood, she turned slowly round, trying to tell which way to go.
      It was all just one dark watching thing, of limbs on the ground and in the
      air. &lsquo;Any way,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;any way of course will take me out!&rsquo; And she
      groped forward, keeping her hands up to guard her face. It was silly, but
      she could not help the sinking, scattered feeling which comes to one
      bushed, or lost in a fog. If the wood had not been so dark, so,&mdash;alive!
      And for a second she had the senseless, terrifying thought of a child:
      &lsquo;What if I never get out!&rsquo; Then she laughed at it, and stood still again,
      listening. There was no sound to guide her, no sound at all except that
      faint dull rumble, which seemed to come from every side, now. And the
      trees watched her. &lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;I hate this wood!&rsquo; She saw it now,
      its snaky branches, its darkness, and great forms, as an abode of giants
      and witches. She groped and scrambled on again, tripped once more, and
      fell, hitting her forehead against a trunk. The blow dazed and sobered
      her. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s idiotic,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a baby! I&rsquo;ll Just walk very slowly
      till I reach the edge. I know it isn&rsquo;t a large wood!&rsquo; She turned
      deliberately to face each direction; solemnly selected that from which the
      muttering of the guns seemed to come, and started again, moving very
      slowly with her hands stretched out. Something rustled in the undergrowth,
      quite close; she saw a pair of green eyes shining. Her heart jumped into
      her mouth. The thing sprang&mdash;there was a swish of ferns and twigs,
      and silence. Noel clasped her breast. A poaching cat! And again she moved
      forward. But she had lost direction. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going round and round,&rsquo; she
      thought. &lsquo;They always do.&rsquo; And the sinking scattered feeling of the
      &ldquo;bushed&rdquo; clutched at her again. &lsquo;Shall I call?&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;I must be
      near the road. But it&rsquo;s so babyish.&rsquo; She moved on again. Her foot struck
      something soft. A voice muttered a thick oath; a hand seized her ankle.
      She leaped, and dragged and wrenched it free; and, utterly unnerved, she
      screamed, and ran forward blindly.

    <p>
      No one could have so convinced a feeling as Jimmy Fort that he would be a
      &lsquo;bit of a makeshift&rsquo; for Noel. He had spent the weeks after his interview
      with her father obsessed by her image, often saying to himself &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
      do. It&rsquo;s playing it too low down to try and get that child, when I know
      that, but for her trouble, I shouldn&rsquo;t have a chance.&rdquo; He had never had
      much opinion of his looks, but now he seemed to himself absurdly old and
      dried-up in this desert of a London. He loathed the Office job to which
      they had put him, and the whole atmosphere of officialdom. Another year of
      it, and he would shrivel like an old apple! He began to look at himself
      anxiously, taking stock of his physical assets now that he had this dream
      of young beauty. He would be forty next month, and she was nineteen! But
      there would be times too when he would feel that, with her, he could be as
      much of a &ldquo;three-year-old&rdquo; as the youngster she had loved. Having little
      hope of winning her, he took her &ldquo;past&rdquo; but lightly. Was it not that past
      which gave him what chance he had? On two things he was determined: He
      would not trade on her past. And if by any chance she took him, he would
      never show her that he remembered that she had one.
    </p>
    <p>
      After writing to Gratian he had spent the week before his holiday began,
      in an attempt to renew the youthfulness of his appearance, which made him
      feel older, leaner, bonier and browner than ever. He got up early, rode in
      the rain, took Turkish baths, and did all manner of exercises; neither
      smoked nor drank, and went to bed early, exactly as if he had been going
      to ride a steeplechase. On the afternoon, when at last he left on that
      terrific pilgrimage, he gazed at his face with a sort of despair, it was
      so lean, and leather-coloured, and he counted almost a dozen grey hairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the bungalow, and was told that she was working in the
      corn-fields, he had for the first time a feeling that Fate was on his
      side. Such a meeting would be easier than any other! He had been watching
      her for several minutes before she saw him, with his heart beating more
      violently than it had ever beaten in the trenches; and that new feeling of
      hope stayed with him&mdash;all through the greeting, throughout supper,
      and even after she had left them and gone upstairs. Then, with the
      suddenness of a blind drawn down, it vanished, and he sat on, trying to
      talk, and slowly getting more and more silent and restless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nollie gets so tired, working,&rdquo; Gratian said: He knew she meant it kindly
      but that she should say it at all was ominous. He got up at last, having
      lost hope of seeing Noel again, conscious too that he had answered the
      last three questions at random.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the porch George said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come in to lunch tomorrow, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thanks, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;ll bore you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit. Nollie won&rsquo;t be so tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again&mdash;so well meant. They were very kind. He looked up from the
      gate, trying to make out which her window might be; but all was dark. A
      little way down the road he stopped to light a cigarette; and, leaning
      against a gate, drew the smoke of it deep into his lungs, trying to
      assuage the ache in his heart. So it was hopeless! She had taken the
      first, the very first chance, to get away from him! She knew that he loved
      her, could not help knowing, for he had never been able to keep it out of
      his eyes and voice. If she had felt ever so little for him, she would not
      have avoided him this first evening. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go back to that desert,&rsquo; he
      thought; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to whine and crawl. I&rsquo;ll go back, and bite on it;
      one must have some pride. Oh, why the hell am I crocked-up like this? If
      only I could get out to France again!&rsquo; And then Noel&rsquo;s figure bent over
      the falling corn formed before him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have one more try,&rsquo; he thought;
      &lsquo;one more&mdash;tomorrow somewhere, I&rsquo;ll get to know for certain. And if I
      get what Leila&rsquo;s got I shall deserve it, I suppose. Poor Leila! Where is
      she? Back at High Constantia?&rsquo; What was that? A cry&mdash;of terror&mdash;in
      that wood! Crossing to the edge, he called &ldquo;Coo-ee!&rdquo; and stood peering
      into its darkness. He heard the sound of bushes being brushed aside, and
      whistled. A figure came bursting out, almost into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice gasped: &ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw Noel. She had swayed back, and stood about a yard away. He could
      dimly see her covering her face with her arms. Feeling instinctively that
      she wanted to hide her fright, he said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What luck! I was just passing. It&rsquo;s awfully dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I got lost; and a man&mdash;caught my foot, in there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moved beyond control by the little gulps and gasps of her breathing, he
      stepped forward and put his hands on her shoulders. He held her lightly,
      without speaking, terrified lest he should wound her pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I-I got in there,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;and the trees&mdash;and I stumbled over a
      roan asleep, and he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Yes, I know,&rdquo; he murmured, as if to a child. She had dropped her
      arms now, and he could see her face, with eyes unnaturally dilated, and
      lips quivering. Then moved again beyond control, he drew her so close that
      he could feel the throbbing of her heart, and put his lips to her forehead
      all wet with heat. She closed her eyes, gave a little choke, and buried
      her face against his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, my darling!&rdquo; he kept on saying. &ldquo;There, there, my darling!&rdquo;
       He could feel the snuggling of her cheek against his shoulder. He had got
      her&mdash;had got her! He was somehow certain that she would not draw back
      now. And in the wonder and ecstasy of that thought, all the world above
      her head, the stars in their courses, the wood which had frightened her,
      seemed miracles of beauty and fitness. By such fortune as had never come
      to man, he had got her! And he murmured over and over again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you!&rdquo; She was resting perfectly quiet against him, while her heart
      ceased gradually to beat so fast. He could feel her cheek rubbing against
      his coat of Harris tweed. Suddenly she sniffed at it, and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It smells good.&rdquo;
     </p>

      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      When summer sun has burned all Egypt, the white man looks eagerly each day
      for evening, whose rose-coloured veil melts opalescent into the dun drift,
      of the hills, and iridescent above, into the slowly deepening blue.
      Pierson stood gazing at the mystery of the desert from under the little
      group of palms and bougainvillea which formed the garden of the hospital.
      Even-song was in full voice: From the far wing a gramophone was grinding
      out a music-hall ditty; two aeroplanes, wheeling exactly like the buzzards
      of the desert, were letting drip the faint whir of their flight; metallic
      voices drifted from the Arab village; the wheels of the water-wells
      creaked; and every now and then a dry rustle was stirred from the
      palm-leaves by puffs of desert wind. On either hand an old road ran out,
      whose line could be marked by the little old watch-towers of another age.
      For how many hundred years had human life passed along it to East and
      West; the brown men and their camels, threading that immemorial track over
      the desert, which ever filled him with wonder, so still it was, so wide,
      so desolate, and every evening so beautiful! He sometimes felt that he
      could sit for ever looking at it; as though its cruel mysterious
      loveliness were&mdash;home; and yet he never looked at it without a spasm
      of homesickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far his new work had brought him no nearer to the hearts of men. Or at
      least he did not feel it had. Both at the regimental base, and now in this
      hospital&mdash;an intermediate stage&mdash;waiting for the draft with
      which he would be going into Palestine, all had been very nice to him,
      friendly, and as it were indulgent; so might schoolboys have treated some
      well-intentioned dreamy master, or business men a harmless idealistic
      inventor who came visiting their offices. He had even the feeling that
      they were glad to have him about, just as they were glad to have their
      mascots and their regimental colours; but of heart-to-heart simple
      comradeship&mdash;it seemed they neither wanted it of him nor expected him
      to give it, so that he had a feeling that he would be forward and
      impertinent to offer it. Moreover, he no longer knew how. He was very
      lonely. &lsquo;When I come face to face with death,&rsquo; he would think, &lsquo;it will be
      different. Death makes us all brothers. I may be of real use to them
      then.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They brought him a letter while he stood there listening to that
      even-song, gazing at the old desert road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DARLING DAD,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope this will reach you before you move on to Palestine. You said
      in your last&mdash;at the end of September, so I hope you&rsquo;ll just get it.
      There is one great piece of news, which I&rsquo;m afraid will hurt and trouble
      you; Nollie is married to Jimmy Fort. They were married down here this
      afternoon, and have just gone up to Town. They have to find a house of
      course. She has been very restless, lonely, and unhappy ever since you
      went, and I&rsquo;m sure it is really for the best: She is quite another
      creature, and simply devoted, headlong. It&rsquo;s just like Nollie. She says
      she didn&rsquo;t know what she wanted, up to the last minute. But now she seems
      as if she could never want anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad dear, Nollie could never have made good by herself. It isn&rsquo;t her
      nature, and it&rsquo;s much better like this, I feel sure, and so does George.
      Of course it isn&rsquo;t ideal&mdash;and one wanted that for her; but she did
      break her wing, and he is so awfully good and devoted to her, though you
      didn&rsquo;t believe it, and perhaps won&rsquo;t, even now. The great thing is to feel
      her happy again, and know she&rsquo;s safe. Nollie is capable of great devotion;
      only she must be anchored. She was drifting all about; and one doesn&rsquo;t
      know what she might have done, in one of her moods. I do hope you won&rsquo;t
      grieve about it. She&rsquo;s dreadfully anxious about how you&rsquo;ll feel. I know it
      will be wretched for you, so far off; but do try and believe it&rsquo;s for the
      best.... She&rsquo;s out of danger; and she was really in a horrible position.
      It&rsquo;s so good for the baby, too, and only fair to him. I do think one must
      take things as they are, Dad dear. It was impossible to mend Nollie&rsquo;s
      wing. If she were a fighter, and gloried in it, or if she were the sort
      who would &lsquo;take the veil&rsquo;&mdash;but she isn&rsquo;t either. So it is all right,
      Dad. She&rsquo;s writing to you herself. I&rsquo;m sure Leila didn&rsquo;t want Jimmy Fort
      to be unhappy because he couldn&rsquo;t love her; or she would never have gone
      away. George sends you his love; we are both very well. And Nollie is
      looking splendid still, after her harvest work. All, all my love, Dad
      dear. Is there anything we can get, and send you? Do take care of your
      blessed self, and don&rsquo;t grieve about Nollie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GRATIAN.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A half-sheet of paper fluttered down; he picked it up from among the
      parched fibre of dead palm-leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DADDY DARLING,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it. Forgive me&mdash;I&rsquo;m so happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your NOLLIE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The desert shimmered, the palm-leaves rustled, and Pierson stood trying to
      master the emotion roused in him by those two letters. He felt no anger,
      not even vexation; he felt no sorrow, but a loneliness so utter and
      complete that he did not know how to bear it. It seemed as if some last
      link with life had&rsquo; snapped. &lsquo;My girls are happy,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;If I am
      not&mdash;what does it matter? If my faith and my convictions mean nothing
      to them&mdash;why should they follow? I must and will not feel lonely. I
      ought to have the sense of God present, to feel His hand in mine. If I
      cannot, what use am I&mdash;what use to the poor fellows in there, what
      use in all the world?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An old native on a donkey went by, piping a Soudanese melody on a little
      wooden Arab flute. Pierson turned back into the hospital humming it. A
      nurse met him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor boy at the end of A ward is sinking fast, sir; I expect he&rsquo;d
      like to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into A ward, and walked down between the beds to the west window
      end, where two screens had been put, to block off the cot. Another nurse,
      who was sitting beside it, rose at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite conscious,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;he can still speak a little. He&rsquo;s
      such a dear.&rdquo; A tear rolled down her cheek, and she passed out behind the
      screens. Pierson looked down at the boy; perhaps he was twenty, but the
      unshaven down on his cheeks was soft and almost colourless. His eyes were
      closed. He breathed regularly, and did not seem in pain; but there was
      about him that which told he was going; something resigned, already of the
      grave. The window was wide open, covered by mosquito-netting, and a tiny
      line of sunlight, slanting through across the foot of the cot, crept
      slowly backwards over the sheets and the boy&rsquo;s body, shortening as it
      crept. In the grey whiteness of the walls; the bed, the boy&rsquo;s face, just
      that pale yellow bar of sunlight, and one splash of red and blue from a
      little flag on the wall glowed out. At this cooler hour, the ward behind
      the screens was almost empty, and few sounds broke the stillness; but from
      without came that intermittent rustle of dry palm-leaves. Pierson waited
      in silence, watching the sun sink. If the boy might pass like this, it
      would be God&rsquo;s mercy. Then he saw the boy&rsquo;s eyes open, wonderfully clear
      eyes of the lighted grey which has dark rims; his lips moved, and Pierson
      bent down to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; West, zurr.&rdquo; The whisper had a little soft burr; the lips
      quivered; a pucker as of a child formed on his face, and passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through Pierson&rsquo;s mind there flashed the thought: &lsquo;O God! Let me be some
      help to him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To God, my dear son!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flicker of humour, of ironic question, passed over the boy&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terribly moved, Pierson knelt down, and began softly, fervently praying.
      His whispering mingled with the rustle of the palm-leaves, while the bar
      of sunlight crept up the body. In the boy&rsquo;s smile had been the whole of
      stoic doubt, of stoic acquiescence. It had met him with an unconscious
      challenge; had seemed to know so much. Pierson took his hand, which lay
      outside the sheet. The boy&rsquo;s lips moved, as though in thanks; he drew a
      long feeble breath, as if to suck in the thread of sunlight; and his eyes
      closed. Pierson bent over the hand. When he looked up the boy was dead. He
      kissed his forehead and went quietly out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had set, and he walked away from the hospital to a hillock beyond
      the track on the desert&rsquo;s edge, and stood looking at the afterglow. The
      sun and the boy&mdash;together they had gone West, into that wide glowing
      nothingness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The muezzin call to sunset prayer in the Arab village came to him clear
      and sharp, while he sat there, unutterably lonely. Why had that smile so
      moved him? Other death smiles had been like this evening smile on the
      desert hills&mdash;a glowing peace, a promise of heaven. But the boy&rsquo;s
      smile had said: &lsquo;Waste no breath on me&mdash;you cannot help. Who knows&mdash;who
      knows? I have no hope, no faith; but I am adventuring. Good-bye!&rsquo; Poor
      boy! He had braved all things, and moved out uncertain, yet undaunted! Was
      that, then, the uttermost truth, was faith a smaller thing? But from that
      strange notion he recoiled with horror. &lsquo;In faith I have lived, in faith I
      will die!&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;God helping me!&rsquo; And the breeze, ruffling the
      desert sand, blew the grains against the palms of his hands, outstretched
      above the warm earth.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
