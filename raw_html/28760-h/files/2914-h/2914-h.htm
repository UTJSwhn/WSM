    <h2>
      ACT I
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It is half-past nine of a July evening. In a dining-room lighted by
        sconces, and apparelled in wall-paper, carpet, and curtains of deep
        vivid blue, the large French windows between two columns are open on to
        a wide terrace, beyond which are seen trees in darkness, and distant
        shapes of lighted houses. On one side is a bay window, over which
        curtains are partly drawn. Opposite to this window is a door leading
        into the hall. At an oval rosewood table, set with silver, flowers,
        fruit, and wine, six people are seated after dinner. Back to the bay
        window is STEPHEN MORE, the host, a man of forty, with a fine-cut face,
        a rather charming smile, and the eyes of an idealist; to his right, SIR,
        JOHN JULIAN, an old soldier, with thin brown features, and grey
        moustaches; to SIR JOHN's right, his brother, the DEAN OF STOUR, a tall,
        dark, ascetic-looking Churchman: to his right KATHERINE is leaning
        forward, her elbows on the table, and her chin on her hands, staring
        across at her husband; to her right sits EDWARD MENDIP, a pale man of
        forty-five, very bald, with a fine forehead, and on his clear-cut lips a
        smile that shows his teeth; between him and MORE is HELEN JULIAN, a
        pretty dark-haired young woman, absorbed in thoughts of her own. The
        voices are tuned to the pitch of heated discussion, as the curtain
        rises.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE DEAN. I disagree with you, Stephen; absolutely, entirely disagree.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. I can't help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. Remember a certain war, Stephen! Were your chivalrous notions any
      good, then? And, what was winked at in an obscure young Member is anathema
      for an Under Secretary of State. You can't afford&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. To follow my conscience? That's new, Mendip.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. Idealism can be out of place, my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DEAN. The Government is dealing here with a wild lawless race, on whom
      I must say I think sentiment is rather wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. God made them, Dean.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. I have my doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DEAN. They have proved themselves faithless. We have the right to
      chastise.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. If I hit a little man in the eye, and he hits me back, have I the
      right to chastise him?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. We didn't begin this business.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. What! With our missionaries and our trading?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DEAN. It is news indeed that the work of civilization may be
      justifiably met by murder. Have you forgotten Glaive and Morlinson?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. Yes. And that poor fellow Groome and his wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. They went into a wild country, against the feeling of the tribes, on
      their own business. What has the nation to do with the mishaps of
      gamblers?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. We can't stand by and see our own flesh and blood ill-treated!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DEAN. Does our rule bring blessing&mdash;or does it not, Stephen?
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Sometimes; but with all my soul I deny the fantastic superstition
      that our rule can benefit a people like this, a nation of one race, as
      different from ourselves as dark from light&mdash;in colour, religion,
      every mortal thing. We can only pervert their natural instincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DEAN. That to me is an unintelligible point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. Go into that philosophy of yours a little deeper, Stephen&mdash;
      it spells stagnation. There are no fixed stars on this earth. Nations
      can't let each other alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Big ones could let little ones alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. If they could there'd be no big ones. My dear fellow, we know
      little nations are your hobby, but surely office should have toned you
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. I've served my country fifty years, and I say she is not in the
      wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. I hope to serve her fifty, Sir John, and I say she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. There are moments when such things can't be said, More.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. They'll be said by me to-night, Mendip.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. In the House?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MORE nods.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Stephen!
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. Mrs. More, you mustn't let him. It's madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. [Rising] You can tell people that to-morrow, Mendip. Give it a
      leader in 'The Parthenon'.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. Political lunacy! No man in your position has a right to fly out
      like this at the eleventh hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. I've made no secret of my feelings all along. I'm against this war,
      and against the annexation we all know it will lead to.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. My dear fellow! Don't be so Quixotic! We shall have war within the
      next twenty-four hours, and nothing you can do will stop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN. Oh! No!
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. I'm afraid so, Mrs. Hubert.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. Not a doubt of it, Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. [TO MORE] And you mean to charge the windmill?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MORE nods.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MENDIP. 'C'est magnifique'!
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. I'm not out for advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. You will get it!
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Must speak the truth sometimes, even at that risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. It is not the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. The greater the truth the greater the libel, and the greater the
      resentment of the person libelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DEAN. [Trying to bring matters to a blander level] My dear Stephen,
      even if you were right&mdash;which I deny&mdash;about the initial merits,
      there surely comes a point where the individual conscience must resign it
      self to the country's feeling. This has become a question of national
      honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. Well said, James!
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Nations are bad judges of their honour, Dean.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DEAN. I shall not follow you there.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. No. It's an awkward word.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. [Stopping THE DEAN] Uncle James! Please!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MORE looks at her intently.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. So you're going to put yourself at the head of the cranks, ruin
      your career, and make me ashamed that you're my son-in-law?
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Is a man only to hold beliefs when they're popular? You've stood up
      to be shot at often enough, Sir John.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. Never by my country! Your speech will be in all the foreign
      press-trust 'em for seizing on anything against us. A show-up before other
      countries&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. You admit the show-up?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. I do not, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DEAN. The position has become impossible. The state of things out
      there must be put an end to once for all! Come, Katherine, back us up!
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. My country, right or wrong! Guilty&mdash;still my country!
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. That begs the question.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [KATHERINE rises. THE DEAN, too, stands up.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE DEAN. [In a low voice] 'Quem Deus volt perdere'&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. Unpatriotic!
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. I'll have no truck with tyranny.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Father doesn't admit tyranny. Nor do any of us, Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUBERT JULIAN, a tall Soldier-like man, has come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN. Hubert!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She gets up and goes to him, and they talk together near the door.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. What in God's name is your idea? We've forborne long enough, in
      all conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Sir John, we great Powers have got to change our ways in dealing
      with weaker nations. The very dogs can give us lessons&mdash; watch a big
      dog with a little one.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. No, no, these things are not so simple as all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. There's no reason in the world, Mendip, why the rules of chivalry
      should not apply to nations at least as well as to&mdash;-dogs.

      MENDIP. My dear friend, are you to become that hapless kind of outcast, a
      champion of lost causes?
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. This cause is not lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. Right or wrong, as lost as ever was cause in all this world. There
      was never a time when the word "patriotism" stirred mob sentiment as it
      does now. 'Ware "Mob," Stephen&mdash;-'ware "Mob"!
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Because general sentiment's against me, I&mdash;a public man&mdash;am
      to deny my faith? The point is not whether I'm right or wrong, Mendip, but
      whether I'm to sneak out of my conviction because it's unpopular.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DEAN. I'm afraid I must go. [To KATHERINE] Good-night, my dear! Ah!
      Hubert! [He greets HUBERT] Mr. Mendip, I go your way. Can I drop you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. Thank you. Good-night, Mrs. More. Stop him! It's perdition.

      SIR JOHN. I knew your views were extreme in many ways, Stephen, but I
      never thought the husband of my daughter would be a Peace-at-any-price
      man!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. Well! I can only hope to God you'll come to your senses before
      you commit the folly of this speech. I must get back to the War Office.
      Good-night, Hubert.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUBERT. Good-night, Father.

    <p>
      HUBERT. At once.

      MORE. Poor Helen!
    </p>
    <p>
      HUBERT. Not married a year; pretty bad luck! [MORE touches his arm in
      sympathy] Well! We've got to put feelings in our pockets. Look here,
      Stephen&mdash;don't make that speech! Think of Katherine&mdash;with the
      Dad at the War Office, and me going out, and Ralph and old George out
      there already! You can't trust your tongue when you're hot about a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. I must speak, Hubert.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUBERT. No, no! Bottle yourself up for to-night. The next few hours 'll
      see it begin. [MORE turns from him] If you don't care whether you mess up
      your own career&mdash;don't tear Katherine in two!
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. You're not shirking your duty because of your wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUBERT. Well! You're riding for a fall, and a godless mucker it'll be.
      This'll be no picnic. We shall get some nasty knocks out there. Wait and
      see the feeling here when we've had a force or two cut up in those
      mountains. It's awful country. Those fellows have got modern arms, and are
      jolly good fighters. Do drop it, Stephen!

    <p>
      MORE. You know my feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. But it's our own country. We can't stand apart from it. You
      won't stop anything&mdash;only make people hate you. I can't bear that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. I tell you, Kit, some one must raise a voice. Two or three reverses&mdash;certain
      to come&mdash;and the whole country will go wild. And one more little
      nation will cease to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. If you believe in your country, you must believe that the more
      land and power she has, the better for the world.

    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Yes.

    <p>
      MORE. I respect it; I even understand it; but&mdash;I can't hold it.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. But, Stephen, your speech will be a rallying cry to all the
      cranks, and every one who has a spite against the country. They'll make
      you their figurehead. [MORE smiles] They will. Your chance of the Cabinet
      will go&mdash;you may even have to resign your seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Dogs will bark. These things soon blow over.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. No, no! If you once begin a thing, you always go on; and what
      earthly good?
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. History won't say: "And this they did without a single protest from
      their public men!"
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. There are plenty who&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Poets?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Do you remember that day on our honeymoon, going up Ben Lawers?
      You were lying on your face in the heather; you said it was like kissing a
      loved woman. There was a lark singing&mdash;you said that was the voice of
      one's worship. The hills were very blue; that's why we had blue here,
      because it was the best dress of our country. You do love her.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Love her!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. You'd have done this for me&mdash;then.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Would you have asked me&mdash;then, Kit?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Yes. The country's our country! Oh! Stephen, think what it'll
      be like for me&mdash;with Hubert and the other boys out there. And poor
      Helen, and Father! I beg you not to make this speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Kit! This isn't fair. Do you want me to feel myself a cur?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. [Breathless] I&mdash;I&mdash;almost feel you'll be a cur to do
      it [She looks at him, frightened by her own words. Then, as the footman
      HENRY has come in to clear the table&mdash;very low] I ask you not!

      sacrifice of our pettier dignity, to avoid laying another stone upon its
      grave; to avoid placing before the searchlight eyes of History the
      spectacle of yet one more piece of national cynicism? We are about to
      force our will and our dominion on a race that has always been free, that
      loves its country, and its independence, as much as ever we love ours. I
      cannot sit silent to-night and see this begin. As we are tender of our own
      land, so we should be of the lands of others. I love my country. It is
      because I love my country that I raise my voice. Warlike in spirit these
      people may be&mdash;but they have no chance against ourselves. And war on
      such, however agreeable to the blind moment, is odious to the future. The
      great heart of mankind ever beats in sense and sympathy with the weaker.
      It is against this great heart of mankind that we are going. In the name

    <p>
      STEEL. Mr. More back?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. No. Has he spoken?
    </p>
    <p>
      STEEL. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Against?
    </p>
    <p>
      STEEL. Yes.

      SIR JOHN. What? After!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        SIR, JOHN stands rigid, then turns and marches straight out into the
        hall. At a sign from KATHERINE, HUBERT follows him.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Yes, Mr. Steel?
    </p>
    <p>
      STEEL. [Still breathless and agitated] We were here&mdash;he slipped away
      from me somehow. He must have gone straight down to the House. I ran over,
      but when I got in under the Gallery he was speaking already. They expected
      something&mdash;I never heard it so still there. He gripped them from the
      first word&mdash;deadly&mdash;every syllable. It got some of those
      fellows. But all the time, under the silence you could feel a&mdash;sort
      of&mdash;of&mdash;current going round. And then Sherratt&mdash;I think it
      was&mdash;began it, and you saw the anger rising in them; but he kept them
      down&mdash;his quietness! The feeling! I've never seen anything like it
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a whisper all over the House that fighting had begun. And
      the whole thing broke out&mdash;regular riot&mdash;as if they could have
      killed him. Some one tried to drag him down by the coat-tails, but he
      shook him off, and went on. Then he stopped dead and walked out, and the
      noise dropped like a stone. The whole thing didn't last five minutes. It
      was fine, Mrs. More; like&mdash;like lava; he was the only cool person
      there. I wouldn't have missed it for anything&mdash;it was grand!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MORE has appeared on the terrace, behind STEEL.

    <p>

    <p>
      STEEL. [Startled] Oh!&mdash;Good-night!

        clasping them to her breast. MORE comes in.

    <p>
      KATHERINE. You've cleared your conscience, then! I didn't think you'd hurt
      me so.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Before noon a few days later. The open windows of the dining-room let in
        the sunlight. On the table a number of newspapers are littered. HELEN is
        sitting there, staring straight before her. A newspaper boy runs by
        outside calling out his wares. At the sound she gets up anti goes out on
        to the terrace. HUBERT enters from the hall. He goes at once to the
        terrace, and draws HELEN into the room.
      </p>

    <p>
      HELEN. Is it true&mdash;what they're shouting?
    </p>
    <p>
      HUBERT. Yes. Worse than we thought. They got our men all crumpled up in
      the Pass&mdash;guns helpless. Ghastly beginning.

      HENRY. Just wait here, will you, while I let Mrs. More know. [Catching
      sight of HUBERT] Beg pardon, sir!

      HUBERT. All right, Henry. [Off-hand] Ah! Wreford! [The FOOTMAN withdraws]
      So you've brought her round. That's good! My sister'll look after her&mdash;don't
      you worry! Got everything packed? Three o'clock sharp.

      WREFORD. [A broad faced soldier, dressed in khaki with a certain look of

      KATHERINE. Yes, yes! Still, it's for the country, isn't it?

    <p>
      THE GIRL. That's what Wreford keeps tellin' me. He've got to go&mdash;so
      it's no use upsettin' 'im. And of course I keep tellin' him I shall be all
      right.

    <p>
      NURSE. [Whose eyes never leave her son's face] And so you will.

      me. 'E's so 'ot-headed I'm sure somethin'll come to 'im.

    <p>
      KATHERINE. We've all got some one going. Are you coming to the docks? We
      must send them off in good spirits, you know.

    <p>
      OLIVE. Perhaps he'll get a medal.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Olive!

      NURSE. You wouldn't like for him to be hanging back, one of them
      anti-patriot, stop-the-war ones.

      KATHERINE. [Quickly] Let me see&mdash;I have your address. [Holding out
      her hand to WREFORD] We'll look after her.

      OLIVE. [In a loud whisper] Shall I lend him my toffee?

      KATHERINE. If you like, dear. [To WREFORD] Now take care of my brother and
      yourself, and we'll take care of her.

      OLIVE. [Who has taken from the bureau a packet, places it in his hand]

    <p>
      KATHERINE. Poor things!

      OLIVE. What is an anti-patriot, stop-the-war one, Mummy?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. [Taking up a newspaper] Just a stupid name, dear&mdash;don't
      chatter!

    <p>
      OLIVE. But tell me just one weeny thing!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. Is Daddy one?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Olive! How much do you know about this war?
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. They won't obey us properly. So we have to beat them, and take away
      their country. We shall, shan't we?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Yes. But Daddy doesn't want us to; he doesn't think it fair,
      and he's been saying so. People are very angry with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. Why isn't it fair? I suppose we're littler than them.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. Oh! in history we always are. And we always win. That's why I like
      history. Which are you for, Mummy&mdash;us or them?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Us.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. Then I shall have to be. It's a pity we're not on the same side as
      Daddy. [KATHERINE shudders] Will they hurt him for not taking our side?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. I expect they will, Olive.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. Then we shall have to be extra nice to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. If we can.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. I can; I feel like it.

    <p>
      OLIVE. [Catching sight of him-softly] Is Uncle Hubert going to the front
      to-day? [KATHERINE nods] But not grandfather?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. No, dear.

      STEEL. Awful news this morning of that Pass! And have you seen these?
      [Reading from the newspaper] "We will have no truck with the jargon of the
      degenerate who vilifies his country at such a moment. The Member for
      Toulmin has earned for himself the contempt of all virile patriots." [He
      takes up a second journal] "There is a certain type of public man who,
      even at his own expense, cannot resist the itch to advertise himself. We
      would, at moments of national crisis, muzzle such persons, as we muzzle
      dogs that we suspect of incipient rabies...." They're in full cry after
      him!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. I mind much more all the creatures who are always flinging mud
      at the country making him their hero suddenly! You know what's in his
      mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      STEEL. Oh! We must get him to give up that idea of lecturing everywhere
      against the war, Mrs. More; we simply must.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. [Listening] The deputation's come. Go and fetch him, Mr. Steel.
      He'll be in his room, at the House.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [STEEL goes out, and KATHERINE Stands at bay. In a moment he opens the
        door again, to usher in the deputation; then retires. The four gentlemen
        have entered as if conscious of grave issues. The first and most
        picturesque is JAMES HOME, a thin, tall, grey-bearded man, with
        plentiful hair, contradictious eyebrows, and the half-shy, half-bold
        manners, alternately rude and over polite, of one not accustomed to
        Society, yet secretly much taken with himself. He is dressed in rough
        tweeds, with a red silk tie slung through a ring, and is closely
        followed by MARK WACE, a waxy, round-faced man of middle-age, with sleek
        dark hair, traces of whisker, and a smooth way of continually rubbing
        his hands together, as if selling something to an esteemed customer. He
        is rather stout, wears dark clothes, with a large gold chain. Following
        him comes CHARLES SHELDER, a lawyer of fifty, with a bald egg-shaped
        head, and gold pince-nez. He has little side whiskers, a leathery,
        yellowish skin, a rather kind but watchful and dubious face, and when he
        speaks seems to have a plum in his mouth, which arises from the
        preponderance of his shaven upper lip. Last of the deputation comes
        WILLIAM BANNING, an energetic-looking, square-shouldered, self-made
        country-man, between fifty and sixty, with grey moustaches, ruddy face,
        and lively brown eyes.]

    <p>
      KATHERINE. How do you do, Mr. Home?

      independence of women's influence] Mrs. More! We hardly expected&mdash;
      This is an honour.

      WACE. How do you do, Ma'am?

      occasion, Ma'am.

      BANNING. I tell you what hit me&mdash;what's hit the whole constituency&mdash;
      and that's his knowing we were over the frontier, fighting already, when
      he made it.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. What difference does it make if he did know?
    </p>
    <p>
      HOME. Hitting below the belt&mdash;I should have thought&mdash;you'll
      pardon me!
    </p>
    <p>
      BANNING. Till war's begun, Mrs. More, you're entitled to say what you
      like, no doubt&mdash;but after! That's going against your country. Ah! his
      speech was strong, you know&mdash;his speech was strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. He had made up his mind to speak. It was just an accident the
      news coming then.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [A silence.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BANNING. Well, that's true, I suppose. What we really want is to make sure
      he won't break out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      HOME. Very high-minded, his views of course&mdash;but, some consideration
      for the common herd. You'll pardon me!
    </p>
    <p>
      SHELDER. We've come with the friendliest feelings, Mrs. More&mdash;but,
      you know, it won't do, this sort of thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      WACE. We shall be able to smooth him down. Oh! surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      BANNING. We'd be best perhaps not to mention about his knowing that
      fighting had begun.

      BANNING. You've seen the morning's telegrams? I tell you, Mr. More&mdash;another
      reverse like that, and the flood will sweep you clean away. And I'll not
      blame it. It's only flesh and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE, Allow for the flesh and blood in me, too, please. When I spoke the
      other night it was not without a certain feeling here. [He touches his
      heart.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BANNING. But your attitude's so sudden&mdash;you'd not been going that
      length when you were down with us in May.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Do me the justice to remember that even then I was against our
      policy. It cost me three weeks' hard struggle to make up my mind to that
      speech. One comes slowly to these things, Banning.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHELDER. Case of conscience?
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Such things have happened, Shelder, even in politics.

    <p>
      BANNING. There's one thing you forget, sir. We send you to Parliament,
      representing us; but you couldn't find six men in the whole constituency
      that would have bidden you to make that speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. I'm sorry; but I can't help my convictions, Banning.

      SHELDER. What was it the prophet was without in his own country?
    </p>
    <p>
      BANNING. Ah! but we're not funning, Mr. More. I've never known feeling run
      so high. The sentiment of both meetings was dead against you. We've had
      showers of letters to headquarters. Some from very good men&mdash;very
      warm friends of yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHELDER. Come now! It's not too late. Let's go back and tell them you
      won't do it again.

    <p>
      BANNING. [Bluntly] That's about it.

      have hounded me to it.

      BANNING. They won't say that of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHELDER. My dear More, aren't you rather dropping to our level? With your
      principles you ought not to care two straws what people say.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. But I do. I can't betray the dignity and courage of public men. If
      popular opinion is to control the utterances of her politicians, then
      good-bye indeed to this country!
    </p>
    <p>
      BANNING. Come now! I won't say that your views weren't sound enough before
      the fighting began. I've never liked our policy out there. But our blood's
      being spilled; and that makes all the difference. I don't suppose they'd
      want me exactly, but I'd be ready to go myself. We'd all of us be ready.
      And we can't have the man that represents us talking wild, until we've
      licked these fellows. That's it in a nutshell.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. I understand your feeling, Banning. I tender you my resignation. I
      can't and won't hold on where I'm not wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      BANNING. No, no, no! Don't do that! [His accent broader and broader]
      You've 'ad your say, and there it is. Coom now! You've been our Member
      nine years, in rain and shine.
    </p>
    <p>

      a good man!

      cattle-lifting ruffians?

    <p>
      MORE. Better lift cattle than lift freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHELDER. Well, all we'll ask is that you shouldn't go about the country,
      saying so.

      MORE. Is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      BANNING. Ah! no, but we don't want to part with you, Mr. More. It's a
      bitter thing, this, after three elections. Look at the 'uman side of it!
      To speak ill of your country when there's been a disaster like this
      terrible business in the Pass. There's your own wife. I see her brother's
      regiment's to start this very afternoon. Come now&mdash;how must she feel?

    <p>
      BANNING. We just want to put you out of temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. I've held my seat with you in all weathers for nine years. You've
      all been bricks to me. My heart's in my work, Banning; I'm not eager to
      undergo political eclipse at forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHELDER. Just so&mdash;we don't want to see you in that quandary.
    </p>
    <p>
      BANNING. It'd be no friendliness to give you a wrong impression of the
      state of feeling. Silence&mdash;till the bitterness is overpast; there's
      naught else for it, Mr. More, while you feel as you do. That tongue of
      yours! Come! You owe us something. You're a big man; it's the big view you
      ought to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. I am trying to.
    </p>
    <p>
      HOME. And what precisely is your view&mdash;you'll pardon my asking?
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. [Turning on him] Mr. Home a great country such as ours&mdash;is
      trustee for the highest sentiments of mankind. Do these few outrages
      justify us in stealing the freedom of this little people?
    </p>
    <p>
      BANNING. Steal&mdash;their freedom! That's rather running before the
      hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Ah, Banning! now we come to it. In your hearts you're none of you
      for that&mdash;neither by force nor fraud. And yet you all know that we've
      gone in there to stay, as we've gone into other lands&mdash;as all we big
      Powers go into other lands, when they're little and weak. The Prime
      Minister's words the other night were these: "If we are forced to spend
      this blood and money now, we must never again be forced." What does that
      mean but swallowing this country?
    </p>
    <p>
      SHELDER. Well, and quite frankly, it'd be no bad thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      HOME. We don't want their wretched country&mdash;we're forced.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. We are not forced.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHELDER. My dear More, what is civilization but the logical, inevitable
      swallowing up of the lower by the higher types of man? And what else will
      it be here?
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. We shall not agree there, Shelder; and we might argue it all day.
      But the point is, not whether you or I are right&mdash;the point is: What
      is a man who holds a faith with all his heart to do? Please tell me.

      low] in spite of my own wife's feeling, I must be free to raise my voice
      against this war.

      eyes] Mr. More, there's no man I respect more than yourself. I can't tell
      what they'll say down there when we go back; but I, for one, don't feel it
      in me to take a hand in pressing you farther against your faith.
    </p>

      SCENE I
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        A cobble-stoned alley, without pavement, behind a suburban theatre. The
        tall, blind, dingy-yellowish wall of the building is plastered with the
        tattered remnants of old entertainment bills, and the words: "To Let,"
        and with several torn, and one still virgin placard, containing this
        announcement: "Stop-the- War Meeting, October 1st. Addresses by STEPHEN
        MORE, Esq., and others." The alley is plentifully strewn with refuse and
        scraps of paper. Three stone steps, inset, lead to the stage door. It is
        a dark night, and a street lamp close to the wall throws all the light
        there is. A faint, confused murmur, as of distant hooting is heard.
        Suddenly a boy comes running, then two rough girls hurry past in the
        direction of the sound; and the alley is again deserted. The stage door
        opens, and a doorkeeper, poking his head out, looks up and down. He
        withdraws, but in a second reappears, preceding three black-coated
        gentlemen.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      DOORKEEPER. It's all clear. You can get away down here, gentlemen. Keep to
      the left, then sharp to the right, round the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE THREE. [Dusting themselves, and settling their ties] Thanks, very
      much! Thanks!

      FIRST BLACK-COATED GENTLEMAN. Where's More? Isn't he coming?

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        They hurry away. The DOORKEEPER retires. Another boy runs past. Then the
        door opens again. STEEL and MORE come out. MORE stands hesitating on the
        steps; then turns as if to go back.

      STEEL. [Running his arm through MORE'S, and almost dragging him down the
      steps] You owe it to the theatre people. [MORE still hesitates] We might
      be penned in there another hour; you told Mrs. More half-past ten; it'll
      only make her anxious. And she hasn't seen you for six weeks.

      <p>
        They move down the steps, and away to the left, as a boy comes running

      SCENE II
    </p>
    <p>
      The window-end of KATHERINE'S bedroom, panelled in cream-coloured wood.
      The light from four candles is falling on KATHERINE, who is sitting before
      the silver mirror of an old oak dressing-table, brushing her hair. A door,
      on the left, stands ajar. An oak chair against the wall close to a
      recessed window is all the other furniture. Through this window the blue
      night is seen, where a mist is rolled out flat amongst trees, so that only
      dark clumps of boughs show here and there, beneath a moonlit sky. As the
      curtain rises, KATHERINE, with brush arrested, is listening. She begins
      again brushing her hair, then stops, and taking a packet of letters from a
      drawer of her dressing-table, reads. Through the just open door behind her
      comes the voice of OLIVE.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. Mummy! I'm awake!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        But KATHERINE goes on reading; and OLIVE steals into the room in her
        nightgown.

    <p>
      OLIVE. [At KATHERINE'S elbow&mdash;examining her watch on its stand] It's
      fourteen minutes to eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Olive, Olive!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. I just wanted to see the time. I never can go to sleep if I try&mdash;it's
      quite helpless, you know. Is there a victory yet? [KATHERINE, shakes her
      head] Oh! I prayed extra special for one in the evening papers. [Straying
      round her mother] Hasn't Daddy come?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. Are you waiting for him? [Burying her face in her mother's hair]
      Your hair is nice, Mummy. It's particular to-night.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      OLIVE. How long has Daddy been away?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Six weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. It seems about a hundred years, doesn't it? Has he been making
      speeches all the time?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. To-night, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. The night that man was here whose head's too bald for anything&mdash;oh!
      Mummy, you know&mdash;the one who cleans his teeth so termendously&mdash;I
      heard Daddy making a speech to the wind. It broke a wine-glass. His
      speeches must be good ones, mustn't they!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Very.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. It felt funny; you couldn't see any wind, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Talking to the wind is an expression, Olive.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. Does Daddy often?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Yes, nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. What does it mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Speaking to people who won't listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. What do they do, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Just a few people go to hear him, and then a great crowd comes
      and breaks in; or they wait for him outside, and throw things, and hoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. Poor Daddy! Is it people on our side who throw things?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Yes, but only rough people.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. Why does he go on doing it? I shouldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. He thinks it is his duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. To your neighbour, or only to God?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. To both.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. Oh! Are those his letters?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. [Reading from the letter] "My dear Heart." Does he always call you
      his dear heart, Mummy? It's rather jolly, isn't it? "I shall be home about
      half-past ten to-morrow night. For a few hours the fires of
      p-u-r-g-a-t-or-y will cease to burn&mdash;" What are the fires of
      p-u-r-g-a-t-o-r-y?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. [Putting away the letters] Come, Olive!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. But what are they?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Daddy means that he's been very unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. Have you, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. [Cheerfully] So have I. May I open the window?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. No; you'll let the mist in.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. Isn't it a funny mist-all flat!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Now, come along, frog!
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. [Making time] Mummy, when is Uncle Hubert coming back?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. We don't know, dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLIVE. I suppose Auntie Helen'll stay with us till he does.

    <p>
      KATHERINE. Yes.

    <p>
      KATHERINE. [Picking her up] Now then!

      I'm frightened of the mob, or of the window's bein' broke again, or mind
      what the boys in the street say. I should think not&mdash; no! It's my
      heart. I'm sore night and day thinkin' of my son, and him lying out there
      at night without a rag of dry clothing, and water that the bullocks won't
      drink, and maggots in the meat; and every day one of his friends laid out
      stark and cold, and one day&mdash;'imself perhaps. If anything were to
      'appen to him. I'd never forgive meself&mdash;here. Ah! Miss Katherine, I
      wonder how you bear it&mdash;bad news comin' every day&mdash;And Sir
      John's face so sad&mdash;And all the time the master speaking against us,

      something to happen, if I stay here; and Mr. More coming back to-night.

      cost him, to go against the country.

      KATHERINE. He's following his conscience.

      NURSE. And others must follow theirs, too. No, Miss Katherine, for you to
      let him&mdash;you, with your three brothers out there, and your father
      fair wasting away with grief. Sufferin' too as you've been these three
      months past. What'll you feel if anything happens to my three young
      gentlemen out there, to my dear Mr. Hubert that I nursed myself, when your

    <p>
      KATHERINE. My dear, what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN. I've seen&mdash;a vision!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. Hssh! You'll wake Olive!
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN. [Staring before her] I'd just fallen asleep, and I saw a plain that
      seemed to run into the sky&mdash;like&mdash;that fog. And on it there were&mdash;dark
      things. One grew into a body without a head, and a gun by its side. And
      one was a man sitting huddled up, nursing a wounded leg. He had the face
      of Hubert's servant, Wreford. And then I saw&mdash;Hubert. His face was
      all dark and thin; and he had&mdash;a wound, an awful wound here [She
      touches her breast]. The blood was running from it, and he kept trying to
      stop it&mdash;oh! Kit&mdash;by kissing it [She pauses, stifled by
      emotion]. Then I heard Wreford laugh, and say vultures didn't touch live
      bodies. And there came a voice, from somewhere, calling out: "Oh! God! I'm
      dying!" And Wreford began to swear at it, and I heard Hubert say: "Don't,
      Wreford; let the poor fellow be!" But the voice went on and on, moaning
      and crying out: "I'll lie here all night dying&mdash;and then I'll die!"
      And Wreford dragged himself along the ground; his face all devilish, like
      a man who's going to kill.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. My dear! HOW ghastly!
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN. Still that voice went on, and I saw Wreford take up the dead man's
      gun. Then Hubert got upon his feet, and went tottering along, so feebly,
      so dreadfully&mdash;but before he could reach and stop him, Wreford fired
      at the man who was crying. And Hubert called out: "You brute!" and fell
      right down. And when Wreford saw him lying there, he began to moan and
      sob, but Hubert never stirred. Then it all got black again&mdash;and I
      could see a dark woman&mdash;thing creeping, first to the man without a
      head; then to Wreford; then to Hubert, and it touched him, and sprang
      away. And it cried out: "A-ai-ah!" [Pointing out at the mist] Look! Out
      there! The dark things!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. [Putting her arms round her] Yes, dear, yes! You must have been
      looking at the mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN. [Strangely calm] He's dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATHERINE. It was only a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN. You didn't hear that cry. [She listens] That's Stephen. Forgive me,
      Kit; I oughtn't to have upset you, but I couldn't help coming.

    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. My dear fellow, you're up against the strongest common instinct in
      the world. What do you expect? That the man in the street should be a
      Quixote? That his love of country should express itself in philosophic
      altruism? What on earth do you expect? Men are very simple creatures; and
      Mob is just conglomerate essence of simple men.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Conglomerate excrescence. Mud of street and market-place gathered in
      a torrent&mdash;This blind howling "patriotism"&mdash;what each man feels
      in here? [He touches his breast] No!
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. You think men go beyond instinct&mdash;they don't. All they know
      is that something's hurting that image of themselves that they call
      country. They just feel something big and religious, and go it blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. This used to be the country of free speech. It used to be the
      country where a man was expected to hold to his faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. There are limits to human nature, Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Let no man stand to his guns in face of popular attack. Still your
      advice, is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MENDIP. My advice is: Get out of town at once. The torrent you speak of
      will be let loose the moment this news is out. Come, my dear fellow, don't
      stay here!
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE. Thanks! I'll see that Katherine and Olive go.

      should be.

      SIR JOHN. By these&mdash;whom you uphold. Katherine asked me to let you
      know. She's gone to Helen. I understand you only came back last night from
      your&mdash;&mdash;No word I can use would give what I feel about that. I
      don't know how things stand now between you and Katherine; but I tell you
      this, Stephen: you've tried her these last two months beyond what any
      woman ought to bear!

      SIR JOHN. Yes&mdash;I can believe in your unhappiness. I cannot conceive
      of greater misery than to be arrayed against your country. If I could have
      Hubert back, I would not have him at such a price&mdash;no, nor all my
      sons. 'Pro patri mori'&mdash;My boy, at all events, is happy!

      MORE. Yes!

      SIR JOHN. Yet you can go on doing what you are! What devil of pride has
      got into you, Stephen?

      fighting out there? Not for a minute.

      MORE. I would give all I have&mdash;for that creed.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. [Puzzled] Stephen, I've never looked on you as a crank; I always
      believed you sane and honest. But this is&mdash;visionary mania.

    <p>
      MORE. Vision of what might be.

      SIR JOHN. Why can't you be content with what the grandest nation&mdash;
      the grandest men on earth&mdash;have found good enough for them? I've
      known them, I've seen what they could suffer, for our country.

      MORE. Sir John, imagine what the last two months have been to me! To see
      people turn away in the street&mdash;old friends pass me as if I were a
      wall! To dread the post! To go to bed every night with the sound of
      hooting in my ears! To know that my name is never referred to without
      contempt&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      SIR JOHN. You have your new friends. Plenty of them, I understand.
    </p>

      battles are fool's play to it.

      SIR JOHN. You've heard there's been a victory. Do you carry your unnatural
      feeling so far as to be sorry for that? [MORE shakes his head] That's
      something! For God's sake, Stephen, stop before it's gone past mending.
      Don't ruin your life with Katherine. Hubert was her favourite brother; you
      are backing those who killed him. Think what that means to her! Drop this&mdash;mad
      Quixotism&mdash;idealism&mdash;whatever you call it. Take Katherine away.
      Leave the country till the thing's over&mdash;this country of yours that
      you're opposing, and&mdash;and&mdash; traducing. Take her away! Come! What
      good are you doing? What earthly good? Come, my boy! Before you're utterly
      undone.

      MORE. Sir John! Our men are dying out there for, the faith that's in them!
      I believe my faith the higher, the better for mankind&mdash;Am I to slink
      away? Since I began this campaign I've found hundreds who've thanked me
      for taking this stand. They look on me now as their leader. Am I to desert
      them? When you led your forlorn hope&mdash; did you ask yourself what good
      you were doing, or, whether you'd come through alive? It's my forlorn hope
      not to betray those who are following me; and not to help let die a fire&mdash;a
      fire that's sacred&mdash; not only now in this country, but in all
      countries, for all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. [After a long stare] I give you credit for believing what you
      say. But let me tell you whatever that fire you talk of&mdash;I'm too
      old-fashioned to grasp&mdash;one fire you are letting die&mdash;your
      wife's love. By God! This crew of your new friends, this crew of cranks
      and jays, if they can make up to you for the loss of her love&mdash;of
      your career, of all those who used to like and respect you&mdash;so much
      the better for you. But if you find yourself bankrupt of affection&mdash;
      alone as the last man on earth; if this business ends in your utter ruin
      and destruction&mdash;as it must&mdash;I shall not pity&mdash;I cannot
      pity you. Good-night!

        A shower of nutshells, orange-peel, and harmless missiles begins to

        groaning: "More! Traitor! Black-leg! More!" And through the window can
        be seen waving flags and lighted Chinese lanterns, swinging high on long
        bamboos. The din of execration swells. MORE stands unheeding, still
        gazing after the cab. Then, with a sharp crack, a flung stone crashes
        through one of the panes. It is followed by a hoarse shout of laughter,

        flare of the Chinese lanterns lights up his face. Then, as if forgetting

        In the surging entrance of the mob the footman, HENRY, who shows fight,
        is overwhelmed, hustled out into the crowd on the terrace, and no more
        seen. The MOB is a mixed crowd of revellers of both sexes, medical
        students, clerks, shop men and girls, and a Boy Scout or two. Many have
        exchanged hats&mdash;Some wear masks, or false noses, some carry
        feathers or tin whistles. Some, with bamboos and Chinese lanterns, swing
        them up outside on the terrace. The medley of noises is very great. Such
        ringleaders as exist in the confusion are a GROUP OF STUDENTS, the chief
        of whom, conspicuous because unadorned, is an athletic, hatless young
        man with a projecting underjaw, and heavy coal-black moustache, who
        seems with the swing of his huge arms and shoulders to sway the currents
        of motion. When the first surge of noise and movement subsides, he calls
        out: "To him, boys! Chair the hero!" THE STUDENTS rush at the impassive
        MORE, swing him roughly on to their shoulders and bear him round the
        room. When they have twice circled the table to the music of their
        confused singing, groans and whistling, THE CHIEF OF THE STUDENTS calls
        out: "Put him down!" Obediently they set him down on the table which has
        been forced into the bay window, and stand gaping up at him.

 Updated editions will replace the previous one&mdash;the old editions
 will be renamed.

 Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
 one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
 (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
 permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
 set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
 copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
 protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
 Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
 charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
 do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
 rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
 such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
 research.  They may be modified and printed and given away&mdash;you may do
 practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
 subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
 redistribution.

 *** START: FULL LICENSE ***

 THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
 http://gutenberg.net/license).

 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic works

 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
 States.

 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
 copied or distributed:

 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
 with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
 1.E.9.

 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
 prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm License.

 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
 that

 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
      License.  You must require such a user to return or
      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
      Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
      of receipt of the work.

 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
 Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

 1.F.

 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 your equipment.

 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGE.

 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
 opportunities to fix the problem.

 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 people in all walks of life.

 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
 To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
 and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 particular state visit http://pglaf.org

 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate.

 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
 donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.

 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

      http://www.gutenberg.net

 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
