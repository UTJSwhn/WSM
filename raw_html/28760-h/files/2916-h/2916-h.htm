      ACT I
    </h2>
    <p>
      LORD WILLIAM DROMONDY'S mansion in Park Lane. Eight o'clock of the
      evening. LITTLE ANNE DROMONDY and the large footman, JAMES, gaunt and
      grin, discovered in the wine cellar, by light of gas. JAMES, in plush
      breeches, is selecting wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE: James, are you really James?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. No, my proper name's John.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Oh! [A pause] And is Charles's an improper name too?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. His proper name's Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Then is Thomas Matthew?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Miss Anne, stand clear o' that bin. You'll put your foot through
      one o' those 'ock bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. No, but James&mdash;Henry might be Luke, really?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Now shut it, Miss Anne!
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Who gave you those names? Not your godfathers and godmothers?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Poulder. Butlers think they're the Almighty. [Gloomily] But his
      name's Bartholomew.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Bartholomew Poulder? It's rather jolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. It's hidjeous.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Which do you like to be called&mdash;John or James?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. I don't give a darn.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. What is a darn?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. 'Tain't in the dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Do you like my name? Anne Dromondy? It's old, you know. But it's
      funny, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Indifferently] It'll pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. How many bottles have you got to pick out?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Thirty-four.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Are they all for the dinner, or for the people who come in to the
      Anti-Sweating Meeting afterwards?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. All for the dinner. They give the Sweated&mdash;tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. All for the dinner? They'll drink too much, won't they?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. We've got to be on the safe side.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Will it be safer if they drink too much?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [JAMES pauses in the act of dusting a bottle to look at her, as if
        suspecting irony.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      [Sniffing] Isn't the smell delicious here-like the taste of cherries when
      they've gone bad&mdash;[She sniffs again] and mushrooms; and boot
      blacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. That's the escape of gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Has the plumber's man been?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Which one?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Little blighter I've never seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. What is a little blighter? Can I see?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. He's just gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. [Straying] Oh!... James, are these really the foundations?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. You might 'arf say so. There's a lot under a woppin' big house like
      this; you can't hardly get to the bottom of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Everything's built on something, isn't it? And what's THAT built
      on?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Ask another.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. If you wanted to blow it up, though, you'd have to begin from
      here, wouldn't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Who'd want to blow it up?
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. It would make a mess in Park Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. I've seen a lot bigger messes than this'd make, out in the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Oh! but that's years ago! Was it like this in the trenches,
      James?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Grimly] Ah! 'Cept that you couldn't lay your 'and on a bottle o'
      port when you wanted one.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Do you, when you want it, here?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [On guard] I only suggest it's possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Perhaps Poulder does.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Icily] I say nothin' about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Oh! Do say something!
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. I'm ashamed of you, Miss Anne, pumpin' me!
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. [Reproachfully] I'm not pumpin'! I only want to make Poulder jump
      when I ask him.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Grinning] Try it on your own responsibility, then; don't bring me
      in!
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. [Switching off] James, do you think there's going to be a bloody
      revolution?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Shocked] I shouldn't use that word, at your age.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Why not? Daddy used it this morning to Mother. [Imitating] "The
      country's in an awful state, darling; there's going to be a bloody
      revolution, and we shall all be blown sky-high." Do you like Daddy?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Taken aback] Like Lord William? What do you think? We chaps would
      ha' done anything for him out there in the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. He never says that he always says he'd have done anything for
      you!
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Well&mdash;that's the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. It isn't&mdash;it's the opposite. What is class hatred, James?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Wisely] Ah! A lot o' people thought when the war was over there'd
      be no more o' that. [He sniggers] Used to amuse me to read in the papers
      about the wonderful unity that was comin'. I could ha' told 'em different.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Why should people hate? I like everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. You know such a lot o' people, don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Well, Daddy likes everybody, and Mother likes everybody, except
      the people who don't like Daddy. I bar Miss Stokes, of course; but then,
      who wouldn't?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [With a touch of philosophy] That's right&mdash;we all bars them
      that tries to get something out of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Who do you bar, James?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Well&mdash;[Enjoying the luxury of thought]&mdash;Speaking
      generally, I bar everybody that looks down their noses at me. Out there in
      the trenches, there'd come a shell, and orf'd go some orficer's head, an'
      I'd think: That might ha' been me&mdash;we're all equal in the sight o'
      the stars. But when I got home again among the torfs, I says to meself:
      Out there, ye know, you filled a hole as well as me; but here you've put
      it on again, with mufti.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. James, are your breeches made of mufti?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Contemplating his legs with a certain contempt] Ah! Footmen were
      to ha' been off; but Lord William was scared we wouldn't get jobs in the
      rush. We're on his conscience, and it's on my conscience that I've been on
      his long enough&mdash;so, now I've saved a bit, I'm goin' to take meself
      orf it.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Oh! Are you going? Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Assembling the last bottles] Out o' Blighty!
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Is a little blighter a little Englishman?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Embarrassed] Well-'e can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE [Mining] James&mdash;we're quite safe down here, aren't we, in a
      revolution? Only, we wouldn't have fun. Which would you rather&mdash;be
      safe, or have fun?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Grimly] Well, I had my bit o' fun in the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. I like fun that happens when you're not looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Do you? You'd ha' been just suited.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. James, is there a future life? Miss Stokes says so.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. It's a belief, in the middle classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. What are the middle classes?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Anything from two 'undred a year to supertax.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Mother says they're terrible. Is Miss Stokes middle class?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Then I expect they are terrible. She's awfully virtuous, though,
      isn't she?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. 'Tisn't so much the bein' virtuous, as the lookin' it, that's
      awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Are all the middle classes virtuous? Is Poulder?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Dubiously] Well. Ask him!
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. Yes, I will. Look!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [From an empty bin on the ground level she picks up a lighted taper,&mdash;burnt
        almost to the end.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Contemplating it] Careless!
    </p>
    <p>
      L. Ate. Oh! And look! [She paints to a rounded metal object lying in the
      bin, close to where the taper was] It's a bomb!

    <p>
      LORD W. It's time you and James were up, Poulder. [Indicating the cooler]
      Look after this; tell Lady William I'll be there in a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      POULDER. Very good, me Lord.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        look after them, LORD WILLIAM catches sight of his back.]

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LORD W. I must apologise, sir. Can I brush you?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Dusting himself] Thanks; it's only behind. [He opens his
      note-book] Now, Lord William, if you'd kindly outline your views on the
      national situation; after such a narrow escape from death, I feel they
      might have a moral effect. My paper, as you know, is concerned with&mdash;the
      deeper aspect of things. By the way, what do you value your house and
      collection at?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. [Twisting his little mustache] Really: I can't! Really!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. Might I say a quarter of a million-lifted in two seconds and a
      half-hundred thousand to the second. It brings it home, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. No, no; dash it! No!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Disappointed] I see&mdash;not draw attention to your property in
      the present excited state of public feeling? Well, suppose we approach it
      from the viewpoint of the Anti-Sweating dinner. I have the list of guests&mdash;very
      weighty!
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Taken some lifting-wouldn't they?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Seriously] May I say that you designed the dinner to soften the
      tension, at this crisis? You saw that case, I suppose, this morning, of
      the woman dying of starvation in Bethnal Green?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. [Desperately] Yes-yes! I've been horribly affected. I always knew
      this slump would come after the war, sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Writing] "... had predicted slump."
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. You see, I've been an Anti-Sweating man for years, and I thought
      if only we could come together now....
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Nodding] I see&mdash;I see! Get Society interested in the Sweated,
      through the dinner. I have the menu here. [He produces it.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Good God, man&mdash;more than that! I want to show the people that
      we stand side by side with them, as we did in the trenches. The whole
      thing's too jolly awful. I lie awake over it.
    </p>

    <p>
      PRESS. [Scribbling] One moment, please. I'll just get that down&mdash;
      "Too jolly awful&mdash;lies awake over it. Was wearing a white waistcoat
      with pearl buttons." [At a sign of resentment from his victim.] I want the
      human touch, Lord William&mdash;it's everything in my paper. What do you
      say about this attempt to bomb you?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Well, in a way I think it's d&mdash;-d natural
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Scribbling] "Lord William thought it d&mdash;-d natural."
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. [Overhearing] No, no; don't put that down. What I mean is, I
      should like to get hold of those fellows that are singing the Marseillaise
      about the streets&mdash;fellows that have been in the war&mdash; real
      sports they are, you know&mdash;thorough good chaps at bottom&mdash;and
      say to them: "Have a feeling heart, boys; put yourself in my position." I
      don't believe a bit they'd want to bomb me then.

    <p>
      LORD E. [Bewildered] "Brotherhood!" Well, it's pure accident that I'm here
      and they're there. All the same, I can't pretend to be starving. Can't go
      out into Hyde Park and stand on a tub, can I? But if I could only show
      them what I feel&mdash;they're such good chaps&mdash; poor devils.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. I quite appreciate! [He writes] "Camel and needle's eye." You were
      at Eton and Oxford? Your constituency I know. Clubs? But I can get all
      that. Is it your view that Christianity is on the up-grade, Lord William?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. [Dubious] What d'you mean by Christianity&mdash;loving&mdash;kindness
      and that? Of course I think that dogma's got the knock.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      PRESS. [Writing] "Lord William thought dogma had got the knock." I should
      like you just to develop your definition of Christianity. "Loving&mdash;kindness"
      strikes rather a new note.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. New? What about the Sermon on the Mount?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Writing] "Refers to Sermon on Mount." I take it you don't belong
      to any Church, Lord William?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. [Exasperated] Well, really&mdash;I've been baptised and that sort
      of thing. But look here&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. Oh! you can trust me&mdash;I shan't say anything that you'll
      regret. Now, do you consider that a religious revival would help to quiet
      the country?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Well, I think it would be a deuced, good thing if everybody were a
      bit more kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. Ah! [Musing] I feel that your views are strikingly original, Lord
      William. If you could just open out on them a little more? How far would
      you apply kindness in practice?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Can you apply it in theory?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. I believe it is done. But would you allow yourself to be blown up
      with impunity?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Well, that's a bit extreme. But I quite sympathise with this chap.
      Imagine yourself in his shoes. He sees a huge house, all these bottles; us
      swilling them down; perhaps he's got a starving wife, or consumptive kids.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Writing and murmuring] Um-m! "Kids."
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. He thinks: "But for the grace of God, there swill I. Why should
      that blighter have everything and I nothing?" and all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Writing] "And all that." [Eagerly] Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. And gradually&mdash;you see&mdash;this contrast&mdash;becomes an
      obsession with him. "There's got to be an example made," he thinks; and&mdash;er&mdash;
      he makes it, don't you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Writing] Ye-es? And&mdash;when you're the example?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Well, you feel a bit blue, of course. But my point is that you
      quite see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. From the other world. Do you believe in a future life, Lord
      William? The public took a lot of interest in the question, if you
      remember, at the time of the war. It might revive at any moment, if
      there's to be a revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. The wish is always father to the thought, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. Yes! But&mdash;er&mdash;doesn't the question of a future life
      rather bear on your point about kindness? If there isn't one&mdash;why be
      kind?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Well, I should say one oughtn't to be kind for any motive&mdash;
      that's self-interest; but just because one feels it, don't you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Writing vigorously] That's very new&mdash;very new!
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. [Simply] You chaps are wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Doubtfully] You mean we're&mdash;we're&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. No, really. You have such a d&mdash;-d hard time. It must be
      perfectly beastly to interview fellows like me.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. Oh! Not at all, Lord William. Not at all. I assure you compared
      with a literary man, it's&mdash;it's almost heavenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. You must have a wonderful knowledge of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Bridling a little] Well&mdash;I shouldn't say that.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. I don't see how you can avoid it. You turn your hands to
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Modestly] Well&mdash;yes, Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. I say: Is there really going to be a revolution, or are you making
      it up, you Press?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. We don't know. We never know whether we come before the event, or
      it comes before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. That's&mdash;very deep&mdash;very dip. D'you mind lending me your
      note-book a moment. I'd like to stick that down. All right, I'll use the
      other end. [THE PRESS hands it hypnotically.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. [Jotting] Thanks awfully. Now what's your real opinion of the
      situation?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. As a man or a Press man?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Is there any difference?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. Is there any connection?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Well, as a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. As a man, I think it's rotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. [Jotting] "Rotten." And as a pressman?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. [Smiling] Prime.

      LORD W. What! Like a Stilton cheese. Ha, ha!

    <p>
      LORD W. But look here! Would you say that a strong press movement would
      help to quiet the country?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. Well, as you ask me, Lord William, I'll tell you. No newspapers for
      a month would do the trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. [Jotting] By Jove! That's brilliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. Yes, but I should starve. [He suddenly looks up, and his eyes, like
      gimlets, bore their way into LORD WILLIAM'S pleasant, troubled face] Lord
      William, you could do me a real kindness. Authorise me to go and interview
      the fellow who left the bomb here; I've got his address. I promise you to
      do it most discreetly. Fact is&mdash;well&mdash;I'm in low water. Since
      the war we simply can't get sensation enough for the new taste. Now, if I
      could have an article headed: "Bombed and Bomber"&mdash;sort of double
      interview, you know, it'd very likely set me on my legs again. [Very
      earnestly] Look! [He holds out his frayed wristbands.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. [Grasping his hand] My dear chap, certainly. Go and interview this
      blighter, and then bring him round here. You can do that for one. I'd very
      much like to see him, as a matter of fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. Thanks awfully; I shall never forget it. Oh! might I have my
      note-book?

      and another's not&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      [He puts his hand into his breast pocket.]
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESS. Oh, thank you! But you see, I shall have to write you up a bit,
      Lord William. The old aristocracy&mdash;you know what the public still
      expects; if you were to lend me money, you might feel&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. By Jove! Never should have dreamt&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      PRESS. No! But it wouldn't do. Have you a photograph of yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Not on me.

      PRESS. Pity! By the way, has it occurred to you that there may be another
      bomb on the premises?

    <p>
      LADY W. Why, what harm have we done?
    </p>

    <p>
      LADY W. Why do you want to?
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Out there one used to know what one's men felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. [Staring] My dear boy, I really don't think you ought to see the
      Press; it always upsets you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Well! Why should you and I be going to eat ourselves silly to
      improve the condition of the sweated, when&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. [Calmly] When they're going to "improve" ours, if we don't look
      out. We've got to get in first, Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. [Gloomily] I know. It's all fear. That's it! Here we are, and here
      we shall stay&mdash;as if there'd never been a war.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. Well, thank heaven there's no "front" to a revolution. You and I
      can go to glory together this time. Compact! Anything that's on, I'm to
      abate in.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Well, in reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. No, in rhyme, too.

      LORD W. I say, your dress!

      LADY W. Yes, Poulder tried to stop me, but I wasn't going to have you
      blown up without me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. You duck. You do look stunning. Give us a kiss!

      LADY W. [Starting back] Oh, Bill! Don't touch me&mdash;your hands!
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Never mind, my mouth's clean.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The single room of old MRS. LEMMY, in a small grey house in Bethnal
        Green, the room of one cumbered by little save age, and the crockery
        debris of the past. A bed, a cupboard, a coloured portrait of Queen
        Victoria, and&mdash;of all things&mdash;a fiddle, hanging on the wall.
        By the side of old MRS. LEMMY in her chair is a pile of corduroy
        trousers, her day's sweated sewing, and a small table. She sits with her
        back to the window, through which, in the last of the light, the
        opposite side of the little grey street is visible under the evening
        sky, where hangs one white cloud shaped like a horned beast. She is
        still sewing, and her lips move. Being old, and lonely, she has that
        habit of talking to herself, distressing to those who cannot overhear.
        From the smack of her tongue she was once a West Country cottage woman;
        from the look of her creased, parchmenty face, she was once a pretty
        girl with black eyes, in which there is still much vitality. The door is
        opened with difficulty and a little girl enters, carrying a pile of
        unfinished corduroy trousers nearly as large as herself. She puts them
        down against the wall, and advances. She is eleven or twelve years old;
        large-eyed, dark haired, and sallow. Half a woman of this and half of
        another world, except when as now, she is as irresponsible a bit of life
        as a little flowering weed growing out of a wall. She stands looking at
        MRS. LEMMY with dancing eyes.

        houses on the opposite side of the street, the moon has risen in the
        dark blue sky, so that the cloud shaped like a beast seems leaping over
        it. LEMMY plays the first notes of the Marseillaise. A black cat on the
        window-sill outside looks in, hunching its back. LITTLE AIDA barks at
        her. MRS. LEMMY struggles to her feet, sweeping the empty dish and spoon
        to the floor in the effort.]

      ACT III

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        An octagon ante-room of the hall at LORD WILLIAM DROMONDY'S. A shining
        room lighted by gold candelabra, with gold-curtained pillars, through
        which the shining hall and a little of the grand stairway are visible. A
        small table with a gold-coloured cloth occupies the very centre of the
        room, which has a polished parquet floor and high white walls.
        Gold-coloured doors on the left. Opposite these doors a window with
        gold-coloured curtains looks out on Park Lane. LADY WILLIAM standing
        restlessly between the double doors and the arch which leads to the
        hall. JAMES is stationary by the double doors, from behind which come
        sounds of speech and applause.

    <p>
      LADY W. Oh! Father, you ARE late.
    </p>
    <p>
      HIS G. Awful crowd in the streets, Nell. They've got a coffin&mdash;
      couldn't get by.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. Coin? Whose?
    </p>
    <p>
      HIS G. The Government's I should think-no flowers, by request. I say, have
      I got to speak?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. Oh! no, dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      HIS G. H'm! That's unlucky. I've got it here. [He looks down his cuff]
      Found something I said in 1914&mdash;just have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. Oh! If you've got it&mdash;James, ask Lord William to come to me
      for a moment. [JAMES vanishes through the door. To THE DUKE] Go in,
      Grand-dad; they'll be so awfully pleased to see you. I'll tell Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      HIS G. Where's Anne?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. In bed, of course.

    <p>
      HIS G. I got her this&mdash;rather nice?

      LADY W. [Much interested] Oh! no, but how sweet! She'll simply love it.
    </p>
    <p>
      POULDER. If I might suggest to Your Grace to take it in and operate it.
      It's sweated, Your Grace. They-er-make them in those places.
    </p>
    <p>
      HIS G. By Jove! D'you know the price, Poulder?
    </p>
    <p>
      POULDER. [Interrogatively] A penny, is it? Something paltry, Your Grace!
    </p>
    <p>
      HIS G. Where's that woman who knows everything; Miss Munday?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. Oh! She'll be in there, somewhere.

      LADY W. Of course&mdash;first quiet moment.

      LADY W. Oh! Bill, your Dad wants to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. The deuce he does&mdash;that's bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. Yes, of course, but you must let him; he's found something he said
      in 1914.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. I knew it. That's what they'll say. Standing stock still, while
      hell's on the jump around us.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. Never mind that; it'll please him; and he's got a lovely little
      sweated toy that turns head over heels at one penny.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. H'm! Well, come on.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. No, I must wait for stragglers. There's sure to be an editor in a
      hurry.

      POULDER. [Announcing] Mis-ter Gold-rum!

      LADY W. [Sotto voce] And there he is! [She advances to meet a thin,
      straggling man in eyeglasses, who is smiling absently] How good of you!

    <p>
      MR. G. Thanks awfully. I just er&mdash;and then I'm afraid I must&mdash;er&mdash;

      LORD W. There! I thought she was in&mdash;She really is the most
      unexpected woman! How do you do? How awfully sweet of you!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS M. [An elderly female schoolboy] How do you do? There's a spiffing
      crowd. I believe things are really going Bolshy. How do you do, Lord
      William? Have you got any of our people to show? I told one or two, in
      case&mdash;they do so simply love an outing.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. There are three old chips in the lobby, my Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. What? Oh! I say! Bring them in at once. Why&mdash;they're the hub
      of the whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Going] Very good, my Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. I am sorry. I'd no notion; and they're such dears always.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS M. I must tell you what one of them said to me. I'd told him not to
      use such bad language to his wife. "Don't you worry, Ma!" he said, "I
      expert you can do a bit of that yourself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY W. How awfully nice! It's SO like them.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS M. Yes. They're wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. I say, why do we always call them they?

    <p>
      LADY W. [Puzzled] Well, why not?

    <p>
      LORD W. THEY!

      MISS M. [Struck] Quite right, Lord William! Quite right! Another species.
      They! I must remember that. THEY! [She passes on.]

    <p>
      MISS S. Where is Anne?
    </p>
    <p>
      POULDER. [Vexed at the disturbance of his speech] Excuse me, Miss&mdash;
      to keep track of Miss Anne is fortunately no part of my dooties.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Miss S. She really is naughty.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      POULDER. She is. If she was mine, I'd spank her.
    </p>

        legs.]

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MISS S. Not a nice word.
    </p>
    <p>
      POULDER. No; but a pleasant haction. Miss Anne's the limit. In fact, Lord
      and Lady William are much too kind 'earted all round. Take these sweated
      workers; that class o' people are quite 'opeless. Treatin' them as your
      equals, shakin 'ands with 'em, givin 'em tea&mdash; it only puffs 'em out.
      Leave it to the Church, I say.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS S. The Church is too busy, Poulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      POULDER. Ah! That "Purity an' Future o' the Race Campaign." I'll tell you
      what I thinks the danger o' that, Miss. So much purity that there won't be
      a future race. [Expanding] Purity of 'eart's an excellent thing, no doubt,
      but there's a want of nature about it. Same with this Anti-Sweating.
      Unless you're anxious to come down, you must not put the lower classes up.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS S. I don't agree with you at all, Poulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      POULDER. Ah! You want it both ways, Miss. I should imagine you're a
      Liberal.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS S. [Horrified] Oh, no! I certainly am not.
    </p>
    <p>
      POULDER. Well, I judged from your takin' cocoa. Funny thing that, about
      cocoa-how it still runs through the Liberal Party! It's virtuous, I
      suppose. Wine, beer, tea, coffee-all of 'em vices. But cocoa you might
      drink a gallon a day and annoy no one but yourself! There's a lot o' deep
      things in life, Miss!
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss S. Quite so. But I must find Anne.
    </p>

    <p>
      POULDER. [Suavely] Well, I wish you every success; and I hope you'll spank
      her. This modern education&mdash;there's no fruitiness in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. ANNE. [From under the table] Poulder, are you virtuous?

      POULDER. [Jumping] Good Ged!

    <p>
      [Moved by some deep feeling] And this house an 'orspital in the war! I ask
      you&mdash;what was the good of all our sacrifices for the country? No town
      'ouse for four seasons&mdash;rustygettin' in the shires, not a soul but
      two boys under me. Lord William at the front, Lady William at the back.
      And all for this! [He points sadly at the cooler] It comes of meddlin' on
      the Continent. I had my prognostications at the time. [To JAMES] You
      remember my sayin' to you just before you joined up: "Mark my words&mdash;we
      shall see eight per cent. for our money before this is over!"
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Sepulchrally] I see the eight per cent., but not the money.

      JAMES. We'll put up a fight over your body: "Bartholomew Poulder, faithful
      unto death!" Have you insured your life?
    </p>
    <p>
      POULDER. Against a revolution?
    </p>

      JAMES. Act o' God! Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      POULDER. It's not an act o' God.

    <p>
      JAMES. It is; and I sympathise with it.

    <p>
      POULDER. You&mdash;what?

    <p>
      JAMES. I do&mdash;only&mdash;hands off the gov'nor.

    <p>
      POULDER. Oh! Really! Well, that's something. I'm glad to see you stand
      behind him, at all events.

    <p>
      JAMES. I stand in front of 'im when the scrap begins!

    <p>
      POULDER. Do you insinuate that my heart's not in the right place?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Well, look at it! It's been creepin' down ever since I knew you.
      Talk of your sacrifices in the war&mdash;they put you on your honour, and
      you got stout on it. Rations&mdash;not 'arf.
    </p>
    <p>
      POULDER. [Staring at him] For independence, I've never seen your equal,
      James. You might be an Australian.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Suavely] Keep a civil tongue, or I'll throw you to the crowd! [He
      comes forward to the table] Shall I tell you why I favour the gov'nor?
      Because, with all his pomp, he's a gentleman, as much as I am. Never asks
      you to do what he wouldn't do himself. What's more, he never comes it over
      you. If you get drunk, or&mdash;well, you understand me, Poulder&mdash;he'll
      just say: "Yes, yes; I know, James!" till he makes you feel he's done it
      himself. [Sinking his voice mysteriously] I've had experience with him, in
      the war and out. Why he didn't even hate the Huns, not as he ought. I tell
      you he's no Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      POULDER. Well, for irreverence&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Obstinately] And he'll never be. He's got too soft a heart.

    <p>
      POULDER. In there, under the bomb?

    <p>
      JAMES. [Contemptuously] Silly ass! You should take 'em lying down!

    <p>
      POULDER. Look here, James! I can't go on in this revolutionary spirit;
      either you or I resign.
    </p>

      JAMES. Crisis in the Cabinet!
    </p>
    <p>

      'Yn't that true, speakin' as a man?

      PRESS. Mr. Lemmy, even the Press is capable of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEMMY. Is it? I should ha' thought it was too important for a little thing
      like that. [To LORD WILLIAM] But ye're quite right; we couldn't do wivaht
      the Press&mdash;there wouldn't be no distress, no coffin, no revolution&mdash;'cos
      nobody'd know nuffin' abaht it. Why! There wouldn't be no life at all on

    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. Ah! Tell me, what would you do in my place?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEMMY. Why&mdash;as the nobleman said in 'is well-known wy: "Sit in me
      Club winder an' watch it ryne on the dam people!" That's if I was a
      average nobleman! If I was a bit more noble, I might be tempted to come
      the kind'earted on twenty thou' a year. Some prefers yachts, or ryce
      'orses. But philanthropy on the 'ole is syfer, in these dyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. So you think one takes to it as a sort of insurance, Mr. Lemmy? Is
      that quite fair?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEMMY. Well, we've all got a weakness towards bein' kind, somewhere abaht
      us. But the moment wealf comes in, we 'yn't wot I call single-'earted. If
      yer went into the foundytions of your wealf&mdash;would yer feel like
      'avin' any? It all comes from uvver people's 'ard, unpleasant lybour&mdash;it's
      all built on Muvver as yer might sy. An' if yer daon't get rid o' some of
      it in bein' kind&mdash;yer daon't feel syfe nor comfy.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. [Twisting his moustache] Your philosophy is very pessimistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEMMY. Well, I calls meself an optimist; I sees the worst of everyfink.
      Never disappynted, can afford to 'ave me smile under the blackest sky.
      When deaf is squeezin' of me windpipe, I shall 'ave a laugh in it! Fact
      is, if yer've 'ad to do wiv gas an' water pipes, yer can fyce anyfing.
      [The distant Marseillaise blares up] 'Ark at the revolution!
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. [Rather desperately] I know&mdash;hunger and all the rest of it!
      And here am I, a rich man, and don't know what the deuce to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEMMY. Well, I'll tell yer. Throw yer cellars open, an' while the populyce
      is gettin' drunk, sell all yer 'ave an' go an' live in Ireland; they've
      got the millennium chronic over there.

      'earin' the Marseillaisy naow. Lord! 'Ow you did talk abaht Unity and a

    </p>
    <p>
      LORD W. I quite agree; I quite agree. I've often said much the same thing.

    <p>
      LEMMY. Voice cryin' in the wilderness&mdash;I daon't sy we was yngels&mdash;
      there was faults on bofe sides. [He looks at THE PRESS] The Press could
      ha' helped yer a lot. Shall I tell yer wot the Press did? "It's vital,"
      said the Press, "that the country should be united, or it will never
      recover." Nao strikes, nao 'omen nature, nao nuffink. Kepitel an' Lybour
      like the Siamese twins. And, fust dispute that come along, the Press orfs
      wiv its coat an' goes at it bald'eaded. An' wot abaht since? Sich a riot
      o' nymes called, in Press&mdash;and Pawlyement. Unpatriotic an' outrygeous

 Updated editions will replace the previous one&mdash;the old editions
 will be renamed.

 Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
 one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
 (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
 permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
 set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
 copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
 protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
 Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
 charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
 do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
 rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
 such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
 research.  They may be modified and printed and given away&mdash;you may do
 practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
 subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
 redistribution.

 *** START: FULL LICENSE ***

 THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
 http://gutenberg.net/license).

 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic works

 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
 States.

 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
 copied or distributed:

 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
 with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
 1.E.9.

 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
 prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm License.

 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
 that

 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
      License.  You must require such a user to return or
      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
      Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
      of receipt of the work.

 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
 Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

 1.F.

 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 your equipment.

 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGE.

 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
 opportunities to fix the problem.

 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 people in all walks of life.

 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

 and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 particular state visit http://pglaf.org

 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate.

 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
 donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.

 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

      http://www.gutenberg.net

 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
