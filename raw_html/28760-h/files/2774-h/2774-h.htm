    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Light, entering the vast room&mdash;a room so high that its carved ceiling
      refused itself to exact scrutiny&mdash;travelled, with the wistful, cold
      curiosity of the dawn, over a fantastic storehouse of Time. Light,
      unaccompanied by the prejudice of human eyes, made strange revelation of
      incongruities, as though illuminating the dispassionate march of history.
    </p>
    <p>
      For in this dining hall&mdash;one of the finest in England&mdash;the
      Caradoc family had for centuries assembled the trophies and records of
      their existence. Round about this dining hall they had built and pulled
      down and restored, until the rest of Monkland Court presented some aspect
      of homogeneity. Here alone they had left virgin the work of the old
      quasi-monastic builders, and within it unconsciously deposited their
      souls. For there were here, meeting the eyes of light, all those rather
      touching evidences of man&rsquo;s desire to persist for ever, those shells of
      his former bodies, the fetishes and queer proofs of his faiths, together
      with the remorseless demonstration of their treatment at the hands of
      Time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The annalist might here have found all his needed confirmations; the
      analyst from this material formed the due equation of high birth; the
      philosopher traced the course of aristocracy, from its primeval rise in
      crude strength or subtlety, through centuries of power, to picturesque
      decadence, and the beginnings of its last stand. Even the artist might
      here, perchance, have seized on the dry ineffable pervading spirit, as one
      visiting an old cathedral seems to scent out the constriction of its
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the legendary sword of that Welsh chieftain who by an act of high,
      rewarded treachery had passed into the favour of the conquering William,
      and received, with the widow of a Norman, many lands in Devonshire, to the
      Cup purchased for Geoffrey Caradoc; present Earl of Valleys, by
      subscription of his Devonshire tenants on the occasion of his marriage
      with the Lady Gertrude Semmering&mdash;no insignia were absent, save the
      family portraits in the gallery of Valleys House in London. There was even
      an ancient duplicate of that yellow tattered scroll royally, reconfirming
      lands and title to John, the most distinguished of all the Caradocs, who
      had unfortunately neglected to be born in wedlock, by one of those
      humorous omissions to be found in the genealogies of most old families.
      Yes, it was there, almost cynically hung in a corner; for this incident,
      though no doubt a burning question in the fifteenth century, was now but
      staple for an ironical little tale, in view of the fact that descendants
      of John&rsquo;s &lsquo;own&rsquo; brother Edmund were undoubtedly to be found among the
      cottagers of a parish not far distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Light, glancing from the suits of armour to the tiger skins beneath them,
      brought from India but a year ago by Bertie Caradoc, the younger son,
      seemed recording, how those, who had once been foremost by virtue of that
      simple law of Nature which crowns the adventuring and strong, now being
      almost washed aside out of the main stream of national life, were
      compelled to devise adventure, lest they should lose belief in their own
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unsparing light of that first half-hour of summer morning recorded
      many other changes, wandering from austere tapestries to the velvety
      carpets, and dragging from the contrast sure proof of a common sense which
      denied to the present Earl and Countess the asceticisms of the past. And
      then it seemed to lose interest in this critical journey, as though
      longing to clothe all in witchery. For the sun had risen, and through the
      Eastern windows came pouring its level and mysterious joy. And with it,
      passing in at an open lattice, came a wild bee to settle among the flowers
      on the table athwart the Eastern end, used when there was only a small
      party in the house. The hours fled on silent, till the sun was high, and
      the first visitors came&mdash;three maids, rosy, not silent, bringing
      brushes. They passed, and were followed by two footmen&mdash;scouts of the
      breakfast brigade, who stood for a moment professionally doing nothing,
      then soberly commenced to set the table. Then came a little girl of six,
      to see if there were anything exciting&mdash;little Ann Shropton, child of
      Sir William Shropton by his marriage with Lady Agatha, and eldest daughter
      of the house, the only one of the four young Caradocs as yet wedded. She
      came on tiptoe, thinking to surprise whatever was there. She had a broad
      little face, and wide frank hazel eyes over a little nose that came out
      straight and sudden. Encircled by a loose belt placed far below the waist
      of her holland frock, as if to symbolize freedom, she seemed to think
      everything in life good fun. And soon she found the exciting thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bumble bee, William. Do you think I could tame it in my little
      glass bog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, Miss Ann; and look out, you&rsquo;ll be stung!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t sting me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;if you say so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time is the motor ordered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with Grandpapa as far as the gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose he says you&rsquo;re not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then I shall go all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might go all the way with him to London! Is Auntie Babs going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think anybody is going with his lordship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, if she were. William!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Uncle Eustace sure to be elected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll be a good Member of Parliament?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Miltoun is very clever, Miss Ann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Charles think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like London. I like here, and I like Cotton, and I like home
      pretty well, and I love Pendridny&mdash;and&mdash;I like Ravensham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship is going to Ravensham to-day on his way up, I heard say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! then he&rsquo;ll see great-granny. William&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Miss Wallace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the doorway a lady with a broad pale patient face said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Ann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Hallo, Simmons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The entering butler replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Miss Ann!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re very sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door banged faintly, and in the great room rose the busy silence of
      those minutes which precede repasts. Suddenly the four men by the
      breakfast fable stood back. Lord Valleys had come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached slowly, reading a blue paper, with his level grey eyes
      divided by a little uncharacteristic frown. He had a tanned yet ruddy,
      decisively shaped face, with crisp hair and moustache beginning to go
      iron-grey&mdash;the face of a man who knows his own mind and is contented
      with that knowledge. His figure too, well-braced and upright, with the
      back of the head carried like a soldier&rsquo;s, confirmed the impression, not
      so much of self-sufficiency, as of the sufficiency of his habits of life
      and thought. And there was apparent about all his movements that peculiar
      unconsciousness of his surroundings which comes to those who live a great
      deal in the public eye, have the material machinery of existence placed
      exactly to their hands, and never need to consider what others think of
      them. Taking his seat, and still perusing the paper, he at once began to
      eat what was put before him; then noticing that his eldest daughter had
      come in and was sitting down beside him, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bore having to go up in such weather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a Cabinet meeting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. This confounded business of the balloons.&rdquo; But the rather anxious
      dark eyes of Agatha&rsquo;s delicate narrow face were taking in the details of a
      tray for keeping dishes warm on a sideboard, and she was thinking: &ldquo;I
      believe that would be better than the ones I&rsquo;ve got, after all. If William
      would only say whether he really likes these large trays better than
      single hot-water dishes!&rdquo; She contrived how-ever to ask in her gentle
      voice&mdash;for all her words and movements were gentle, even a little
      timid, till anything appeared to threaten the welfare of her husband or
      children:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think this war scare good for Eustace&rsquo;s prospects, Father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But her father did not answer; he was greeting a new-comer, a tall,
      fine-looking young man, with dark hair and a fair moustache, between whom
      and himself there was no relationship, yet a certain negative resemblance.
      Claud Fresnay, Viscount Harbinger, was indeed also a little of what is
      called the &lsquo;Norman&rsquo; type&mdash;having a certain firm regularity of
      feature, and a slight aquilinity of nose high up on the bridge&mdash;but
      that which in the elder man seemed to indicate only an unconscious
      acceptance of self as a standard, in the younger man gave an impression at
      once more assertive and more uneasy, as though he were a little afraid of
      not chaffing something all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind him had come in a tall woman, of full figure and fine presence,
      with hair still brown&mdash;Lady Valleys herself. Though her eldest son
      was thirty, she was, herself, still little more than fifty. From her
      voice, manner, and whole personality, one might suspect that she had been
      an acknowledged beauty; but there was now more than a suspicion of
      maturity about her almost jovial face, with its full grey-blue eyes; and
      coarsened complexion. Good comrade, and essentially &lsquo;woman of the world,&rsquo;
      was written on every line of her, and in every tone of her voice. She was
      indeed a figure suggestive of open air and generous living, endowed with
      abundant energy, and not devoid of humour. It was she who answered
      Agatha&rsquo;s remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, my dear, the very best thing possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Harbinger chimed in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Brabrook&rsquo;s going to speak on it. Did you ever hear him, Lady
      Agatha? &lsquo;Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise&mdash;and with me rises the democratic
      principle&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Agatha only smiled, for she was thinking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I let Ann go as far as the gate, she&rsquo;ll only make it a stepping-stone
      to something else to-morrow.&rdquo; Taking no interest in public affairs, her
      inherited craving for command had resorted for expression to a meticulous
      ordering of household matters. It was indeed a cult with her, a passion&mdash;as
      though she felt herself a sort of figurehead to national domesticity; the
      leader of a patriotic movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys, having finished what seemed necessary, arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any message to your mother, Gertrude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wrote last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Miltoun to keep&mdash;an eye on that Mr. Courtier. I heard him speak
      one day&mdash;he&rsquo;s rather good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys, who had not yet sat down, accompanied her husband to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, I&rsquo;ve told Mother about this woman, Geoff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it necessary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think so; I&rsquo;m uneasy&mdash;after all, Mother has some influence
      with Miltoun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys shrugged his shoulders, and slightly squeezing his wife&rsquo;s
      arm, went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though himself vaguely uneasy on that very subject, he was a man who did
      not go to meet disturbance. He had the nerves which seem to be no nerves
      at all&mdash;especially found in those of his class who have much to do
      with horses. He temperamentally regarded the evil of the day as quite
      sufficient to it. Moreover, his eldest son was a riddle that he had long
      given up, so far as women were concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emerging into the outer hall, he lingered a moment, remembering that he
      had not seen his younger and favourite daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Barbara down yet?&rdquo; Hearing that she was not, he slipped into the
      motor coat held for him by Simmons, and stepped out under the white
      portico, decorated by the Caradoc hawks in stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of little Ann reached him, clear and high above the smothered
      whirring of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Grandpapa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys grimaced beneath his crisp moustache&mdash;the word grandpapa
      always fell queerly on the ears of one who was but fifty-six, and by no
      means felt it&mdash;and jerking his gloved hand towards Ann, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send down to the lodge gate for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of little Ann answered loudly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m coming back by myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The car starting, drowned discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys, motoring, somewhat pathetically illustrated the invasion of
      institutions by their destroyer, Science. A supporter of the turf, and not
      long since Master of Foxhounds, most of whose soul (outside politics) was
      in horses, he had been, as it were, compelled by common sense, not only to
      tolerate, but to take up and even press forward the cause of their
      supplanters. His instinct of self-preservation was secretly at work,
      hurrying him to his own destruction; forcing him to persuade himself that
      science and her successive victories over brute nature could be wooed into
      the service of a prestige which rested on a crystallized and stationary
      base. All this keeping pace with the times, this immersion in the results
      of modern discoveries, this speeding-up of existence so that it was all
      surface and little root&mdash;the increasing volatility, cosmopolitanism,
      and even commercialism of his life, on which he rather prided himself as a
      man of the world&mdash;was, with a secrecy too deep for his perception,
      cutting at the aloofness logically demanded of one in his position.
      Stubborn, and not spiritually subtle, though by no means dull in practical
      matters, he was resolutely letting the waters bear him on, holding the
      tiller firmly, without perceiving that he was in the vortex of a
      whirlpool. Indeed, his common sense continually impelled him, against the
      sort of reactionaryism of which his son Miltoun had so much, to that
      easier reactionaryism, which, living on its spiritual capital, makes what
      material capital it can out of its enemy, Progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove the car himself, shrewd and self-contained, sitting easily, with
      his cap well drawn over those steady eyes; and though this unexpected
      meeting of the Cabinet in the Whitsuntide recess was not only a nuisance,
      but gave food for anxiety, he was fully able to enjoy the swift smooth
      movement through the summer air, which met him with such friendly
      sweetness under the great trees of the long avenue. Beside him, little Ann
      was silent, with her legs stuck out rather wide apart. Motoring was a new
      excitement, for at home it was forbidden; and a meditative rapture shone
      in her wide eyes above her sudden little nose. Only once she spoke, when
      close to the lodge the car slowed down, and they passed the lodge-keeper&rsquo;s
      little daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Susie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer, but the look on Susie&rsquo;s small pale face was so humble
      and adoring that Lord Valleys, not a very observant man, noticed it with a
      sort of satisfaction. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he thought, somewhat irrelevantly, &ldquo;the
      country is sound at heart!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      At Ravensham House on the borders of Richmond Park, suburban seat of the
      Casterley family, ever since it became usual to have a residence within
      easy driving distance of Westminster&mdash;in a large conservatory
      adjoining the hall, Lady Casterley stood in front of some Japanese lilies.
      She was a slender, short old woman, with an ivory-coloured face, a thin
      nose, and keen eyes half-veiled by delicate wrinkled lids. Very still, in
      her grey dress, and with grey hair, she gave the impression of a little
      figure carved out of fine, worn steel. Her firm, spidery hand held a
      letter written in free somewhat sprawling style:
    </p>
    <p>
      MONKLAND COURT, &ldquo;DEVON. &ldquo;MY DEAR, MOTHER,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geoffrey is motoring up to-morrow. He&rsquo;ll look in on you on the way if he
      can. This new war scare has taken him up. I shan&rsquo;t be in Town myself till
      Miltoun&rsquo;s election is over. The fact is, I daren&rsquo;t leave him down here
      alone. He sees his &lsquo;Anonyma&rsquo; every day. That Mr. Courtier, who wrote the
      book against War&mdash;rather cool for a man who&rsquo;s been a soldier of
      fortune, don&rsquo;t you think?&mdash;is staying at the inn, working for the
      Radical. He knows her, too&mdash;and, one can only hope, for Miltoun&rsquo;s
      sake, too well&mdash;an attractive person, with red moustaches, rather
      nice and mad. Bertie has just come down; I must get him to have a talk
      with Miltoun, and see if he cant find out how the land lies. One can trust
      Bertie&mdash;he&rsquo;s really very astute. I must say, that she&rsquo;s quite a
      sweet-looking woman; but absolutely nothing&rsquo;s known of her here except
      that she divorced her husband. How does one find out about people?
      Miltoun&rsquo;s being so extraordinarily strait-laced makes it all the more
      awkward. The earnestness of this rising generation is most remarkable. I
      don&rsquo;t remember taking such a serious view of life in my youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley lowered the coronetted sheet of paper. The ghost of a
      grimace haunted her face&mdash;she had not forgotten her daughter&rsquo;s youth.
      Raising the letter again, she read on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Geoffrey and I feel years younger than either Miltoun or Agatha,
      though we did produce them. One doesn&rsquo;t feel it with Bertie or Babs,
      luckily. The war scare is having an excellent effect on Miltoun&rsquo;s
      candidature. Claud Harbinger is with us, too, working for Miltoun; but, as
      a matter of fact, I think he&rsquo;s after Babs. It&rsquo;s rather melancholy, when
      you think that Babs isn&rsquo;t quite twenty&mdash;still, one can&rsquo;t expect
      anything else, I suppose, with her looks; and Claud is rather a fine
      specimen. They talk of him a lot now; he&rsquo;s quite coming to the fore among
      the young Tories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley again lowered the letter, and stood listening. A prolonged,
      muffled sound as of distant cheering and groans had penetrated the great
      conservatory, vibrating among the pale petals of the lilies and setting
      free their scent in short waves of perfume. She passed into the hall;
      where, stood an old man with sallow face and long white whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that noise, Clifton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A posse of Socialists, my lady, on their way to Putney to hold a
      demonstration; the people are hooting them. They&rsquo;ve got blocked just
      outside the gates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they making speeches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are talking some kind of rant, my lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and hear them. Give me my black stick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Above the velvet-dark, flat-toughed cedar trees, which rose like pagodas
      of ebony on either side of the drive, the sky hung lowering in one great
      purple cloud, endowed with sinister life by a single white beam striking
      up into it from the horizon. Beneath this canopy of cloud a small phalanx
      of dusty, dishevelled-looking men and women were drawn up in the road,
      guarding, and encouraging with cheers, a tall, black-coated orator. Before
      and behind this phalanx, a little mob of men and boys kept up an
      accompaniment of groans and jeering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley and her &lsquo;major-domo&rsquo; stood six paces inside the scrolled
      iron gates, and watched. The slight, steel-coloured figure with
      steel-coloured hair, was more arresting in its immobility than all the
      vociferations and gestures of the mob. Her eyes alone moved under their
      half-drooped lids; her right hand clutched tightly the handle of her
      stick. The speaker&rsquo;s voice rose in shrill protest against the exploitation
      of &lsquo;the people&rsquo;; it sank in ironical comment on Christianity; it demanded
      passionately to be free from the continuous burden of &lsquo;this insensate
      militarist taxation&rsquo;; it threatened that the people would take things info
      their own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley turned her head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is talking nonsense, Clifton. It is going to rain. I shall go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under the stone porch she paused. The purple cloud had broken; a blind
      fury of rain was deluging the fast-scattering crowd. A faint smile came on
      Lady Casterley&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will do them good to have their ardour damped a little. You will get
      wet, Clifton&mdash;hurry! I expect Lord Valleys to dinner. Have a room got
      ready for him to dress. He&rsquo;s motoring from Monkland.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a very high, white-panelled room, with but little furniture, Lord
      Valleys greeted his mother-in-law respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Motored up in nine hours, Ma&rsquo;am&mdash;not bad going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you came. When is Miltoun&rsquo;s election?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the twenty-ninth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity! He should be away from Monkland, with that&mdash;anonymous woman
      living there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes; you&rsquo;ve heard of her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley replied sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too easy-going, Geoffrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These war scares,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are getting a bore. Can&rsquo;t quite make out
      what the feeling of the country is about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley rose:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has none. When war comes, the feeling will be all right. It always is.
      Give me your arm. Are you hungry?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lord Valleys spoke of war, he spoke as one who, since he arrived at
      years of discretion, had lived within the circle of those who direct the
      destinies of States. It was for him&mdash;as for the lilies in the great
      glass house&mdash;impossible to see with the eyes, or feel with the
      feelings of a flower of the garden outside. Soaked in the best prejudices
      and manners of his class, he lived a life no more shut off from the
      general than was to be expected. Indeed, in some sort, as a man of facts
      and common sense, he was fairly in touch with the opinion of the average
      citizen. He was quite genuine when he said that he believed he knew what
      the people wanted better than those who prated on the subject; and no
      doubt he was right, for temperamentally he was nearer to them than their
      own leaders, though he would not perhaps have liked to be told so. His
      man-of-the-world, political shrewdness had been superimposed by life on a
      nature whose prime strength was its practicality and lack of imagination.
      It was his business to be efficient, but not strenuous, or desirous of
      pushing ideas to their logical conclusions; to be neither narrow nor
      puritanical, so long as the shell of &lsquo;good form&rsquo; was preserved intact; to
      be a liberal landlord up to the point of not seriously damaging his
      interests; to be well-disposed towards the arts until those arts revealed
      that which he had not before perceived; it was his business to have light
      hands, steady eyes, iron nerves, and those excellent manners that have no
      mannerisms. It was his nature to be easy-going as a husband; indulgent as
      a father; careful and straightforward as a politician; and as a man,
      addicted to pleasure, to work, and to fresh air. He admired, and was fond
      of his wife, and had never regretted his marriage. He had never perhaps
      regretted anything, unless it were that he had not yet won the Derby, or
      quite succeeded in getting his special strain of blue-ticked pointers to
      breed absolutely true to type. His mother-in-law he respected, as one
      might respect a principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was indeed in the personality of that little old lady the tremendous
      force of accumulated decision&mdash;the inherited assurance of one whose
      prestige had never been questioned; who, from long immunity, and a certain
      clear-cut matter-of-factness, bred by the habit of command, had indeed
      lost the power of perceiving that her prestige ever could be questioned.
      Her knowledge of her own mind was no ordinary piece of learning, had not,
      in fact, been learned at all, but sprang full-fledged from an active
      dominating temperament. Fortified by the necessity, common to her class,
      of knowing thoroughly the more patent side of public affairs; armoured by
      the tradition of a culture demanded by leadership; inspired by ideas, but
      always the same ideas; owning no master, but in servitude to her own
      custom of leading, she had a mind, formidable as the two-edged swords
      wielded by her ancestors the Fitz-Harolds, at Agincourt or Poitiers&mdash;a
      mind which had ever instinctively rejected that inner knowledge of herself
      or of the selves of others; produced by those foolish practices of
      introspection, contemplation, and understanding, so deleterious to
      authority. If Lord Valleys was the body of the aristocratic machine, Lady
      Casterley was the steel spring inside it. All her life studiously
      unaffected and simple in attire; of plain and frugal habit; an early
      riser; working at something or other from morning till night, and as
      little worn-out at seventy-eight as most women of fifty, she had only one
      weak spot&mdash;and that was her strength&mdash;blindness as to the nature
      and size of her place in the scheme of things. She was a type, a force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wonderfully well she went with the room in which they were dining, whose
      grey walls, surmounted by a deep frieze painted somewhat in the style of
      Fragonard, contained many nymphs and roses now rather dim; with the
      furniture, too, which had a look of having survived into times not its
      own. On the tables were no flowers, save five lilies in an old silver
      chalice; and on the wall over the great sideboard a portrait of the late
      Lord Casterley.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Miltoun is taking his own line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble. He suffers from swollen principles&mdash;only wish he
      could keep them out of his speeches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him be; and get him away from that woman as soon as his election&rsquo;s
      over. What is her real name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. something Lees Noel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has she been there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a year, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t know anything about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys raised his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Lady Casterley; &ldquo;exactly! You&rsquo;re letting the thing drift. I
      shall go down myself. I suppose Gertrude can have me? What has that Mr.
      Courtier to do with this good lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys smiled. In this smile was the whole of his polite and
      easy-going philosophy. &ldquo;I am no meddler,&rdquo; it seemed to say; and at sight
      of that smile Lady Casterley tightened her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a firebrand,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I read that book of his against War&mdash;most
      inflammatory. Aimed at Grant-and Rosenstern, chiefly. I&rsquo;ve just seen, one
      of the results, outside my own gates. A mob of anti-War agitators.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys controlled a yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? I&rsquo;d no idea Courtier had any influence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dangerous. Most idealists are negligible-his book was clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to goodness we could see the last of these scares, they only make
      both countries look foolish,&rdquo; muttered Lord Valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley raised her glass, full of a bloody red wine. &ldquo;The war would
      save us,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War is no joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be the beginning of a better state of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should get the lead again as a nation, and Democracy would be put back
      fifty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys made three little heaps of salt, and paused to count them;
      then, with a slight uplifting of his eyebrows, which seemed to doubt what
      he was going to say, he murmured: &ldquo;I should have said that we were all
      democrats nowadays.... What is it, Clifton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your chauffeur would like to know, what time you will have the car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Directly after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twenty minutes later, he was turning through the scrolled iron gates into
      the road for London. It was falling dark; and in the tremulous sky clouds
      were piled up, and drifted here and there with a sort of endless lack of
      purpose. No direction seemed to have been decreed unto their wings. They
      had met together in the firmament like a flock of giant magpies crossing
      and re-crossing each others&rsquo; flight. The smell of rain was in the air. The
      car raised no dust, but bored swiftly on, searching out the road with its
      lamps. On Putney Bridge its march was stayed by a string of waggons. Lord
      Valleys looked to right and left. The river reflected the thousand lights
      of buildings piled along her sides, lamps of the embankments, lanterns of
      moored barges. The sinuous pallid body of this great Creature, for ever
      gliding down to the sea, roused in his mind no symbolic image. He had had
      to do with her, years back, at the Board of Trade, and knew her for what
      she was, extremely dirty, and getting abominably thin just where he would
      have liked her plump. Yet, as he lighted a cigar, there came to him a
      queer feeling&mdash;as if he were in the presence of a woman he was fond
      of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to God,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;nothing&rsquo;ll come of these scares!&rdquo; The car
      glided on into the long road, swarming with traffic, towards the
      fashionable heart of London. Outside stationers&rsquo; shops, however, the
      posters of evening papers were of no reassuring order.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    &lsquo;THE PLOT THICKENS.&rsquo;
                     &lsquo;MORE REVELATIONS.&rsquo;
               &lsquo;GRAVE SITUATION THREATENED.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      And before each poster could be seen a little eddy in the stream of the
      passers-by&mdash;formed by persons glancing at the news, and disengaging
      themselves, to press on again. The Earl of Valleys caught himself
      wondering what they thought of it! What was passing behind those pale
      rounds of flesh turned towards the posters?
    </p>
    <p>
      Did they think at all, these men and women in the street? What was their
      attitude towards this vaguely threatened cataclysm? Face after face,
      stolid and apathetic, expressed nothing, no active desire, certainly no
      enthusiasm, hardly any dread. Poor devils! The thing, after all, was no
      more within their control than it was within the power of ants to stop the
      ruination of their ant-heap by some passing boy! It was no doubt quite
      true, that the people had never had much voice in the making of war. And
      the words of a Radical weekly, which as an impartial man he always forced
      himself to read, recurred to him. &ldquo;Ignorant of the facts, hypnotized by
      the words &lsquo;Country&rsquo; and &lsquo;Patriotism&rsquo;; in the grip of mob-instinct and
      inborn prejudice against the foreigner; helpless by reason of his
      patience, stoicism, good faith, and confidence in those above him;
      helpless by reason of his snobbery, mutual distrust, carelessness for the
      morrow, and lack of public spirit-in the face of War how impotent and to
      be pitied is the man in the street!&rdquo; That paper, though clever, always
      seemed to him intolerably hifalutin!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was doubtful whether he would get to Ascot this year. And his mind flew
      for a moment to his promising two-year-old Casetta; then dashed almost
      violently, as though in shame, to the Admiralty and the doubt whether they
      were fully alive to possibilities. He himself occupied a softer spot of
      Government, one of those almost nominal offices necessary to qualify into
      the Cabinet certain tried minds, for whom no more strenuous post can for
      the moment be found. From the Admiralty again his thoughts leaped to his
      mother-in-law. Wonderful old woman! What a statesman she would have made!
      Too reactionary! Deuce of a straight line she had taken about Mrs. Lees
      Noel! And with a connoisseur&rsquo;s twinge of pleasure he recollected that
      lady&rsquo;s face and figure seen that morning as he passed her cottage.
      Mysterious or not, the woman was certainly attractive! Very graceful head
      with its dark hair waved back from the middle over either temple&mdash;very
      charming figure, no lumber of any sort! Bouquet about her! Some story or
      other, no doubt&mdash;no affair of his! Always sorry for that sort of
      woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      A regiment of Territorials returning from a march stayed the progress of
      his car. He leaned forward watching them with much the same contained,
      shrewd, critical look he would have bent on a pack of hounds. All the
      mistiness and speculation in his mind was gone now. Good stamp of man,
      would give a capital account of themselves! Their faces, flushed by a day
      in the open, were masked with passivity, or, with a half-aggressive,
      half-jocular self-consciousness; they were clearly not troubled by
      abstract doubts, or any visions of the horrors of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone raised a cheer &lsquo;for the Terriers!&rsquo; Lord Valleys saw round him a
      little sea of hats, rising and falling, and heard a sound, rather shrill
      and tentative, swell into hoarse, high clamour, and suddenly die out.
      &ldquo;Seem keen enough!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Very little does it! Plenty of fighting
      spirit in the country.&rdquo; And again a thrill of pleasure shot through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the last soldier passed, his car slowly forged its way through
      the straggling crowd, pressing on behind the regiment&mdash;men of all
      ages, youths, a few women, young girls, who turned their eyes on him with
      a negligent stare as if their lives were too remote to permit them to take
      interest in this passing man at ease.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      At Monkland, that same hour, in the little whitewashed &lsquo;withdrawing-room&rsquo;
      of a thatched, whitewashed cottage, two men sat talking, one on either
      side of the hearth; and in a low chair between them a dark-eyed woman
      leaned back, watching, the tips of her delicate thin fingers pressed
      together, or held out transparent towards the fire. A log, dropping now
      and then, turned up its glowing underside; and the firelight and the
      lamplight seemed so to have soaked into the white walls that a wan warmth
      exuded. Silvery dun moths, fluttering in from the dark garden, kept
      vibrating, like spun shillings, over a jade-green bowl of crimson roses;
      and there was a scent, as ever in that old thatched cottage, of woodsmoke,
      flowers, and sweetbriar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man on the left was perhaps forty, rather above middle height,
      vigorous, active, straight, with blue eyes and a sanguine face that glowed
      on small provocation. His hair was very bright, almost red, and his fiery
      moustaches which descended to the level of his chin, like Don Quixote&rsquo;s
      seemed bristling and charging.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man on the right was nearer thirty, evidently tall, wiry, and very
      thin. He sat rather crumpled, in his low armchair, with hands clasped
      round a knee; and a little crucified smile haunted the lips of his lean
      face, which, with its parchmenty, tanned, shaven cheeks, and deep-set,
      very living eyes, had a certain beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two men, so extravagantly unlike, looked at each other like
      neighbouring dogs, who, having long decided that they are better apart,
      suddenly find that they have met at some spot where they cannot possibly
      have a fight. And the woman watched; the owner, as it were, of one, but
      who, from sheer love of dogs, had always stroked and patted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Mr. Courtier,&rdquo; said the younger man, whose dry, ironic voice, like
      his smile, seemed defending the fervid spirit in his eyes; &ldquo;all you say
      only amounts, you see, to a defence of the so-called Liberal spirit; and,
      forgive my candour, that spirit, being an importation from the realms of
      philosophy and art, withers the moment it touches practical affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man with the red moustaches laughed; the sound was queer&mdash;at once
      so genial and so sardonic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well put!&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;And far be it from me to gainsay. But since
      compromise is the very essence of politics, high-priests of caste and
      authority, like you, Lord Miltoun, are every bit as much out of it as any
      Liberal professor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agree or not, your position towards public affairs is very like the
      Church&rsquo;s attitude towards marriage and divorce; as remote from the
      realities of life as the attitude of the believer in Free Love, and not
      more likely to catch on. The death of your point of view lies in itself&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      too dried-up and far from things ever to understand them. If you don&rsquo;t
      understand you can never rule. You might just as well keep your hands in
      your pockets, as go into politics with your notions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear we must continue to agree to differ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; perhaps I do pay you too high a compliment. After all, you are a
      patrician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak in riddles, Mr. Courtier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dark-eyed woman stirred; her hands gave a sort of flutter, as though
      in deprecation of acerbity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising at once, and speaking in a deferential voice, the elder man said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re tiring Mrs. Noel. Good-night, Audrey, It&rsquo;s high time I was off.&rdquo;
       Against the darkness of the open French window, he turned round to fire a
      parting shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I meant, Lord Miltoun, was that your class is the driest and most
      practical in the State&mdash;it&rsquo;s odd if it doesn&rsquo;t save you from a poet&rsquo;s
      dreams. Good-night!&rdquo; He passed out on to the lawn, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man sat unmoving; the glow of the fire had caught his face, so
      that a spirit seemed clinging round his lips, gleaming out of his eyes.
      Suddenly he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe that, Mrs. Noel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer Audrey Noel smiled, then rose and went over to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at my dear toad! It comes here every evening!&rdquo; On a flagstone of the
      verandah, in the centre of the stream of lamplight, sat a little golden
      toad. As Miltoun came to look, it waddled to one side, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How peaceful your garden is!&rdquo; he said; then taking her hand, he very
      gently raised it to his lips, and followed his opponent out into the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly peace brooded over that garden. The Night seemed listening&mdash;all
      lights out, all hearts at rest. It watched, with a little white star for
      every tree, and roof, and slumbering tired flower, as a mother watches her
      sleeping child, leaning above him and counting with her love every hair of
      his head, and all his tiny tremors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Argument seemed child&rsquo;s babble indeed under the smile of Night. And the
      face of the woman, left alone at her window, was a little like the face of
      this warm, sweet night. It was sensitive, harmonious; and its harmony was
      not, as in some faces, cold&mdash;but seemed to tremble and glow and
      flutter, as though it were a spirit which had found its place of resting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her garden,&mdash;all velvety grey, with black shadows beneath the
      yew-trees, the white flowers alone seemed to be awake, and to look at her
      wistfully. The trees stood dark and still. Not even the night birds
      stirred. Alone, the little stream down in the bottom raised its voice,
      privileged when day voices were hushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not in Audrey Noel to deny herself to any spirit that was abroad;
      to repel was an art she did not practise. But this night, though the
      Spirit of Peace hovered so near, she did not seem to know it. Her hands
      trembled, her cheeks were burning; her breast heaved, and sighs fluttered
      from her lips, just parted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Eustace Cardoc, Viscount Miltoun, had lived a very lonely life, since he
      first began to understand the peculiarities of existence. With the
      exception of Clifton, his grandmother&rsquo;s &lsquo;majordomo,&rsquo; he made, as a small
      child, no intimate friend. His nurses, governesses, tutors, by their own
      confession did not understand him, finding that he took himself with
      unnecessary seriousness; a little afraid, too, of one whom they discovered
      to be capable of pushing things to the point of enduring pain in silence.
      Much of that early time was passed at Ravensham, for he had always been
      Lady Casterley&rsquo;s favourite grandchild. She recognized in him the
      purposeful austerity which had somehow been omitted from the composition
      of her daughter. But only to Clifton, then a man of fifty with a great
      gravity and long black whiskers, did Eustace relieve his soul. &ldquo;I tell you
      this, Clifton,&rdquo; he would say, sitting on the sideboard, or the arm of the
      big chair in Clifton&rsquo;s room, or wandering amongst the raspberries,
      &ldquo;because you are my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Clifton, with his head a little on one side, and a sort of wise
      concern at his &lsquo;friend&rsquo;s&rsquo; confidences, which were sometimes of an
      embarrassing description, would answer now and then: &ldquo;Of course, my lord,&rdquo;
       but more often: &ldquo;Of course, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was in this friendship something fine and suitable, neither of these
      &lsquo;friends&rsquo; taking or suffering liberties, and both being interested in
      pigeons, which they would stand watching with a remarkable attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      In course of time, following the tradition of his family, Eustace went to
      Harrow. He was there five years&mdash;always one of those boys a little
      out at wrists and ankles, who may be seen slouching, solitary, along the
      pavement to their own haunts, rather dusty, and with one shoulder slightly
      raised above the other, from the habit of carrying something beneath one
      arm. Saved from being thought a &lsquo;smug,&rsquo; by his title, his lack of any
      conspicuous scholastic ability, his obvious independence of what was
      thought of him, and a sarcastic tongue, which no one was eager to
      encounter, he remained the ugly duckling who refused to paddle properly in
      the green ponds of Public School tradition. He played games so badly that
      in sheer self-defence his fellows permitted him to play without them. Of
      &lsquo;fives&rsquo; they made an exception, for in this he attained much proficiency,
      owing to a certain windmill-like quality of limb. He was noted too for
      daring chemical experiments, of which he usually had one or two brewing,
      surreptitiously at first, and afterwards by special permission of his
      house-master, on the principle that if a room must smell, it had better
      smell openly. He made few friendships, but these were lasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Latin was so poor, and his Greek verse so vile, that all had been
      surprised when towards the finish of his career he showed a very
      considerable power of writing and speaking his own language. He left
      school without a pang. But when in the train he saw the old Hill and the
      old spire on the top of it fading away from him, a lump rose in his
      throat, he swallowed violently two or three times, and, thrusting himself
      far back into the carriage corner, appeared to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Oxford, he was happier, but still comparatively lonely; remaining, so
      long as custom permitted, in lodgings outside his College, and clinging
      thereafter to remote, panelled rooms high up, overlooking the gardens and
      a portion of the city wall. It was at Oxford that he first developed that
      passion for self-discipline which afterwards distinguished him. He took up
      rowing; and, though thoroughly unsuited by nature to this pastime, secured
      himself a place in his College &lsquo;torpid.&rsquo; At the end of a race he was
      usually supported from his stretcher in a state of extreme extenuation,
      due to having pulled the last quarter of the course entirely with his
      spirit. The same craving for self-discipline guided him in the choice of
      Schools; he went out in &lsquo;Greats,&rsquo; for which, owing to his indifferent
      mastery of Greek and Latin, he was the least fitted. With enormous labour
      he took a very good degree. He carried off besides, the highest
      distinctions of the University for English Essays. The ordinary circles of
      College life knew nothing of him. Not once in the whole course of his
      University career, was he the better for wine. He, did not hunt; he never
      talked of women, and none talked of women in his presence. But now and
      then he was visited by those gusts which come to the ascetic, when all
      life seemed suddenly caught up and devoured by a flame burning night and
      day, and going out mercifully, he knew not why, like a blown candle.
      However unsocial in the proper sense of the word, he by no means lacked
      company in these Oxford days. He knew many, both dons and undergraduates.
      His long stride, and determined absence of direction, had severely tried
      all those who could stomach so slow a pastime as walking for the sake of
      talking. The country knew him&mdash;though he never knew the country&mdash;from
      Abingdon to Bablock Hythe. His name stood high, too, at the Union, where
      he made his mark during his first term in a debate on a &lsquo;Censorship of
      Literature&rsquo; which he advocated with gloom, pertinacity, and a certain
      youthful brilliance that might well have carried the day, had not an
      Irishman got up and pointed out the danger hanging over the Old Testament.
      To that he had retorted: &ldquo;Better, sir, it should run a risk than have no
      risk to run.&rdquo; From which moment he was notable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed up four years, and went down with a sense of bewilderment and
      loss. The matured verdict of Oxford on this child of hers, was &ldquo;Eustace
      Miltoun! Ah! Queer bird! Will make his mark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had about this time an interview with his father which confirmed the
      impression each had formed of the other. It took place in the library at
      Monkland Court, on a late November afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of eight candles in thin silver candlesticks, four on either
      side of the carved stone hearth, illumined that room. Their gentle
      radiance penetrated but a little way into the great dark space lined with
      books, panelled and floored with black oak, where the acrid fragrance of
      leather and dried roseleaves seemed to drench the very soul with the aroma
      of the past. Above the huge fireplace, with light falling on one side of
      his shaven face, hung a portrait&mdash;painter unknown&mdash;of that
      Cardinal Caradoc who suffered for his faith in the sixteenth century.
      Ascetic, crucified, with a little smile clinging to the lips and deep-set
      eyes, he presided, above the bluefish flames of a log fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father and son found some difficulty in beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of those two felt as though he were in the presence of someone else&rsquo;s
      very near relation. They had, in fact, seen extremely little of each
      other, and not seen that little long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys uttered the first remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear fellow, what are you going to do now? I think we can make
      certain of this seat down here, if you like to stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun had answered: &ldquo;Thanks, very much; I don&rsquo;t think so at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the thin fume of his cigar Lord Valleys watched that long figure
      sunk deep in the chair opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t begin too soon; unless you think you ought
      to go round the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I can become a man of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys gave a rather disconcerted laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in politics you can&rsquo;t pick up as you go along,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look older.&rdquo; A faint line, as of contemplation, rose between his
      eyes. Was it fancy that a little smile was hovering about Miltoun&rsquo;s lips?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a foolish theory,&rdquo; came from those lips, &ldquo;that one must know the
      conditions first. I want to give at least five years to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;Waste of time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d know
      more at the end of it, if you went into the House at once. You take the
      matter too seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For fully a minute Lord Valleys made no answer; he felt almost ruffled.
      Waiting till the sensation had passed, he said: &ldquo;Well, my dear fellow, as
      you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun&rsquo;s apprenticeship to the profession of politics was served in a
      slum settlement; on his father&rsquo;s estates; in Chambers at the Temple; in
      expeditions to Germany, America, and the British Colonies; in work at
      elections; and in two forlorn hopes to capture a constituency which could
      be trusted not to change its principles. He read much, slowly, but with
      conscientious tenacity, poetry, history, and works on philosophy,
      religion, and social matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiction, and especially foreign fiction, he did not care for. With the
      utmost desire to be wide and impartial, he sucked in what ministered to
      the wants of his nature, rejecting unconsciously all that by its
      unsuitability endangered the flame of his private spirit. What he read, in
      fact, served only to strengthen those profounder convictions which arose
      from his temperament. With a contempt of the vulgar gewgaws of wealth and
      rank he combined a humble but intense and growing conviction of his
      capacity for leadership, of a spiritual superiority to those whom he
      desired to benefit. There was no trace, indeed, of the common Pharisee in
      Miltoun, he was simple and direct; but his eyes, his gestures, the whole
      man, proclaimed the presence of some secret spring of certainty, some
      fundamental well into which no disturbing glimmers penetrated. He was not
      devoid of wit, but he was devoid of that kind of wit which turns its eyes
      inward, and sees something of the fun that lies in being what you are.
      Miltoun saw the world and all the things thereof shaped like spires&mdash;even
      when they were circles. He seemed to have no sense that the Universe was
      equally compounded of those two symbols, whose point of reconciliation had
      not yet been discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was he, then, when the Member for his native division was made a
      peer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had reached the age of thirty without ever having been in love, leading
      a life of almost savage purity, with one solitary breakdown. Women were
      afraid of him. And he was perhaps a little afraid of woman. She was in
      theory too lovely and desirable&mdash;the half-moon in a summer sky; in
      practice too cloying, or too harsh. He had an affection for Barbara, his
      younger sister; but to his mother, his grandmother, or his elder sister
      Agatha, he had never felt close. It was indeed amusing to see Lady Valleys
      with her first-born. Her fine figure, the blown roses of her face, her
      grey-blue eyes which had a slight tendency to roll, as though amusement
      just touched with naughtiness bubbled behind them; were reduced to a
      queer, satirical decorum in Miltoun&rsquo;s presence. Thoughts and sayings
      verging on the risky were characteristic of her robust physique, of her
      soul which could afford to express almost all that occurred to it. Miltoun
      had never, not even as a child, given her his confidence. She bore him no
      resentment, being of that large, generous build in body and mind, rarely&mdash;never
      in her class&mdash;associated with the capacity for feeling aggrieved or
      lowered in any estimation, even its own. He was, and always had been, an
      odd boy, and there was an end of it! Nothing had perhaps so disconcerted
      Lady Valleys as his want of behaviour in regard to women. She felt it
      abnormal, just as she recognized the essential if duly veiled normality of
      her husband and younger son. It was this feeling which made her realize
      almost more vividly than she had time for, in the whirl of politics and
      fashion, the danger of his friendship with this lady to whom she alluded
      so discreetly as &lsquo;Anonyma.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pure chance had been responsible for the inception of that friendship.
      Going one December afternoon to the farmhouse of a tenant, just killed by
      a fall from his horse, Miltoun had found the widow in a state of
      bewildered grief, thinly cloaked in the manner of one who had almost lost
      the power to express her feelings, and quite lost it in presence of &lsquo;the
      gentry.&rsquo; Having assured the poor soul that she need have no fear about her
      tenancy, he was just leaving, when he met, in the stone-flagged entrance,
      a lady in a fur cap and jacket, carrying in her arms a little crying boy,
      bleeding from a cut on the forehead. Taking him from her and placing him
      on a table in the parlour, Miltoun looked at this lady, and saw that she
      was extremely grave, and soft, and charming. He inquired of her whether
      the mother should be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing, not just now: let&rsquo;s wash it, and bind it up first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together therefore they washed and bound up the cut. Having finished, she
      looked at Miltoun, and seemed to say: &ldquo;You would do the telling so much
      better than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He, therefore, told the mother and was rewarded by a little smile from the
      grave lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that meeting he took away the knowledge of her name, Audrey Lees
      Noel, and the remembrance of a face, whose beauty, under a cap of
      squirrel&rsquo;s fur, pursued him. Some days later passing by the village green,
      he saw her entering a garden gate. On this occasion he had asked her
      whether she would like her cottage re-thatched; an inspection of the roof
      had followed; he had stayed talking a long time. Accustomed to women&mdash;over
      the best of whom, for all their grace and lack of affectation, high-caste
      life had wrapped the manner which seems to take all things for granted&mdash;there
      was a peculiar charm for Miltoun in this soft, dark-eyed lady who
      evidently lived quite out of the world, and had so poignant, and shy, a
      flavour. Thus from a chance seed had blossomed swiftly one of those rare
      friendships between lonely people, which can in short time fill great
      spaces of two lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day she asked him: &ldquo;You know about me, I suppose?&rdquo; Miltoun made a
      motion of his head, signifying that he did. His informant had been the
      vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am told, her story is a sad one&mdash;a divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that she has been divorced, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the fraction of a second the vicar perhaps had hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no&mdash;no. Sinned against, I am sure. A nice woman, so far as I
      have seen; though I&rsquo;m afraid not one of my congregation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this, Miltoun, in whom chivalry had already been awakened, was
      content. When she asked if he knew her story, he would not for the world
      have had her rake up what was painful. Whatever that story, she could not
      have been to blame. She had begun already to be shaped by his own spirit;
      had become not a human being as it was, but an expression of his
      aspiration....
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third evening after his passage of arms with Courtier, he was again
      at her little white cottage sheltering within its high garden walls.
      Smothered in roses, and with a black-brown thatch overhanging the
      old-fashioned leaded panes of the upper windows, it had an air of hiding
      from the world. Behind, as though on guard, two pine trees spread their
      dark boughs over the outhouses, and in any south-west wind could be heard
      speaking gravely about the weather. Tall lilac bushes flanked the garden,
      and a huge lime-tree in the adjoining field sighed and rustled, or on
      still days let forth the drowsy hum of countless small dusky bees who
      frequented that green hostelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her altering a dress, sitting over it in her peculiar delicate
      fashion&mdash;as if all objects whatsoever, dresses, flowers, books,
      music, required from her the same sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come from a long day&rsquo;s electioneering, had been heckled at two
      meetings, and was still sore from the experience. To watch her, to be
      soothed, and ministered to by her had never been so restful; and stretched
      out in a long chair he listened to her playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the hill a Pierrot moon was slowly moving up in a sky the colour of
      grey irises. And in a sort of trance Miltoun stared at the burnt-out star,
      travelling in bright pallor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the moor a sea of shallow mist was rolling; and the trees in the
      valley, like browsing cattle, stood knee-deep in whiteness, with all the
      air above them wan from an innumerable rain as of moondust, falling into
      that white sea. Then the moon passed behind the lime-tree, so that a great
      lighted Chinese lantern seemed to hang blue-black from the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, jarring and shivering the music, came a sound of hooting. It
      swelled, died away, and swelled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has spoiled my vision,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mrs. Noel, I have something I want
      to say.&rdquo; But looking down at her, sitting so still, with her hands resting
      on the keys, he was silent in sheer adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice from the door ejaculated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! ma&rsquo;am&mdash;oh! my lord! They&rsquo;re devilling a gentleman on the green!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the immortal Don set out to ring all the bells of merriment, he was
      followed by one clown. Charles Courtier on the other hand had always been
      accompanied by thousands, who really could not understand the conduct of
      this man with no commercial sense. But though he puzzled his
      contemporaries, they did not exactly laugh at him, because it was reported
      that he had really killed some men, and loved some women. They found such
      a combination irresistible, when coupled with an appearance both vigorous
      and gallant. The son of an Oxfordshire clergyman, and mounted on a lost
      cause, he had been riding through the world ever since he was eighteen,
      without once getting out of the saddle. The secret of this endurance lay
      perhaps in his unconsciousness that he was in the saddle at all. It was as
      much his natural seat as office stools to other mortals. He made no
      capital out of errantry, his temperament being far too like his red-gold
      hair, which people compared to flames, consuming all before them. His
      vices were patent; too incurable an optimism; an admiration for beauty
      such as must sometimes have caused him to forget which woman he was most
      in love with; too thin a skin; too hot a heart; hatred of humbug, and
      habitual neglect of his own interest. Unmarried, and with many friends,
      and many enemies, he kept his body like a sword-blade, and his soul always
      at white heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      That one who admitted to having taken part in five wars should be mixing
      in a by-election in the cause of Peace, was not so inconsistent as might
      be supposed; for he had always fought on the losing side, and there seemed
      to him at the moment no side so losing as that of Peace. No great
      politician, he was not an orator, nor even a glib talker; yet a quiet
      mordancy of tongue, and the white-hot look in his eyes, never failed to
      make an impression of some kind on an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, hardly a corner of England where orations on behalf of
      Peace had a poorer chance than the Bucklandbury division. To say that
      Courtier had made himself unpopular with its matter-of-fact, independent,
      stolid, yet quick-tempered population, would be inadequate. He had
      outraged their beliefs, and roused the most profound suspicions. They
      could not, for the life of them, make out what he was at. Though by his
      adventures and his book, &ldquo;Peace-a lost Cause,&rdquo; he was, in London, a
      conspicuous figure, they had naturally never heard of him; and his
      adventure to these parts seemed to them an almost ludicrous example of
      pure idea poking its nose into plain facts&mdash;the idea that nations
      ought to, and could live in peace being so very pure; and the fact that
      they never had, so very plain!
    </p>
    <p>
      At Monkland, which was all Court estate, there were naturally but few
      supporters of Miltoun&rsquo;s opponent, Mr. Humphrey Chilcox, and the reception
      accorded to the champion of Peace soon passed from curiosity to derision,
      from derision to menace, till Courtier&rsquo;s attitude became so defiant, and
      his sentences so heated that he was only saved from a rough handling by
      the influential interposition of the vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet when he began to address them he had felt irresistibly attracted. They
      looked such capital, independent fellows. Waiting for his turn to speak,
      he had marked them down as men after his own heart. For though Courtier
      knew that against an unpopular idea there must always be a majority, he
      never thought so ill of any individual as to suppose him capable of
      belonging to that ill-omened body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely these fine, independent fellows were not to be hoodwinked by the
      jingoes! It had been one more disillusion. He had not taken it lying down;
      neither had his audience. They dispersed without forgiving; they came
      together again without having forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village Inn, a little white building whose small windows were
      overgrown with creepers, had a single guest&rsquo;s bedroom on the upper floor,
      and a little sitting-room where Courtier took his meals. The rest of the
      house was but stone-floored bar with a long wooden bench against the back
      wall, whence nightly a stream of talk would issue, all harsh a&rsquo;s, and
      sudden soft u&rsquo;s; whence too a figure, a little unsteady, would now and
      again emerge, to a chorus of &lsquo;Gude naights,&rsquo; stand still under the
      ash-trees to light his pipe, then move slowly home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on that evening, when the trees, like cattle, stood knee-deep in the
      moon-dust, those who came out from the bar-room did not go away; they hung
      about in the shadows, and were joined by other figures creeping furtively
      through the bright moonlight, from behind the Inn. Presently more figures
      moved up from the lanes and the churchyard path, till thirty or more were
      huddled there, and their stealthy murmur of talk distilled a rare savour
      of illicit joy. Unholy hilarity, indeed, seemed lurking in the deep
      tree-shadow, before the wan Inn, whence from a single lighted window came
      forth the half-chanting sound of a man&rsquo;s voice reading out loud. Laughter
      was smothered, talk whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;m a-practisin&rsquo; his spaches.&rdquo; &ldquo;Smoke the cunnin&rsquo; old vox out!&rdquo; &ldquo;Red
      pepper&rsquo;s the proper stuff.&rdquo; &ldquo;See men sneeze! We&rsquo;ve a-screed up the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as a face showed at the lighted window, a burst of harsh laughter
      broke the hush.
    </p>
    <p>
      He at the window was seen struggling violently to wrench away a bar. The
      laughter swelled to hooting. The prisoner forced his way through, dropped
      to the ground, rose, staggered, and fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice said sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out of the sounds of scuffling and scattering came the whisper: &ldquo;His
      lordship!&rdquo; And the shade under the ash-trees became deserted, save by the
      tall dark figure of a man, and a woman&rsquo;s white shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Mr. Courtier? Are you hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A chuckle rose from the recumbent figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only my knee. The beggars! They precious nearly choked me, though.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bertie Caradoc, leaving the smoking-room at Monkland Court that same
      evening,&mdash;on his way to bed, went to the Georgian corridor, where his
      pet barometer was hanging. To look at the glass had become the nightly
      habit of one who gave all the time he could spare from his profession to
      hunting in the winter and to racing in the summer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hon. Hubert Caradoc, an apprentice to the calling of diplomacy, more
      completely than any living Caradoc embodied the characteristic strength
      and weaknesses of that family. He was of fair height, and wiry build. His
      weathered face, under sleek, dark hair, had regular, rather small
      features, and wore an expression of alert resolution, masked by
      impassivity. Over his inquiring, hazel-grey eyes the lids were almost
      religiously kept half drawn. He had been born reticent, and great, indeed,
      was the emotion under which he suffered when the whole of his eyes were
      visible. His nose was finely chiselled, and had little flesh. His lips,
      covered by a small, dark moustache, scarcely opened to emit his speeches,
      which were uttered in a voice singularly muffled, yet unexpectedly quick.
      The whole personality was that of a man practical, spirited, guarded,
      resourceful, with great power of self-control, who looked at life as if
      she were a horse under him, to whom he must give way just so far as was
      necessary to keep mastery of her. A man to whom ideas were of no value,
      except when wedded to immediate action; essentially neat; demanding to be
      &lsquo;done well,&rsquo; but capable of stoicism if necessary; urbane, yet always in
      readiness to thrust; able only to condone the failings and to
      compassionate the kinds of distress which his own experience had taught
      him to understand. Such was Miltoun&rsquo;s younger brother at the age of
      twenty-six.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having noted that the glass was steady, he was about to seek the stairway,
      when he saw at the farther end of the entrance-hall three figures
      advancing arm-in-arm. Habitually both curious and wary, he waited till
      they came within the radius of a lamp; then, seeing them to be those of
      Miltoun and a footman, supporting between them a lame man, he at once
      hastened forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you put your knee out, sir? Hold on a minute! Get a chair, Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seating the stranger in this chair, Bertie rolled up the trouser, and
      passed his fingers round the knee. There was a sort, of loving-kindness in
      that movement, as of a hand which had in its time felt the joints and
      sinews of innumerable horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;can you stand a bit of a jerk? Catch hold of him behind,
      Eustace. Sit down on the floor, Charles, and hold the legs of the chair.
      Now then!&rdquo; And taking up the foot, he pulled. There was a click, a little
      noise of teeth ground together; and Bertie said: &ldquo;Good man&mdash;shan&rsquo;t
      have to have the vet. to you, this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having conducted their lame guest to a room in the Georgian corridor
      hastily converted to a bedroom, the two brothers presently left him to the
      attentions of the footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old man,&rdquo; said Bertie, as they sought their rooms; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s put paid
      to his name&mdash;won&rsquo;t do you any more harm this journey. Good plucked
      one, though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The report that Courtier was harboured beneath their roof went the round
      of the family before breakfast, through the agency of one whose practice
      it was to know all things, and to see that others partook of that
      knowledge, Little Ann, paying her customary morning visit to her mother&rsquo;s
      room, took her stand with face turned up and hands clasping her belt, and
      began at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Eustace brought a man last night with a wounded leg, and Uncle
      Bertie pulled it out straight. William says that Charles says he only made
      a noise like this&rdquo;&mdash;there was a faint sound of small chumping teeth:
      &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s the man that&rsquo;s staying at the Inn, and the stairs were too
      narrow to carry him up, William says; and if his knee was put out he won&rsquo;t
      be able to walk without a stick for a long time. Can I go to Father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Agatha, who was having her hair brushed, thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure whether belts so low as that are wholesome,&rdquo; murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But little Ann was gone; and her voice could be heard in the dressing-room
      climbing up towards Sir William, who from the sound of his replies, was
      manifestly shaving. When Agatha, who never could resist a legitimate
      opportunity of approaching her husband, looked in, he was alone, and
      rather thoughtful&mdash;a tall man with a solid, steady face and cautious
      eyes, not in truth remarkable except to his own wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow Courtier&rsquo;s caught by the leg,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what your
      Mother will say to an enemy in the camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a freethinker, and rather&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir William, following his own thoughts, interrupted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as well, of course, so far as Miltoun&rsquo;s concerned, to have got him
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Agatha sighed: &ldquo;Well, I suppose we shall have to be nice to him. I&rsquo;ll tell
      Mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir William smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ann will see to that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ann was seeing to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated in the embrasure of the window behind the looking-glass, where Lady
      Valleys was still occupied, she was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He fell out of the window because of the red pepper. Miss Wallace says he
      is a hostage&mdash;what does hostage mean, Granny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When six years ago that word had first fallen on Lady Valleys&rsquo; ears, she
      had thought: &ldquo;Oh! dear! Am I really Granny?&rdquo; It had been a shock, had
      seemed the end of so much; but the matter-of-fact heroism of women, so
      much quicker to accept the inevitable than men, had soon come to her aid,
      and now, unlike her husband, she did not care a bit. For all that she
      answered nothing, partly because it was not necessary to speak in order to
      sustain a conversation with little Ann, and partly because she was deep in
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was injured! Hospitality, of course&mdash;especially since their
      own tenants had committed the outrage! Still, to welcome a man who had
      gone out of his way to come down here and stump the country against her
      own son, was rather a tall order. It might have been worse, no doubt. If;
      for instance, he had been some &lsquo;impossible&rsquo; Nonconformist Radical! This
      Mr. Courtier was a free lance&mdash;rather a well-known man, an
      interesting creature. She must see that he felt &lsquo;at home&rsquo; and comfortable.
      If he were pumped judiciously, no doubt one could find out about this
      woman. Moreover, the acceptance of their &lsquo;salt&rsquo; would silence him
      politically if she knew anything of that type of man, who always had
      something in him of the Arab&rsquo;s creed. Her mind, that of a capable
      administrator, took in all the practical significance of this incident,
      which, although untoward, was not without its comic side to one disposed
      to find zest and humour in everything that did not absolutely run counter
      to her interests and philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of little Ann broke in on her reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Auntie Babs now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; give me a kiss first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Ann thrust up her face, so that its sudden little nose penetrated
      Lady Valleys&rsquo; soft curving lips....
    </p>
    <p>
      When early that same afternoon Courtier, leaning on a stick, passed from
      his room out on to the terrace, he was confronted by three sunlit peacocks
      marching slowly across a lawn towards a statue of Diana. With incredible
      dignity those birds moved, as if never in their lives had they been
      hurried. They seemed indeed to know that when they got there, there would
      be nothing for them to do but to come back again. Beyond them, through the
      tall trees, over some wooded foot-hills of the moorland and a promised
      land of pinkish fields, pasture, and orchards, the prospect stretched to
      the far sea. Heat clothed this view with a kind of opalescence, a fairy
      garment, transmuting all values, so that the four square walls and tall
      chimneys of the pottery-works a few miles down the valley seemed to
      Courtier like a vision of some old fortified Italian town. His sensations,
      finding himself in this galley, were peculiar. For his feeling towards
      Miltoun, whom he had twice met at Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s, was, in spite of
      disagreements, by no means unfriendly; while his feeling towards Miltoun&rsquo;s
      family was not yet in existence. Having lived from hand to mouth, and in
      many countries, since he left Westminster School, he had now practically
      no class feelings. An attitude of hostility to aristocracy because it was
      aristocracy, was as incomprehensible to him as an attitude of deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sensations habitually shaped themselves in accordance with those two
      permanent requirements of his nature, liking for adventure, and hatred of
      tyranny. The labourer who beat his wife, the shopman who sweated his
      &lsquo;hands,&rsquo; the parson who consigned his parishioners to hell, the peer who
      rode roughshod&mdash;all were equally odious to him. He thought of people
      as individuals, and it was, as it were, by accident that he had conceived
      the class generalization which he had fired back at Miltoun from Mrs.
      Noel&rsquo;s window. Sanguine, accustomed to queer environments, and always
      catching at the moment as it flew, he had not to fight with the timidities
      and irritations of a nervous temperament. His cheery courtesy was only
      disturbed when he became conscious of some sentiment which appeared to him
      mean or cowardly. On such occasions, not perhaps infrequent, his face
      looked as if his heart were physically fuming, and since his shell of
      stoicism was never quite melted by this heat, a very peculiar expression
      was the result, a sort of calm, sardonic, desperate, jolly look.
    </p>
    <p>
      His chief feeling, then, at the outrage which had laid him captive in the
      enemy&rsquo;s camp, was one of vague amusement, and curiosity. People round
      about spoke fairly well of this Caradoc family. There did not seem to be
      any lack of kindly feeling between them and their tenants; there was said
      to be no griping destitution, nor any particular ill-housing on their
      estate. And if the inhabitants were not encouraged to improve themselves,
      they were at all events maintained at a certain level, by steady and not
      ungenerous supervision. When a roof required thatching it was thatched;
      when a man became too old to work, he was not suffered to lapse into the
      Workhouse. In bad years for wool, or beasts, or crops, the farmers
      received a graduated remission of rent. The pottery-works were run on a
      liberal if autocratic basis. It was true that though Lord Valleys was said
      to be a staunch supporter of a &lsquo;back to the land&rsquo; policy, no disposition
      was shown to encourage people to settle on these particular lands, no
      doubt from a feeling that such settlers would not do them so much justice
      as their present owner. Indeed so firmly did this conviction seemingly
      obtain, that Lord Valleys&rsquo; agent was not unfrequently observed to be
      buying a little bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, since in this life one notices only what interests him, all this
      gossip, half complimentary, half not, had fallen but lightly on the ears
      of the champion of Peace during his campaign, for he was, as has, been
      said, but a poor politician, and rode his own horse very much his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he stood there enjoying the view, he heard a small high voice, and
      became conscious of a little girl in a very shady hat so far back on her
      brown hair that it did not shade her; and of a small hand put out in
      front. He took the hand, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I am well&mdash;and you?&rdquo; perceiving the while that a pair of
      wide frank eyes were examining his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to speak of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My pony&rsquo;s leg was blistered. Granny is coming to look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to go now. I hope you&rsquo;ll soon be better. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, instead of the little girl, Courtier saw a tall and rather florid
      woman regarding him with a sort of quizzical dignity. She wore a stiffish
      fawn-coloured dress that seemed to be cut a little too tight round her
      substantial hips, for it quite neglected to embrace her knees. She had on
      no hat, no gloves, no ornaments, except the rings on her fingers, and a
      little jewelled watch in a leather bracelet on her wrist. There was,
      indeed, about her whole figure an air of almost professional escape from
      finery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretching out a well-shaped but not small hand, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I most heartily apologize to you, Mr. Courtier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope you&rsquo;re comfortable. Have they given you everything you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It really was disgraceful! However it&rsquo;s brought us the pleasure of making
      your acquaintance. I&rsquo;ve read your book, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Courtier it seemed that on this lady&rsquo;s face had come a look which
      seemed to say: Yes, very clever and amusing, quite enjoyable! But the
      ideas&mdash;&mdash;What? You know very well they won&rsquo;t do&mdash;in fact
      they mustn&rsquo;t do!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very nice of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But into Lady Valleys&rsquo; answer, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with it a bit, you know!&rdquo;
       there had crept a touch of asperity, as though she knew that he had smiled
      inside. &ldquo;What we want preached in these days are the warlike virtues&mdash;especially
      by a warrior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, Lady Valleys, the warlike virtues are best left to men of
      more virgin imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He received a quick look, and the words: &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t care
      a rap for politics. You know Mrs. Lees Noel, don&rsquo;t you? What a pretty
      woman she is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as she spoke Courtier saw a young girl coming along the terrace. She
      had evidently been riding, for she wore high boots and a skirt which had
      enabled her to sit astride. Her eyes were blue, and her hair&mdash;the
      colour of beech-leaves in autumn with the sun shining through&mdash;was
      coiled up tight under a small soft hat. She was tall, and moved towards
      them like one endowed with great length from the hip joint to the knee.
      Joy of life, serene, unconscious vigour, seemed to radiate from her whole
      face and figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Lady Valleys&rsquo; words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Babs! My daughter Barbara&mdash;Mr. Courtier,&rdquo; he put out his hand,
      received within it some gauntleted fingers held out with a smile, and
      heard her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miltoun&rsquo;s gone up to Town, Mother; I was going to motor in to
      Bucklandbury with a message he gave me; so I can fetch Granny out from the
      station:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better take Ann, or she&rsquo;ll make our lives a burden; and perhaps
      Mr. Courtier would like an airing. Is your knee fit, do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glancing at the apparition, Courtier replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never since the age of seven had he been able to look on feminine beauty
      without a sense of warmth and faint excitement; and seeing now perhaps the
      most beautiful girl he had ever beheld, he desired to be with her wherever
      she might be going. There was too something very fascinating in the way
      she smiled, as if she had a little seen through his sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better look for Ann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After short but vigorous search little Ann was found&mdash;in the car,
      instinct having told her of a forward movement in which it was her duty to
      take part. And soon they had started, Ann between them in that peculiar
      state of silence to which she became liable when really interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Monkland estate, flowered, lawned, and timbered, to the open
      moor, was like passing to another world; for no sooner was the last lodge
      of the Western drive left behind, than there came into sudden view the
      most pagan bit of landscape in all England. In this wild parliament-house,
      clouds, rocks, sun, and winds met and consulted. The &lsquo;old&rsquo; men, too, had
      left their spirits among the great stones, which lay couched like lions on
      the hill-tops, under the white clouds, and their brethren, the hunting
      buzzard hawks. Here the very rocks were restless, changing form, and
      sense, and colour from day to day, as though worshipping the unexpected,
      and refusing themselves to law. The winds too in their passage revolted
      against their courses, and came tearing down wherever there were combes or
      crannies, so that men in their shelters might still learn the power of the
      wild gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wonders of this prospect were entirely lost on little Ann, and
      somewhat so on Courtier, deeply engaged in reconciling those two alien
      principles, courtesy, and the love of looking at a pretty face. He was
      wondering too what this girl of twenty, who had the self-possession of a
      woman of forty, might be thinking. It was little Ann who broke the
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie Babs, it wasn&rsquo;t a very strong house, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier looked in the direction of her small finger. There was the wreck
      of a little house, which stood close to a stone man who had obviously
      possessed that hill before there were men of flesh. Over one corner of the
      sorry ruin, a single patch of roof still clung, but the rest was open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a silly man to build it, wasn&rsquo;t he, Ann? That&rsquo;s why they call it
      Ashman&rsquo;s Folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a hundred years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made him build it here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hated women, and&mdash;the roof fell in on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he hate women?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a crank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a crank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Mr. Courtier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under this girl&rsquo;s calm quizzical glance, Courtier endeavoured to find an
      answer to that question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crank,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;is a man like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard a little laugh, and became acutely conscious of Ann&rsquo;s
      dispassionate examining eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Uncle Eustace a crank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know now, Mr. Courtier, what Ann thinks of you. You think a good deal
      of Uncle Eustace, don&rsquo;t you, Ann?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ann, and fixed her eyes before her. But Courtier gazed
      sideways&mdash;over her hatless head.
    </p>
    <p>
      His exhilaration was increasing every moment. This girl reminded him of a
      two-year-old filly he had once seen, stepping out of Ascot paddock for her
      first race, with the sun glistening on her satin chestnut skin, her neck
      held high, her eyes all fire&mdash;as sure to win, as that grass was
      green. It was difficult to believe her Miltoun&rsquo;s sister. It was difficult
      to believe any of those four young Caradocs related. The grave ascetic
      Miltoun, wrapped in the garment of his spirit; mild, domestic,
      strait-laced Agatha; Bertie, muffled, shrewd, and steely; and this frank,
      joyful conquering Barbara&mdash;the range was wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the car had left the moor, and, down a steep hill, was passing the
      small villas and little grey workmen&rsquo;s houses outside the town of
      Bucklandbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ann and I have to go on to Miltoun&rsquo;s headquarters. Shall I drop you at
      the enemy&rsquo;s, Mr. Courtier? Stop, please, Frith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And before Courtier could assent, they had pulled up at a house on which
      was inscribed with extraordinary vigour: &ldquo;Chilcox for Bucklandbury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hobbling into the Committee-room of Mr. Humphrey Chilcox, which smelled of
      paint, Courtier took with him the scented memory of youth, and ambergris,
      and Harris tweed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that room three men were assembled round a table; the eldest of whom,
      endowed with little grey eyes, a stubbly beard, and that mysterious
      something only found in those who have been mayors, rose at once and came
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Courtier, I believe,&rdquo; he said bluffly. &ldquo;Glad to see you, sir. Most
      distressed to hear of this outrage. Though in a way, it&rsquo;s done us good.
      Yes, really. Grossly against fair play. Shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it
      turned a couple of hundred votes. You carry the effects of it about with
      you, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thin, refined man, with wiry hair, also came up, holding a newspaper in
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has had one rather embarrassing effect,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Read this
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;&lsquo;OUTRAGE ON A DISTINGUISHED VISITOR.

          &ldquo;&lsquo;LORD MILTOUN&rsquo;S EVENING ADVENTURE.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Courtier read a paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man with the little eyes broke the ominous silence which ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of our side must have seen the whole thing, jumped on his bicycle and
      brought in the account before they went to press. They make no imputation
      on the lady&mdash;simply state the facts. Quite enough,&rdquo; he added with
      impersonal grimness; &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s done for himself, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man with the refined face added nervously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t help it, Mr. Courtier; I really don&rsquo;t know what we can do. I
      don&rsquo;t like it a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your candidate seen this?&rdquo; Courtier asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t have,&rdquo; struck in the third Committee-man; &ldquo;we hadn&rsquo;t seen it
      ourselves until an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never have permitted it,&rdquo; said the man with the refined face; &ldquo;I
      blame the editor greatly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said the little-eyed man, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a plain piece
      of news. If it makes a stir, that&rsquo;s not our fault. The paper imputes
      nothing, it states. Position of the lady happens to do the rest. Can&rsquo;t
      help it, and moreover, sir, speaking for self, don&rsquo;t want to. We&rsquo;ll have
      no loose morals in public life down here, please God!&rdquo; There was real
      feeling in his words; then, catching sight of Courtier&rsquo;s face, he added:
      &ldquo;Do you know this lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since she was a child. Anyone who speaks evil of her, has to reckon
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man with the refined face said earnestly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, Mr. Courtier, I entirely sympathize. We had nothing to do
      with the paragraph. It&rsquo;s one of those incidents where one benefits against
      one&rsquo;s will. Most unfortunate that she came out on to the green with Lord
      Miltoun; you know what people are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the head-line that does it;&rdquo; said the third Committee-man; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve
      put what will attract the public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the little-eyed man stubbornly; &ldquo;if
      Lord Miltoun will spend his evenings with lonely ladies, he can&rsquo;t blame
      anybody but himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier looked from face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This closes my connection with the campaign,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      address of this paper?&rdquo; And without waiting for an answer, he took up the
      journal and hobbled from the room. He stood a minute outside finding the
      address, then made his way down the street.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      By the side of little Ann, Barbara sat leaning back amongst the cushions
      of the car. In spite of being already launched into high-caste life which
      brings with it an early knowledge of the world, she had still some of the
      eagerness in her face which makes children lovable. Yet she looked
      negligently enough at the citizens of Bucklandbury, being already a little
      conscious of the strange mixture of sentiment peculiar to her countrymen
      in presence of herself&mdash;that curious expression on their faces
      resulting from the continual attempt to look down their noses while
      slanting their eyes upwards. Yes, she was already alive to that mysterious
      glance which had built the national house and insured it afterwards&mdash;foe
      to cynicism, pessimism, and anything French or Russian; parent of all the
      national virtues, and all the national vices; of idealism and
      muddle-headedness, of independence and servility; fosterer of conduct,
      murderer of speculation; looking up, and looking down, but never straight
      at anything; most high, most deep, most queer; and ever bubbling-up from
      the essential Well of Emulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surrounded by that glance, waiting for Courtier, Barbara, not less British
      than her neighbours, was secretly slanting her own eyes up and down over
      the absent figure of her new acquaintance. She too wanted something she
      could look up to, and at the same time see damned first. And in this
      knight-errant it seemed to her that she had got it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a creature from another world. She had met many men, but not as yet
      one quite of this sort. It was rather nice to be with a clever man, who
      had none the less done so many outdoor things, been through so many bodily
      adventures. The mere writers, or even the &lsquo;Bohemians,&rsquo; whom she
      occasionally met, were after all only &lsquo;chaplains to the Court,&rsquo; necessary
      to keep aristocracy in touch with the latest developments of literature
      and art. But this Mr. Courtier was a man of action; he could not be looked
      on with the amused, admiring toleration suited to men remarkable only for
      ideas, and the way they put them into paint or ink. He had used, and could
      use, the sword, even in the cause of Peace. He could love, had loved, or
      so they said: If Barbara had been a girl of twenty in another class, she
      would probably never have heard of this, and if she had heard, it might
      very well have dismayed or shocked her. But she had heard, and without
      shock, because she had already learned that men were like that, and women
      too sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with quite a little pang of concern that she saw him hobbling down
      the street towards her; and when he was once more seated, she told the
      chauffeur: &ldquo;To the station, Frith. Quick, please!&rdquo; and began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not to be trusted a bit. What were you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Courtier smiled grimly over the head of Ann, in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, almost the first time she had ever yet encountered a distinct
      rebuff, Barbara quivered, as though she had been touched lightly with a
      whip. Her lips closed firmly, her eyes began to dance. &ldquo;Very well, my
      dear,&rdquo; she thought. But presently stealing a look at him, she became aware
      of such a queer expression on his face, that she forgot she was offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anything wrong, Mr. Courtier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Lady Barbara, something is very wrong&mdash;that miserable mean
      thing, the human tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara had an intuitive knowledge of how to handle things, a kind of
      moral sangfroid, drawn in from the faces she had watched, the talk she had
      heard, from her youth up. She trusted those intuitions, and letting her
      eyes conspire with his over Ann&rsquo;s brown hair, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything to do with Mrs. N&mdash;&mdash;-?&rdquo; Seeing &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in his eyes, she
      added quickly: &ldquo;And M&mdash;&mdash;-?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that was coming. Let them babble! Who cares?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught an approving glance, and the word, &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the car had drawn up at Bucklandbury Station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little grey figure of Lady Casterley, coming out of the station
      doorway, showed but slight sign of her long travel. She stopped to take
      the car in, from chauffeur to Courtier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Frith!&mdash;Mr. Courtier, is it? I know your book, and I don&rsquo;t
      approve of you; you&rsquo;re a dangerous man&mdash;How do you do? I must have
      those two bags. The cart can bring the rest.... Randle, get up in front,
      and don&rsquo;t get dusty. Ann!&rdquo; But Ann was already beside the chauffeur,
      having long planned this improvement. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! So you&rsquo;ve hurt your leg, sir?
      Keep still! We can sit three.... Now, my dear, I can kiss you! You&rsquo;ve
      grown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley&rsquo;s kiss, once received, was never forgotten; neither perhaps
      was Barbara&rsquo;s. Yet they were different. For, in the case of Lady
      Casterley, the old eyes, bright and investigating, could be seen deciding
      the exact spot for the lips to touch; then the face with its firm chin was
      darted forward; the lips paused a second, as though to make quite certain,
      then suddenly dug hard and dry into the middle of the cheek, quavered for
      the fraction of a second as if trying to remember to be soft, and were
      relaxed like the elastic of a catapult. And in the case of Barbara, first
      a sort of light came into her eyes, then her chin tilted a little, then
      her lips pouted a little, her body quivered, as if it were getting a size
      larger, her hair breathed, there was a small sweet sound; it was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus kissing her grandmother, Barbara resumed her seat, and looked at
      Courtier. &lsquo;Sitting three&rsquo; as they were, he was touching her, and it seemed
      to her somehow that he did not mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind had risen, blowing from the West, and sunshine was flying on it.
      The call of the cuckoos&mdash;a little sharpened&mdash;followed the
      swift-travelling car. And that essential sweetness of the moor, born of
      the heather roots and the South-West wind, was stealing out from under the
      young ferns.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her thin nostrils distended to this scent, Lady Casterley bore a
      distinct resemblance to a small, fine game-bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You smell nice down here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Courtier, before I forget&mdash;who
      is this Mrs. Lees Noel that I hear so much of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that question, Barbara could not help sliding her eyes round. How would
      he stand up to Granny? It was the moment to see what he was made of.
      Granny was terrific!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very charming woman, Lady Casterley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt; but I am tired of hearing that. What is her story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Lady Casterley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever so slightly Barbara let her arm press against Courtiers. It was so
      delicious to hear Granny getting no forwarder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may take it she has a past, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from me, Lady Casterley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Barbara gave him that imperceptible and flattering touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is all very mysterious. I shall find out for myself. You know
      her, my dear. You must take me to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Granny! If people hadn&rsquo;t pasts, they wouldn&rsquo;t have futures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley let her little claw-like hand descend on her
      grand-daughter&rsquo;s thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, and don&rsquo;t stretch like that!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re too
      large already....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At dinner that night they were all in possession of the news. Sir William
      had been informed by the local agent at Staverton, where Lord Harbinger&rsquo;s
      speech had suffered from some rude interruptions. The Hon. Geoffrey
      Winlow; having sent his wife on, had flown over in his biplane from
      Winkleigh, and brought a copy of &lsquo;the rag&rsquo; with him. The one member of the
      small house-party who had not heard the report before dinner was Lord
      Dennis Fitz-Harold, Lady Casterley&rsquo;s brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little, of course, was said. But after the ladies had withdrawn,
      Harbinger, with that plain-spoken spontaneity which was so unexpected,
      perhaps a little intentionally so, in connection with his almost
      classically formed face, uttered words to the effect that, if they did not
      fundamentally kick that rumour, it was all up with Miltoun. Really this
      was serious! And the beggars knew it, and they were going to work it. And
      Miltoun had gone up to Town, no one knew what for. It was the devil of a
      mess!
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the conversation of this young man there was that peculiar brand of
      voice, which seems ever rebutting an accusation of being serious&mdash;a
      brand of voice and manner warranted against anything save ridicule; and in
      the face of ridicule apt to disappear. The words, just a little
      satirically spoken: &ldquo;What is, my dear young man?&rdquo; stopped him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking for the complement and counterpart of Lady Casterley, one would
      perhaps have singled out her brother. All her abrupt decision was negated
      in his profound, ironical urbanity. His voice and look and manner were
      like his velvet coat, which had here and there a whitish sheen, as if it
      had been touched by moonlight. His hair too had that sheen. His very
      delicate features were framed in a white beard and moustache of
      Elizabethan shape. His eyes, hazel and still clear, looked out very
      straight, with a certain dry kindliness. His face, though unweathered and
      unseamed, and much too fine and thin in texture, had a curious affinity to
      the faces of old sailors or fishermen who have lived a simple, practical
      life in the light of an overmastering tradition. It was the face of a man
      with a very set creed, and inclined to be satiric towards innovations,
      examined by him and rejected full fifty years ago. One felt that a brain
      not devoid either of subtlety or aesthetic quality had long given up all
      attempts to interfere with conduct; that all shrewdness of speculation had
      given place to shrewdness of practical judgment based on very definite
      experience. Owing to lack of advertising power, natural to one so
      conscious of his dignity as to have lost all care for it, and to his
      devotion to a certain lady, only closed by death, his life had been lived,
      as it were, in shadow. Still, he possessed a peculiar influence in
      Society, because it was known to be impossible to get him to look at
      things in a complicated way. He was regarded rather as a last resort,
      however. &ldquo;Bad as that? Well, there&rsquo;s old Fitz-Harold! Try him! He won&rsquo;t
      advise you, but he&rsquo;ll say something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in the heart of that irreverent young man, Harbinger, there stirred a
      sort of misgiving. Had he expressed himself too freely? Had he said
      anything too thick? He had forgotten the old boy! Stirring Bertie up with
      his foot, he murmured &ldquo;Forgot you didn&rsquo;t know, sir. Bertie will explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus called on, Bertie, opening his lips a very little way, and fixing his
      half-closed eyes on his great-uncle, explained. There was a lady at the
      cottage&mdash;a nice woman&mdash;Mr. Courtier knew her&mdash;old Miltoun
      went there sometimes&mdash;rather late the other evening&mdash;these
      devils were making the most of it&mdash;suggesting&mdash;lose him the
      election, if they didn&rsquo;t look out. Perfect rot, of course!
    </p>
    <p>
      In his opinion, old Miltoun, though as steady as Time, had been a flat to
      let the woman come out with him on to the Green, showing clearly where he
      had been, when he ran to Courtier&rsquo;s rescue. You couldn&rsquo;t play about with
      women who had no form that anyone knew anything of, however promising they
      might look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, out of a silence Winlow asked: What was to be done? Should Miltoun
      be wired for? A thing like this spread like wildfire! Sir William&mdash;a
      man not accustomed to underrate difficulties&mdash;was afraid it was going
      to be troublesome. Harbinger expressed the opinion that the editor ought
      to be kicked. Did anybody know what Courtier had done when he heard of it.
      Where was he&mdash;dining in his room? Bertie suggested that if Miltoun
      was at Valleys House, it mightn&rsquo;t be too late to wire to him. The thing
      ought to be stemmed at once! And in all this concern about the situation
      there kept cropping out quaint little outbursts of desire to disregard the
      whole thing as infernal insolence, and metaphorically to punch the
      beggars&rsquo; heads, natural to young men of breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, out of another silence came the voice of Lord Dennis:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinking of this poor lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning a little abruptly towards that dry suave voice, and recovering the
      self-possession which seldom deserted him, Harbinger murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, sir; of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the lesser withdrawing room, used when there was so small a party, Mrs.
      Winlow had gone to the piano and was playing to herself, for Lady
      Casterley, Lady Valleys, and her two daughters had drawn together as
      though united to face this invading rumour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was curious testimony to Miltoun&rsquo;s character that, no more here than in
      the dining-hall, was there any doubt of the integrity of his relations
      with Mrs. Noel. But whereas, there the matter was confined to its
      electioneering aspect, here that aspect was already perceived to be only
      the fringe of its importance. Those feminine minds, going with intuitive
      swiftness to the core of anything which affected their own males, had
      already grasped the fact that the rumour would, as it were, chain a man of
      Miltoun&rsquo;s temper to this woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they were walking on such a thin crust of facts, and there was so deep
      a quagmire of supposition beneath, that talk was almost painfully
      difficult. Never before perhaps had each of these four women realized so
      clearly how much Miltoun&mdash;that rather strange and unknown grandson,
      son, and brother&mdash;counted in the scheme of existence. Their
      suppressed agitation was manifested in very different ways. Lady
      Casterley, upright in her chair, showed it only by an added decision of
      speech, a continual restless movement of one hand, a thin line between her
      usually smooth brows. Lady Valleys wore a puzzled look, as if a little
      surprised that she felt serious. Agatha looked frankly anxious. She was in
      her quiet way a woman of much character, endowed with that natural piety,
      which accepts without questioning the established order in life and
      religion. The world to her being home and family, she had a real, if
      gently expressed, horror of all that she instinctively felt to be
      subversive of this ideal. People judged her a little quiet, dull, and
      narrow; they compared her to a hen for ever clucking round her chicks. The
      streak of heroism that lay in her nature was not perhaps of patent order.
      Her feeling about her brother&rsquo;s situation however was sincere and not to
      be changed or comforted. She saw him in danger of being damaged in the
      only sense in which she could conceive of a man&mdash;as a husband and a
      father. It was this that went to her heart, though her piety proclaimed to
      her also the peril of his soul; for she shared the High Church view of the
      indissolubility of marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Barbara, she stood by the hearth, leaning her white shoulders
      against the carved marble, her hands behind her, looking down. Now and
      then her lips curled, her level brows twitched, a faint sigh came from
      her; then a little smile would break out, and be instantly suppressed. She
      alone was silent&mdash;Youth criticizing Life; her judgment voiced itself
      only in the untroubled rise and fall of her young bosom, the impatience of
      her brows, the downward look of her blue eyes, full of a lazy,
      inextinguishable light:
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only he weren&rsquo;t such a queer boy! He&rsquo;s quite capable of marrying her
      from sheer perversity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Lady Casterley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen her, my dear. A most unfortunately attractive creature&mdash;quite
      a charming face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Agatha said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, if she was divorced, I don&rsquo;t think Eustace would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that, certainly,&rdquo; murmured Lady Valleys; &ldquo;hope for the best!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you even know which way it was?&rdquo; said Lady Casterley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the vicar says she did the divorcing. But he&rsquo;s very charitable; it
      may be as Agatha hopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I detest vagueness. Why doesn&rsquo;t someone ask the woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall come with me, Granny dear, and ask her yourself; you will do it
      so nicely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; she said. Something struggled with the autocratic
      criticism in her eyes. No more than the rest of the world could she help
      indulging Barbara. As one who believed in the divinity of her order, she
      liked this splendid child. She even admired&mdash;though admiration was
      not what she excelled in&mdash;that warm joy in life, as of some great
      nymph, parting the waves with bare limbs, tossing from her the foam of
      breakers. She felt that in this granddaughter, rather than in the good
      Agatha, the patrician spirit was housed. There were points to Agatha,
      earnestness and high principle; but something morally narrow and
      over-Anglican slightly offended the practical, this-worldly temper of Lady
      Casterley. It was a weakness, and she disliked weakness. Barbara would
      never be squeamish over moral questions or matters such as were not
      really, essential to aristocracy. She might, indeed, err too much the
      other way from sheer high spirits. As the impudent child had said: &ldquo;If
      people had no pasts, they would have no futures.&rdquo; And Lady Casterley could
      not bear people without futures. She was ambitious; not with the low
      ambition of one who had risen from nothing, but with the high passion of
      one on the top, who meant to stay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where have you been meeting this&mdash;er&mdash;anonymous creature?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara came from the hearth, and bending down beside Lady Casterley&rsquo;s
      chair, seemed to envelop her completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, Granny; she couldn&rsquo;t corrupt me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley&rsquo;s face peered out doubtfully from that warmth, wearing a
      look of disapproving pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your wiles!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see her about. She&rsquo;s nice to look at. We talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again with that hurried quietness Agatha said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Babs, I do think you ought to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Angel, why? What is it to me if she&rsquo;s had four husbands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Agatha bit her lips, and Lady Valleys murmured with a laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really are a terror, Babs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the sound of Mrs. Winlow&rsquo;s music had ceased&mdash;the men had come in.
      And the faces of the four women hardened, as if they had slipped on masks;
      for though this was almost or quite a family party, the Winlows being
      second cousins, still the subject was one which each of these four in
      their very different ways felt to be beyond general discussion. Talk, now,
      began glancing from the war scare&mdash;Winlow had it very specially that
      this would be over in a week&mdash;to Brabrook&rsquo;s speech, in progress at
      that very moment, of which Harbinger provided an imitation. It sped to
      Winlow&rsquo;s flight&mdash;to Andrew Grant&rsquo;s articles in the &lsquo;Parthenon&rsquo;&mdash;to
      the caricature of Harbinger in the &lsquo;Cackler&rsquo;, inscribed &lsquo;The New Tory.
      Lord H-rb-ng-r brings Social Reform beneath the notice of his friends,&rsquo;
      which depicted him introducing a naked baby to a number of coroneted old
      ladies. Thence to a dancer. Thence to the Bill for Universal Assurance.
      Then back to the war scare; to the last book of a great French writer; and
      once more to Winlow&rsquo;s flight. It was all straightforward and outspoken,
      each seeming to say exactly what came into the head. For all that, there
      was a curious avoidance of the spiritual significances of these things; or
      was it perhaps that such significances were not seen?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis, at the far end of the room, studying a portfolio of
      engravings, felt a touch on his cheek; and conscious of a certain
      fragrance, said without turning his head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice things, these, Babs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Receiving no answer he looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      There indeed stood Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hate sneering behind people&rsquo;s backs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There had always been good comradeship between these two, since the days
      when Barbara, a golden-haired child, astride of a grey pony, had been his
      morning companion in the Row all through the season. His riding days were
      past; he had now no outdoor pursuit save fishing, which he followed with
      the ironic persistence of a self-contained, high-spirited nature, which
      refuses to admit that the mysterious finger of old age is laid across it.
      But though she was no longer his companion, he still had a habit of
      expecting her confidences; and he looked after her, moving away from him
      to a window, with surprised concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those nights, dark yet gleaming, when there seems a flying
      malice in the heavens; when the stars, from under and above the black
      clouds, are like eyes frowning and flashing down at men with purposed
      malevolence. The great sighing trees even had caught this spirit, save
      one, a dark, spire-like cypress, planted three hundred and fifty years
      before, whose tall form incarnated the very spirit of tradition, and
      neither swayed nor soughed like the others. From her, too close-fibred,
      too resisting, to admit the breath of Nature, only a dry rustle came.
      Still almost exotic, in spite of her centuries of sojourn, and now brought
      to life by the eyes of night, she seemed almost terrifying, in her narrow,
      spear-like austerity, as though something had dried and died within her
      soul. Barbara came back from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do anything in our lives, it seems to me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but play
      at taking risks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis replied dryly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I understand, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at Mr. Courtier!&rdquo; muttered Barbara. &ldquo;His life&rsquo;s so much more risky
      altogether than any of our men folk lead. And yet they sneer at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, what has he done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I dare say not very much; but it&rsquo;s all neck or nothing. But what does
      anything matter to Harbinger, for instance? If his Social Reform comes to
      nothing, he&rsquo;ll still be Harbinger, with fifty thousand a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis looked up a little queerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Is it possible you don&rsquo;t take the young man seriously, Babs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara shrugged; a strap slipped a little off one white shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all play really; and he knows it&mdash;you can tell that from his
      voice. He can&rsquo;t help its not mattering, of course; and he knows that too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard that he&rsquo;s after you, Babs; is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t caught me yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara&rsquo;s answer was another shrug; and, for all their statuesque beauty,
      the movement of her shoulders was like the shrug of a little girl in her
      pinafore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this Mr. Courtier,&rdquo; said Lord Dennis dryly: &ldquo;Are you after him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m after everything; didn&rsquo;t you know that, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In reason, my child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In reason, of course&mdash;like poor Eusty!&rdquo; She stopped. Harbinger
      himself was standing there close by, with an air as nearly approaching
      reverence as was ever to be seen on him. In truth, the way in which he was
      looking at her was almost timorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sing that song I like so much, Lady Babs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They moved away together; and Lord Dennis, gazing after that magnificent
      young couple, stroked his beard gravely.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miltoun&rsquo;s sudden journey to London had been undertaken in pursuance of a
      resolve slowly forming from the moment he met Mrs. Noel in the stone
      flagged passage of Burracombe Farm. If she would have him and since last
      evening he believed she would&mdash;he intended to marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that except for one lapse his life had been austere, but
      this is not to assert that he had no capacity for passion. The contrary
      was the case. That flame which had been so jealously guarded smouldered
      deep within him&mdash;a smothered fire with but little air to feed on. The
      moment his spirit was touched by the spirit of this woman, it had flared
      up. She was the incarnation of all that he desired. Her hair, her eyes,
      her form; the tiny tuck or dimple at the corner of her mouth just where a
      child places its finger; her way of moving, a sort of unconscious swaying
      or yielding to the air; the tone in her voice, which seemed to come not so
      much from happiness of her own as from an innate wish to make others
      happy; and that natural, if not robust, intelligence, which belongs to the
      very sympathetic, and is rarely found in women of great ambitions or
      enthusiasms&mdash;all these things had twined themselves round his heart.
      He not only dreamed of her, and wanted her; he believed in her. She filled
      his thoughts as one who could never do wrong; as one who, though a wife
      would remain a mistress, and though a mistress, would always be the
      companion of his spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that no one spoke or gossiped about women in Miltoun&rsquo;s
      presence, and the tale of her divorce was present to his mind simply in
      the form of a conviction that she was an injured woman. After his
      interview with the vicar, he had only once again alluded to it, and that
      in answer to the speech of a lady staying at the Court: &ldquo;Oh! yes, I
      remember her case perfectly. She was the poor woman who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Did not, I am certain, Lady Bonington.&rdquo; The tone of his voice had made
      someone laugh uneasily; the subject was changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All divorce was against his convictions, but in a blurred way he admitted
      that there were cases where release was unavoidable. He was not a man to
      ask for confidences, or expect them to be given him. He himself had never
      confided his spiritual struggles to any living creature; and the
      unspiritual struggle had little interest for Miltoun. He was ready at any
      moment to stake his life on the perfection of the idol he had set up
      within his soul, as simply and straightforwardly as he would have placed
      his body in front of her to shield her from harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same fanaticism, which looked on his passion as a flower by itself,
      entirely apart from its suitability to the social garden, was also the
      driving force which sent him up to London to declare his intention to his
      father before he spoke to Mrs. Noel. The thing should be done simply, and
      in right order. For he had the kind of moral courage found in those who
      live retired within the shell of their own aspirations. Yet it was not
      perhaps so much active moral courage as indifference to what others
      thought or did, coming from his inbred resistance to the appreciation of
      what they felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      That peculiar smile of the old Tudor Cardinal&mdash;which had in it
      invincible self-reliance, and a sort of spiritual sneer&mdash;played over
      his face when he speculated on his father&rsquo;s reception of the coming news;
      and very soon he ceased to think of it at all, burying himself in the work
      he had brought with him for the journey. For he had in high degree the
      faculty, so essential to public life, of switching off his whole attention
      from one subject to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at Paddington he drove straight to Valleys House.
    </p>
    <p>
      This large dwelling with its pillared portico, seemed to wear an air of
      faint surprise that, at the height of the season, it was not more
      inhabited. Three servants relieved Miltoun of his little luggage; and
      having washed, and learned that his father would be dining in, he went for
      a walk, taking his way towards his rooms in the Temple. His long figure,
      somewhat carelessly garbed, attracted the usual attention, of which he was
      as usual unaware. Strolling along, he meditated deeply on a London, an
      England, different from this flatulent hurly-burly, this &lsquo;omniuin
      gatherum&rsquo;, this great discordant symphony of sharps and flats. A London,
      an England, kempt and self-respecting; swept and garnished of slums, and
      plutocrats, advertisement, and jerry-building, of sensationalism,
      vulgarity, vice, and unemployment. An England where each man should know
      his place, and never change it, but serve in it loyally in his own caste.
      Where every man, from nobleman to labourer, should be an oligarch by
      faith, and a gentleman by practice. An England so steel-bright and
      efficient that the very sight should suffice to impose peace. An England
      whose soul should be stoical and fine with the stoicism and fineness of
      each soul amongst her many million souls; where the town should have its
      creed and the country its creed, and there should be contentment and no
      complaining in her streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he walked down the Strand, a little ragged boy cheeped out between
      his legs:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bloodee discoveree in a Bank&mdash;Grite sensytion! Pi-er!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun paid no heed to that saying; yet, with it, the wind that blows
      where man lives, the careless, wonderful, unordered wind, had dispersed
      his austere and formal vision. Great was that wind&mdash;the myriad
      aspiration of men and women, the praying of the uncounted multitude to the
      goddess of Sensation&mdash;of Chance, and Change. A flowing from heart to
      heart, from lip to lip, as in Spring the wistful air wanders through a
      wood, imparting to every bush and tree the secrets of fresh life, the
      passionate resolve to grow, and become&mdash;no matter what! A sighing, as
      eternal as the old murmuring of the sea, as little to be hushed, as prone
      to swell into sudden roaring!
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun held on through the traffic, not looking overmuch at the present
      forms of the thousands he passed, but seeing with the eyes of faith the
      forms he desired to see. Near St. Paul&rsquo;s he stopped in front of an old
      book-shop. His grave, pallid, not unhandsome face, was well-known to
      William Rimall, its small proprietor, who at once brought out his latest
      acquisition&mdash;a Mores &lsquo;Utopia.&rsquo; That particular edition (he assured
      Miltoun) was quite unprocurable&mdash;he had never sold but one other
      copy, which had been literally, crumbling away. This copy was in even
      better condition. It could hardly last another twenty years&mdash;a
      genuine book, a bargain. There wasn&rsquo;t so much movement in More as there
      had been a little time back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun opened the tome, and a small book-louse who had been sleeping on
      the word &lsquo;Tranibore,&rsquo; began to make its way slowly towards the very centre
      of the volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it&rsquo;s genuine,&rdquo; said Miltoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not to read, my lord,&rdquo; the little man warned him: &ldquo;Hardly safe to
      turn the pages. As I was saying&mdash;I&rsquo;ve not had a better piece this
      year. I haven&rsquo;t really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shrewd old dreamer,&rdquo; muttered Miltoun; &ldquo;the Socialists haven&rsquo;t got beyond
      him, even now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man&rsquo;s eyes blinked, as though apologizing for the views of
      Thomas More.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose he was one of them. I forget if your
      lordship&rsquo;s very strong on politics?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see an England, Rimall, something like the England of Mores
      dream. But my machinery will be different. I shall begin at the top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, quite so,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we shall come to that, I dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must, Rimall.&rdquo; And Miltoun turned the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man&rsquo;s face quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that book&rsquo;s quite strong enough for you, my
      lord, with your taste for reading. Now I&rsquo;ve a most curious old volume here&mdash;on
      Chinese temples. It&rsquo;s rare&mdash;but not too old. You can peruse it
      thoroughly. It&rsquo;s what I call a book to browse on just suit your palate.
      Funny principle they built those things on,&rdquo; he added, opening the volume
      at an engraving, &ldquo;in layers. We don&rsquo;t build like that in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun looked up sharply; the little man&rsquo;s face wore no signs of
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately we don&rsquo;t, Rimall,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we ought to, and we shall.
      I&rsquo;ll take this book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Placing his finger on the print of the pagoda, he added: &ldquo;A good symbol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little bookseller&rsquo;s eye strayed down the temple to the secret price
      mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, my lord,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I thought it&rsquo;d be your fancy. The price to
      you will be twenty-seven and six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun, pocketing the bargain, walked out. He made his way into the
      Temple, left the book at his Chambers, and passed on down to the bank of
      Mother Thames. The Sun was loving her passionately that afternoon; he had
      kissed her into warmth and light and colour. And all the buildings along
      her banks, as far as the towers at Westminster, seemed to be smiling. It
      was a great sight for the eyes of a lover. And another vision came
      haunting Miltoun, of a soft-eyed woman with a low voice, bending amongst
      her flowers. Nothing would be complete without her; no work bear fruit; no
      scheme could have full meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys greeted his son at dinner with good fellowship and a faint
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Day off, my dear fellow? Or have you come up to hear Brabrook pitch into
      us? He&rsquo;s rather late this time&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got rid of that balloon
      business no trouble after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he eyed Miltoun with that clear grey stare of his, so cool, level, and
      curious. Now, what sort of bird is this? it seemed saying. Certainly not
      the partridge I should have expected from its breeding!
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun&rsquo;s answer: &ldquo;I came up to tell you some thing, sir,&rdquo; riveted his
      father&rsquo;s stare for a second longer than was quite urbane.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not be true to say that Lord Valleys was afraid of his son. Fear
      was not one of his emotions, but he certainly regarded him with a
      respectful curiosity that bordered on uneasiness. The oligarchic temper of
      Miltoun&rsquo;s mind and political convictions almost shocked one who knew both
      by temperament and experience how to wait in front. This instruction he
      had frequently had occasion to give his jockeys when he believed his
      horses could best get home first in that way. And it was an instruction he
      now longed to give his son. He himself had &lsquo;waited in front&rsquo; for over
      fifty years, and he knew it to be the finest way of insuring that he would
      never be compelled to alter this desirable policy&mdash;for something in
      Lord Valleys&rsquo; character made him fear that, in real emergency, he would
      exert himself to the point of the gravest discomfort sooner than be left
      to wait behind. A fellow like young Harbinger, of course, he understood&mdash;versatile,
      &lsquo;full of beans,&rsquo; as he expressed it to himself in his more confidential
      moments, who had imbibed the new wine (very intoxicating it was) of desire
      for social reform. He would have to be given his head a little&mdash;but
      there would be no difficulty with him, he would never &lsquo;run out&rsquo;&mdash;light
      handy build of horse that only required steadying at the corners. He would
      want to hear himself talk, and be let feel that he was doing something.
      All very well, and quite intelligible. But with Miltoun (and Lord Valleys
      felt this to be no, mere parental fancy) it was a very different business.
      His son had a way of forcing things to their conclusions which was
      dangerous, and reminded him of his mother-in-law. He was a baby in public
      affairs, of course, as yet; but as soon as he once got going, the
      intensity of his convictions, together with his position, and real gift&mdash;not
      of the gab, like Harbinger&rsquo;s&mdash;but of restrained, biting oratory, was
      sure to bring him to the front with a bound in the present state of
      parties. And what were those convictions? Lord Valleys had tried to
      understand them, but up to the present he had failed. And this did not
      surprise him exactly, since, as he often said, political convictions were
      not, as they appeared on the surface, the outcome of reason, but merely
      symptoms of temperament. And he could not comprehend, because he could not
      sympathize with, any attitude towards public affairs that was not
      essentially level, attached to the plain, common-sense factors of the case
      as they appeared to himself. Not that he could fairly be called a
      temporizer, for deep down in him there was undoubtedly a vein of
      obstinate, fundamental loyalty to the traditions of a caste which prized
      high spirit beyond all things. Still he did feel that Miltoun was
      altogether too much the &lsquo;pukka&rsquo; aristocrat&mdash;no better than a
      Socialist, with his confounded way of seeing things all cut and dried; his
      ideas of forcing reforms down people&rsquo;s throats and holding them there with
      the iron hand! With his way too of acting on his principles! Why! He even
      admitted that he acted on his principles! This thought always struck a
      very discordant note in Lord Valleys&rsquo; breast. It was almost indecent;
      worse-ridiculous! The fact was, the dear fellow had unfortunately a deeper
      habit of thought than was wanted in politics&mdash;dangerous&mdash;very!
      Experience might do something for him! And out of his own long experience
      the Earl of Valleys tried hard to recollect any politician whom the
      practice of politics had left where he was when he started. He could not
      think of one. But this gave him little comfort; and, above a piece of late
      asparagus his steady eyes sought his son&rsquo;s. What had he come up to tell
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase had been ominous; he could not recollect Miltoun&rsquo;s ever having
      told him anything. For though a really kind and indulgent father, he had&mdash;like
      so many men occupied with public and other lives&mdash;a little acquired
      towards his offspring the look and manner: Is this mine? Of his four
      children, Barbara alone he claimed with conviction. He admired her; and,
      being a man who savoured life, he was unable to love much except where he
      admired. But, the last person in the world to hustle any man or force a
      confidence, he waited to hear his son&rsquo;s news, betraying no uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun seemed in no hurry. He described Courtier&rsquo;s adventure, which
      tickled Lord Valleys a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ordeal by red pepper! Shouldn&rsquo;t have thought them equal to that,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve got him at Monkland now. Harbinger still with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I don&rsquo;t think Harbinger has much stamina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Politically?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather resent his being on our side&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think he does us any
      good. You&rsquo;ve seen that cartoon, I suppose; it cuts pretty deep. I couldn&rsquo;t
      recognize you amongst the old women, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys smiled impersonally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very clever thing. By the way; I shall win the Eclipse, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus, spasmodically, the conversation ran till the last servant had
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Miltoun, without preparation, looked straight at his father and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to marry Mrs. Noel, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys received the shot with exactly the same expression as that
      with which he was accustomed to watch his horses beaten. Then he raised
      his wineglass to his lips; and set it down again untouched. This was the
      only sign he gave of interest or discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this rather sudden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun answered: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to from the moment I first saw her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys, almost as good a judge of a man and a situation as of a
      horse or a pointer dog, leaned back in his chair, and said with faint
      sarcasm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, it&rsquo;s good of you to have told me this; though, to be
      quite frank, it&rsquo;s a piece of news I would rather not have heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dusky flush burned slowly up in Miltoun&rsquo;s cheeks. He had underrated his
      father; the man had coolness and courage in a crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your objection, sir?&rdquo; And suddenly he noticed that a wafer in
      Lord Valleys&rsquo; hand was quivering. This brought into his eyes no look of
      compunction, but such a smouldering gaze as the old Tudor Churchman might
      have bent on an adversary who showed a sign of weakness. Lord Valleys,
      too, noticed the quivering of that wafer, and ate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are men of the world,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun answered: &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Showing his first real symptom of impatience Lord Valleys rapped out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it! I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;, said Miltoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eustace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nursing one knee, Miltoun faced that appeal without the faintest movement.
      His eyes continued to burn into his father&rsquo;s face. A tremor passed over
      Lord Valleys&rsquo; heart. What intensity of feeling there was in the fellow,
      that he could look like this at the first breath of opposition!
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached out and took up the cigar-box; held it absently towards his
      son, and drew it quickly back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And lighting a cigar, he smoked gravely, looking straight before him, a
      furrow between his brows. He spoke at last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks like a lady. I know nothing else about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile deepened round Miltoun&rsquo;s mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you want to know anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys shrugged. His philosophy had hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand for one thing,&rdquo; he said coldly; &ldquo;that there is a matter of a
      divorce. I thought you took the Church&rsquo;s view on that subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has not done wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know her story, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys raised his brows, in irony and a sort of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chivalry the better part of discretion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t, I think, understand the kind of feeling I have for Mrs. Noel.
      It does not come into your scheme of things. It is the only feeling,
      however, with which I should care to marry, and I am not likely to feel it
      for anyone again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys felt once more that uncanny sense of insecurity. Was this
      true? And suddenly he felt Yes, it is true! The face before him was the
      face of one who would burn in his own fire sooner than depart from his
      standards. And a sudden sense of the utter seriousness of this dilemma
      dumbed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can say no more at the moment,&rdquo; he muttered and got up from the table.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley was that inconvenient thing&mdash;an early riser. No woman
      in the kingdom was a better judge of a dew carpet. Nature had in her time
      displayed before her thousands of those pretty fabrics, where all the
      stars of the past night, dropped to the dark earth, were waiting to glide
      up to heaven again on the rays of the sun. At Ravensham she walked
      regularly in her gardens between half-past seven and eight, and when she
      paid a visit, was careful to subordinate whatever might be the local
      custom to this habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When therefore her maid Randle came to Barbara&rsquo;s maid at seven o&rsquo;clock,
      and said: &ldquo;My old lady wants Lady Babs to get up,&rdquo; there was no particular
      pain in the breast of Barbara&rsquo;s maid, who was doing up her corsets. She
      merely answered &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to it. Lady Babs won&rsquo;t be too pleased!&rdquo; And ten
      minutes later she entered that white-walled room which smelled of pinks-a
      temple of drowsy sweetness, where the summer light was vaguely stealing
      through flowered chintz curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara was sleeping with her cheek on her hand, and her tawny hair,
      gathered back, streaming over the pillow. Her lips were parted; and the
      maid thought: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have hair and a mouth like that!&rdquo; She could not
      help smiling to herself with pleasure; Lady Babs looked so pretty&mdash;prettier
      asleep even than awake! And at sight of that beautiful creature, sleeping
      and smiling in her sleep, the earthy, hothouse fumes steeping the mind of
      one perpetually serving in an atmosphere unsuited to her natural growth,
      dispersed. Beauty, with its queer touching power of freeing the spirit
      from all barriers and thoughts of self, sweetened the maid&rsquo;s eyes, and
      kept her standing, holding her breath. For Barbara asleep was a symbol of
      that Golden Age in which she so desperately believed. She opened her eyes,
      and seeing the maid, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it eight o&rsquo;clock, Stacey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but Lady Casterley wants you to walk with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! bother! I was having such a dream!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you were smiling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was dreaming that I could fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could see everything spread out below me, as close as I see you; I was
      hovering like a buzzard hawk. I felt that I could come down exactly where
      I wanted. It was fascinating. I had perfect power, Stacey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And throwing her neck back, she closed her eyes again. The sunlight
      streamed in on her between the half-drawn curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queerest impulse to put out a hand and stroke that full white throat
      shot through the maid&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These flying machines are stupid,&rdquo; murmured Barbara; &ldquo;the pleasure&rsquo;s in
      one&rsquo;s body&mdash;-wings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see Lady Casterley in the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara sprang out of bed. Close by the statue of Diana Lady Casterley was
      standing, gazing down at some flowers, a tiny, grey figure. Barbara
      sighed. With her, in her dream, had been another buzzard hawk, and she was
      filled with a sort of surprise, and queer pleasure that ran down her in
      little shivers while she bathed and dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her haste she took no hat; and still busy with the fastening of her
      linen frock, hurried down the stairs and Georgian corridor, towards the
      garden. At the end of it she almost ran into the arms of Courtier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Awakening early this morning, he had begun first thinking of Audrey Noel,
      threatened by scandal; then of his yesterday&rsquo;s companion, that glorious
      young creature, whose image had so gripped and taken possession of him. In
      the pleasure of this memory he had steeped himself. She was youth itself!
      That perfect thing, a young girl without callowness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his words, when she nearly ran into him, were: &ldquo;The Winged Victory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara&rsquo;s answer was equally symbolic: &ldquo;A buzzard hawk! Do you know, I
      dreamed we were flying, Mr. Courtier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier gravely answered
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the gods give me that dream&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the garden door Barbara turned her head, smiled, and passed through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley, in the company of little Ann, who had perceived that it
      was novel to be in the garden at this hour, had been scrutinizing some
      newly founded colonies of a flower with which she was not familiar. On
      seeing her granddaughter approach, she said at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nemesia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather the fashion, Granny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nemesia?&rdquo; repeated Lady Casterley. &ldquo;What has Nemesis to do with flowers?
      I have no patience with gardeners, and these idiotic names. Where is your
      hat? I like that duck&rsquo;s egg colour in your frock. There&rsquo;s a button
      undone.&rdquo; And reaching up her little spidery hand, wonderfully steady
      considering its age, she buttoned the top button but one of Barbara&rsquo;s
      bodice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look very blooming, my dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How far is it to this
      woman&rsquo;s cottage? We&rsquo;ll go there now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t be up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley&rsquo;s eyes gleamed maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell me she&rsquo;s so nice,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No nice unencumbered woman lies in
      bed after half-past seven. Which is the very shortest way? No, Ann, we
      can&rsquo;t take you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Ann, after regarding her great-grandmother rather too intently,
      replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t come, you see, because I&rsquo;ve got to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Lady Casterley, &ldquo;then trot along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Ann, tightening her lips, walked to the next colony of Nemesia, and
      bent over the colonists with concentration, showing clearly that she had
      found something more interesting than had yet been encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Lady Casterley, and led on at her brisk pace towards the
      avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way down the drive she discoursed on woodcraft, glancing sharply
      at the trees. Forestry&mdash;she said-like building, and all other
      pursuits which required, faith and patient industry, was a lost art in
      this second-hand age. She had made Barbara&rsquo;s grandfather practise it, so
      that at Catton (her country place) and even at Ravensham, the trees were
      worth looking at. Here, at Monkland, they were monstrously neglected. To
      have the finest Italian cypress in the country, for example, and not take
      more care of it, was a downright scandal!
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara listened, smiling lazily. Granny was so amusing in her energy and
      precision, and her turns of speech, so deliberately homespun, as if she&mdash;than
      whom none could better use a stiff and polished phrase, or the refinements
      of the French language&mdash;were determined to take what liberties she
      liked. To the girl, haunted still by the feeling that she could fly,
      almost drunk on the sweetness of the air that summer morning, it seemed
      funny that anyone should be like that. Then for a second she saw her
      grandmother&rsquo;s face in repose, off guard, grim with anxious purpose, as if
      questioning its hold on life; and in one of those flashes of intuition
      which come to women&mdash;even when young and conquering like Barbara&mdash;she
      felt suddenly sorry, as though she had caught sight of the pale spectre
      never yet seen by her. &ldquo;Poor old dear,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;what a pity to be
      old!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they had entered the footpath crossing three long meadows which
      climbed up towards Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s. It was so golden-sweet here amongst the
      million tiny saffron cups frosted with lingering dewshine; there was such
      flying glory in the limes and ash-trees; so delicate a scent from the late
      whins and may-flower; and, on every tree a greybird calling to be sorry
      was not possible!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the far corner of the first field a chestnut mare was standing, with
      ears pricked at some distant sound whose charm she alone perceived. On
      viewing the intruders, she laid those ears back, and a little vicious star
      gleamed out at the corner of her eye. They passed her and entered the
      second field. Half way across, Barbara said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granny, that&rsquo;s a bull!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed an enormous bull, who had been standing behind a clump of
      bushes. He was moving slowly towards them, still distant about two hundred
      yards; a great red beast, with the huge development of neck and front
      which makes the bull, of all living creatures, the symbol of brute force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley envisaged him severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dislike bulls,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I think I must walk backward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s too uphill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to turn back,&rdquo; said Lady Casterley. &ldquo;The bull ought not to
      be here. Whose fault is it? I shall speak to someone. Stand still and look
      at him. We must prevent his coming nearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood still and looked at the bull, who continued to approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t stop him,&rdquo; said Lady Casterley. &ldquo;We must take no notice. Give
      me your arm, my dear; my legs feel rather funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara put her arm round the little figure. They walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been used to bulls lately,&rdquo; said Lady Casterley. The bull came
      nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granny,&rdquo; said Barbara, &ldquo;you must go quietly on to the stile. When you&rsquo;re
      over I&rsquo;ll come too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Lady Casterley, &ldquo;we will go together. Take no notice
      of him; I have great faith in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granny darling, you must do as I say, please; I remember this bull, he is
      one of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At those rather ominous words Lady Casterley gave her a sharp glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My legs feel quite strong now. We can run, if
      necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So can the bull,&rdquo; said Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to leave you,&rdquo; muttered Lady Casterley. &ldquo;If he turns
      vicious I shall talk to him. He won&rsquo;t touch me. You can run faster than I;
      so that&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd, dear,&rdquo; answered Barbara; &ldquo;I am not afraid of bulls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley flashed a look at her which had a gleam of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can feel you,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just as trembly as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bull was now distant some eighty yards, and they were still quite a
      hundred from the stile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granny,&rdquo; said Barbara, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t go on as I tell you, I shall just
      leave you, and go and meet him! You mustn&rsquo;t be obstinate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley&rsquo;s answer was to grip her granddaughter round the waist; the
      nervous force of that thin arm was surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I refuse to have anything
      more to do with this bull; I shall simply pay no attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bull now began very slowly ambling towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take no notice,&rdquo; said Lady Casterley, who was walking faster than she had
      ever walked before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ground is level now,&rdquo; said Barbara; &ldquo;can you run?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; gasped Lady Casterley; and suddenly she found herself
      half-lifted from the ground, and, as it were, flying towards the stile.
      She heard a noise behind; then Barbara&rsquo;s voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must stop. He&rsquo;s on us. Get behind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt herself caught and pinioned by two arms that seemed set on the
      wrong way. Instinct, and a general softness told her that she was back to
      back with her granddaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; she gasped; &ldquo;let me go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she felt herself being propelled by that softness forward
      towards the stile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoo!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;shoo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granny,&rdquo; Barbara&rsquo;s voice came, calm and breathless, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t! You only
      excite him! Are we near the stile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten yards,&rdquo; panted Lady Casterley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, then!&rdquo; There was a sort of warm flurry round her, a rush, a
      heave, a scramble; she was beyond the stile. The bull and Barbara, a yard
      or two apart, were just the other side. Lady Casterley raised her
      handkerchief and fluttered it. The bull looked up; Barbara, all legs and
      arms, came slipping down beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without wasting a moment Lady Casterley leaned forward and addressed the
      bull:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You awful brute!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I will have you well flogged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gently pawing the ground, the bull snuffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you any the worse, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a scrap,&rdquo; said Barbara&rsquo;s serene, still breathless voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley put up her hands, and took the girl&rsquo;s face between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What legs you have!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Give me a kiss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having received a hot, rather quivering kiss, she walked on, holding
      somewhat firmly to Barbara&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for that bull,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;the brute&mdash;to attack women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara looked down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granny,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are you sure you&rsquo;re not shaken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley, whose lips were quivering, pressed them together very
      hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a b-b-bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; said Barbara, &ldquo;that we had better go back, at once&mdash;the
      other way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. There are no more bulls, I suppose, between us and this
      woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you fit to see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley passed her handkerchief over her lips, to remove their
      quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, dear,&rdquo; said Barbara, &ldquo;stand still a minute, while I dust you
      behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This having been accomplished, they proceeded in the direction of Mrs.
      Noel&rsquo;s cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of it, Lady Casterley said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall put my foot down. It&rsquo;s out of the question for a man of Miltoun&rsquo;s
      prospects. I look forward to seeing him Prime Minister some day.&rdquo; Hearing
      Barbara&rsquo;s voice murmuring above her, she paused: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said: What is the use of our being what we are, if we can&rsquo;t love whom
      we like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love!&rdquo; said Lady Casterley; &ldquo;I was talking of marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you admit the distinction, Granny dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pleased to be sarcastic,&rdquo; said Lady Casterley. &ldquo;Listen to me!
      It&rsquo;s the greatest nonsense to suppose that people in our caste are free to
      do as they please. The sooner you realize that, the better, Babs. I am
      talking to you seriously. The preservation of our position as a class
      depends on our observing certain decencies. What do you imagine would
      happen to the Royal Family if they were allowed to marry as they liked?
      All this marrying with Gaiety girls, and American money, and people with
      pasts, and writers, and so forth, is most damaging. There&rsquo;s far too much
      of it, and it ought to be stopped. It may be tolerated for a few cranks,
      or silly young men, and these new women, but for Eustace&mdash;&rdquo; Lady
      Casterley paused again, and her fingers pinched Barbara&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;or for you&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      only one sort of marriage possible. As for Eustace, I shall speak to this
      good lady, and see that he doesn&rsquo;t get entangled further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed in the intensity of her purpose, she did not observe a peculiar
      little smile playing round Barbara&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better speak to Nature, too, Granny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley stopped short, and looked up in her granddaughter&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what do you mean by that?&rdquo; she said &ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But noticing that Barbara&rsquo;s lips had closed tightly, she gave her arm a
      hard&mdash;if unintentional-pinch, and walked on.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley&rsquo;s rather malicious diagnosis of Audrey Noel was correct.
      The unencumbered woman was up and in her garden when Barbara and her
      grandmother appeared at the Wicket gate; but being near the lime-tree at
      the far end she did not hear the rapid colloquy which passed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to be good, Granny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that&mdash;it will depend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley could not possibly have provided herself with a better
      introduction than Barbara, whom Mrs. Noel never met without the sheer
      pleasure felt by a sympathetic woman when she sees embodied in someone
      else that &lsquo;joy in life&rsquo; which Fate has not permitted to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came forward with her head a little on one side, a trick of hers not
      at all affected, and stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unembarrassed Barbara began at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just had an encounter with a bull. This is my grandmother, Lady
      Casterley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little old lady&rsquo;s demeanour, confronted with this very pretty face and
      figure was a thought less autocratic and abrupt than usual. Her shrewd
      eyes saw at once that she had no common adventuress to deal with. She was
      woman of the world enough, too, to know that &lsquo;birth&rsquo; was not what it had
      been in her young days, that even money was rather rococo, and that good
      looks, manners, and a knowledge of literature, art, and music (and this
      woman looked like one of that sort), were often considered socially more
      valuable. She was therefore both wary and affable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have heard of you. May we sit down for a
      minute in your garden? The bull was a wretch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But even in speaking, she was uneasily conscious that Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s clear
      eyes were seeing very well what she had come for. The look in them indeed
      was almost cynical; and in spite of her sympathetic murmurs, she did not
      somehow seem to believe in the bull. This was disconcerting. Why had
      Barbara condescended to mention the wretched brute? And she decided to
      take him by the horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babs,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;go to the Inn and order me a &lsquo;fly.&rsquo; I shall drive back,
      I feel very shaky,&rdquo; and, as Mrs. Noel offered to send her maid, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my granddaughter will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara having departed with a quizzical look, Lady Casterley patted the
      rustic seat, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do come and sit down, I want to talk to you:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Noel obeyed. And at once Lady Casterley perceived that &ldquo;she had a
      most difficult task before her. She had not expected a woman with whom one
      could take no liberties. Those clear dark eyes, and that soft, perfectly
      graceful manner&mdash;to a person so &lsquo;sympathetic&rsquo; one should be able to
      say anything, and&mdash;one couldn&rsquo;t! It was awkward. And suddenly she
      noticed that Mrs. Noel was sitting perfectly upright, as upright&mdash;more
      upright, than she was herself. A bad, sign&mdash;a very bad sign! Taking
      out her handkerchief, she put it to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that we were not chased by a bull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Ah! But I&rsquo;ve something else to talk to you about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s face quivered back, as a flower might when it was going to be
      plucked; and again Lady Casterley put her handkerchief to her lips. This
      time she rubbed them hard. There was nothing to come off; to do so,
      therefore, was a satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an old woman,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you mustn&rsquo;t mind what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Noel did not answer, but looked straight at her visitor; to whom it
      seemed suddenly that this was another person. What was it about that face,
      staring at her! In a weird way it reminded her of a child that one had
      hurt&mdash;with those great eyes and that soft hair, and the mouth thin,
      in a line, all of a sudden. And as if it had been jerked out of her, she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you, my dear. It&rsquo;s about my grandson, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Noel made neither sign nor motion; and the feeling of irritation
      which so rapidly attacks the old when confronted by the unexpected, came
      to Lady Casterley&rsquo;s aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is being coupled with yours in a way that&rsquo;s doing
      him a great deal of harm. You don&rsquo;t wish to injure him, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Noel shook her head, and Lady Casterley went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re not saying since the evening your friend Mr.
      Courtier hurt his knee. Miltoun has been most unwise. You had not perhaps
      realized that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s answer was bitterly distinct:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anyone was sufficiently interested in my doings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley suffered a gesture of exasperation to escape her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;every common person is interested in a woman
      whose position is anomalous. Living alone as you do, and not a widow,
      you&rsquo;re fair game for everybody, especially in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s sidelong glance, very clear and cynical, seemed to say: &ldquo;Even
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not entitled to ask your story,&rdquo; Lady Casterley went on, &ldquo;but if you
      make mysteries you must expect the worst interpretation put on them. My
      grandson is a man of the highest principle; he does not see things with
      the eyes of the world, and that should have made you doubly careful not to
      compromise him, especially at a time like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Noel smiled. This smile startled Lady Casterley; it seemed, by
      concealing everything, to reveal depths of strength and subtlety. Would
      the woman never show her hand? And she said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything serious, of course, is out of the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That word, which of all others seemed the right one, was spoken so that
      Lady Casterley did not know in the least what it meant. Though
      occasionally employing irony, she detested it in others. No woman should
      be allowed to use it as a weapon! But in these days, when they were so
      foolish as to want votes, one never knew what women would be at. This
      particular woman, however, did not look like one of that sort. She was
      feminine&mdash;very feminine&mdash;the sort of creature that spoiled men
      by being too nice to them. And though she had come determined to find out
      all about everything and put an end to it, she saw Barbara re-entering the
      wicket gate with considerable relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready to walk home now,&rdquo; she said. And getting up from the rustic
      seat, she made Mrs. Noel a satirical little bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for letting me rest. Give me your arm, child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara gave her arm, and over her shoulder threw a swift smile at Mrs.
      Noel, who did not answer it, but stood looking quietly after them, her
      eyes immensely dark and large.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the lane Lady Casterley walked on, very silent, digesting her
      emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the &lsquo;fly,&rsquo; Granny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What &lsquo;fly&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one you told me to order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you took me seriously?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They proceeded some little way farther before Lady Casterley said
      suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And dark,&rdquo; said Barbara. &ldquo;I am afraid you were not good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley glanced upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I detest this habit,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;amongst you young people, of taking
      nothing seriously. Not even bulls,&rdquo; she added, with a grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara threw back her head and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor &lsquo;flys,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley saw that she had closed her eyes and opened her lips. And
      she thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very beautiful girl. I had no idea she was so beautiful&mdash;but
      too big!&rdquo; And she added aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut your mouth! You will get one down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They spoke no more till they had entered the avenue; then Lady Casterley
      said sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this coming down the drive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Courtier, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean by it, with that leg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is coming to talk to you, Granny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a cat,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;a sly cat. Now mind, Babs, I won&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, darling,&rdquo; murmured Barbara; &ldquo;you shan&rsquo;t have it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take him
      off your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does your mother mean,&rdquo; stammered Lady Casterley, &ldquo;letting you grow
      up like this! You&rsquo;re as bad as she was at your age!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse!&rdquo; said Barbara. &ldquo;I dreamed last night that I could fly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you try that,&rdquo; said Lady Casterley grimly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll soon come to grief.
      Good-morning, sir; you ought to be in bed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier raised his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely it is not for me to be where you are not!&rdquo; And he added gloomily:
      &ldquo;The war scare&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Lady Casterley: &ldquo;your occupation&rsquo;s gone then. You&rsquo;ll go back to
      London now, I suppose.&rdquo; Looking suddenly at Barbara she saw that the
      girl&rsquo;s eyes were half-closed, and that she was smiling; it seemed to Lady
      Casterley too or was it fancy?&mdash;that she shook her head.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thanks to Lady Valleys, a patroness of birds, no owl was ever shot on the
      Monkland Court estate, and those soft-flying spirits of the dusk hooted
      and hunted, to the great benefit of all except the creeping voles. By
      every farm, cottage, and field, they passed invisible, quartering the dark
      air. Their voyages of discovery stretched up on to the moor as far as the
      wild stone man, whose origin their wisdom perhaps knew. Round Audrey
      Noel&rsquo;s cottage they were as thick as thieves, for they had just there two
      habitations in a long, old, holly-grown wall, and almost seemed to be
      guarding the mistress of that thatched dwelling&mdash;so numerous were
      their fluttering rushes, so tenderly prolonged their soft sentinel
      callings. Now that the weather was really warm, so that joy of life was in
      the voles, they found those succulent creatures of an extraordinarily
      pleasant flavour, and on them each pair was bringing up a family of
      exceptionally fine little owls, very solemn, with big heads, bright large
      eyes, and wings as yet only able to fly downwards. There was scarcely any
      hour from noon of the day (for some of them had horns) to the small sweet
      hours when no one heard them, that they forgot to salute the very large,
      quiet, wingless owl whom they could espy moving about by day above their
      mouse-runs, or preening her white and sometimes blue and sometimes grey
      feathers morning and evening in a large square hole high up in the front
      wall. And they could not understand at all why no swift depredating graces
      nor any habit of long soft hooting belonged to that lady-bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the day when she received that early morning call, as
      soon as dusk had fallen, wrapped in a long thin cloak, with black lace
      over her dark hair, Audrey Noel herself fluttered out into the lanes, as
      if to join the grave winged hunters of the invisible night. Those far,
      continual sounds, not stilled in the country till long after the sun dies,
      had but just ceased from haunting the air, where the late May-scent clung
      as close as fragrance clings to a woman&rsquo;s robe. There was just the barking
      of a dog, the boom of migrating chafers, the song of the stream, and of
      the owls, to proclaim the beating in the heart of this sweet Night. Nor
      was there any light by which Night&rsquo;s face could be seen; it was hidden,
      anonymous; so that when a lamp in a cottage threw a blink over the
      opposite bank, it was as if some wandering painter had wrought a picture
      of stones and leaves on the black air, framed it in purple, and left it
      hanging. Yet, if it could only have been come at, the Night was as full of
      emotion as this woman who wandered, shrinking away against the banks if
      anyone passed, stopping to cool her hot face with the dew on the ferns,
      walking swiftly to console her warm heart. Anonymous Night seeking for a
      symbol could have found none better than this errant figure, to express
      its hidden longings, the fluttering, unseen rushes of its dark wings, and
      all its secret passion of revolt against its own anonymity....
    </p>
    <p>
      At Monkland Court, save for little Ann, the morning passed but dumbly,
      everyone feeling that something must be done, and no one knowing what. At
      lunch, the only allusion to the situation had been Harbinger&rsquo;s inquiry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When does Miltoun return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had wired, it seemed, to say that he was motoring down that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner the better,&rdquo; Sir William murmured: &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve still a fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But all had felt from the tone in which he spoke these words, how serious
      was the position in the eyes of that experienced campaigner.
    </p>
    <p>
      What with the collapse of the war scare, and this canard about Mrs. Noel,
      there was indeed cause for alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon post brought a letter from Lord Valleys marked Express.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys opened it with a slight grimace, which deepened as she read.
      Her handsome, florid face wore an expression of sadness seldom seen there.
      There was, in fact, more than a touch of dignity in her reception of the
      unpalatable news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eustace declares his intention of marrying this Mrs. Noel&rdquo;&mdash;so ran
      her husband&rsquo;s letter&mdash;&ldquo;I know, unfortunately, of no way in which I
      can prevent him. If you can discover legitimate means of dissuasion, it
      would be well to use them. My dear, it&rsquo;s the very devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the very devil! For, if Miltoun had already made up his mind to
      marry her, without knowledge of the malicious rumour, what would not be
      his determination now? And the woman of the world rose up in Lady Valleys.
      This marriage must not come off. It was contrary to almost every instinct
      of one who was practical not only by character, but by habit of life and
      training. Her warm and full-blooded nature had a sneaking sympathy with
      love and pleasure, and had she not been practical, she might have found
      this side of her a serious drawback to the main tenor of a life so much in
      view of the public eye. Her consciousness of this danger in her own case
      made her extremely alive to the risks of an undesirable connection&mdash;especially
      if it were a marriage&mdash;to any public man. At the same time the
      mother-heart in her was stirred. Eustace had never been so deep in her
      affection as Bertie, still he was her first-born; and in face of news
      which meant that he was lost to her&mdash;for this must indeed be &lsquo;the
      marriage of two minds&rsquo; (or whatever that quotation was)&mdash;she felt
      strangely jealous of a woman, who had won her son&rsquo;s love, when she herself
      had never won it. The aching of this jealousy gave her face for a moment
      almost a spiritual expression, then passed away into impatience. Why
      should he marry her? Things could be arranged. People spoke of it already
      as an illicit relationship; well then, let people have what they had
      invented. If the worst came to the worst, this was not the only
      constituency in England; and a dissolution could not be far off. Better
      anything than a marriage which would handicap him all his life! But would
      it be so great a handicap? After all, beauty counted for much! If only her
      story were not too conspicuous! But what was her story? Not to know it was
      absurd! That was the worst of people who were not in Society, it was so
      difficult to find out! And there rose in her that almost brutal
      resentment, which ferments very rapidly in those who from their youth up
      have been hedged round with the belief that they and they alone are the
      whole of the world. In this mood Lady Valleys passed the letter to her
      daughters. They read, and in turn handed it to Bertie, who in silence
      returned it to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that evening, in the billiard-room, having manoeuvred to get him to
      herself, Barbara said to Courtier:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you will answer me a question, Mr. Courtier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I may, and can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her low-cut dress was of yew-green, with, little threads of flame-colour,
      matching her hair, so that there was about her a splendour of darkness and
      whiteness and gold, almost dazzling; and she stood very still, leaning
      back against the lighter green of the billiard-table, grasping its edge so
      tightly that the smooth strong backs of her hands quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have just heard that Miltoun is going to ask Mrs. Noel to marry him.
      People are never mysterious, are they, without good reason? I wanted you
      to tell me&mdash;who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I quite grasp the situation,&rdquo; murmured Courtier. &ldquo;You said&mdash;to
      marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that she had put out her hand, as if begging for the truth, he
      added: &ldquo;How can your brother marry her&mdash;she&rsquo;s married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idea you didn&rsquo;t know that much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thought there was a divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression of which mention has been made&mdash;that peculiar
      white-hot sardonically jolly look&mdash;visited Courtier&rsquo;s face at once.
      &ldquo;Hoist with their own petard! The usual thing. Let a pretty woman live
      alone&mdash;the tongues of men will do the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not so bad as that,&rdquo; said Barbara dryly; &ldquo;they said she had
      divorced her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Caught out thus characteristically riding past the hounds Courtier bit his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better hear the story now. Her father was a country parson, and a
      friend of my father&rsquo;s; so that I&rsquo;ve known her from a child. Stephen Lees
      Noel was his curate. It was a &lsquo;snap&rsquo; marriage&mdash;she was only twenty,
      and had met hardly any men. Her father was ill and wanted to see her
      settled before he died. Well, she found out almost directly, like a good
      many other people, that she&rsquo;d made an utter mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara came a little closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the man like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not bad in his way, but one of those narrow, conscientious pig-headed
      fellows who make the most trying kind of husband&mdash;bone egoistic. A
      parson of that type has no chance at all. Every mortal thing he has to do
      or say helps him to develop his worst points. The wife of a man like
      that&rsquo;s no better than a slave. She began to show the strain of it at last;
      though she&rsquo;s the sort who goes on till she snaps. It took him four years
      to realize. Then, the question was, what were they to do? He&rsquo;s a very High
      Churchman, with all their feeling about marriage; but luckily his pride
      was wounded. Anyway, they separated two years ago; and there she is, left
      high and dry. People say it was her fault. She ought to have known her own
      mind&mdash;at twenty! She ought to have held on and hidden it up somehow.
      Confound their thick-skinned charitable souls, what do they know of how a
      sensitive woman suffers? Forgive me, Lady Barbara&mdash;I get hot over
      this.&rdquo; He was silent; then seeing her eyes fixed on him, went on: &ldquo;Her
      mother died when she was born, her father soon after her marriage. She&rsquo;s
      enough money of her own, luckily, to live on quietly. As for him, he
      changed his parish and runs one somewhere in the Midlands. One&rsquo;s sorry for
      the poor devil, too, of course! They never see each other; and, so far as
      I know, they don&rsquo;t correspond. That, Lady Barbara, is the simple history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara, said, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and turned away; and he heard her mutter:
      &ldquo;What a shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he could not tell whether it was Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s fate, or the husband&rsquo;s
      fate, or the thought of Miltoun that had moved her to those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      She puzzled him by her self-possession, so almost hard, her way of
      refusing to show feeling.&rsquo; Yet what a woman she would make if the drying
      curse of high-caste life were not allowed to stereotype and shrivel her!
      If enthusiasm were suffered to penetrate and fertilize her soul! She
      reminded him of a great tawny lily. He had a vision of her, as that
      flower, floating, freed of roots and the mould of its cultivated soil, in
      the liberty of the impartial air. What a passionate and noble thing she
      might become! What radiance and perfume she would exhale! A spirit
      Fleur-de-Lys! Sister to all the noble flowers of light that inhabited the
      wind!
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning in the deep embrasure of his window, he looked at anonymous Night.
      He could hear the owls hoot, and feel a heart beating out there somewhere
      in the darkness, but there came no answer to his wondering. Would she&mdash;this
      great tawny lily of a girl&mdash;ever become unconscious of her
      environment, not in manner merely, but in the very soul, so that she might
      be just a woman, breathing, suffering, loving, and rejoicing with the poet
      soul of all mankind? Would she ever be capable of riding out with the
      little company of big hearts, naked of advantage? Courtier had not been
      inside a church for twenty years, having long felt that he must not enter
      the mosques of his country without putting off the shoes of freedom, but
      he read the Bible, considering it a very great poem. And the old words
      came haunting him: &lsquo;Verily I say unto you, It is harder for a camel to
      pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom
      of Heaven.&rsquo; And now, looking into the Night, whose darkness seemed to hold
      the answer to all secrets, he tried to read the riddle of this girl&rsquo;s
      future, with which there seemed so interwoven that larger enigma, how far
      the spirit can free itself, in this life, from the matter that
      encompasseth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Night whispered suddenly, and low down, as if rising from the sea,
      came the moon, dropping a wan robe of light till she gleamed out nude
      against the sky-curtain. Night was no longer anonymous. There in the dusky
      garden the statue of Diana formed slowly before his eyes, and behind her&mdash;as
      it were, her temple&mdash;rose the tall spire of the cypress tree.

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      A copy of the Bucklandbury News, containing an account of his evening
      adventure, did not reach Miltoun till he was just starting on his return
      journey. It came marked with blue pencil together with a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR EUSTACE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The enclosed&mdash;however unwarranted and impudent&mdash;requires
      attention. But we shall do nothing till you come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WILLIAM SHROPTON.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect on Miltoun might perhaps have been different had he not been so
      conscious of his intention to ask Audrey Noel to be his wife; but in any
      circumstances it is doubtful whether he would have done more than smile,
      and tear the paper up. Truly that sort of thing had so little power to
      hurt or disturb him personally, that he was incapable of seeing how it
      could hurt or disturb others. If those who read it were affected, so much
      the worse for them. He had a real, if unobtrusive, contempt for
      groundlings, of whatever class; and it never entered his head to step an
      inch out of his course in deference to their vagaries. Nor did it come
      home to him that Mrs. Noel, wrapped in the glamour which he cast about
      her, could possibly suffer from the meanness of vulgar minds. Shropton&rsquo;s
      note, indeed, caused him the more annoyance of those two documents. It was
      like his brother-in-law to make much of little!
    </p>
    <p>
      He hardly dozed at all during his swift journey through the sleeping
      country; nor when he reached his room at Monkland did he go to bed. He had
      the wonderful, upborne feeling of man on the verge of achievement. His
      spirit and senses were both on fire&mdash;for that was the quality of this
      woman, she suffered no part of him to sleep, and he was glad of her
      exactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drank some tea; went out, and took a path up to the moor. It was not
      yet eight o&rsquo;clock when he reached the top of the nearest tor. And there,
      below him, around, and above, was a land and sky transcending even his
      exaltation. It was like a symphony of great music; or the nobility of a
      stupendous mind laid bare; it was God up there, in His many moods.
      Serenity was spread in the middle heavens, blue, illimitable, and along to
      the East, three huge clouds, like thoughts brooding over the destinies
      below, moved slowly toward the sea, so that great shadows filled the
      valleys. And the land that lay under all the other sky was gleaming, and
      quivering with every colour, as it were, clothed with the divine smile.
      The wind, from the North, whereon floated the white birds of the smaller
      clouds, had no voice, for it was above barriers, utterly free. Before
      Miltoun, turning to this wind, lay the maze of the lower lands, the misty
      greens, rose pinks, and browns of the fields, and white and grey dots and
      strokes of cottages and church towers, fading into the blue veil of
      distance, confined by a far range of hills. Behind him there was nothing
      but the restless surface of the moor, coloured purplish-brown. On that
      untamed sea of graven wildness could be seen no ship of man, save one, on
      the far horizon&mdash;the grim hulk, Dartmoor Prison. There was no sound,
      no scent, and it seemed to Miltoun as if his spirit had left his body, and
      become part of the solemnity of God. Yet, as he stood there, with his head
      bared, that strange smile which haunted him in moments of deep feeling,
      showed that he had not surrendered to the Universal, that his own spirit
      was but being fortified, and that this was the true and secret source of
      his delight. He lay down in a scoop of the stones. The sun entered there,
      but no wind, so that a dry sweet scent exuded from the young shoots of
      heather. That warmth and perfume crept through the shield of his spirit,
      and stole into his blood; ardent images rose before him, the vision of an
      unending embrace. Out of an embrace sprang Life, out of that the World was
      made, this World, with its innumerable forms, and natures&mdash;no two
      alike! And from him and her would spring forms to take their place in the
      great pattern. This seemed wonderful, and right-for they would be worthy
      forms, who would hand on those traditions which seemed to him so necessary
      and great. And then there broke on him one of those delirious waves of
      natural desire, against which he had so often fought, so often with great
      pain conquered. He got up, and ran downhill, leaping over the stones, and
      the thicker clumps of heather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey Noel, too, had been early astir, though she had gone late enough to
      bed. She dressed languidly, but very carefully, being one of those women
      who put on armour against Fate, because they are proud, and dislike the
      thought that their sufferings should make others suffer; because, too,
      their bodies are to them as it were sacred, having been given them in
      trust, to cause delight. When she had finished, she looked at herself in
      the glass rather more distrustfully than usual. She felt that her sort of
      woman was at a discount in these days, and being sensitive, she was never
      content either with her appearance, or her habits. But, for all that, she
      went on behaving in unsatisfactory ways, because she incorrigibly loved to
      look as charming as she could; and even if no one were going to see her,
      she never felt that she looked charming enough. She was&mdash;as Lady
      Casterley had shrewdly guessed&mdash;the kind of woman who spoils men by
      being too nice to them; of no use to those who wish women to assert
      themselves; yet having a certain passive stoicism, very disconcerting.
      With little or no power of initiative, she would do what she was set to do
      with a thoroughness that would shame an initiator; temperamentally unable
      to beg anything of anybody, she required love as a plant requires water;
      she could give herself completely, yet remain oddly incorruptible; in a
      word, hopeless, and usually beloved of those who thought her so.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all this, however, she was not quite what is called a &lsquo;sweet woman&mdash;a
      phrase she detested&mdash;for there was in her a queer vein of gentle
      cynicism. She &lsquo;saw&rsquo; with extraordinary clearness, as if she had been born
      in Italy and still carried that clear dry atmosphere about her soul. She
      loved glow and warmth and colour; such mysticism as she felt was pagan;
      and she had few aspirations&mdash;sufficient to her were things as they
      showed themselves to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning, when she had made herself smell of geraniums, and fastened
      all the small contrivances that hold even the best of women together, she
      went downstairs to her little dining-room, set the spirit lamp going, and
      taking up her newspaper, stood waiting to make tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the hour of the day most dear to her. If the dew had been brushed
      off her life, it was still out there every morning on the face of Nature,
      and on the faces of her flowers; there was before her all the pleasure of
      seeing how each of those little creatures in the garden had slept; how
      many children had been born since the Dawn; who was ailing, and needed
      attention. There was also the feeling, which renews itself every morning
      in people who live lonely lives, that they are not lonely, until, the day
      wearing on, assures them of the fact. Not that she was idle, for she had
      obtained through Courtier the work of reviewing music in a woman&rsquo;s paper,
      for which she was intuitively fitted. This, her flowers, her own music,
      and the affairs of certain families of cottagers, filled nearly all her
      time. And she asked no better fate than to have every minute occupied,
      having that passion for work requiring no initiation, which is natural to
      the owners of lazy minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she dropped her newspaper, went to the bowl of flowers on the
      breakfast-table, and plucked forth two stalks of lavender; holding them
      away from her, she went out into the garden, and flung them over the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      This strange immolation of those two poor sprigs, born so early, gathered
      and placed before her with such kind intention by her maid, seemed of all
      acts the least to be expected of one who hated to hurt people&rsquo;s feelings,
      and whose eyes always shone at the sight of flowers. But in truth the
      smell of lavender&mdash;that scent carried on her husband&rsquo;s handkerchief
      and clothes&mdash;still affected her so strongly that she could not bear
      to be in a room with it. As nothing else did, it brought before her one,
      to live with whom had slowly become torture. And freed by that scent, the
      whole flood of memory broke in on her. The memory of three years when her
      teeth had been set doggedly, on her discovery that she was chained to
      unhappiness for life; the memory of the abrupt end, and of her creeping
      away to let her scorched nerves recover. Of how during the first year of
      this release which was not freedom, she had twice changed her abode, to
      get away from her own story&mdash;not because she was ashamed of it, but
      because it reminded her of wretchedness. Of how she had then come to
      Monkland, where the quiet life had slowly given her elasticity again. And
      then of her meeting with Miltoun; the unexpected delight of that
      companionship; the frank enjoyment of the first four months. And she
      remembered all her secret rejoicing, her silent identification of another
      life with her own, before she acknowledged or even suspected love. And
      just three weeks ago now, helping to tie up her roses, he had touched her,
      and she had known. But even then, until the night of Courtier&rsquo;s accident,
      she had not dared to realize. More concerned now for him than for herself,
      she asked herself a thousand times if she had been to blame. She had let
      him grow fond of her, a woman out of court, a dead woman! An unpardonable
      sin! Yet surely that depended on what she was prepared to give! And she
      was frankly ready to give everything, and ask for nothing. He knew her
      position, he had told her that he knew. In her love for him she gloried,
      would continue to glory; would suffer for it without regret. Miltoun was
      right in believing that newspaper gossip was incapable of hurting her,
      though her reasons for being so impervious were not what he supposed. She
      was not, like him, secured from pain because such insinuations about the
      private affairs of others were mean and vulgar and beneath notice; it had
      not as yet occurred to her to look at the matter in so lofty and general a
      light; she simply was not hurt, because she was already so deeply
      Miltoun&rsquo;s property in spirit, that she was almost glad that they should
      assign him all the rest of her. But for Miltoun&rsquo;s sake she was disturbed
      to the soul. She had tarnished his shield in the eyes of men; and (for she
      was oddly practical, and saw things in very clear proportion) perhaps put
      back his career, who knew how many years!
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down to drink her tea. Not being a crying woman, she suffered
      quietly. She felt that Miltoun would be coming to her. She did not know at
      all what she should say when he did come. He could not care for her so
      much as she cared for him! He was a man; men soon forget! Ah! but he was
      not like most men. One could not look at his eyes without feeling that he
      could suffer terribly! In all this her own reputation concerned her not at
      all. Life, and her clear way of looking at things, had rooted in her the
      conviction that to a woman the preciousness of her reputation was a
      fiction invented by men entirely for man&rsquo;s benefit; a second-hand fetish
      insidiously, inevitably set-up by men for worship, in novels, plays, and
      law-courts. Her instinct told her that men could not feel secure in the
      possession of their women unless they could believe that women set
      tremendous store by sexual reputation. What they wanted to believe, that
      they did believe! But she knew otherwise. Such great-minded women as she
      had met or read of had always left on her the impression that reputation
      for them was a matter of the spirit, having little to do with sex. From
      her own feelings she knew that reputation, for a simple woman, meant to
      stand well in the eyes of him or her whom she loved best. For worldly
      women&mdash;and there were so many kinds of those, besides the merely
      fashionable&mdash;she had always noted that its value was not intrinsic,
      but commercial; not a crown of dignity, but just a marketable asset. She
      did not dread in the least what people might say of her friendship with
      Miltoun; nor did she feel at all that her indissoluble marriage forbade
      her loving him. She had secretly felt free as soon as she had discovered
      that she had never really loved her husband; she had only gone on
      dutifully until the separation, from sheer passivity, and because it was
      against her nature to cause pain to anyone. The man who was still her
      husband was now as dead to her as if he had never been born. She could not
      marry again, it was true; but she could and did love. If that love was to
      be starved and die away, it would not be because of any moral scruples.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her paper languidly; and almost the first words she read, under
      the heading of Election News, were these:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Apropos of the outrage on Mr. Courtier, we are requested to state that
      the lady who accompanied Lord Miltoun to the rescue of that gentleman was
      Mrs. Lees Noel, wife of the Rev. Stephen Lees Noel, vicar of Clathampton,
      Warwickshire.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This dubious little daub of whitewash only brought a rather sad smile to
      her lips. She left her tea, and went out into the air. There at the gate
      was Miltoun coming in. Her heart leaped. But she went forward quietly, and
      greeted him with cast-down eyes, as if nothing were out of the ordinary.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Exaltation had not left Miltoun. His sallow face was flushed, his eyes
      glowed with a sort of beauty; and Audrey Noel who, better than most women,
      could read what was passing behind a face, saw those eyes with the delight
      of a moth fluttering towards a lamp. But in a very unemotional voice she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have come to breakfast. How nice of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not in Miltoun to observe the formalities of attack. Had he been
      going to fight a duel there would have been no preliminary, just a look, a
      bow, and the swords crossed. So in this first engagement of his with the
      soul of a woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      He neither sat down nor suffered her to sit, but stood looking intently
      into her face, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that it had come, with this disconcerting swiftness, she was strangely
      calm, and unashamed. The elation of knowing for sure that she was loved
      was like a wand waving away all tremors, stilling them to sweetness. Since
      nothing could take away that knowledge, it seemed that she could never
      again be utterly unhappy. Then, too, in her nature, so deeply,
      unreasoningly incapable of perceiving the importance of any principle but
      love, there was a secret feeling of assurance, of triumph. He did love
      her! And she, him! Well! And suddenly panic-stricken, lest he should take
      back those words, she put her hand up to his breast, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The feel of his arms round her, the strength and passion of that moment,
      were so terribly sweet, that she died to thought, just looking up at him,
      with lips parted and eyes darker with the depth of her love than he had
      ever dreamed that eyes could be. The madness of his own feeling kept him
      silent. And they stood there, so merged in one another that they knew and
      cared nothing for any other mortal thing. It was very still in the room;
      the roses and carnations in the lustre bowl, seeming to know that their
      mistress was caught up into heaven, had let their perfume steal forth and
      occupy every cranny of the abandoned air; a hovering bee, too, circled
      round the lovers&rsquo; heads, scenting, it seemed, the honey in their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that Miltoun&rsquo;s face was not unhandsome; for Audrey Noel
      at this moment when his eyes were so near hers, and his lips touching her,
      he was transfigured, and had become the spirit of all beauty. And she,
      with heart beating fast against him, her eyes, half closing from delight,
      and her hair asking to be praised with its fragrance, her cheeks fainting
      pale with emotion, and her arms too languid with happiness to embrace him&mdash;she,
      to him, was the incarnation of the woman that visits dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bee ended it; who, impatient with flowers that hid their honey so
      deep, had entangled himself in Audrey&rsquo;s hair. And then, seeing that words,
      those dreaded things, were on his lips, she tried to kiss them back. But
      they came:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will you marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It all swayed a little. And with marvellous rapidity the whole position
      started up before her. She saw, with preternatural insight, into its nooks
      and corners. Something he had said one day, when they were talking of the
      Church view of marriage and divorce, lighted all up. So he had really
      never known about her! At this moment of utter sickness, she was saved
      from fainting by her sense of humour&mdash;her cynicism. Not content to
      let her be, people&rsquo;s tongues had divorced her; he had believed them! And
      the crown of irony was that he should want to marry her, when she felt so
      utterly, so sacredly his, to do what he liked with sans forms or
      ceremonies. A surge of bitter feeling against the man who stood between
      her and Miltoun almost made her cry out. That man had captured her before
      she knew the world or her own soul, and she was tied to him, till by some
      beneficent chance he drew his last breath when her hair was grey, and her
      eyes had no love light, and her cheeks no longer grew pale when they were
      kissed; when twilight had fallen, and the flowers, and bees no longer
      cared for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was that feeling, the sudden revolt of the desperate prisoner, which
      steeled her to put out her hand, take up the paper, and give it to
      Miltoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had read the little paragraph, there followed one of those
      eternities which last perhaps two minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, I suppose?&rdquo; And, at her silence, added: &ldquo;I am sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This queer dry saying was so much more terrible than any outcry, that she
      remained, deprived even of the power of breathing, with her eyes still
      fixed on Miltoun&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile of the old Cardinal had come up there, and was to her like a
      living accusation. It seemed strange that the hum of the bees and flies
      and the gentle swishing of the limetree should still go on outside,
      insisting that there was a world moving and breathing apart from her, and
      careless of her misery. Then some of her courage came back, and with it
      her woman&rsquo;s mute power. It came haunting about her face, perfectly still,
      about her lips, sensitive and drawn, about her eyes, dark, almost mutinous
      under their arched brows. She stood, drawing him with silence and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made a foolish mistake, it seems. I believed you were free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips just moved for the words to pass: &ldquo;I thought you knew. I never,
      dreamed you would want to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to her natural that he should be thinking only of himself, but
      with the subtlest defensive instinct, she put forward her own tragedy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I had got too used to knowing I was dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no release?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None. We have neither of us done wrong; besides with him, marriage is&mdash;for
      ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had broken his smile, which had been cruel without meaning to be
      cruel; and with a smile of her own that was cruel too, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that you believed in release either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as though she had stabbed herself in stabbing him, her face
      quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her now, conscious at last that she was suffering. And she
      felt that he was holding himself in with all his might from taking her
      again into his arms. Seeing this, the warmth crept back to her lips, and a
      little light into her eyes, which she kept hidden from him. Though she
      stood so proudly still, some wistful force was coming from her, as from a
      magnet, and Miltoun&rsquo;s hands and arms and face twitched as though palsied.
      This struggle, dumb and pitiful, seemed never to be coming to an end in
      the little white room, darkened by the thatch of the verandah, and sweet
      with the scent of pinks and of a wood fire just lighted somewhere out at
      the back. Then, without a word, he turned and went out. She heard the
      wicket gate swing to. He was gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lord Denis was fly-fishing&mdash;the weather just too bright to allow the
      little trout of that shallow, never silent stream to embrace with avidity
      the small enticements which he threw in their direction. Nevertheless he
      continued to invite them, exploring every nook of their watery pathway
      with his soft-swishing line. In a rough suit and battered hat adorned with
      those artificial and other flies, which infest Harris tweed, he crept
      along among the hazel bushes and thorn-trees, perfectly happy. Like an old
      spaniel, who has once gloried in the fetching of hares, rabbits, and all
      manner of fowl, and is now glad if you will but throw a stick for him, so
      one, who had been a famous fisher before the Lord, who had harried the
      waters of Scotland and Norway, Florida and Iceland, now pursued trout no
      bigger than sardines. The glamour of a thousand memories hallowed the
      hours he thus spent by that brown water. He fished unhasting, religious,
      like some good Catholic adding one more to the row of beads already told,
      as though he would fish himself, gravely, without complaint, into the
      other world. With each fish caught he experienced a solemn satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he would have liked Barbara with him that morning, he had only
      looked at her once after breakfast in such a way that she could not see
      him, and with a dry smile gone off by himself. Down by the stream it was
      dappled, both cool and warm, windless; the trees met over the river, and
      there were many stones, forming little basins which held up the ripple, so
      that the casting of a fly required much cunning. This long dingle ran for
      miles through the foot-growth of folding hills. It was beloved of jays;
      but of human beings there were none, except a chicken-farmer&rsquo;s widow, who
      lived in a house thatched almost to the ground, and made her livelihood by
      directing tourists, with such cunning that they soon came back to her for
      tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while throwing a rather longer line than usual to reach a little
      dark piece of crisp water that Lord Dennis heard the swishing and
      crackling of someone advancing at full speed. He frowned slightly, feeling
      for the nerves of his fishes, whom he did not wish startled. The invader
      was Miltoun, hot, pale, dishevelled, with a queer, hunted look on his
      face. He stopped on seeing his great-uncle, and instantly assumed the mask
      of his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis was not the man to see what was not intended for him, and he
      merely said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Eustace!&rdquo; as he might have spoken, meeting his nephew in the hall
      of one of his London Clubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun, no less polite, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope I haven&rsquo;t lost you anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis shook his head, and laying his rod on the bank, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down and have a chat, old fellow. You don&rsquo;t fish, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not, in the least, missed the suffering behind Miltoun&rsquo;s mask; his
      eyes were still good, and there was a little matter of some twenty years&rsquo;
      suffering of his own on account of a woman&mdash;ancient history now&mdash;which
      had left him quaintly sensitive, for an old man, to signs of suffering in
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun would not have obeyed that invitation from anyone else, but there
      was something about Lord Dennis which people did not resist; his power lay
      in a dry ironic suavity which could not but persuade people that
      impoliteness was altogether too new and raw a thing to be indulged in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two sat side by side on the roots of trees. At first they talked a
      little of birds, and then were dumb, so dumb that the invisible creatures
      of the woods consulted together audibly. Lord Dennis broke that silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;always reminds me of Mark Twain&rsquo;s writings&mdash;can&rsquo;t
      tell why, unless it&rsquo;s the ever-greenness. I like the evergreen
      philosophers, Twain and Meredith. There&rsquo;s no salvation except through
      courage, though I never could stomach the &lsquo;strong man&rsquo;&mdash;captain of
      his soul, Henley and Nietzsche and that sort&mdash;goes against the grain
      with me. What do you say, Eustace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They meant well,&rdquo; answered Miltoun, &ldquo;but they protested too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis moved his head in assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be captain of your soul!&rdquo; continued Miltoun in a bitter voice; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
      pretty phrase!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty enough,&rdquo; murmured Lord Dennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suitable to you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; Lord Dennis answered dryly, &ldquo;a long way off that, thank
      God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were fixed intently on the place where a large trout had risen in
      the stillest toffee-coloured pool. He knew that fellow, a half-pounder at
      least, and his thoughts began flighting round the top of his head,
      hovering over the various merits of the flies. His fingers itched too, but
      he made no movement, and the ash-tree under which he sat let its leaves
      tremble, as though in sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that hawk?&rdquo; said Miltoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a height more than level with the tops of the hills a buzzard hawk was
      stationary in the blue directly over them. Inspired by curiosity at their
      stillness, he was looking down to see whether they were edible; the
      upcurved ends of his great wings flirted just once to show that he was
      part of the living glory of the air&mdash;a symbol of freedom to men and
      fishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis looked at his great-nephew. The boy&mdash;for what else was
      thirty to seventy-six?&mdash;was taking it hard, whatever it might be,
      taking it very hard! He was that sort&mdash;ran till he dropped. The worst
      kind to help&mdash;the sort that made for trouble&mdash;that let things
      gnaw at them! And there flashed before the old man&rsquo;s mind the image of
      Prometheus devoured by the eagle. It was his favourite tragedy, which he
      still read periodically, in the Greek, helping himself now and then out of
      his old lexicon to the meaning of some word which had flown to Erebus.
      Yes, Eustace was a fellow for the heights and depths!
    </p>
    <p>
      He said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care to talk about it, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun shook his head, and again there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The buzzard hawk having seen them move, quivered his wings like a moth&rsquo;s,
      and deserted that plane of air. A robin from the dappled warmth of a mossy
      stone, was regarding them instead. There was another splash in the pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow&rsquo;s risen twice; I believe he&rsquo;d take a &lsquo;Wistman&rsquo;s treasure.&rsquo;&rdquo;
       Extracting from his hat its latest fly, and binding it on, he began softly
      to swish his line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have him yet!&rdquo; he muttered. But Miltoun had stolen away....
    </p>
    <p>
      The further piece of information about Mrs. Noel, already known by
      Barbara, and diffused by the &lsquo;Bucklandbury News&rsquo;, had not become common
      knowledge at the Court till after Lord Dennis had started out to fish. In
      combination with the report that Miltoun had arrived and gone out without
      breakfast, it had been received with mingled feelings. Bertie, Harbinger,
      and Shropton, in a short conclave, after agreeing that from the point of
      view of the election it was perhaps better than if she had been a
      divorcee, were still inclined to the belief that no time was to be lost&mdash;in
      doing what, however, they were unable to determine. Apart from the
      impossibility of knowing how a fellow like Miltoun would take the matter,
      they were faced with the devilish subtlety of all situations to which the
      proverb &lsquo;Least said, soonest mended&rsquo; applies. They were in the presence of
      that awe-inspiring thing, the power of scandal. Simple statements of
      simple facts, without moral drawn (to which no legal exception could be
      taken) laid before the public as pieces of interesting information, or at
      the worst exposed in perfect good faith, lest the public should blindly
      elect as their representative one whose private life might not stand the
      inspection of daylight&mdash;what could be more justifiable! And yet
      Miltoun&rsquo;s supporters knew that this simple statement of where he spent his
      evenings had a poisonous potency, through its power of stimulating that
      side of the human imagination the most easily excited. They recognized
      only too well, how strong was a certain primitive desire, especially in
      rural districts, by yielding to which the world was made to go, and how
      remarkably hard it, was not to yield to it, and how interesting and
      exciting to see or hear of others yielding to it, and how (though here, of
      course, men might differ secretly) reprehensible of them to do so! They
      recognized, too well, how a certain kind of conscience would appreciate
      this rumour; and how the puritans would lick their lengthened chops. They
      knew, too, how irresistible to people of any imagination at all, was the
      mere combination of a member of a class, traditionally supposed to be
      inclined to having what it wanted, with a lady who lived alone! As
      Harbinger said: It was really devilish awkward! For, to take any notice of
      it would be to make more people than ever believe it true. And yet, that
      it was working mischief, they felt by the secret voice in their own souls,
      telling them that they would have believed it if they had not known
      better. They hung about, waiting for Miltoun to come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news was received by Lady Valleys with a sigh of intense relief, and
      the remark that it was probably another lie. When Barbara confirmed it,
      she only said: &ldquo;Poor Eustace!&rdquo; and at once wrote off to her husband to say
      that &lsquo;Anonyma&rsquo; was still married, so that the worst fortunately could not
      happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun came in to lunch, but from his face and manner nothing could be
      guessed. He was a thought more talkative than usual, and spoke of
      Brabrook&rsquo;s speech&mdash;some of which he had heard. He looked at Courtier
      meaningly, and after lunch said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come round to my den?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that room, the old withdrawing-room of the Elizabethan wing&mdash;where
      once had been the embroideries, tapestries, and missals of beruffled dames
      were now books, pamphlets, oak-panels, pipes, fencing gear, and along one
      wall a collection of Red Indian weapons and ornaments brought back by
      Miltoun from the United States. High on the wall above these reigned the
      bronze death-mask of a famous Apache Chief, cast from a plaster taken of
      the face by a professor of Yale College, who had declared it to be a
      perfect specimen of the vanishing race. That visage, which had a certain
      weird resemblance to Dante&rsquo;s, presided over the room with cruel, tragic
      stoicism. No one could look on it without feeling that, there, the human
      will had been pushed to its farthest limits of endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing it for the first time, Courtier said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine thing&mdash;that! Only wants a soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun nodded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtier sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed one of those silences in which men whose spirits, though
      different, have a certain bigness in common&mdash;can say so much to one
      another:
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Miltoun spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been living in the clouds, it seems. You are her oldest friend.
      The immediate question is how to make it easiest for her in face of this
      miserable rumour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not even Courtier himself could have put such whip-lash sting into the
      word &lsquo;miserable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! take no notice of that. Let them stew in their own juice. She won&rsquo;t
      care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun listened, not moving a muscle of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friends here,&rdquo; went on Courtier with a touch of contempt, &ldquo;seem in a
      flutter. Don&rsquo;t let them do anything, don&rsquo;t let them say a word. Treat the
      thing as it deserves to be treated. It&rsquo;ll die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun, however, smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the consequences will be as you think, but
      I shall do as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for your candidature, any man with a spark of generosity in his soul
      will rally to you because of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Miltoun. &ldquo;It will lose me the election, for all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, dimly conscious that their last words had revealed the difference of
      their temperaments and creeds, they stared at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Courtier, &ldquo;I never will believe that people can be so mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, though we get at it in different ways, we agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun leaned his elbow on the mantelpiece, and shading his face with his
      hand, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know her story. Is there any way out of that, for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On Courtier&rsquo;s face was the look which so often came when he was speaking
      for one of his lost causes&mdash;as if the fumes from a fire in his heart
      had mounted to his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the way,&rdquo; he answered calmly, &ldquo;that I should take if I were you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law into your own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun unshaded his face. His gaze seemed to have to travel from an
      immense distance before it reached Courtier. He answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I thought you would say that.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      When everything, that night, was quiet, Barbara, her hair hanging loose
      outside her dressing gown, slipped from her room into the dim corridor.
      With bare feet thrust into fur-crowned slippers which made no noise, she
      stole along looking at door after door. Through a long Gothic window,
      uncurtained, the mild moonlight was coming. She stopped just where that
      moonlight fell, and tapped. There came no answer. She opened the door a
      little way, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you asleep, Eusty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There still came no answer, and she went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtains were drawn, but a chink of moonlight peering through fell on
      the bed. This was empty. Barbara stood uncertain, listening. In the heart
      of that darkness there seemed to be, not sound, but, as it were, the
      muffled soul of sound, a sort of strange vibration, like that of a flame
      noiselessly licking the air. She put her hand to her heart, which beat as
      though it would leap through the thin silk covering. From what corner of
      the room was that mute tremor coming? Stealing to the window, she parted
      the curtains, and stared back into the shadows. There, on the far side,
      lying on the floor with his arms pressed tightly round his head and his
      face to the wall, was Miltoun. Barbara let fall the curtains, and stood
      breathless, with such a queer sensation in her breast as she had never
      felt; a sense of something outraged-of scarred pride. It was gone at once,
      in a rush of pity. She stepped forward quickly in the darkness, was
      visited by fear, and stopped. He had seemed absolutely himself all the
      evening. A little more talkative, perhaps, a little more caustic than
      usual. And now to find him like this! There was no great share of
      reverence in Barbara, but what little she possessed had always been kept
      for her eldest brother. He had impressed her, from a child, with his
      aloofness, and she had been proud of kissing him because he never seemed
      to let anybody else do so. Those caresses, no doubt, had the savour of
      conquest; his face had been the undiscovered land for her lips. She loved
      him as one loves that which ministers to one&rsquo;s pride; had for him, too, a
      touch of motherly protection, as for a doll that does not get on too well
      with the other dolls; and withal a little unaccustomed awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dared she now plunge in on this private agony? Could she have borne that
      anyone should see herself thus prostrate? He had not heard her, and she
      tried to regain the door. But a board creaked; she heard him move, and
      flinging away her fears, said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me! Babs!&rdquo; and dropped on her knees
      beside him. If it had not been so pitch dark she could never have done
      that. She tried at once to take his head into her arms, but could not see
      it, and succeeded indifferently. She could but stroke his arm continually,
      wondering whether he would hate her ever afterwards, and blessing the
      darkness, which made it all seem as though it were not happening, yet so
      much more poignant than if it had happened. Suddenly she felt him slip
      away from her, and getting up, stole out. After the darkness of that room,
      the corridor seemed full of grey filmy light, as though dream-spiders had
      joined the walls with their cobwebs, in which innumerable white moths, so
      tiny that they could not be seen, were struggling. Small eerie noises
      crept about. A sudden frightened longing for warmth, and light, and colour
      came to Barbara. She fled back to her room. But she could not sleep. That
      terrible mute unseen vibration in the unlighted room-like the noiseless
      licking of a flame at bland air; the touch of Miltoun&rsquo;s hand, hot as fire
      against her cheek and neck; the whole tremulous dark episode, possessed
      her through and through. Thus had the wayward force of Love chosen to
      manifest itself to her in all its wistful violence. At this fiat sight of
      the red flower of passion her cheeks burned; up and down her, between the
      cool sheets, little hot cruel shivers ran; she lay, wide-eyed, staring at
      the ceiling. She thought, of the woman whom he so loved, and wondered if
      she too were lying sleepless, flung down on a bare floor, trying to cool
      her forehead and lips against a cold wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for hours did she fall asleep, and then dreamed of running desperately
      through fields full of tall spiky asphodel-like flowers, and behind her
      was running herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning she dreaded to go down. Could she meet Miltoun now that she
      knew of the passion in him, and he knew that she knew it? She had her
      breakfast brought upstairs. Before she had finished Miltoun himself came
      in. He looked more than usually self-contained, not to say ironic, and
      only remarked: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to ride you might take this note for me
      over to old Haliday at Wippincott.&rdquo; By his coming she knew that he was
      saying all he ever meant to say about that dark incident. And sympathizing
      completely with a reticence which she herself felt to be the only possible
      way out for both of them, Barbara looked at him gratefully, took the note
      and said: &ldquo;All right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, after glancing once or twice round the room, Miltoun went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left her restless, divested of the cloak &lsquo;of course,&rsquo; in a strange mood
      of questioning, ready as it were for the sight of the magpie wings of
      Life, and to hear their quick flutterings. Talk jarred on her that
      morning, with its sameness and attachment to the facts of the present and
      the future, its essential concern with the world as it was-she avoided all
      companionship on her ride. She wanted to be told of things that were not,
      yet might be, to peep behind the curtain, and see the very spirit of
      mortal happenings escaped from prison. And this was all so unusual with
      Barbara, whose body was too perfect, too sanely governed by the flow of
      her blood not to revel in the moment and the things thereof. She knew it
      was unusual. After her ride she avoided lunch, and walked out into the
      lanes. But about two o&rsquo;clock, feeling very hungry, she went into a
      farmhouse, and asked for milk. There, in the kitchen, like young jackdaws
      in a row with their mouths a little open, were the three farm boys, seated
      on a bench gripped to the alcove of the great fire-way, munching bread and
      cheese. Above their heads a gun was hung, trigger upwards, and two hams
      were mellowing in the smoke. At the feet of a black-haired girl, who was
      slicing onions, lay a sheep dog of tremendous age, with nose stretched out
      on paws, and in his little blue eyes a gleam of approaching immortality.
      They all stared at, Barbara. And one of the boys, whose face had the
      delightful look of him who loses all sense of other things in what he is
      seeing at the moment, smiled, and continued smiling, with sheer pleasure.
      Barbara drank her milk, and wandered out again; passing through a gate at
      the bottom of a steep, rocky tor, she sat down on a sun-warmed stone. The
      sunlight fell greedily on her here, like an invisible swift hand touching
      her all over, and specially caressing her throat and face. A very gentle
      wind, which dived over the tor tops into the young fern; stole down at
      her, spiced with the fern sap. All was warmth and peace, and only the
      cuckoos on the far thorn trees&mdash;as though stationed by the Wistful
      Master himself&mdash;were there to disturb her heart: But all the
      sweetness and piping of the day did not soothe her. In truth, she could
      not have said what was the matter, except that she felt so discontented,
      and as it were empty of all but a sort of aching impatience with&mdash;what
      exactly she could not say. She had that rather dreadful feeling of
      something slipping by which she could not catch. It was so new to her to
      feel like that&mdash;for no girl was less given to moods and repinings.
      And all the time a sort of contempt for this soft and almost sentimental
      feeling made her tighten her lips and frown. She felt distrustful and
      sarcastic towards a mood so utterly subversive of that fetich &lsquo;Hardness,&rsquo;
      to the unconscious worship of which she had been brought up. To stand no
      sentiment or nonsense either in herself or others was the first article of
      faith; not to slop-over anywhere. So that to feel as she did was almost
      horrible to Barbara. Yet she could not get rid of the sensation. With
      sudden recklessness she tried giving herself up to it entirely. Undoing
      the scarf at her throat, she let the air play on her bared neck, and
      stretched out her arms as if to hug the wind to her; then, with a sigh,
      she got up, and walked on. And now she began thinking of &lsquo;Anonyma&rsquo;;
      turning her position over and over. The idea that anyone young and
      beautiful should thus be clipped off in her life, roused her impatient
      indignation. Let them try it with her! They would soon see! For all her
      cultivated &lsquo;hardness,&rsquo; Barbara really hated anything to suffer. It seemed
      to her unnatural. She never went to that hospital where Lady Valleys had a
      ward, nor to their summer camp for crippled children, nor to help in their
      annual concert for sweated workers, without a feeling of such vehement
      pity that it was like being seized by the throat: Once, when she had been
      singing to them, the rows of wan, pinched faces below had been too much
      for her; she had broken down, forgotten her words, lost memory of the
      tune, and just ended her performance with a smile, worth more perhaps to
      her audience than those lost verses. She never came away from such sights
      and places without a feeling of revolt amounting almost to rage; and she
      only continued to go because she dimly knew that it was expected of her
      not to turn her back on such things, in her section of Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not this feeling which made her stop before Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s
      cottage; nor was it curiosity. It was a quite simple desire to squeeze her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anonyma&rsquo; seemed taking her trouble as only those women who are no good at
      self-assertion can take things&mdash;doing exactly as she would have done
      if nothing had happened; a little paler than usual, with lips pressed
      rather tightly together.
    </p>
    <p>
      They neither of them spoke at first, but stood looking, not at each
      other&rsquo;s faces, but at each other&rsquo;s breasts. At last Barbara stepped
      forward impulsively and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, like two children who kiss first, and then make acquaintance,
      they stood apart, silent, faintly smiling. It had been given and returned
      in real sweetness and comradeship, that kiss, for a sign of womanhood
      making face against the world; but now that it was over, both felt a
      little awkward. Would that kiss have been given if Fate had been
      auspicious? Was it not proof of misery? So Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s smile seemed
      saying, and Barbara&rsquo;s smile unwillingly admitted. Perceiving that if they
      talked it could only be about the most ordinary things, they began
      speaking of music, flowers, and the queerness of bees&rsquo; legs. But all the
      time, Barbara, though seemingly unconscious, was noting with her smiling
      eyes, the tiny movement&rsquo;s, by which one woman can tell what is passing in
      another. She saw a little quiver tighten the corner of the lips, the eyes
      suddenly grow large and dark, the thin blouse desperately rise and fall.
      And her fancy, quickened by last night&rsquo;s memory, saw this woman giving
      herself up to the memory of love in her thoughts. At this sight she felt a
      little of that impatience which the conquering feel for the passive, and
      perhaps just a touch of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever Miltoun decided, that would this woman accept! Such resignation,
      while it simplified things, offended the part of Barbara which rebelled
      against all inaction, all dictation, even from her favourite brother. She
      said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to do nothing? Aren&rsquo;t you going to try and free yourself?
      If I were in your position, I would never rest till I&rsquo;d made them free
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Noel did not answer; and sweeping her glance from that crown of
      soft dark hair, down the soft white figure, to the very feet, Barbara
      cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are a fatalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon after that, not knowing what more to say, she went away. But walking
      home across the fields, where full summer was swinging on the delicious
      air and there was now no bull but only red cows to crop short the
      &lsquo;milk-maids&rsquo; and buttercups, she suffered from this strange revelation of
      the strength of softness and passivity&mdash;as though she had seen in the
      white figure of &lsquo;Anonyma,&rsquo; and heard in her voice something from beyond,
      symbolic, inconceivable, yet real.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys, relieved from official pressure by subsidence of the war
      scare, had returned for a long week-end. To say that he had been intensely
      relieved by the news that Mrs. Noel was not free, would be to put it
      mildly. Though not old-fashioned, like his mother-in-law, in regard to the
      mixing of the castes, prepared to admit that exclusiveness was out of
      date, to pass over with a shrug and a laugh those numerous alliances by
      which his order were renewing the sinews of war, and indeed in his
      capacity of an expert, often pointing out the dangers of too much
      in-breeding&mdash;yet he had a peculiar personal feeling about his own
      family, and was perhaps a little extra sensitive because of Agatha; for
      Shropton, though a good fellow, and extremely wealthy, was only a third
      baronet, and had originally been made of iron. It was inadvisable to go
      outside the inner circle where there was no material necessity for so
      doing. He had not done it himself. Moreover there was a sentiment about
      these things!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning after his arrival, visiting the kennels before breakfast,
      he stood chatting with his head man, and caressing the wet noses of his
      two favourite pointers,&mdash;with something of the feeling of a boy let
      out of school. Those pleasant creatures, cowering and quivering with pride
      against his legs, and turning up at him their yellow Chinese eyes, gave
      him that sense of warmth and comfort which visits men in the presence of
      their hobbies. With this particular pair, inbred to the uttermost, he had
      successfully surmounted a great risk. It was now touch and go whether he
      dared venture on one more cross to the original strain, in the hope of
      eliminating the last clinging of liver colour. It was a gamble&mdash;and
      it was just that which rendered it so vastly interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small voice diverted his attention; he looked round and saw little Ann.
      She had been in bed when he arrived the night before, and he was therefore
      the newest thing about.
    </p>
    <p>
      She carried in her arms a guinea-pig, and began at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpapa, Granny wants you. She&rsquo;s on the terrace; she&rsquo;s talking to Mr.
      Courtier. I like him&mdash;he&rsquo;s a kind man. If I put my guinea-pig down,
      will they bite it? Poor darling&mdash;they shan&rsquo;t! Isn&rsquo;t it a darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys, twirling his moustache, regarded the guinea-pig without
      favour; he had rather a dislike for all senseless kinds of beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pressing the guinea-pig between her hands, as it might be a concertina,
      little Ann jigged it gently above the pointers, who, wrinkling horribly
      their long noses, gazed upwards, fascinated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor darlings, they want it&mdash;don&rsquo;t they? Grandpapa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think the next puppies will be spotted quite all over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Continuing to twirl his moustache, Lord Valleys answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is not improbable, Ann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you like them spotted like that? Oh! they&rsquo;re kissing Sambo&mdash;I
      must go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys followed her, his eyebrows a little raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached the terrace his wife came, towards him. Her colour was,
      deeper than usual, and she had the look, higher and more resolute,
      peculiar to her when she had been opposed. In truth she had just been
      through a passage of arms with Courtier, who, as the first revealer of
      Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s situation, had become entitled to a certain confidence on this
      subject. It had arisen from what she had intended as a perfectly natural
      and not unkind remark, to the effect that all the trouble had come from
      Mrs. Noel not having made her position clear to Miltoun from the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had at once grown very red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy, Lady Valleys, for those who have never been in the position of
      a lonely woman, to blame her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unaccustomed to be withstood, she had looked at him intently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the last person to be hard on a woman for conventional reasons. But
      I think it showed lack of character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier&rsquo;s reply had been almost rude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plants are not equally robust, Lady Valleys. Some, as we know, are
      actually sensitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had retorted with decision
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like to so dignify the simpler word &lsquo;weak&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had become very rigid at that, biting deeply into his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What crimes are not committed under the sanctity of that creed &lsquo;survival
      of the fittest,&rsquo; which suits the book of all you fortunate people so
      well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Priding herself on her restraint, Lady Valleys answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! we must talk that out. On the face of them your words sound a little
      unphilosophic, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had looked straight at her with a queer, unpleasant smile; and she had
      felt at once disturbed and angry. It was all very well to pet and even to
      admire these original sort of men, but there were limits. Remembering,
      however, that he was her guest, she had only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps after all we had better not talk it out;&rdquo; and moving away, she
      heard him answer: &ldquo;In any case, I&rsquo;m certain Audrey Noel never wilfully
      kept your son in the dark; she&rsquo;s much too proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though rude, she could not help liking the way he stuck up for this woman;
      and she threw back at him the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and I, Mr. Courtier, must have a good fight some day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went towards her husband conscious of the rather pleasurable sensation
      which combat always roused in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two were very good comrades. Theirs had been a love match, and
      making due allowance for human nature beset by opportunity, had remained,
      throughout, a solid and efficient alliance. Taking, as they both did, such
      prominent parts in public and social matters, the time they spent together
      was limited, but productive of mutual benefit and reinforcement. They had
      not yet had an opportunity of discussing their son&rsquo;s affair; and, slipping
      her hand through his arm, Lady Valleys drew him away from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk to you about Miltoun, Geoff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Lord Valleys; &ldquo;yes. The boy&rsquo;s looking worn. Good thing when
      this election&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s beaten and hasn&rsquo;t something new and serious to concentrate
      himself on, he&rsquo;ll fret his heart out over that woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys meditated a little before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that, Gertrude. He&rsquo;s got plenty of spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! But it&rsquo;s a real passion. And, you know, he&rsquo;s not like most
      boys, who&rsquo;ll take what they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said this rather wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for the woman,&rdquo; mused Lord Valleys; &ldquo;I really am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say this rumour&rsquo;s done a lot of harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our influence is strong enough to survive that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a squeak; I wish I knew what he was going to do. Will you ask
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re clearly the person to speak to him,&rdquo; replied Lord Valleys. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no
      hand at that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Valleys, with genuine discomfort, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I&rsquo;m so nervous with Eustace. When he puts on that smile of his
      I&rsquo;m done for, at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is obviously a woman&rsquo;s business; nobody like a mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were only one of the others,&rdquo; muttered Lady Valleys: &ldquo;Eustace has
      that queer way of making you feel lumpy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys looked at her askance. He had that kind of critical
      fastidiousness which a word will rouse into activity. Was she lumpy? The
      idea had never struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll do it, if I must,&rdquo; sighed Lady Valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      When after breakfast she entered Miltoun&rsquo;s &lsquo;den,&rsquo; he was buckling on his
      spurs preparatory, to riding out to some of the remoter villages. Under
      the mask of the Apache chief, Bertie was standing, more inscrutable and
      neat than ever, in a perfectly tied cravatte, perfectly cut riding
      breeches, and boots worn and polished till a sooty glow shone through
      their natural russet. Not specially dandified in his usual dress, Bertie
      Caradoc would almost sooner have died than disgrace a horse. His eyes, the
      sharper because they had only half the space of the ordinary eye to glance
      from, at once took in the fact that his mother wished to be alone with
      &lsquo;old Miltoun,&rsquo; and he discreetly left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      That which disconcerted all who had dealings with Miltoun was the
      discovery made soon or late, that they could not be sure how anything
      would strike him. In his mind, as in his face, there was a certain
      regularity, and then&mdash;impossible to say exactly where&mdash;it would,
      shoot off and twist round a corner. This was the legacy no doubt of the
      hard-bitten individuality, which had brought to the front so many of his
      ancestors; for in Miltoun was the blood not only of the Caradocs and
      Fitz-Harolds, but of most other prominent families in the kingdom, all of
      whom, in those ages before money made the man, must have had a forbear
      conspicuous by reason of qualities, not always fine, but always poignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, though Lady Valleys had the audacity of her physique, and was not
      customarily abashed, she began by speaking of politics, hoping her son
      would give her an opening. But he gave her none, and she grew nervous. At
      last, summoning all her coolness, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreadfully sorry about this affair, dear boy. Your father told me of
      your talk with him. Try not to take it too hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun did not answer, and silence being that which Lady Valleys
      habitually most dreaded, she took refuge in further speech, outlining for
      her son the whole episode as she saw it from her point of view, and ending
      with these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely it&rsquo;s not worth it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun heard her with his peculiar look, as of a man peering through a
      vizor. Then smiling, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you;&rdquo; and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys, without quite knowing whether he intended her to do so,
      indeed without quite knowing anything at the moment, passed out, and
      Miltoun closed the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later he and Bertie were seen riding down the drive.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      That afternoon the wind, which had been rising steadily, brought a flurry
      of clouds up from the South-West. Formed out on the heart of the Atlantic,
      they sailed forward, swift and fleecy at first, like the skirmishing white
      shallops of a great fleet; then, in serried masses, darkened the sun.
      About four o&rsquo;clock they broke in rain, which the wind drove horizontally
      with a cold whiffling murmur. As youth and glamour die in a face before
      the cold rains of life, so glory died on the moor. The tors, from being
      uplifted wild castles, became mere grey excrescences. Distance failed. The
      cuckoos were silent. There was none of the beauty that there is in death,
      no tragic greatness&mdash;all was moaning and monotony. But about seven
      the sun tore its way back through the swathe, and flared out. Like some
      huge star, whose rays were stretching down to the horizon, and up to the
      very top of the hill of air, it shone with an amazing murky glamour; the
      clouds splintered by its shafts, and tinged saffron, piled themselves up
      as if in wonder. Under the sultry warmth of this new great star, the
      heather began to steam a little, and the glitter of its wet unopened bells
      was like that of innumerable tiny smoking fires. The two brothers were
      drenched as they cantered silently home. Good friends always, they had
      never much to say to one another. For Miltoun was conscious that he
      thought on a different plane from Bertie; and Bertie grudged even to his
      brother any inkling of what was passing in his spirit, just as he grudged
      parting with diplomatic knowledge, or stable secrets, or indeed anything
      that might leave him less in command of life. He grudged it, because in a
      private sort of way it lowered his estimation of his own stoical
      self-sufficiency; it hurt something proud in the withdrawing-room of his
      soul. But though he talked little, he had the power of contemplation&mdash;often
      found in men of decided character, with a tendency to liver. Once in
      Nepal, where he had gone to shoot, he had passed a month quite happily
      with only a Ghoorka servant who could speak no English. To those who asked
      him if he had not been horribly bored, he had always answered: &ldquo;Not a bit;
      did a lot of thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With Miltoun&rsquo;s trouble he had the professional sympathy of a brother and
      the natural intolerance of a confirmed bachelor. Women were to him very
      kittle-cattle. He distrusted from the bottom of his soul those who had
      such manifest power to draw things from you. He was one of those men in
      whom some day a woman might awaken a really fine affection; but who, until
      that time, would maintain the perfectly male attitude to the entire sex,
      and, after it, to all the sex but one. Women were, like Life itself,
      creatures to be watched, carefully used, and kept duly subservient. The
      only allusion therefore that he made to Miltoun&rsquo;s trouble was very sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old man, I hope you&rsquo;re going to cut your losses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were followed by undisturbed silence: But passing Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s
      cottage Miltoun said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my horse on; I want to go in here.&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting at her piano with her hands idle, looking at a line of
      music.... She had been sitting thus for many minutes, but had not yet
      taken in the notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Miltoun&rsquo;s shadow blotted the light by which she was seeing so little,
      she gave a slight start, and got up. But she neither went towards him, nor
      spoke. And he, without a word, came in and stood by the hearth, looking
      down at the empty grate. A tortoise-shell cat which had been watching
      swallows, disturbed by his entrance, withdrew from the window beneath a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      This silence, in which the question of their future lives was to be
      decided, seemed to both interminable; yet, neither could end it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, touching his sleeve, she said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun shivered at that timid sign of possession. And they again stood in
      silence broken only by the sound of the cat licking its paws.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her faculty for dumbness was stronger than his, and&mdash;he had to
      speak first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me for coming; something must be settled. This&mdash;rumour&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is there anything I can do to stop the harm to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the turn of Miltoun&rsquo;s lips to curl. &ldquo;God! no; let them talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes had come together now, and, once together, seemed unable to
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Noel said at last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ever forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for&mdash;it was my fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I should have known you better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The depth of meaning in those words&mdash;the tremendous and subtle
      admission they contained of all that she had been ready to do, the
      despairing knowledge in them that he was not, and never had been, ready to
      &lsquo;bear it out even to the edge of doom&rsquo;&mdash;made Miltoun wince away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not from fear&mdash;believe that, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed another long, long silence! But though so close that they
      were almost touching, they no longer looked at one another. Then Miltoun
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only to say good-bye, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At those clear words spoken by lips which, though just smiling, failed so
      utterly to hide his misery, Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s face became colourless as her
      white gown. But her eyes, which had grown immense, seemed from the sheer
      lack of all other colour, to have drawn into them the whole of her
      vitality; to be pouring forth a proud and mournful reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shivering, and crushing himself together with his arms, Miltoun walked
      towards the window. There was not the faintest sound from her, and he
      looked back. She was following him with her eyes. He threw his hand up
      over his face, and went quickly out. Mrs. Noel stood for a little while
      where he had left her; then, sitting down once more at the piano, began
      again to con over the line of music. And the cat stole back to the window
      to watch the swallows. The sunlight was dying slowly on the top branches
      of the lime-tree; a drizzling rain began to fall.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Claud Fresnay, Viscount Harbinger was, at the age of thirty-one, perhaps
      the least encumbered peer in the United Kingdom. Thanks to an ancestor who
      had acquired land, and departed this life one hundred and thirty years
      before the town of Nettlefold was built on a small portion of it, and to a
      father who had died in his son&rsquo;s infancy, after judiciously selling the
      said town, he possessed a very large income independently of his landed
      interests. Tall and well-built, with handsome, strongly-marked features,
      he gave at first sight an impression of strength&mdash;which faded
      somewhat when he began to talk. It was not so much the manner of his
      speech&mdash;with its rapid slang, and its way of turning everything to a
      jest&mdash;as the feeling it produced, that the brain behind it took
      naturally the path of least resistance. He was in fact one of those
      personalities who are often enough prominent in politics and social life,
      by reason of their appearance, position, assurance, and of a certain
      energy, half genuine, and half mere inherent predilection for short cuts.
      Certainly he was not idle, had written a book, travelled, was a Captain of
      Yeomanry, a Justice of the Peace, a good cricketer, and a constant and
      glib speaker. It would have been unfair to call his enthusiasm for social
      reform spurious. It was real enough in its way, and did certainly testify
      that he was not altogether lacking either in imagination or
      good-heartedness. But it was over and overlaid with the public-school
      habit&mdash;that peculiar, extraordinarily English habit, so powerful and
      beguiling that it becomes a second nature stronger than the first&mdash;of
      relating everything in the Universe to the standards and prejudices of a
      single class. Since practically all his intimate associates were immersed
      in it, he was naturally not in the least conscious of this habit; indeed
      there was nothing he deprecated so much in politics as the narrow and
      prejudiced outlook, such as he had observed in the Nonconformist, or
      labour politician. He would never have admitted for a moment that certain
      doors had been banged-to at his birth, bolted when he went to Eton, and
      padlocked at Cambridge. No one would have denied that there was much that
      was valuable in his standards&mdash;a high level of honesty, candour,
      sportsmanship, personal cleanliness, and self-reliance, together with a
      dislike of such cruelty as had been officially (so to speak) recognized as
      cruelty, and a sense of public service to a State run by and for the
      public schools; but it would have required far more originality than he
      possessed ever to look at Life from any other point of view than that from
      which he had been born and bred to watch Her. To fully understand
      harbinger, one must, and with unprejudiced eyes and brain, have attended
      one of those great cricket matches in which he had figured conspicuously
      as a boy, and looking down from some high impartial spot have watched the
      ground at lunch time covered from rope to rope and stand to stand with a
      marvellous swarm, all walking in precisely the same manner, with precisely
      the same expression on their faces, under precisely the same hats&mdash;a
      swarm enshrining the greatest identity of, creed and habit ever known
      since the world began. No, his environment had not been favourable to
      originality. Moreover he was naturally rapid rather than deep, and life
      hardly ever left him alone or left him silent. Brought into contact day
      and night with people to whom politics were more or less a game; run after
      everywhere; subjected to no form of discipline&mdash;it was a wonder that
      he was as serious as he was. Nor had he ever been in love, until, last
      year, during her first season, Barbara had, as he might have expressed it&mdash;in
      the case of another &lsquo;bowled him middle stump. Though so deeply smitten, he
      had not yet asked her to marry him&mdash;had not, as it were, had time,
      nor perhaps quite the courage, or conviction. When he was near her, it
      seemed impossible that he could go on longer without knowing his fate;
      when he was away from her it was almost a relief, because there were so
      many things to be done and said, and so little time to do or say them in.
      But now, during this fortnight, which, for her sake, he had devoted to
      Miltoun&rsquo;s cause, his feeling had advanced beyond the point of comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not admit that the reason of this uneasiness was Courtier, for,
      after all, Courtier was, in a sense, nobody, and &lsquo;an extremist&rsquo; into the
      bargain, and an extremist always affected the centre of Harbinger&rsquo;s
      anatomy, causing it to give off a peculiar smile and tone of voice.
      Nevertheless, his eyes, whenever they fell on that sanguine, steady,
      ironic face, shone with a sort of cold inquiry, or were even darkened by
      the shade of fear. They met seldom, it is true, for most of his day was
      spent in motoring and speaking, and most of Courtier&rsquo;s in writing and
      riding, his leg being still too weak for walking. But once or twice in the
      smoking room late at night, he had embarked on some bantering discussion
      with the champion of lost causes; and very soon an ill-concealed
      impatience had crept into his voice. Why a man should waste his time,
      flogging dead horses on a journey to the moon, was incomprehensible! Facts
      were facts, human nature would never be anything but human nature! And it
      was peculiarly galling to see in Courtier&rsquo;s eye a gleam, to catch in his
      voice a tone, as if he were thinking: &ldquo;My young friend, your soup is
      cold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On a morning after one of these encounters, seeing Barbara sally forth in
      riding clothes, he asked if he too might go round the stables, and started
      forth beside her, unwontedly silent, with an odd feeling about his heart,
      and his throat unaccountably dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stables at Monkland Court were as large as many country houses.
      Accommodating thirty horses, they were at present occupied by twenty-one,
      including the pony of little Ann. For height, perfection of lighting,
      gloss, shine, and purity of atmosphere they were unequalled in the county.
      It seemed indeed impossible that any horse could ever so far forget
      himself in such a place as to remember that he was a horse. Every morning
      a little bin of carrots, apples, and lumps of sugar, was set close to the
      main entrance, ready for those who might desire to feed the dear
      inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reined up to a brass ring on either side of their stalls with their noses
      towards the doors, they were always on view from nine to ten, and would
      stand with their necks arched, ears pricked, and coats gleaming, wondering
      about things, soothed by the faint hissing of the still busy grooms, and
      ready to move their noses up and down the moment they saw someone enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a large loose-box at the end of the north wing Barbara&rsquo;s favourite
      chestnut hunter, all but one saving sixteenth of whom had been entered in
      the stud book, having heard her footstep, was standing quite still with
      his neck turned. He had been crumping up an apple placed amongst his feed,
      and his senses struggled between the lingering flavour of that delicacy,&mdash;and
      the perception of a sound with which he connected carrots. When she
      unlatched his door, and said &ldquo;Hal,&rdquo; he at once went towards his manger, to
      show his independence, but when she said: &ldquo;Oh! very well!&rdquo; he turned round
      and came towards her. His eyes, which were full and of a soft brilliance,
      under thick chestnut lashes, explored her all over. Perceiving that her
      carrots were not in front, he elongated his neck, let his nose stray round
      her waist, and gave her gauntletted hand a nip with his lips. Not tasting
      carrot, he withdrew his nose, and snuffled. Then stepping carefully so as
      not to tread on her foot, he bunted her gently with his shoulder, till
      with a quick manoeuvre he got behind her and breathed low and long on her
      neck. Even this did not smell of carrots, and putting his muzzle over her
      shoulder against her cheek, he slobbered a very little. A carrot appeared
      about the level of her waist, and hanging his head over, he tried to reach
      it. Feeling it all firm and soft under his chin, he snuffled again, and
      gave her a gentle dig with his knee. But still unable to reach the carrot,
      he threw his head up, withdrew, and pretended not to see her. And suddenly
      he felt two long substances round his neck, and something soft against his
      nose. He suffered this in silence, laying his ears back. The softness
      began puffing on his muzzle. Pricking his ears again, he puffed back a
      little harder, with more curiosity, and the softness was withdrawn. He
      perceived suddenly that he had a carrot in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harbinger had witnessed this episode, oddly pale, leaning against the
      loose-box wall. He spoke, as it came to an end:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Babs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of his voice must have been as strange as it sounded to himself,
      for Barbara spun round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long am I going on like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither changing colour nor dropping her eyes, she regarded him with a
      faintly inquisitive interest. It was not a cruel look, had not a trace of
      mischief, or sex malice, and yet it frightened him by its serene
      inscrutability. Impossible to tell what was going on behind it. He took
      her hand, bent over it, and said in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I feel; don&rsquo;t be cruel to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not pull away her hand; it was as if she had not thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a bit cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking up, he saw her smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;Babs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was close to hers, but Barbara did not shrink back. She just
      shook her head; and Harbinger flushed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked; and as though the enormous injustice of that rejecting
      gesture had suddenly struck him, he dropped her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he said again, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the silence was only broken by the cheeping of sparrows outside the
      round window, and the sound of the horse, Hal, munching the last morsel of
      his carrot. Harbinger was aware in his every nerve of the sweetish,
      slightly acrid, husky odour of the loosebox, mingling with the scent of
      Barbara&rsquo;s hair and clothes. And rather miserably, he said for the third
      time:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But folding her hands away behind her back she answered gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, how should I know why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was calmly exposed to his embrace if he had only dared; but he did not
      dare, and went back to the loose-box wall. Biting his finger, he stared at
      her gloomily. She was stroking the muzzle of her horse; and a sort of dry
      rage began whisking and rustling in his heart. She had refused him&mdash;Harbinger!
      He had not known, had not suspected how much he wanted her. How could
      there be anybody else for him, while that young, calm, sweet-scented,
      smiling thing lived, to make his head go round, his senses ache, and to
      fill his heart with longing! He seemed to himself at that moment the most
      unhappy of all men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not give you up,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara&rsquo;s answer was a smile, faintly curious, compassionate, yet almost
      grateful, as if she had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;who knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And rather quickly, a yard or so apart, and talking of horses, they
      returned to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about noon, when, accompanied by Courtier, she rode forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sou-Westerly spell&mdash;a matter of three days&mdash;had given way
      before radiant stillness; and merely to be alive was to feel emotion. At a
      little stream running beside the moor under the wild stone man, the riders
      stopped their horses, just to listen, and, inhale the day. The far sweet
      chorus of life was tuned to a most delicate rhythm; not one of those small
      mingled pipings of streams and the lazy air, of beasts, men; birds, and
      bees, jarred out too harshly through the garment of sound enwrapping the
      earth. It was noon&mdash;the still moment&mdash;but this hymn to the sun,
      after his too long absence, never for a moment ceased to be murmured. And
      the earth wore an under-robe of scent, delicious, very finely woven of the
      young fern sap, heather buds; larch-trees not yet odourless, gorse just
      going brown, drifted woodsmoke, and the breath of hawthorn. Above Earth&rsquo;s
      twin vestments of sound and scent, the blue enwrapping scarf of air, that
      wistful wide champaign, was spanned only by the wings of Freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that long drink of the day, the riders mounted almost in silence to
      the very top of the moor. There again they sat quite still on their
      horses, examining the prospect. Far away to South and East lay the sea,
      plainly visible. Two small groups of wild ponies were slowly grazing
      towards each other on the hillside below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtier said in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Thus will I sit and sing, with love in my arms; watching our two herds
      mingle together, and below us the far, divine, cerulean sea.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, after another silence, looking steadily in Barbara&rsquo;s face, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Barbara, I am afraid this is the last time we shall be alone
      together. While I have the chance, therefore, I must do homage.... You
      will always be the fixed star for my worship. But your rays are too
      bright; I shall worship from afar. From your seventh Heaven, therefore,
      look down on me with kindly eyes, and do not quite forget me:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under that speech, so strangely compounded of irony and fervour, Barbara
      sat very still, with glowing cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Courtier, &ldquo;only an immortal must embrace a goddess. Outside
      the purlieus of Authority I shall sit cross-legged, and prostrate myself
      three times a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Barbara answered nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the early morning,&rdquo; went on Courtier, &ldquo;leaving the dark and dismal
      homes of Freedom I shall look towards the Temples of the Great; there with
      the eye of faith I shall see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, for Barbara&rsquo;s lips were moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt me, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier leaned over, took her hand, and put it to his lips. &ldquo;We will now
      ride on....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night at dinner Lord Dennis, seated opposite his great-niece, was
      struck by her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very beautiful child,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;a most lovely young creature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was placed between Courtier and Harbinger. And the old man&rsquo;s still
      keen eyes carefully watched those two. Though attentive to their
      neighbours on the other side, they were both of them keeping the corner of
      an eye on Barbara and on each other. The thing was transparent to Lord
      Dennis, and a smile settled in that nest of gravity between his white
      peaked beard and moustaches. But he waited, the instinct of a fisherman
      bidding him to neglect no piece of water, till he saw the child silent and
      in repose, and watched carefully to see what would rise. Although she was
      so calmly, so healthily eating, her eyes stole round at Courtier. This
      quick look seemed to Lord Dennis perturbed, as if something were exciting
      her. Then Harbinger spoke, and she turned to answer him. Her face was calm
      now, faintly smiling, a little eager, provocative in its joy of life. It
      made Lord Dennis think of his own youth. What a splendid couple! If Babs
      married young Harbinger there would not be a finer pair in all England.
      His eyes travelled back to Courtier. Manly enough! They called him
      dangerous! There was a look of effervescence, carefully corked down&mdash;might
      perhaps be attractive to a girl! To his essentially practical and sober
      mind, a type like Courtier was puzzling. He liked the look of him, but
      distrusted his ironic expression, and that appearance of blood to the
      head. Fellow&mdash;no doubt&mdash;that would ride off on his ideas,
      humanitarian! To Lord Dennis there was something queer about
      humanitarians. They offended perhaps his dry and precise sense of form.
      They were always looking out for cruelty or injustice; seemed delighted
      when they found it&mdash;swelled up, as it were, when they scented it, and
      as there was a good deal about, were never quite of normal size. Men who
      lived for ideas were, in fact, to one for whom facts sufficed always a
      little worrying! A movement from Barbara brought him back to actuality.
      Was the possessor of that crown of hair and those divine young shoulders
      the little Babs who had ridden with him in the Row? Time was certainly the
      Devil! Her eyes were searching for something; and following the direction
      of that glance, Lord Dennis found himself observing Miltoun. What a
      difference between those two! Both no doubt in the great trouble of youth;
      which sometimes, as he knew too well, lasted on almost to old age. It was
      a curious look the child was giving her brother, as if asking him to help
      her. Lord Dennis had seen in his day many young creatures leave the
      shelter of their freedom and enter the house of the great lottery; many,
      who had drawn a prize and thereat lost forever the coldness of life; many
      too, the light of whose eyes had faded behind the shutters of that house,
      having drawn a blank. The thought of &lsquo;little&rsquo; Babs on the threshold of
      that inexorable saloon, filled him with an eager sadness; and the sight of
      the two men watching for her, waiting for her, like hunters, was to him
      distasteful. In any case, let her not, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, go ranging as
      far as that red fellow of middle age, who might have ideas, but had no
      pedigree; let her stick to youth and her own order, and marry the&mdash;young
      man, confound him, who looked like a Greek god, of the wrong period,
      having grown a moustache. He remembered her words the other evening about
      these two and the different lives they lived. Some romantic notion or
      other was working in her! And again he looked at Courtier. A Quixotic type&mdash;the
      sort that rode slap-bang at everything! All very well&mdash;but not for
      Babs! She was not like the glorious Garibaldi&rsquo;s glorious Anita! It was
      truly characteristic of Lord Dennis&mdash;and indeed of other people&mdash;that
      to him champions of Liberty when dead were far dearer than champions of
      Liberty when living. Yes, Babs would want more, or was it less, than just
      a life of sleeping under the stars for the man she loved, and the cause he
      fought for. She would want pleasure, and, not too much effort, and
      presently a little power; not the uncomfortable after-fame of a woman who
      went through fire, but the fame and power of beauty, and Society prestige.
      This, fancy of hers, if it were a fancy, could be nothing but the
      romanticism of a young girl. For the sake of a passing shadow, to give up
      substance? It wouldn&rsquo;t do! And again Lord Dennis fixed his shrewd glance
      on his great-niece. Those eyes, that smile! Yes! She would grow out of
      this. And take the Greek god, the dying Gaul&mdash;whichever that young
      man was!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not till the morning of polling day itself that Courtier left
      Monkland Court. He had already suffered for some time from bad conscience.
      For his knee was practically cured, and he knew well that it was Barbara,
      and Barbara alone, who kept him staying there. The atmosphere of that big
      house with its army of servants, the impossibility of doing anything for
      himself, and the feeling of hopeless insulation from the vivid and
      necessitous sides of life, galled him greatly. He felt a very genuine pity
      for these people who seemed to lead an existence as it were smothered
      under their own social importance. It was not their fault. He recognized
      that they did their best. They were good specimens of their kind; neither
      soft nor luxurious, as things went in a degenerate and extravagant age;
      they evidently tried to be simple&mdash;and this seemed to him to heighten
      the pathos of their situation. Fate had been too much for them. What human
      spirit could emerge untrammelled and unshrunken from that great
      encompassing host of material advantage? To a Bedouin like Courtier, it
      was as though a subtle, but very terrible tragedy was all the time being
      played before his eyes; and in, the very centre of this tragedy was the
      girl who so greatly attracted him. Every night when he retired to that
      lofty room, which smelt so good, and where, without ostentation,
      everything was so perfectly ordered for his comfort, he thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, to-morrow I&rsquo;ll be off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But every morning when he met her at breakfast his thought was precisely
      the same, and there were moments when he caught himself wondering: &ldquo;Am I
      falling under the spell of this existence&mdash;am I getting soft?&rdquo; He
      recognized as never before that the peculiar artificial &lsquo;hardness&rsquo; of the
      patrician was a brine or pickle, in which, with the instinct of
      self-preservation they deliberately soaked themselves, to prevent the
      decay of their overprotected fibre. He perceived it even in Barbara&mdash;a
      sort of sentiment-proof overall, a species of mistrust of the emotional or
      lyrical, a kind of contempt of sympathy and feeling. And every day he was
      more and more tempted to lay rude hands on this garment; to see whether he
      could not make her catch fire, and flare up with some emotion or idea. In
      spite of her tantalizing, youthful self-possession, he saw that she felt
      this longing in him, and now and then he caught a glimpse of a streak of
      recklessness in her which lured him on:
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, when at last he was saying good-bye on the night before polling
      day, he could not flatter himself that he had really struck any spark from
      her. Certainly she gave him no chance, at that final interview, but stood
      amongst the other women, calm and smiling, as if determined that he should
      not again mock her with his ironical devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up very early the next morning, intending to pass away unseen. In
      the car put at his disposal; he found a small figure in a holland-frock,
      leaning back against the cushions so that some sandalled toes pointed up
      at the chauffeur&rsquo;s back. They belonged to little Ann, who in the course of
      business had discovered the vehicle before the door. Her sudden little
      voice under her sudden little nose, friendly but not too friendly, was
      comforting to Courtier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going? I can come as, far as the gate.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is lucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Is that all your luggage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s quite a lot, really, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much as I deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t have to take guinea-pigs about with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as a rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always do. There&rsquo;s great-Granny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There certainly was Lady Casterley, standing a little back from the drive,
      and directing a tall gardener how to deal with an old oak-tree. Courtier
      alighted, and went towards her to say good-bye. She greeted him with a
      certain grim cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are going! I am glad of that, though you quite understand that I
      like you personally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes gleamed maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men who laugh like you are dangerous, as I&rsquo;ve told you before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with great gravity; she added
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My granddaughter will marry Lord Harbinger. I mention that, Mr. Courtier,
      for your peace of mind. You are a man of honour; it will go no further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier, bowing over her hand, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be lucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little old lady regarded him unflinchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will, sir. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier smilingly raised his hat. His cheeks were burning. Regaining the
      car, he looked round. Lady Casterley was busy once more exhorting the tall
      gardener. The voice of little Ann broke in on his thoughts:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll come again. Because I expect I shall be here at Christmas;
      and my brothers will be here then, that is, Jock and Tiddy, not
      Christopher because he&rsquo;s young. I must go now. Good-bye! Hallo, Susie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier saw her slide away, and join the little pale adoring figure of
      the lodge-keeper&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car passed out into the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Lady Casterley had planned this disclosure, which indeed she had not,
      for the impulse had only come over her at the sound of Courtier&rsquo;s laugh,
      she could not have, devised one more effectual, for there was deep down in
      him all a wanderer&rsquo;s very real distrust, amounting almost to contempt, of
      people so settled and done for; as aristocrats or bourgeois, and all a man
      of action&rsquo;s horror of what he called puking and muling. The pursuit of
      Barbara with any other object but that of marriage had naturally not
      occurred to one who had little sense of conventional morality, but much
      self-respect; and a secret endeavour to cut out Harbinger, ending in a
      marriage whereat he would figure as a sort of pirate, was quite as little
      to the taste of a man not unaccustomed to think himself as good as other
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caused the car to deviate up the lane that led to Audrey Noel&rsquo;s, hating
      to go away without a hail of cheer to that ship in distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came out to him on the verandah. From the clasp of her hand, thin and
      faintly browned&mdash;the hand of a woman never quite idle&mdash;he felt
      that she relied on him to understand and sympathize; and nothing so
      awakened the best in Courtier as such mute appeals to his protection. He
      said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them think you&rsquo;re down;&rdquo; and, squeezing her hand hard: &ldquo;Why
      should you be wasted like this? It&rsquo;s a sin and shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he stopped in what he felt to be an unlucky speech at sight of her
      face, which without movement expressed so much more than his words. He was
      protesting as a civilized man; her face was the protest of Nature, the
      soundless declaration of beauty wasted against its will, beauty that was
      life&rsquo;s invitation to the embrace which gave life birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m clearing out, myself,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;You and I, you know, are not good
      for these people. No birds of freedom allowed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pressing his hand, she turned away into the house, leaving Courtier gazing
      at the patch of air where her white figure had stood. He had always had a
      special protective feeling for Audrey Noel, a feeling which with but
      little encouragement might have become something warmer. But since she had
      been placed in her anomalous position, he would not for the world have
      brushed the dew off her belief that she could trust him. And, now that he
      had fixed his own gaze elsewhere, and she was in this bitter trouble, he
      felt on her account the rancour that a brother feels when Justice and Pity
      have conspired to flout his sister. The voice of Frith the chauffeur
      roused him from gloomy reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Barbara, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following the man&rsquo;s eyes, Courtier saw against the sky-line on the for
      above Ashman&rsquo;s Folly, an equestrian statue. He stopped the car at once,
      and got out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached her at the ruin, screened from the road, by that divine chance
      which attends on men who take care that it shall. He could not tell
      whether she knew of his approach, and he would have given all he had,
      which was not much, to have seen through the stiff grey of her coat, and
      the soft cream of her body, into that mysterious cave, her heart. To have
      been for a moment, like Ashman, done for good and all with material
      things, and living the white life where are no barriers between man and
      woman. The smile on her lips so baffled him, puffed there by her spirit,
      as a first flower is puffed through the sur face of earth to mock at the
      spring winds. How tell what it signified! Yet he rather prided himself on
      his knowledge of women, of whom he had seen something. But all he found to
      say was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of this chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly looking up, he found her strangely pale and quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see you in London!&rdquo; she said; and, touching her horse with her
      whip, without looking back, she rode away over the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtier returned to the moor road, and getting into the car, muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faster, please, Frith!&rdquo;....

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Polling was already in brisk progress when Courtier arrived in
      Bucklandbury; and partly from a not unnatural interest in the result,
      partly from a half-unconscious clinging to the chance of catching another
      glimpse of Barbara, he took his bag to the hotel, determined to stay for
      the announcement of the poll. Strolling out into the High Street he began
      observing the humours of the day. The bloom of political belief had long
      been brushed off the wings of one who had so flown the world&rsquo;s winds. He
      had seen too much of more vivid colours to be capable now of venerating
      greatly the dull and dubious tints of blue and yellow. They left him
      feeling extremely philosophic. Yet it was impossible to get away from
      them, for the very world that day seemed blue and yellow, nor did the
      third colour of red adopted by both sides afford any clear assurance that
      either could see virtue in the other; rather, it seemed to symbolize the
      desire of each to have his enemy&rsquo;s blood. But Courtier soon observed by
      the looks cast at his own detached, and perhaps sarcastic, face, that even
      more hateful to either side than its antagonist, was the philosophic eye.
      Unanimous was the longing to heave half a brick at it whenever it showed
      itself. With its d&mdash;-d impartiality, its habit of looking through the
      integument of things to see if there might be anything inside, he felt
      that they regarded it as the real adversary&mdash;the eternal foe to all
      the little fat &lsquo;facts,&rsquo; who, dressed up in blue and yellow, were
      swaggering and staggering, calling each other names, wiping each other&rsquo;s
      eyes, blooding each other&rsquo;s noses. To these little solemn delicious
      creatures, all front and no behind, the philosophic eye, with its habit of
      looking round the corner, was clearly detestable. The very yellow and very
      blue bodies of these roistering small warriors with their hands on their
      tin swords and their lips on their tin trumpets, started up in every
      window and on every wall confronting each citizen in turn, persuading him
      that they and they alone were taking him to Westminster. Nor had they
      apparently for the most part much trouble with electors, who, finding
      uncertainty distasteful, passionately desired to be assured that the
      country could at once be saved by little yellow facts or little blue
      facts, as the case might be; who had, no doubt, a dozen other good reasons
      for being on the one side or the other; as, for instance, that their
      father had been so before them; that their bread was buttered yellow or
      buttered blue; that they had been on the other side last time; that they
      had thought it over and made up their minds; that they had innocent blue
      or naive yellow beer within; that his lordship was the man; or that the
      words proper to their mouths were &lsquo;Chilcox for Bucklandbury&rsquo;; and, above
      all, the one really creditable reason, that, so far as they could tell
      with the best of their intellect and feelings, the truth at the moment was
      either blue or yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrow high street was thronged with voters. Tall policemen stationed
      there had nothing to do. The certainty of all, that they were going to
      win, seemed to keep everyone in good humour. There was as yet no need to
      break anyone&rsquo;s head, for though the sharpest lookout was kept for any
      signs of the philosophic eye, it was only to be found&mdash;outside
      Courtier&mdash;in the perambulators of babies, in one old man who rode a
      bicycle waveringly along the street and stopped to ask a policeman what
      was the matter in the town, and in two rather green-faced fellows who
      trundled barrows full of favours both blue and yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Courtier eyed the &lsquo;facts&rsquo; with such suspicion, the keenness of
      everyone about the business struck him as really splendid. They went at it
      with a will. Having looked forward to it for months, they were going to
      look back on it for months. It was evidently a religious ceremony, summing
      up most high feelings; and this seemed to one who was himself a man of
      action, natural, perhaps pathetic, but certainly no matter for scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already late in the afternoon when there came debouching into the
      high street a long string of sandwichmen, each bearing before and behind
      him a poster containing these words beautifully situated in large dark
      blue letters against a pale blue ground:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    &ldquo;NEW COMPLICATIONS.
                      DANGER NOT PAST.
          VOTE FOR MILTOUN AND THE GOVERNMENT,
                    AND SAVE THE EMPIRE.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Courtier stopped to look at them with peculiar indignation. Not only did
      this poster tramp in again on his cherished convictions about Peace, but
      he saw in it something more than met the unphilosophic eye. It symbolized
      for him all that was catch-penny in the national life-an epitaph on the
      grave of generosity, unutterably sad. Yet from a Party point of view what
      could be more justifiable? Was it not desperately important that every
      blue nerve should be strained that day to turn yellow nerves, if not blue,
      at all events green, before night fell? Was it not perfectly true that the
      Empire could only be saved by voting blue? Could they help a blue paper
      printing the words, &lsquo;New complications,&rsquo; which he had read that morning?
      No more than the yellows could help a yellow journal printing the words
      &lsquo;Lord Miltoun&rsquo;s Evening Adventure.&rsquo; Their only business was to win, ever
      fighting fair. The yellows had not fought fair, they never did, and one of
      their most unfair tactics was the way they had of always accusing the
      blues of unfair fighting, an accusation truly ludicrous! As for truth!
      That which helped the world to be blue, was obviously true; that which
      didn&rsquo;t, as obviously not. There was no middle policy! The man who saw
      things neither was a softy, and no proper citizen. And as for giving the
      yellows credit for sincerity&mdash;the yellows never gave them credit! But
      though Courtier knew all that, this poster seemed to him particularly
      damnable, and he could not for the life of him resist striking one of the
      sandwich-boards with his cane. The resounding thwack startled a butcher&rsquo;s
      pony standing by the pavement. It reared, and bolted forward, with
      Courtier, who had naturally seized the rein, hanging on. A dog dashed
      past. Courtier tripped and fell. The pony, passing over, struck him on the
      head with a hoof. For a moment he lost consciousness; then coming to
      himself, refused assistance, and went to his hotel. He felt very giddy,
      and, after bandaging a nasty cut, lay down on his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun, returning from that necessary exhibition of himself, the crowning
      fact, at every polling centre, found time to go and see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That last poster of yours!&rdquo; Courtier began, at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having it withdrawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done the trick&mdash;congratulations&mdash;you&rsquo;ll get in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew nothing of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, I didn&rsquo;t suppose you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When there is a desert, Courtier, between a man and the sacred city, he
      doesn&rsquo;t renounce his journey because he has to wash in dirty water on the
      way: The mob&mdash;how I loathe it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was such pent-up fury in those words as to astonish even one whose
      life had been passed in conflict with majorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate its mean stupidities, I hate the sound of its voice, and the look
      on its face&mdash;it&rsquo;s so ugly, it&rsquo;s so little. Courtier, I suffer
      purgatory from the thought that I shall scrape in by the votes of the mob.
      There is sin in using this creature and I am expiating it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this strange outburst, Courtier at first made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been working too hard,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re off your balance.
      After all, the mob&rsquo;s made up of men like you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Courtier, the mob is not made up of men like you and me. If it were
      it would not be the mob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks,&rdquo; Courtier answered gravely, &ldquo;as if you had no business in this
      galley. I&rsquo;ve always steered clear of it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You follow your feelings. I have not that happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Miltoun turned to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtier&rsquo;s voice pursued him earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop your politics&mdash;if you feel like this about them; don&rsquo;t waste
      your life following whatever it is you follow; don&rsquo;t waste hers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miltoun did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wondrous still night, when, a few minutes before twelve, with his
      forehead bandaged under his hat, the champion of lost causes left the
      hotel and made his way towards the Grammar School for the declaration of
      the poll. A sound as of some monster breathing guided him, till, from a
      steep empty street he came in sight of a surging crowd, spread over the
      town square, like a dark carpet patterned by splashes of lamplight. High
      up above that crowd, on the little peaked tower of the Grammar School, a
      brightly lighted clock face presided; and over the passionate hopes in
      those thousands of hearts knit together by suspense the sky had lifted;
      and showed no cloud between them and the purple fields of air. To Courtier
      descending towards the square, the swaying white faces, turned all one
      way, seemed like the heads of giant wild flowers in a dark field, shivered
      by wind. The night had charmed away the blue and yellow facts, and
      breathed down into that throng the spirit of emotion. And he realized all
      at once the beauty and meaning of this scene&mdash;expression of the
      quivering forces, whose perpetual flux, controlled by the Spirit of
      Balance, was the soul of the world. Thousands of hearts with the thought
      of self lost in one over-mastering excitement!
    </p>
    <p>
      An old man with a long grey beard, standing close to his elbow, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis anxious work&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; missed this for anything in the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine, eh?&rdquo; answered Courtier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis fine. I&rsquo;ve not seen the like o&rsquo; this since
      the great year&mdash;forty-eight. There they are&mdash;the aristocrats!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following the direction of that skinny hand Courtier saw on a balcony Lord
      and Lady Valleys, side by side, looking steadily down at the crowd. There
      too, leaning against a window and talking to someone behind, was Barbara.
      The old man went on muttering, and Courtier could see that his eyes had
      grown very bright, his whole face transfigured by intense hostility; he
      felt drawn to this old creature, thus moved to the very soul. Then he saw
      Barbara looking down at him, with her hand raised to her temple to show
      that she saw his bandaged head. He had the presence of mind not to lift
      his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t remember forty-eight, I suppose. There was a feeling in the
      people then&mdash;we would ha&rsquo; died for things in those days. I&rsquo;m
      eighty-four,&rdquo; and he held his shaking hand up to his breast, &ldquo;but the
      spirit&rsquo;s alive here yet! God send the Radical gets in!&rdquo; There was wafted
      from him a scent as of potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far behind, at the very edge of the vast dark throng, some voices began
      singing: &ldquo;Way down upon the Swanee ribber.&rdquo; The tune floated forth,
      ceased, spurted up once more, and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in the very centre of the square a stentorian baritone roared forth:
      &ldquo;Should auld acquaintance be forgot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The song swelled, till every kind of voice, from treble to the old
      Chartist&rsquo;s quavering bass, was chanting it; here and there the crowd
      heaved with the movement of linked arms. Courtier found the soft fingers
      of a young woman in his right hand, the old Chartist&rsquo;s dry trembling paw
      in his left. He himself sang loudly. The grave and fearful music sprang
      straight up into they air, rolled out right and left, and was lost among
      the hills. But it had no sooner died away than the same huge baritone
      yelled &ldquo;God save our gracious King!&rdquo; The stature of the crowd seemed at
      once to leap up two feet, and from under that platform of raised hats rose
      a stupendous shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; thought Courtier, &ldquo;is religion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were singing even on the balconies; by the lamplight he could see
      Lord Valleys mouth not opened quite enough, as though his voice were just
      a little ashamed of coming out, and Barbara with her head flung back
      against the pillar, pouring out her heart. No mouth in all the crowd was
      silent. It was as though the soul of the English people were escaping from
      its dungeon of reserve, on the pinions of that chant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly, like a shot bird closing wings, the song fell silent and
      dived headlong back to earth. Out from under the clock-face had moved a
      thin dark figure. More figures came behind. Courtier could see Miltoun. A
      voice far away cried: &ldquo;Up; Chilcox!&rdquo; A huge: &ldquo;Husill&rdquo; followed; then such
      a silence, that the sound of an engine shunting a mile away could be heard
      plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark figure moved forward, and a tiny square of paper gleamed out
      white against the black of his frock-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen. Result of the Poll:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miltoun Four thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight. Chilcox Four
      thousand eight hundred and two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silence seemed to fall to earth, and break into a thousand pieces.
      Through the pandemonium of cheers and groaning, Courtier with all his
      strength forced himself towards the balcony. He could see Lord Valleys
      leaning forward with a broad smile; Lady Valleys passing her hand across
      her eyes; Barbara with her hand in Harbinger&rsquo;s, looking straight into his
      face. He stopped. The old Chartist was still beside him, tears rolling
      down his cheeks into his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtier saw Miltoun come forward, and stand, unsmiling, deathly pale.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of the nineteenth of July little Ann
      Shropton commenced the ascent of the main staircase of Valleys House,
      London. She climbed slowly, in the very middle, an extremely small white
      figure on those wide and shining stairs, counting them aloud. Their number
      was never alike two days running, which made them attractive to one for
      whom novelty was the salt of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming to that spot where they branched, she paused to consider which of
      the two flights she had used last, and unable to remember, sat down. She
      was the bearer of a message. It had been new when she started, but was
      already comparatively old, and likely to become older, in view of a design
      now conceived by her of travelling the whole length of the picture
      gallery. And while she sat maturing this plan, sunlight flooding through a
      large window drove a white refulgence down into the heart of the wide
      polished space of wood and marble, whence she had come. The nature of
      little Ann habitually rejected fairies and all fantastic things, finding
      them quite too much in the air, and devoid of sufficient reality and &lsquo;go&rsquo;;
      and this refulgence, almost unearthly in its travelling glory, passed over
      her small head and played strangely with the pillars in the hall, without
      exciting in her any fancies or any sentiment. The intention of discovering
      what was at the end of the picture gallery absorbed the whole of her
      essentially practical and active mind. Deciding on the left-hand flight of
      stairs, she entered that immensely long, narrow, and&mdash;with blinds
      drawn&mdash;rather dark saloon. She walked carefully, because the floor
      was very slippery here, and with a kind of seriousness due partly to the
      darkness and partly to the pictures. They were indeed, in this light,
      rather formidable, those old Caradocs black, armoured creatures, some of
      them, who seemed to eye with a sort of burning, grim, defensive greed the
      small white figure of their descendant passing along between them. But
      little Ann, who knew they were only pictures, maintained her course
      steadily, and every now and then, as she passed one who seemed to her
      rather uglier than the others, wrinkled her sudden little nose. At the
      end, as she had thought; appeared a door. She opened it, and passed on to
      a landing. There was a stone staircase in the corner, and there were two
      doors. It would be nice to go up the staircase, but it would also be nice
      to open the doors. Going towards the first door, with a little thrill, she
      turned the handle. It was one of those rooms, necessary in houses, for
      which she had no great liking; and closing this door rather loudly she
      opened the other one, finding herself in a chamber not resembling the
      rooms downstairs, which were all high and nicely gilded, but more like
      where she had lessons, low, and filled with books and leather chairs. From
      the end of the room which she could not see, she heard a sound as of
      someone kissing something, and instinct had almost made her turn to go
      away when the word: &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; suddenly opened her lips. And almost directly
      she saw that Granny and Grandpapa were standing by the fireplace. Not
      knowing quite whether they were glad to see her, she went forward and
      began at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this where you sit, Grandpapa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice, isn&rsquo;t it, Granny? Where does the stone staircase go to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the roof of the tower, Ann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I have to give a message, so I must go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to lose you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the door shut behind her, Lord and Lady Valleys looked at each
      other with a dubious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little interview which she had interrupted, had arisen in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accustomed to retire to this quiet and homely room, which was not his
      official study where he was always liable to the attacks of secretaries,
      Lord Valleys had come up here after lunch to smoke and chew the cud of a
      worry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter was one in connection with his Pendridny estate, in Cornwall.
      It had long agitated both his agent and himself, and had now come to him
      for final decision. The question affected two villages to the north of the
      property, whose inhabitants were solely dependent on the working of a
      large quarry, which had for some time been losing money.
    </p>
    <p>
      A kindly man, he was extremely averse to any measure which would plunge
      his tenants into distress, and especially in cases where there had been no
      question of opposition between himself and them. But, reduced to its
      essentials, the matter stood thus: Apart from that particular quarry the
      Pendridny estate was not only a going, but even a profitable concern,
      supporting itself and supplying some of the sinews of war towards Valleys
      House and the racing establishment at Newmarket and other general
      expenses; with this quarry still running, allowing for the upkeep of
      Pendridny, and the provision of pensions to superannuated servants, it was
      rather the other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting there, that afternoon, smoking his favourite pipe, he had at last
      come to the conclusion that there was nothing for it but to close down. He
      had not made this resolution lightly; though, to do him justice, the
      knowledge that the decision would be bound to cause an outcry in the
      local, and perhaps the National Press, had secretly rather spurred him on
      to the resolve than deterred him from it. He felt as if he were being
      dictated to in advance, and he did not like dictation. To have to deprive
      these poor people of their immediate living was, he knew, a good deal more
      irksome to him than to those who would certainly make a fuss about it, his
      conscience was clear, and he could discount that future outcry as mere
      Party spite. He had very honestly tried to examine the thing all round;
      and had reasoned thus: If I keep this quarry open, I am really admitting
      the principle of pauperization, since I naturally look to each of my
      estates to support its own house, grounds, shooting, and to contribute
      towards the support of this house, and my family, and racing stable, and
      all the people employed about them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      To allow any business to be run on my estates which does not contribute to
      the general upkeep, is to protect and really pauperize a portion of my
      tenants at the expense of the rest; it must therefore be false economics
      and a secret sort of socialism. Further, if logically followed out, it
      might end in my ruin, and to allow that, though I might not personally
      object, would be to imply that I do not believe that I am by virtue of my
      traditions and training, the best machinery through which the State can
      work to secure the welfare of the people....
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had reached that point in his consideration of the question, his
      mind, or rather perhaps, his essential self, had not unnaturally risen up
      and said: Which is absurd!
    </p>
    <p>
      Impersonality was in fashion, and as a rule he believed in thinking
      impersonally. There was a point, however, where the possibility of doing
      so ceased, without treachery to oneself, one&rsquo;s order, and the country. And
      to the argument which he was quite shrewd enough to put to himself, sooner
      than have it put by anyone else, that it was disproportionate for a single
      man by a stroke of the pen to be able to dispose of the livelihood of
      hundreds whose senses and feelings were similar to his own&mdash;he had
      answered: &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t, some plutocrat or company would&mdash;or, worse
      still, the State!&rdquo; Cooperative enterprise being, in his opinion, foreign
      to the spirit of the country, there was, so far as he could see, no other
      alternative. Facts were facts and not to be got over!
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding all this, the necessity for the decision made him sorry,
      for if he had no great sense of proportion, he was at least humane.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still smoking his pipe and staring at a sheet of paper covered with
      small figures when his wife entered. Though she had come to ask his advice
      on a very different subject, she saw at once that he was vexed, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Geoff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys rose, went to the hearth, deliberately tapped out his pipe,
      then held out to her the sheet of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That quarry! Nothing for it&mdash;must go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys&rsquo; face changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! It will mean such dreadful distress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys stared at his nails. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s putting a drag on the whole
      estate,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but how could we face the people&mdash;I should never be able to
      go down there. And most of them have such enormous families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since Lord Valleys continued to bend on his nails that slow,
      thought-forming stare, she went on earnestly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather than that I&rsquo;d make sacrifices. I&rsquo;d sooner Pendridny were let than
      throw all those people out of work. I suppose it would let.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let? Best woodcock shooting in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys, pursuing her thoughts, went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In time we might get the people drafted into other things. Have you
      consulted Miltoun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lord Valleys shortly, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t mean to&mdash;he&rsquo;s too
      unpractical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He always seems to know what he wants very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; repeated Lord Valleys, &ldquo;Miltoun&rsquo;s no good in a matter of
      this sort&mdash;he and his ideas throw back to the Middle Ages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys went closer, and took him by the lapels of his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geoff-really, to please me; some other way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys frowned, staring at her for some time; and at last answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To please you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll leave it over another year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that&rsquo;s better than letting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the thought of some outsider there. Time enough to come to
      that if we must. Take it as my Christmas present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys, rather flushed, bent forward and kissed his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that little Ann had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone, and they had exchanged that dubious look, Lady Valleys
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came about Babs. I don&rsquo;t know what to make of her since we came up.
      She&rsquo;s not putting her heart into things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys answered almost sulkily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the heat probably&mdash;or Claud Harbinger.&rdquo; In spite of his
      easy-going parentalism, he disliked the thought of losing the child whom
      he so affectionately admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Lady Valleys slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something queer about her. I&rsquo;m by no means certain she hasn&rsquo;t got
      some sort of feeling for that Mr. Courtier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Lord Valleys, growing most unphilosophically red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it, Gertrude, Miltoun&rsquo;s business was quite enough for one year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For twenty,&rdquo; murmured Lady Valleys. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m watching her. He&rsquo;s going to
      Persia, they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And leaving his bones there, I hope,&rdquo; muttered Lord Valleys. &ldquo;Really,
      it&rsquo;s too much. I should think you&rsquo;re all wrong, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys raised her eyebrows. Men were very queer about such things!
      Very queer and worse than helpless!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I must go to my meeting. I&rsquo;ll take her, and see if I
      can get at something,&rdquo; and she went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the inaugural meeting of the Society for the Promotion of the Birth
      Rate, over which she had promised to preside. The scheme was one in which
      she had been prominent from the start, appealing as it did to her large
      and full-blooded nature. Many movements, to which she found it impossible
      to refuse her name, had in themselves but small attraction; and it was a
      real comfort to feel something approaching enthusiasm for one branch of
      her public work. Not that there was any academic consistency about her in
      the matter, for in private life amongst her friends she was not narrowly
      dogmatic on the duty of wives to multiply exceedingly. She thought
      imperially on the subject, without bigotry. Large, healthy families, in
      all cases save individual ones! The prime idea at the back of her mind was&mdash;National
      Expansion! Her motto, and she intended if possible to make it the motto of
      the League, was: &lsquo;De l&rsquo;audace, et encore de l&rsquo;audace!&rsquo; It was a question
      of the full realization of the nation. She had a true, and in a sense
      touching belief in &lsquo;the flag,&rsquo; apart from what it might cover. It was her
      idealism. &ldquo;You may talk,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;as much as you like about
      directing national life in accordance with social justice! What does the
      nation care about social justice? The thing is much bigger than that. It&rsquo;s
      a matter of sentiment. We must expand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the way to the meeting, occupied with her speech, she made no attempt
      to draw Barbara into conversation. That must wait. The child, though
      languid, and pale, was looking so beautiful that it was a pleasure to have
      her support in such a movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a little dark room behind the hall the Committee were already
      assembled, and they went at once on to the platform.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Unmoved by the stares of the audience, Barbara sat absorbed in moody
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the three weeks since Miltoun&rsquo;s election there had been crowded such
      a multitude of functions that she had found, as it were, no time, no
      energy to know where she stood with herself. Since that morning in the
      stable, when he had watched her with the horse Hal, Harbinger had seemed
      to live only to be close to her. And the consciousness of his passion gave
      her a tingling sense of pleasure. She had been riding and dancing with
      him, and sometimes this had been almost blissful. But there were times
      too, when she felt&mdash;though always with a certain contempt of herself,
      as when she sat on that sunwarmed stone below the tor&mdash;a queer
      dissatisfaction, a longing for something outside a world where she had to
      invent her own starvations and simplicities, to make-believe in
      earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seen Courtier three times. Once he had come to dine, in response
      to an invitation from Lady Valleys worded in that charming, almost wistful
      style, which she had taught herself to use to those below her in social
      rank, especially if they were intelligent; once to the Valleys House
      garden party; and next day, having told him what time she would be riding,
      she had found him in the Row, not mounted, but standing by the rail just
      where she must pass, with that look on his face of mingled deference and
      ironic self-containment, of which he was a master. It appeared that he was
      leaving England; and to her questions why, and where, he had only shrugged
      his shoulders. Up on this dusty platform, in the hot bare hall, facing all
      those people, listening to speeches whose sense she was too languid and
      preoccupied to take in, the whole medley of thoughts, and faces round her,
      and the sound of the speakers&rsquo; voices, formed a kind of nightmare, out of
      which she noted with extreme exactitude the colour of her mother&rsquo;s neck
      beneath a large black hat, and the expression on the face of a Committee
      man to the right, who was biting his fingers under cover of a blue paper.
      She realized that someone was speaking amongst the audience, casting
      forth, as it were, small bunches of words. She could see him&mdash;a
      little man in a black coat, with a white face which kept jerking up and
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that this is terrible,&rdquo; she heard him say; &ldquo;I feel that this is
      blasphemy. That we should try to tamper with the greatest force, the
      greatest and the most sacred and secret-force, that&mdash;that moves in
      the world, is to me horrible. I cannot bear to listen; it seems to make
      everything so small!&rdquo; She saw him sit down, and her mother rising to
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must all sympathize with the sincerity and to a certain extent with
      the intention of our friend in the body of the hall. But we must ask
      ourselves:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we the right to allow ourselves the luxury, of private feelings in a
      matter which concerns the national expansion. We must not give way to
      sentiment. Our friend in the body of the hall spoke&mdash;he will forgive
      me for saying so&mdash;like a poet, rather than a serious reformer. I am
      afraid that if we let ourselves drop into poetry, the birth rate of this
      country will very soon drop into poetry too. And that I think it is
      impossible for us to contemplate with folded hands. The resolution I was
      about to propose when our friend in the body of the hall&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Barbara&rsquo;s attention, had wandered off again into that queer medley of
      thoughts, and feelings, out of which the little man had so abruptly roused
      her. Then she realized that the meeting was breaking up, and her mother
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear, it&rsquo;s hospital day. We&rsquo;ve just time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they were once more in the car, she leaned back very silent, watching
      the traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys eyed her sidelong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a little bombshell,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;from that small person! He must have
      got in by mistake. I hear Mr. Courtier has a card for Helen Gloucester&rsquo;s
      ball to-night, Babs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be there,&rdquo; said Lady Valleys dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara drew back into her corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tease me, Mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An expression of compunction crossed Lady Valleys&rsquo; face; she tried to
      possess herself of Barbara&rsquo;s hand. But that languid hand did not return
      her squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the mood you&rsquo;re in, dear. It wants all one&rsquo;s pluck to shake it
      off; don&rsquo;t let it grow on you. You&rsquo;d better go down to Uncle Dennis
      to-morrow. You&rsquo;ve been overdoing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it were to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The car had stopped, and Lady Valleys said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come in, or are you too tired? It always does them good to see
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re twice as tired as me,&rdquo; Barbara answered; &ldquo;of course I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the entrance of the two ladies, there rose at once a faint buzz and
      murmur. Lady Valleys, whose ample presence radiated suddenly a
      businesslike and cheery confidence, went to a bedside and sat down. But
      Barbara stood in a thin streak of the July sunlight, uncertain where to
      begin, amongst the faces turned towards her. The poor dears looked so
      humble, and so wistful, and so tired. There was one lying quite flat, who
      had not even raised her head to see who had come in. That slumbering,
      pale, high cheek-boned face had a frailty as if a touch, a breath, would
      shatter it; a wisp of the blackest hair, finer than silk, lay across the
      forehead; the closed eyes were deep sunk; one hand, scarred almost to the
      bone with work, rested above her breast. She breathed between lips which
      had no colour. About her, sleeping, was a kind of beauty. And there came
      over the girl a queer rush of emotion. The sleeper seemed so apart from
      everything there, from all the formality and stiffness of the ward. To
      look at her swept away the languid, hollow feeling with which she had come
      in; it made her think of the tors at home, when the wind was blowing, and
      all was bare, and grand, and sometimes terrible. There was something
      elemental in that still sleep. And the old lady in the next led, with a
      brown wrinkled face and bright black eyes brimful of life, seemed almost
      vulgar beside such remote tranquillity, while she was telling Barbara that
      a little bunch of heather in the better half of a soap-dish on the
      window-sill had come from Wales, because, as she explained: &ldquo;My mother was
      born in Stirling, dearie; so I likes a bit of heather, though I never been
      out o&rsquo; Bethnal Green meself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when Barbara again passed, the sleeping woman was sitting up, and
      looked but a poor ordinary thing&mdash;her strange fragile beauty all
      withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief when Lady Valleys said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, my Naval Bazaar at five-thirty; and while I&rsquo;m there you must go
      home and have a rest, and freshen yourself up for the evening. We dine at
      Plassey House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess of Gloucester&rsquo;s Ball, a function which no one could very well
      miss, had been fixed for this late date owing to the Duchess&rsquo;s announced
      desire to prolong the season and so help the hackney cabmen; and though
      everybody sympathized, it had been felt by most that it would be simpler
      to go away, motor up on the day of the Ball, and motor down again on the
      following morning. And throughout the week by which the season was thus
      prolonged, in long rows at the railway stations, and on their stands, the
      hackney cabmen, unconscious of what was being done for them, waited,
      patient as their horses. But since everybody was making this special
      effort, an exceptionally large, exclusive, and brilliant company
      reassembled at Gloucester House.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the vast ballroom over the medley of entwined revolving couples,
      punkahs had been fixed, to clear and freshen the languid air, and these
      huge fans, moving with incredible slowness, drove a faint refreshing
      draught down over the sea of white shirt-fronts and bare necks, and freed
      the scent from innumerable flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the evening, close by one of the great clumps of bloom, a very
      pretty woman stood talking to Bertie Caradoc. She was his cousin, Lily
      Malvezin, sister of Geoffrey Winlow, and wife of a Liberal peer, a
      charming creature, whose pink cheeks, bright eyes, quick lips, and rounded
      figure, endowed her with the prettiest air of animation. And while she
      spoke she kept stealing sly glances at her partner, trying as it were to
      pierce the armour of that self-contained young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; she said in her mocking voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll never persuade me
      that Miltoun is going to catch on. &lsquo;Il est trop intransigeant&rsquo;. Ah!
      there&rsquo;s Babs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the girl had come gliding by, her eyes wandering lazily, her lips just
      parted; her neck, hardly less pale than her white frock; her face pale,
      and marked with languor, under the heavy coil of her tawny hair; and her
      swaying body seeming with each turn of the waltz to be caught by the arms
      of her partner from out of a swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that immobility of lips, learned by all imprisoned in Society, Lily
      Malvezin murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that she&rsquo;s dancing with? Is it the dark horse, Bertie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through lips no less immobile Bertie answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty to one, no takers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But those inquisitive bright eyes still followed Barbara, drifting in the
      dance, like a great waterlily caught in the swirl of a mill pool; and the
      thought passed through that pretty head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s hooked him. It&rsquo;s naughty of Babs, really!&rdquo; And then she saw leaning
      against a pillar another whose eyes also were following those two; and she
      thought: &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Poor Claud&mdash;no wonder he&rsquo;s looking like that. Oh!
      Babs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By one of the statues on the terrace Barbara and her partner stood, where
      trees, disfigured by no gaudy lanterns, offered the refreshment of their
      darkness and serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrapped in her new pale languor, still breathing deeply from the waltz,
      she seemed to Courtier too utterly moulded out of loveliness. To what end
      should a man frame speeches to a vision! She was but an incarnation of
      beauty imprinted on the air, and would fade out at a touch-like the sudden
      ghosts of enchantment that came to one under the blue, and the starlit
      snow of a mountain night, or in a birch wood all wistful golden! Speech
      seemed but desecration! Besides, what of interest was there for him to say
      in this world of hers, so bewildering and of such glib assurance&mdash;this
      world that was like a building, whose every window was shut and had a
      blind drawn down. A building that admitted none who had not sworn, as it
      were, to believe it the world, the whole world, and nothing but the world,
      outside which were only the nibbled remains of what had built it. This,
      world of Society, in which he felt like one travelling through a desert,
      longing to meet a fellow-creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Harbinger behind them said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady-Babs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Long did the punkahs waft their breeze over that brave-hued wheel of
      pleasure, and the sound of the violins quaver and wail out into the
      morning. Then quickly, as the spangles of dew vanish off grass when the
      sun rises, all melted away; and in the great rooms were none but flunkeys
      presiding over the polished surfaces like flamingoes by some lakeside at
      dawn.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      A brick dower-house of the Fitz-Harolds, just outside the little seaside
      town of Nettlefold, sheltered the tranquil days of Lord Dennis. In that
      south-coast air, sanest and most healing in all England, he raged very
      slowly, taking little thought of death, and much quiet pleasure in his
      life. Like the tall old house with its high windows and squat chimneys, he
      was marvellously self-contained. His books, for he somewhat passionately
      examined old civilizations, and described their habits from time to time
      with a dry and not too poignant pen in a certain old-fashioned magazine;
      his microscope, for he studied infusoria; and the fishing boat of his
      friend John Bogle, who had long perceived that Lord Dennis was the biggest
      fish he ever caught; all these, with occasional visitors, and little runs
      to London, to Monkland, and other country houses, made up the sum of a
      life which, if not desperately beneficial, was uniformly kind and
      harmless, and, by its notorious simplicity, had a certain negative
      influence not only on his own class but on the relations of that class
      with the country at large. It was commonly said in Nettlefold, that he was
      a gentleman; if they were all like him there wasn&rsquo;t much in all this talk
      against the Lords. The shop people and lodging-house keepers felt that the
      interests of the country were safer in his hands: than in the hands of
      people who wanted to meddle with everything for the good of those who were
      only anxious to be let alone. A man too who could so completely forget he
      was the son of a Duke, that other people never forgot it, was the man for
      their money. It was true that he had never had a say in public affairs;
      but this was overlooked, because he could have had it if he liked, and the
      fact that he did not like, only showed once more that he was a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was the one personality of the little town against whom
      practically nothing was ever, said, so was his house the one house which
      defied criticism. Time had made it utterly suitable. The ivied walls, and
      purplish roof lichened yellow in places, the quiet meadows harbouring
      ponies and kine, reaching from it to the sea&mdash;all was mellow. In
      truth it made all the other houses of the town seem shoddy&mdash;standing
      alone beyond them, like its master, if anything a little too esthetically
      remote from common wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had practically no near neighbours of whom he saw anything, except once
      in a way young Harbinger three miles distant at Whitewater. But since he
      had the faculty of not being bored with his own society, this did not
      worry him. Of local charity, especially to the fishers of the town, whose
      winter months were nowadays very bare of profit, he was prodigal to the
      verge of extravagance, for his income was not great. But in politics,
      beyond acting as the figure-head of certain municipal efforts, he took
      little or no part. His Toryism indeed was of the mild order, that had
      little belief in the regeneration of the country by any means but those of
      kindly feeling between the classes. When asked how that was to be brought
      about, he would answer with his dry, slightly malicious, suavity, that if
      you stirred hornets&rsquo; nests with sticks the hornets would come forth.
      Having no land, he was shy of expressing himself on that vexed question;
      but if resolutely attacked would give utterance to some such sentiment as
      this: &ldquo;The land&rsquo;s best in our hands on the whole, but we want fewer
      dogs-in-the-manger among us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had, as became one of his race, a feeling for land, tender and
      protective, and could not bear to think of its being put out to farm with
      that cold Mother, the State. He was ironical over the views of Radicals or
      Socialists, but disliked to hear such people personally abused behind
      their backs. It must be confessed, however, that if contradicted he
      increased considerably the ironical decision of his sentiments. Withdrawn
      from all chance in public life of enforcing his views on others, the
      natural aristocrat within him was forced to find some expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each year, towards the end of July, he placed his house at the service of
      Lord Valleys, who found it a convenient centre for attending Goodwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the morning after the Duchess of Gloucester&rsquo;s Ball, that he
      received this note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;VALLEYS HOUSE. &ldquo;DEAREST UNCLE DENNIS,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come down to you a little before time and rest? London is so
      terribly hot. Mother has three functions still to stay for, and I shall
      have to come back again for our last evening, the political one&mdash;so I
      don&rsquo;t want to go all the way to Monkland; and anywhere else, except with
      you, would be rackety. Eustace looks so seedy. I&rsquo;ll try and bring him, if
      I may. Granny is terribly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Best love, dear, from your
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;BABS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same afternoon she came, but without Miltoun, driving up from the
      station in a fly. Lord Dennis met her at the gate; and, having kissed her,
      looked at her somewhat anxiously, caressing his white peaked beard. He had
      never yet known Babs sick of anything, except when he took her out in John
      Bogle&rsquo;s boat. She was certainly looking pale, and her hair was done
      differently&mdash;a fact disturbing to one who did not discover it.
      Slipping his arm through hers he led her out into a meadow still full of
      buttercups, where an old white pony, who had carried her in the Row twelve
      years ago, came up to them and rubbed his muzzle against her waist. And
      suddenly there rose in Lord Dennis the thoroughly discomforting and
      strange suspicion that, though the child was not going to cry, she wanted
      time to get over the feeling that she was. Without appearing to separate
      himself from her, he walked to the wall at the end of the field, and stood
      looking at the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tide was nearly up; the South wind driving over it brought him the
      scent of the sea-flowers, and the crisp rustle of little waves swimming
      almost to his feet. Far out, where the sunlight fell, the smiling waters
      lay white and mysterious in July haze, giving him a queer feeling. But
      Lord Dennis, though he had his moments of poetic sentiment, was on the
      whole quite able to keep the sea in its proper place&mdash;for after all
      it was the English Channel; and like a good Englishman he recognized that
      if you once let things get away from their names, they ceased to be facts,
      and if they ceased to be facts, they became&mdash;the devil! In truth he
      was not thinking much of the sea, but of Barbara. It was plain that she
      was in trouble of some kind. And the notion that Babs could find trouble
      in life was extraordinarily queer; for he felt, subconsciously, what a
      great driving force of disturbance was necessary to penetrate the hundred
      folds of the luxurious cloak enwrapping one so young and fortunate. It was
      not Death; therefore it must be Love; and he thought at once of that
      fellow with the red moustaches. Ideas were all very well&mdash;no one
      would object to as many as you liked, in their proper place&mdash;the
      dinner-table, for example. But to fall in love, if indeed it were so, with
      a man who not only had ideas, but an inclination to live up to them, and
      on them, and on nothing else, seemed to Lord Dennis &lsquo;outre&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had followed him to the wall, and he looked&mdash;at her dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To rest in the waters of Lethe, Babs? By the way, seen anything of our
      friend Mr. Courtier? Very picturesque&mdash;that Quixotic theory of life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in saying that, his voice (like so many refined voices which have
      turned their backs on speculation) was triple-toned-mocking at ideas,
      mocking at itself for mocking at ideas, yet showing plainly that at bottom
      it only mocked at itself for mocking at ideas, because it would be, as it
      were, crude not to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Barbara did not answer his question, and began to speak of other
      things. And all that afternoon and evening she talked away so lightly that
      Lord Dennis, but for his instinct, would have been deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      That wonderful smiling mask&mdash;the inscrutability of Youth&mdash;was
      laid aside by her at night. Sitting at her window, under the moon, &lsquo;a
      gold-bright moth slow-spinning up the sky,&rsquo; she watched the darkness
      hungrily, as though it were a great thought into whose heart she was
      trying to see. Now and then she stroked herself, getting strange comfort
      out of the presence of her body. She had that old unhappy feeling of
      having two selves within her. And this soft night full of the quiet stir
      of the sea, and of dark immensity, woke in her a terrible longing to be at
      one with something, somebody, outside herself. At the Ball last night the
      &lsquo;flying feeling&rsquo; had seized on her again; and was still there&mdash;a
      queer manifestation of her streak of recklessness. And this result of her
      contacts with Courtier, this &lsquo;cacoethes volandi&rsquo;, and feeling of clipped
      wings, hurt her&mdash;as being forbidden hurts a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered how in the housekeeper&rsquo;s room at Monkland there lived a
      magpie who had once sought shelter in an orchid-house from some pursuer.
      As soon as they thought him wedded to civilization, they had let him go,
      to see whether he would come back. For hours he had sat up in a high tree,
      and at last come down again to his cage; whereupon, fearing lest the rooks
      should attack him when he next took this voyage of discovery, they clipped
      one of his wings. After that the twilight bird, though he lived happily
      enough, hopping about his cage and the terrace which served him for
      exercise yard, would seem at times restive and frightened, moving his
      wings as if flying in spirit, and sad that he must stay on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, too, at her window Barbara fluttered her wings; then, getting into
      bed, lay sighing and tossing. A clock struck three; and seized by an
      intolerable impatience at her own discomfort, she slipped a motor coat
      over her night-gown, put on slippers, and stole out into the passage. The
      house was very still. She crept downstairs, smothering her footsteps.
      Groping her way through the hall, inhabited by the thin ghosts of would-be
      light, she slid back the chain of the door, and fled towards the sea. She
      made no more noise running in the dew, than a bird following the paths of
      air; and the two ponies, who felt her figure pass in the darkness,
      snuffled, sending out soft sighs of alarm amongst the closed buttercups.
      She climbed the wall over to the beach. While she was running, she had
      fully meant to dash into the sea and cool herself, but it was so black,
      with just a thin edging scarf of white, and the sky was black, bereft of
      lights, waiting for the day!
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood, and looked. And all the leapings and pulsings of flesh and
      spirit slowly died in that wide dark loneliness, where the only sound was
      the wistful breaking of small waves. She was well used to these dead hours&mdash;only
      last night, at this very time, Harbinger&rsquo;s arm had been round her in a
      last waltz! But here the dead hours had such different faces, wide-eyed,
      solemn, and there came to Barbara, staring out at them, a sense that the
      darkness saw her very soul, so that it felt little and timid within her.
      She shivered in her fur-lined coat, as if almost frightened at finding
      herself so marvellously nothing before that black sky and dark sea, which
      seemed all one, relentlessly great.... And crouching down, she waited for
      the dawn to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came from over the Downs, sweeping a rush of cold air on its wings,
      flighting towards the sea. With it the daring soon crept back into her
      blood. She stripped, and ran down into the dark water, fast growing pale.
      It covered her jealously, and she set to work to swim. The water was
      warmer than the air. She lay on her back and splashed, watching the sky
      flush. To bathe like this in the half-dark, with her hair floating out,
      and no wet clothes clinging to her limbs, gave her the joy of a child
      doing a naughty thing. She swam out of her depth, then scared at her own
      adventure, swam in again as the sun rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dashed into her two garments, climbed the wall, and scurried back to
      the house. All her dejection, and feverish uncertainty were gone; she felt
      keen, fresh, terribly hungry, and stealing into the dark dining-room,
      began rummaging for food. She found biscuits, and was still munching, when
      in the open doorway she saw Lord Dennis, a pistol in one hand and a
      lighted candle in the other. With his carved features and white beard
      above an old blue dressing-gown, he looked impressive, having at the
      moment a distinct resemblance to Lady Casterley, as though danger had
      armoured him in steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call this resting!&rdquo; he said, dryly; then, looking at her drowned
      hair, added: &ldquo;I see you have already entrusted your trouble to the waters
      of Lethe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But without answer Barbara vanished into the dim hall and up the stairs.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Barbara was swimming to meet the dawn, Miltoun was bathing in those
      waters of mansuetude and truth which roll from wall to wall in the British
      House of Commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that long debate on the Land question, for which he had waited to make
      his first speech, he had already risen nine times without catching the
      Speaker&rsquo;s eye, and slowly a sense of unreality was creeping over him.
      Surely this great Chamber, where without end rose the small sound of a
      single human voice, and queer mechanical bursts of approbation and
      resentment, did not exist at all but as a gigantic fancy of his own! And
      all these figures were figments of his brain! And when he at last spoke,
      it would be himself alone that he addressed! The torpid air tainted with
      human breath, the unwinking stare of the countless lights, the long rows
      of seats, the queer distant rounds of pale listening flesh perched up so
      high, they were all emanations of himself! Even the coming and going in
      the gangway was but the coming and going of little wilful parts of him!
      And rustling deep down in this Titanic creature of his fancy was &lsquo;the
      murmuration&rsquo; of his own unspoken speech, sweeping away the puff balls of
      words flung up by that far-away, small, varying voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly all that dream creature had vanished; he was on his feet,
      with a thumping heart, speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon he had no tremors, only a dim consciousness that his words sounded
      strange, and a queer icy pleasure in flinging them out into the silence.
      Round him there seemed no longer men, only mouths and eyes. And he had
      enjoyment in the feeling that with these words of his he was holding those
      hungry mouths and eyes dumb and unmoving. Then he knew that he had reached
      the end of what he had to say, and sat down, remaining motionless in the
      centre of a various sound; staring at the back of the head in front of
      him, with his hands clasped round his knee. And soon, when that little
      faraway voice was once more speaking, he took his hat, and glancing
      neither to right nor left, went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of the sensation of relief and wild elation which fills the heart
      of those who have taken the first plunge, Miltoun had nothing in his deep
      dark well but the waters of bitterness. In truth, with the delivery of
      that speech he had but parted with what had been a sort of anodyne to
      suffering. He had only put the fine point on his conviction, of how vain
      was his career now that he could not share it with Audrey Noel. He walked
      slowly towards the Temple, along the riverside, where the lamps were
      paling into nothingness before that daily celebration of Divinity, the
      meeting of dark and light.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Miltoun was not one of those who take things lying down; he took
      things desperately, deeply, and with revolt. He took them like a rider
      riding himself, plunging at the dig of his own spurs, chafing and wincing
      at the cruel tugs of his own bitt; bearing in his friendless, proud heart
      all the burden of struggles which shallower or more genial natures shared
      with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked hardly less haggard, walking home, than some of those homeless
      ones who slept nightly by the river, as though they knew that to lie near
      one who could so readily grant oblivion, alone could save them from
      seeking that consolation. He was perhaps unhappier than they, whose
      spirits, at all events, had long ceased to worry them, having oozed out
      from their bodies under the foot of Life:
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Audrey Noel was lost to him, her loveliness and that
      indescribable quality which made her lovable, floated before him, the very
      torture-flowers of a beauty never to be grasped&mdash;yet, that he could
      grasp, &lsquo;if he only would! That was the heart and fervour of his suffering.
      To be grasped if he only would! He was suffering, too, physically from a
      kind of slow fever, the result of his wetting on the day when he last saw
      her. And through that latent fever, things and feelings, like his
      sensations in the House before his speech, were all as it were muffled in
      a horrible way, as if they all came to him wrapped in a sort of flannel
      coating, through which he could not cut. And all the time there seemed to
      be within him two men at mortal grips with one another; the man of faith
      in divine sanction and authority, on which all his beliefs had hitherto
      hinged, and a desperate warm-blooded hungry creature. He was very
      miserable, craving strangely for the society of someone who could
      understand what he was feeling, and, from long habit of making no
      confidants, not knowing how to satisfy that craving.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dawn when he reached his rooms; and, sure that he would not sleep,
      he did not even go to bed, but changed his clothes, made himself some
      coffee, and sat down at the window which overlooked the flowered
      courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Middle Temple Hall a Ball was still in progress, though the glamour
      from its Chinese lanterns was already darkened and gone. Miltoun saw a man
      and a girl, sheltered by an old fountain, sitting out their last dance.
      Her head had sunk on her partner&rsquo;s shoulder; their lips were joined. And
      there floated up to the window the scent of heliotrope, with the tune of
      the waltz that those two should have been dancing. This couple so
      stealthily enlaced, the gleam of their furtively turned eyes, the
      whispering of their lips, that stony niche below the twittering sparrows,
      so cunningly sought out&mdash;it was the world he had abjured! When he
      looked again, they&mdash;like a vision seen&mdash;had stolen away and
      gone; the music too had ceased, there was no scent of heliotrope. In the
      stony niche crouched a stray cat watching the twittering sparrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun went out, and, turning into the empty Strand, walked on&mdash;without
      heeding where, till towards five o&rsquo;clock he found himself on Putney
      Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rested there, leaning over the parapet, looking down at the grey water.
      The sun was just breaking through the heat haze; early waggons were
      passing, and already men were coming in to work. To what end did the river
      wander up and down; and a human river flow across it twice every day? To
      what end were men and women suffering? Of the full current of this life
      Miltoun could no more see the aim, than that of the wheeling gulls in the
      early sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the bridge he made towards Barnes Common. The night was still
      ensnared there on the gorse bushes grey with cobwebs and starry dewdrops.
      He passed a tramp family still sleeping, huddled all together. Even the
      homeless lay in each other&rsquo;s arms!
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Common he emerged on the road near the gates of Ravensham;
      turning in there, he found his way to the kitchen garden, and sat down on
      a bench close to the raspberry bushes. They were protected from thieves,
      but at Miltoun&rsquo;s approach two blackbirds flustered out through the netting
      and flew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      His long figure resting so motionless impressed itself on the eyes of a
      gardener, who caused a report to be circulated that his young lordship was
      in the fruit garden. It reached the ears of Clifton, who himself came out
      to see what this might mean. The old man took his stand in front of
      Miltoun very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come to breakfast, my lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my grandmother will have me, Clifton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood your lordship was speaking last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find the House of Commons satisfactory, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairly, thank you, Clifton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not what they were in the great days of your grandfather, I
      believe. He had a very good opinion of them. They vary, no doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tempora mutantur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so. I find quite anew spirit towards public affairs. The ha&rsquo;penny
      Press; one takes it in, but one hardly approves. I shall be anxious to
      read your speech. They say a first speech is a great strain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had no reason to be anxious. I&rsquo;m sure it was beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun saw that the old man&rsquo;s thin sallow cheeks had flushed to a deep
      orange between his snow-white whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have looked forward to this day,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;ever since I knew your
      lordship&mdash;twenty-eight years. It is the beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the end, Clifton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s face fell in a look of deep and concerned astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;with your antecedents, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun took his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, Clifton&mdash;didn&rsquo;t mean to shock you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And for a minute neither spoke, looking at their clasped hands as if
      surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would your lordship like a bath&mdash;breakfast is still at eight. I can
      procure you a razor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Miltoun entered the breakfast room, his grandmother, with a copy of
      the Times in her hands, was seated before a grape fruit, which, with a
      shredded wheat biscuit, constituted her first meal. Her appearance hardly
      warranted Barbara&rsquo;s description of &lsquo;terribly well&rsquo;; in truth she looked a
      little white, as if she had been feeling the heat. But there was no lack
      of animation in her little steel-grey eyes, nor of decision in her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve taken a line of your own, Eustace. I&rsquo;ve
      nothing to say against that; in fact, quite the contrary. But remember
      this, my dear, however you may change you mustn&rsquo;t wobble. Only one thing
      counts in that place, hitting the same nail on the head with the same
      hammer all the time. You aren&rsquo;t looking at all well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun, bending to kiss her, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; replied Lady Casterley. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t look after you. Was your
      mother in the House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. And what is Barbara about? She ought to be seeing to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barbara is down with Uncle Dennis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley set her jaw; then looking her grandson through and through,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take you down there this very day. I shall have the sea to you.
      What do you say, Clifton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship does look pale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the carriage, and we&rsquo;ll go from Clapham Junction. Thomas can go in
      and fetch you some clothes. Or, better, though I dislike them, we can
      telephone to your mother for a car. It&rsquo;s very hot for trains. Arrange
      that, please, Clifton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this project Miltoun raised no objection. And all through the drive he
      remained sunk in an indifference and lassitude which to Lady Casterley
      seemed in the highest degree ominous. For lassitude, to her, was the
      strange, the unpardonable, state. The little great lady&mdash;casket of
      the aristocratic principle&mdash;was permeated to the very backbone with
      the instinct of artificial energy, of that alert vigour which those who
      have nothing socially to hope for are forced to develop, lest they should
      decay and be again obliged to hope. To speak honest truth, she could not
      forbear an itch to run some sharp and foreign substance into her grandson,
      to rouse him somehow, for she knew the reason of his state, and was
      temperamentally out of patience with such a cause for backsliding. Had it
      been any other of her grandchildren she would not have hesitated, but
      there was that in Miltoun which held even Lady Casterley in check, and
      only once during the four hours of travel did she attempt to break down
      his reserve. She did it in a manner very soft for her&mdash;was he not of
      all living things the hope and pride of her heart? Tucking her little thin
      sharp hand under his arm, she said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, don&rsquo;t brood over it. That will never do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miltoun removed her hand gently, and laid it back on the dust rug, nor
      did he answer, or show other sign of having heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lady Casterley, deeply wounded, pressed her faded lips together, and
      said sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slower, please, Frith!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was to Barbara that Miltoun unfolded, if but little, the trouble of his
      spirit, lying that same afternoon under a ragged tamarisk hedge with the
      tide far out. He could never have done this if there had not been between
      them the accidental revelation of that night at Monkland; nor even then
      perhaps had he not felt in this young sister of his the warmth of life for
      which he was yearning. In such a matter as love Barbara was the elder of
      these two. For, besides the motherly knowledge of the heart peculiar to
      most women, she had the inherent woman-of-the-worldliness to be expected
      of a daughter of Lord and Lady Valleys. If she herself were in doubt as to
      the state of her affections, it was not as with Miltoun, on the score of
      the senses and the heart, but on the score of her spirit and curiosity,
      which Courtier had awakened and caused to flap their wings a little. She
      worried over Miltoun&rsquo;s forlorn case; it hurt her too to think of Mrs. Noel
      eating her heart out in that lonely cottage. A sister so&mdash;good and
      earnest as Agatha had ever inclined Barbara to a rebellious view of
      morals, and disinclined her altogether to religion. And so, she felt that
      if those two could not be happy apart, they should be happy together, in
      the name of all the joy there was in life!
    </p>
    <p>
      And while her brother lay face to the sky under the tamarisks, she kept
      trying to think of how to console him, conscious that she did not in the
      least understand the way he thought about things. Over the fields behind,
      the larks were hymning the promise of the unripe corn; the foreshore was
      painted all colours, from vivid green to mushroom pink; by the edge of the
      blue sea little black figures stooped, gathering sapphire. The air smelled
      sweet in the shade of the tamarisk; there was ineffable peace. And
      Barbara, covered by the network of sunlight, could not help impatience
      with a suffering which seemed to her so corrigible by action. At last she
      ventured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life is short, Eusty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun&rsquo;s answer, given without movement, startled her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Persuade me that it is, Babs, and I&rsquo;ll bless you. If the singing of these
      larks means nothing, if that blue up there is a morass of our invention,
      if we are pettily, creeping on furthering nothing, if there&rsquo;s no purpose
      in our lives, persuade me of it, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carried suddenly beyond her depth, Barbara could only put out her hand,
      and say: &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t take things so hard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you say that life is short,&rdquo; Miltoun muttered, with his smile, &ldquo;you
      shouldn&rsquo;t spoil it by feeling pity! In old days we went to the Tower for
      our convictions. We can stand a little private roasting, I hope; or has
      the sand run out of us altogether?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stung by his tone, Barbara answered in rather a hard voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we must bear, we must, I suppose. But why should we make trouble?
      That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t stand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O profound wisdom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love Life!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The galleons of the westering sun were already sailing in a broad gold
      fleet straight for that foreshore where the little black stooping figures
      had not yet finished their toil, the larks still sang over the unripe corn&mdash;when
      Harbinger, galloping along the sands from Whitewater to Sea House, came on
      that silent couple walking home to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not be safe to say of this young man that he readily diagnosed a
      spiritual atmosphere, but this was the less his demerit, since everything
      from his cradle up had conspired to keep the spiritual thermometer of his
      surroundings at 60 in the shade. And the fact that his own spiritual
      thermometer had now run up so that it threatened to burst the bulb,
      rendered him less likely than ever to see what was happening with other
      people&rsquo;s. Yet, he did notice that Barbara was looking pale, and&mdash;it
      seemed&mdash;sweeter than ever.... With her eldest brother he always
      somehow felt ill at ease. He could not exactly afford to despise an
      uncompromising spirit in one of his own order, but he was no more
      impervious than others to Miltoun&rsquo;s caustic, thinly-veiled contempt for
      the commonplace; and having a full-blooded belief in himself&mdash;-usual
      with men of fine physique, whose lots are so cast that this belief can
      never or almost never be really shaken&mdash;he greatly disliked the
      feeling of being a little looked down on. It was an intense relief, when,
      saying that he wanted a certain magazine, Miltoun strode off into the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Harbinger, no less than to Miltoun and Barbara, last night had been
      bitter and restless. The sight of that pale swaying figure, with the
      parted lips, whirling round in Courtier&rsquo;s arms, had clung to his vision
      ever since, the Ball. During his own last dance with her he had been
      almost savagely silent; only by a great effort restraining his tongue from
      mordant allusions to that &lsquo;prancing, red-haired fellow,&rsquo; as he secretly
      called the champion of lost causes. In fact, his sensations there and
      since had been a revelation, or would have teen if he could have stood
      apart to see them. True, he had gone about next day with his usual cool,
      off-hand manner, because one naturally did not let people see, but it was
      with such an inner aching and rage of want and jealousy as to really merit
      pity. Men of his physically big, rather rushing, type, are the last to
      possess their souls in patience. Walking home after the Ball he had
      determined to follow her down to the sea, where she had said, so
      maliciously; that she was going. After a second almost sleepless night he
      had no longer any hesitation. He must see her! After all, a man might go
      to his own &lsquo;place&rsquo; with impunity; he did not care if it were a pointed
      thing to do.... Pointed! The more pointed the better! There was beginning
      to be roused in him an ugly stubbornness of male determination. She should
      not escape him!
    </p>
    <p>
      But now that he was walking at her side, all that determination and
      assurance melted to perplexed humility. He marched along by his horse with
      his head down, just feeling the ache of being so close to her and yet so
      far; angry with his own silence and awkwardness, almost angry with her for
      her loveliness, and the pain it made him suffer. When they reached the
      house, and she left him at the stable-yard, saying she was going to get
      some flowers, he jerked the beast&rsquo;s bridle and swore at it for its
      slowness in entering the stable. He, was terrified that she would be gone
      before he could get into the garden; yet half afraid of finding her there.
      But she was still plucking carnations by the box hedge which led to the
      conservatories. And as she rose from gathering those blossoms, before he
      knew what he was doing, Harbinger had thrown his arm around her, held her
      as in a vice, kissed her unmercifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to offer no resistance, her smooth cheeks growing warmer and
      warmer, even her lips passive; but suddenly he recoiled, and his heart
      stood still at his own outrageous daring. What had he done? He saw her
      leaning back almost buried in the clipped box hedge, and heard her say
      with a sort of faint mockery: &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have flung himself down on his knees to ask for pardon but for
      the thought that someone might come. He muttered hoarsely: &ldquo;By God, I was
      mad!&rdquo; and stood glowering in sullen suspense between hardihood and fear.
      He heard her say, quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you were-rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then seeing her put her hand up to her lips as if he had hurt them, he
      muttered brokenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Babs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a full minute&rsquo;s silence while he stood there, no longer daring
      to look at her, beaten all over by his emotions. Then, with bewilderment,
      he heard her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mind it&mdash;for once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at that. How could she love him, and speak so coolly! How
      could she not mind, if she did not love him! She was passing her hands
      over her face and neck and hair, repairing the damage of his kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now shall we go in?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harbinger took a step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you so,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I will put my life in your hands, and you shall
      throw it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At those words, of whose exact nature he had very little knowledge, he saw
      her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I let you come within three yards, will you be good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed; and, in silence, they walked towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner that evening was a strange, uncomfortable meal. But its comedy, too
      subtly played for Miltoun and Lord Dennis, seemed transparent to the eyes
      of Lady Casterley; for, when Harbinger had sallied forth to ride back
      along the sands, she took her candle and invited Barbara to retire. Then,
      having admitted her granddaughter to the apartment always reserved for
      herself, and specially furnished with practically nothing, she sat down
      opposite that tall, young, solid figure, as it were taking stock of it,
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are coming to your senses, at all events. Kiss me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara, stooping to perform this rite, saw a tear stealing down the
      carved fine nose. Knowing that to notice it would be too dreadful, she
      raised herself, and went to the window. There, staring out over the dark
      fields and dark sea, by the side of which Harbinger was riding home, she
      put her hand up to her, lips, and thought for the hundredth time:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three days after his first, and as he promised himself, his last Society
      Ball, Courtier received a note from Audrey Noel, saying that she had left
      Monkland for the present, and come up to a little flat&mdash;on the
      riverside not far from Westminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he made his way there that same July day, the Houses of Parliament
      were bright under a sun which warmed all the grave air emanating from
      their counsels of perfection: Courtier passed by dubiously. His feelings
      in the presence of those towers were always a little mixed. There was not
      so much of the poet in him as to cause him to see nothing there at all
      save only same lines against the sky, but there was enough of the poet to
      make him long to kick something; and in this mood he wended his way to the
      riverside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Noel was not at home, but since the maid informed him that she would
      be in directly, he sat down to wait. Her flat, which was on&mdash;the
      first floor, overlooked the river and had evidently been taken furnished,
      for there were visible marks of a recent struggle with an Edwardian taste
      which, flushed from triumph over Victorianism, had filled the rooms with
      early Georgian remains. On the only definite victory, a rose-coloured
      window seat of great comfort and little age, Courtier sat down, and
      resigned himself to doing nothing with the ease of an old soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the protective feeling he had once had for a very graceful, dark-haired
      child, he joined not only the championing pity of a man of warm heart
      watching a woman in distress, but the impatience of one, who, though
      temperamentally incapable of feeling oppressed himself, rebelled at sight
      of all forms of tyranny affecting others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the grey towers, still just visible, under which Miltoun and
      his father sat, annoyed him deeply; symbolizing to him, Authority&mdash;foe
      to his deathless mistress, the sweet, invincible lost cause of Liberty.
      But presently the river; bringing up in flood the unbound water that had
      bathed every shore, touched all sands, and seen the rising and falling of
      each mortal star, so soothed him with its soundless hymn to Freedom, that
      Audrey Noel coming in with her hands full of flowers, found him sleeping
      firmly, with his mouth shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noiselessly putting down the flowers, she waited for his awakening. That
      sanguine visage, with its prominent chin, flaring moustaches, and eyebrows
      raised rather V-shaped above his closed eyes, wore an expression of cheery
      defiance even in sleep; and perhaps no face in all London was so utterly
      its obverse, as that of this dark, soft-haired woman, delicate, passive,
      and tremulous with pleasure at sight of the only person in the world from
      whom she felt she might learn of Miltoun, without losing her self-respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He woke at last, and manifesting no discomfiture, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was like you not to wake me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat for a long while talking, the riverside traffic drowsily
      accompanying their voices, the flowers drowsily filling the room with
      scent; and when Courtier left, his heart was sore. She had not spoken of
      herself at all, but had talked nearly all the time of Barbara, praising
      her beauty and high spirit; growing pale once or twice, and evidently
      drinking in with secret avidity every allusion to Miltoun. Clearly, her
      feelings had not changed, though she would not show them! Courtier&rsquo;s pity
      for her became well-nigh violent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in such a mood, mingled with very different feelings, that he
      donned evening clothes and set out to attend the last gathering of the
      season at Valleys House, a function which, held so late in July, was
      perforce almost perfectly political.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mounting the wide and shining staircase, that had so often baffled the
      arithmetic of little Ann, he was reminded of a picture entitled &lsquo;The Steps
      to Heaven&rsquo; in his nursery four-and-thirty years before. At the top of this
      staircase, and surrounded by acquaintances, he came on Harbinger, who
      nodded curtly. The young man&rsquo;s handsome face and figure appeared to
      Courtier&rsquo;s jaundiced eye more obviously successful and complacent than
      ever; so that he passed him by sardonically, and manoeuvred his way
      towards Lady Valleys, whom he could perceive stationed, like a general, in
      a little cleared space, where to and fro flowed constant streams of
      people, like the rays of a star. She was looking her very best, going well
      with great and highly-polished spaces; and she greeted Courtier with a
      special cordiality of tone, which had in it, besides kindness towards one
      who must be feeling a strange bird, a certain diplomatic quality,
      compounded of desire, as it were, to &lsquo;warn him off,&rsquo; and fear of saying
      something that might irritate and make him more dangerous. She had heard,
      she said, that he was bound for Persia; she hoped he was not going to try
      and make things more difficult there; then with the words: &ldquo;So good of you
      to have come!&rdquo; she became once more the centre of her battlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving that he was finished with, Courtier stood back against a wall
      and watched. Thus isolated, he was like a solitary cuckoo contemplating
      the gyrations of a flock of rooks. Their motions seemed a little
      meaningless to one so far removed from all the fetishes and shibboleths of
      Westminster. He heard them discussing Miltoun&rsquo;s speech, the real
      significance of which apparently had only just been grasped. The words
      &lsquo;doctrinaire,&rsquo; &lsquo;extremist,&rsquo; came to his ears, together with the saying &lsquo;a
      new force.&rsquo; People were evidently puzzled, disturbed, not pleased&mdash;as
      if some star not hitherto accounted for had suddenly appeared amongst the
      proper constellations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Searching this crowd for Barbara, Courtier had all the time an uneasy
      sense of shame. What business had he to come amongst these people so
      strange to him, just for the sake of seeing her! What business had he to
      be hankering after this girl at all, knowing in his heart that he could
      not stand the atmosphere she lived in for a week, and that she was utterly
      unsuited for any atmosphere that he could give her; to say nothing of the
      unlikelihood that he could flutter the pulses of one half his age!
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice, behind him said: &ldquo;Mr. Courtier!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, and there was Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk to you about something serious: Will you come into the
      picture gallery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When at last they were close to a family group of Georgian Caradocs, and
      could as it were shut out the throng sufficiently for private speech, she
      began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miltoun&rsquo;s so horribly unhappy; I don&rsquo;t know what to do for him: He&rsquo;s
      making himself ill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she suddenly looked up, in Courtier&rsquo;s face. She seemed to him very
      young, and touching, at that moment. Her eyes had a gleam of faith in
      them, like a child&rsquo;s eyes; as if she relied on him to straighten out this
      tangle, to tell her not only about Miltoun&rsquo;s trouble, but about all life,
      its meaning, and the secret of its happiness: And he said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do? Mrs. Noel is in Town. But that&rsquo;s no good, unless&mdash;&rdquo;
       Not knowing how to finish this sentence; he was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were Miltoun,&rdquo; she muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that quaint saying, Courtier was hard put to it not to take hold of the
      hands so close to him. This flash of rebellion in her had quickened all
      his blood. But she seemed to have seen what had passed in him, for her
      next speech was chilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good; stupid of me to be worrying you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite impossible for you to worry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes lifted suddenly from her glove, and looked straight into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really going to Persia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want you to, not yet!&rdquo; and turning suddenly, she left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely disturbed, Courtier remained motionless, consulting the grave
      stare of the group of Georgian Caradocs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good painting, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Behind him was Lord Harbinger. And once more the memory of Lady
      Casterley&rsquo;s words; the memory of the two figures with joined hands on the
      balcony above the election crowd; all his latent jealousy of this handsome
      young Colossus, his animus against one whom he could, as it were, smell
      out to be always fighting on the winning side; all his consciousness too
      of what a lost cause his own was, his doubt whether he were honourable to
      look on it as a cause at all, flared up in Courtier, so that his answer
      was a stare. On Harbinger&rsquo;s face, too, there had come a look of stubborn
      violence slowly working up towards the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said: &lsquo;Good, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; Mr. Courtier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were pleased to answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the civility which might be expected of your habits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coldly disdainful, Courtier answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to say that sort of thing, please choose a place where I can
      reply to you,&rdquo; and turned abruptly on his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he ground his teeth as he made his way out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Hyde Park the grass was parched and dewless under a sky whose stars
      were veiled by the heat and dust haze. Never had Courtier so bitterly
      wanted the sky&rsquo;s consolation&mdash;the blessed sense of insignificance in
      the face of the night&rsquo;s dark beauty, which, dwarfing all petty rage and
      hunger, made men part of its majesty, exalted them to a sense of
      greatness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was past four o&rsquo;clock the following day when Barbara issued from
      Valleys House on foot; clad in a pale buff frock, chosen for quietness,
      she attracted every eye. Very soon entering a taxi-cab, she drove to the
      Temple, stopped at the Strand entrance, and walked down the little narrow
      lane into the heart of the Law. Its votaries were hurrying back from the
      Courts, streaming up from their Chambers for tea, or escaping desperately
      to Lord&rsquo;s or the Park&mdash;young votaries, unbound as yet by the
      fascination of fame or fees. And each, as he passed, looked at Barbara,
      with his fingers itching to remove his hat, and a feeling that this was
      She. After a day spent amongst precedents and practice, after six hours at
      least of trying to discover what chance A had of standing on his rights,
      or B had of preventing him, it was difficult to feel otherwise about that
      calm apparition&mdash;like a golden slim tree walking. One of them, asked
      by her the way to Miltoun&rsquo;s staircase, preceded her with shy ceremony, and
      when she had vanished up those dusty stairs, lingered on, hoping that she
      might find her visitee out, and be obliged to return and ask him the way
      back. But she did not come, and he went sadly away, disturbed to the very
      bottom of all that he owned in fee simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, no one answered Barbara&rsquo;s knock, and discovering that the door
      yielded, she walked through the lobby past the clerk&rsquo;s den, converted to a
      kitchen, into the sitting-room. It was empty. She had never been to
      Miltoun&rsquo;s rooms before, and she stared about her curiously. Since he did
      not practise, much of the proper gear was absent. The room indeed had a
      worn carpet, a few old chairs, and was lined from floor to ceiling with
      books. But the wall space between the windows was occupied by an enormous
      map of England, scored all over with figures and crosses; and before this
      map stood an immense desk, on which were piles of double foolscap covered
      with Miltoun&rsquo;s neat and rather pointed writing. Barbara examined them,
      puckering up her forehead; she knew that he was working at a book on the
      land question; but she had never realized that the making of a book
      requited so much writing. Papers, too, and Blue Books littered a large
      bureau on which stood bronze busts of AEschylus and Dante.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an uncomfortable place!&rdquo; she thought. The room, indeed, had an
      atmosphere, a spirit, which depressed her horribly. Seeing a few flowers
      down in the court below, she had a longing to get out to them. Then behind
      her she heard the sound of someone talking. But there was no one in the
      room; and the effect of this disrupted soliloquy, which came from nowhere,
      was so uncanny, that she retreated to the door. The sound, as of two
      spirits speaking in one voice, grew louder, and involuntarily she glanced
      at the busts. They seemed quite blameless. Though the sound had been
      behind her when she was at the window, it was again behind her now that
      she was at the door; and she suddenly realized that it was issuing from a
      bookcase in the centre of the wall. Barbara had her father&rsquo;s nerve, and
      walking up to the bookcase she perceived that it had been affixed to, and
      covered, a door that was not quite closed. She pulled it towards her, and
      passed through. Across the centre of an unkempt bedroom Miltoun was
      striding, dressed only in his shirt and trousers. His feet were bare, and
      his head and hair dripping wet; the look on his thin dark face went to
      Barbara&rsquo;s heart. She ran forward, and took his hand. This was burning hot,
      but the sight of her seemed to have frozen his tongue and eyes. And the
      contrast of his burning hand with this frozen silence, frightened Barbara
      horribly. She could think of nothing but to put her other hand to his
      forehead. That too was burning hot!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brought you here?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could only murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Eusty! Are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun took hold of her wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, I&rsquo;ve been working too hard; got a touch of fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I can feel,&rdquo; murmured Barbara. &ldquo;You ought to be in bed. Come home with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a case for leeches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The look of his smile, the sound of his voice, sent a shudder through her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to leave you here alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miltoun&rsquo;s grasp tightened on her wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Babs, you will do what I tell you. Go home, hold your tongue, and
      leave me to burn out in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara sustained that painful grip without wincing; she had regained her
      calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come! You haven&rsquo;t anything here, not even a cool drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! Barley water!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scorn he put into those two words was more withering than a whole
      philippic against redemption by creature comforts. And feeling it dart
      into her, Barbara closed her lips tight. He had dropped her wrists, and
      again, begun pacing up and down; suddenly he stopped:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;&lsquo;The stars, sun, moon all shrink away,
               A desert vast, without a bound,
          And nothing left to eat or drink,

               &ldquo;And a dark desert all around.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should read your Blake, Audrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara turned quickly, and went out frightened. She passed through the
      sitting-room and corridor on to the staircase. He was ill-raving! The
      fever in Miltoun&rsquo;s veins seemed to have stolen through the clutch of his
      hands into her own veins. Her face was burning, she thought confusedly,
      breathed unevenly. She felt sore, and at the same time terribly sorry; and
      withal there kept rising in her the gusty memory of Harbingers kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried down the stairs, turned by instinct down-hill and found
      herself on the Embankment. And suddenly, with her inherent power of swift
      decision, she hailed a cab, and drove to the nearest telephone office.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      To a woman like Audrey Noel, born to be the counterpart and complement of
      another,&mdash;whose occupations and effort were inherently divorced from
      the continuity of any stiff and strenuous purpose of her own, the
      uprooting she had voluntarily undergone was a serious matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bereaved of the faces of her flowers, the friendly sighing of her
      lime-tree, the wants of her cottagers; bereaved of that busy monotony of
      little home things which is the stay and solace of lonely women, she was
      extraordinarily lost. Even music for review seemed to have failed her. She
      had never lived in London, so that she had not the refuge of old haunts
      and habits, but had to make her own&mdash;and to make habits and haunts
      required a heart that could at least stretch out feelers and lay hold of
      things, and her heart was not now able. When she had struggled with her
      Edwardian flat, and laid down her simple routine of meals, she was as
      stranded as ever was, convict let out of prison. She had not even that
      great support, the necessity of hiding her feelings for fear of disturbing
      others. She was planted there, with her longing and grief, and nothing,
      nobody, to take her out of herself. Having wilfully embraced this
      position, she tried to make the best of it, feeling it less intolerable,
      at all events, than staying on at Monkland, where she had made that
      grievous, and unpardonable error&mdash;falling in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      This offence, on the part of one who felt within herself a great capacity
      to enjoy and to confer happiness, had arisen&mdash;like the other grievous
      and unpardonable offence, her marriage&mdash;from too much disposition to
      yield herself to the personality of another. But it was cold comfort to
      know that the desire to give and to receive love had twice over left her&mdash;a
      dead woman. Whatever the nature of those immature sensations with which,
      as a girl of twenty, she had accepted her husband, in her feeling towards
      Miltoun there was not only abandonment, but the higher flame of
      self-renunciation. She wanted to do the best for him, and had not even the
      consolation of the knowledge that she had sacrificed herself for his
      advantage. All had been taken out of her hands! Yet with characteristic
      fatalism she did not feel rebellious. If it were ordained that she should,
      for fifty, perhaps sixty years, repent in sterility and ashes that first
      error of her girlhood, rebellion was, none the less, too far-fetched. If
      she rebelled, it would not be in spirit, but in action. General principles
      were nothing to her; she lost no force brooding over the justice or
      injustice of her situation, but merely tried to digest its facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole day, succeeding Courtier&rsquo;s visit, was spent by her in the
      National Gallery, whose roof, alone of all in London, seemed to offer her
      protection. She had found one painting, by an Italian master, the subject
      of which reminded her of Miltoun; and before this she sat for a very long
      time, attracting at last the gouty stare of an official. The still figure
      of this lady, with the oval face and grave beauty, both piqued his
      curiosity, and stimulated certain moral qualms. She, was undoubtedly
      waiting for her lover. No woman, in his experience, had ever sat so long
      before a picture without ulterior motive; and he kept his eyes well opened
      to see what this motive would be like. It gave him, therefore, a sensation
      almost amounting to chagrin when coming round once more, he found they had
      eluded him and gone off together without coming under his inspection.
      Feeling his feet a good deal, for he had been on them all day, he sat down
      in the hollow which she had left behind her; and against his will found
      himself also looking at the picture. It was painted in a style he did not
      care for; the face of the subject, too, gave him the queer feeling that
      the gentleman was being roasted inside. He had not been sitting there
      long, however, before he perceived the lady standing by the picture, and
      the lips of the gentleman in the picture moving. It seemed to him against
      the rules, and he got up at once, and went towards it; but as he did so,
      he found that his eyes were shut, and opened them hastily. There was no
      one there.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the National Gallery, Audrey had gone into an A.B.C. for tea, and
      then home. Before the Mansions was a taxi-cab, and the maid met her with
      the news that &lsquo;Lady Caradoc&rsquo; was in the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara was indeed standing in the middle of the room with a look on her
      face such as her father wore sometimes on the racecourse, in the hunting
      field, or at stormy Cabinet Meetings, a look both resolute and sharp. She
      spoke at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got your address from Mr. Courtier. My brother is ill. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;ll
      be brain fever, I think you had better go and see him at his rooms in the
      Temple; there&rsquo;s no time to be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Audrey everything in the room seemed to go round; yet all her senses
      were preternaturally acute, so that she could distinctly smell the mud of
      the river at low tide. She said, with a shudder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I will go; yes, I will go at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite alone. He hasn&rsquo;t asked for you; but I think your going is the
      only chance. He took me for you. You told me once you were a good nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The room was steady enough now, but she had lost the preternatural
      acuteness of her senses, and felt confused. She heard Barbara say: &ldquo;I can
      take you to the door in my cab,&rdquo; and murmuring: &ldquo;I will get ready,&rdquo; went
      into her bedroom. For a moment she was so utterly bewildered that she did
      nothing. Then every other thought was lost in a strange, soft, almost
      painful delight, as if some new instinct were being born in her; and
      quickly, but without confusion or hurry, she began packing. She put into a
      valise her own toilet things; then flannel, cotton-wool, eau de Cologne,
      hot-water bottle, Etna, shawls, thermometer, everything she had which
      could serve in illness. Changing to a plain dress, she took up the valise
      and returned to Barbara. They went out together to the cab. The moment it
      began to bear her to this ordeal at once so longed-for and so terrible,
      fear came over her again, so that she screwed herself into the corner,
      very white and still. She was aware of Barbara calling to the driver: &ldquo;Go
      by the Strand, and stop at a poulterer&rsquo;s for ice!&rdquo; And, when the bag of
      ice had been handed in, heard her saying: &ldquo;I will bring you all you want&mdash;if
      he is really going to be ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the cab stopped, and the open doorway of the staircase was before
      her, all her courage came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt the girl&rsquo;s warm hand against her own, and grasping her valise and
      the bag of ice, got out, and hurried up the steps.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      On leaving Nettlefold, Miltoun had gone straight back to his rooms, and
      begun at once to work at his book on the land question. He worked all
      through that night&mdash;his third night without sleep, and all the
      following day. In the evening, feeling queer in the head, he went out and
      walked up and down the Embankment. Then, fearing to go to bed and lie
      sleepless, he sat down in his arm-chair. Falling asleep there, he had
      fearful dreams, and awoke unrefreshed. After his bath, he drank coffee,
      and again forced himself to work. By the middle of the day he felt dizzy
      and exhausted, but utterly disinclined to eat. He went out into the hot
      Strand, bought himself a necessary book, and after drinking more coffee,
      came back and again began to work. At four o&rsquo;clock he found that he was
      not taking in the words. His head was burning hot, and he went into his
      bedroom to bathe it. Then somehow he began walking up and down, talking to
      himself, as Barbara had found him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no sooner gone, than he felt utterly exhausted. A small crucifix
      hung over his bed, and throwing himself down before it, he remained
      motionless with his face buried in the coverlet, and his arms stretched
      out towards the wall. He did not pray, but merely sought rest from
      sensation. Across his half-hypnotized consciousness little threads of
      burning fancy kept shooting. Then he could feel nothing but utter physical
      sickness, and against this his will revolted. He resolved that he would
      not be ill, a ridiculous log for women to hang over. But the moments of
      sickness grew longer and more frequent; and to drive them away he rose
      from his knees, and for some time again walked up and down; then, seized
      with vertigo, he was obliged to sit on the bed to save himself from
      falling. From being burning hot he had become deadly cold, glad to cover
      himself with the bedclothes. The heat soon flamed up in him again; but
      with a sick man&rsquo;s instinct he did not throw off the clothes, and stayed
      quite still. The room seemed to have turned to a thick white substance
      like a cloud, in which he lay enwrapped, unable to move hand or foot. His
      sense of smell and hearing had become unnaturally acute; he smelled the
      distant streets, flowers, dust, and the leather of his books, even the
      scent left by Barbara&rsquo;s clothes, and a curious odour of river mud. A clock
      struck six, he counted each stroke; and instantly the whole world seemed
      full of striking clocks, the sound of horses&rsquo; hoofs, bicycle bells,
      people&rsquo;s footfalls. His sense of vision, on the contrary, was absorbed in
      consciousness of this white blanket of cloud wherein he was lifted above
      the earth, in the midst of a dull incessant hammering. On the surface of
      the cloud there seemed to be forming a number of little golden spots;
      these spots were moving, and he saw that they were toads. Then, beyond
      them, a huge face shaped itself, very dark, as if of bronze, with eyes
      burning into his brain. The more he struggled to get away from these eyes,
      the more they bored and burned into him. His voice was gone, so that he
      was unable to cry out, and suddenly the face marched over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he recovered consciousness his head was damp with moisture trickling
      from something held to his forehead by a figure leaning above him. Lifting
      his hand he touched a cheek; and hearing a sob instantly suppressed, he
      sighed. His hand was gently taken; he felt kisses on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was so dark, that he could scarcely see her face&mdash;his sight
      too was dim; but he could hear her breathing and the least sound of her
      dress and movements&mdash;the scent too of her hands and hair seemed to
      envelop him, and in the midst of all the acute discomfort of his fever, he
      felt the band round his brain relax. He did not ask how long she had been
      there, but lay quite still, trying to keep his eyes on her, for fear of
      that face, which seemed lurking behind the air, ready to march on him
      again. Then feeling suddenly that he could not hold it back, he beckoned,
      and clutched at her, trying to cover himself with the protection of her
      breast. This time his swoon was not so deep; it gave way to delirium, with
      intervals when he knew that she was there, and by the shaded candle light
      could see her in a white garment, floating close to him, or sitting still
      with her hand on his; he could even feel the faint comfort of the ice cap,
      and of the scent of eau de Cologne. Then he would lose all consciousness
      of her presence, and pass through into the incoherent world, where the
      crucifix above his bed seemed to bulge and hang out, as if it must fall on
      him. He conceived a violent longing to tear it down, which grew till he
      had struggled up in bed and wrenched it from off the wall. Yet a
      mysterious consciousness of her presence permeated even his darkest
      journeys into the strange land; and once she seemed to be with him, where
      a strange light showed them fields and trees, a dark line of moor, and a
      bright sea, all whitened, and flashing with sweet violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after dawn he had a long interval of consciousness, and took in with
      a sort of wonder her presence in the low chair by his bed. So still she
      sat in a white loose gown, pale with watching, her eyes immovably fixed on
      him, her lips pressed together, and quivering at his faintest motion. He
      drank in desperately the sweetness of her face, which had so lost
      remembrance of self.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      Barbara gave the news of her brother&rsquo;s illness to no one else, common
      sense telling her to run no risk of disturbance. Of her own initiative,
      she brought a doctor, and went down twice a day to hear reports of
      Miltoun&rsquo;s progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a fact, her father and mother had gone to Lord Dennis, for Goodwood,
      and the chief difficulty had been to excuse her own neglect of that
      favourite Meeting. She had fallen back on the half-truth that Eustace
      wanted her in Town; and, since Lord and Lady Valleys had neither of them
      shaken off a certain uneasiness about their son, the pretext sufficed:
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the sixth day, when the crisis was well past and Miltoun
      quite free from fever, that she again went down to Nettlefold.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving she at once sought out her mother, whom she found in her
      bedroom, resting. It had been very hot at Goodwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara was not afraid of her&mdash;she was not, indeed, afraid of anyone,
      except Miltoun, and in some strange way, a little perhaps of Courtier;
      yet, when the maid had gone, she did not at once begin her tale. Lady
      Valleys, who at Goodwood had just heard details of a Society scandal,
      began a carefully expurgated account of it suitable to her daughter&rsquo;s ears&mdash;for
      some account she felt she must give to somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Barbara suddenly, &ldquo;Eustace has been ill. He&rsquo;s out of danger
      now, and going on all right.&rdquo; Then, looking hard at the bewildered lady,
      she added: &ldquo;Mrs. Noel is nursing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The past tense in which illness had been mentioned, checking at the first
      moment any rush of panic in Lady Valleys, left her confused by the
      situation conjured up in Barbara&rsquo;s last words. Instead of feeding that
      part of man which loves a scandal, she was being fed, always an unenviable
      sensation. A woman did not nurse a man under such circumstances without
      being everything to him, in the world&rsquo;s eyes. Her daughter went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took her to him. It seemed the only thing to do&mdash;since it&rsquo;s all
      through fretting for her. Nobody knows, of course, except the doctor, and&mdash;Stacey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; muttered Lady Valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has saved him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother instinct in Lady Valleys took sudden fright. &ldquo;Are you telling
      me the truth, Babs? Is he really out of danger? How wrong of you not to
      let me know before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Barbara did not flinch; and her mother relapsed into rumination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stacey is a cat!&rdquo; she said suddenly. The expurgated details of the
      scandal she had been retailing to her daughter had included the usual
      maid. She could not find it in her to enjoy the irony of this coincidence.
      Then, seeing Barbara smile, she said tartly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fail to see the joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that I thought you&rsquo;d enjoy my throwing Stacey in, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! You mean she doesn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a little wretch you are, Babs!&rdquo; Maliciously she added: &ldquo;Claud and
      his mother are coming over from Whitewater, with Bertie and Lily Malvezin,
      you&rsquo;d better go and dress;&rdquo; and her eyes searched her daughter&rsquo;s so
      shrewdly, that a flush rose to the girl&rsquo;s cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone, Lady Valleys rang for her maid again, and relapsed into
      meditation. Her first thought was to consult her husband; her second that
      secrecy was strength. Since no one knew but Barbara, no one had better
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her astuteness and experience comprehended the far-reaching probabilities
      of this affair. It would not do to take a single false step. If she had no
      one&rsquo;s action to control but her own and Barbara&rsquo;s, so much the less chance
      of a slip. Her mind was a strange medley of thoughts and feelings, almost
      comic, well-nigh tragic; of worldly prudence, and motherly instinct; of
      warm-blooded sympathy with all love-affairs, and cool-blooded concern for
      her son&rsquo;s career. It was not yet too late perhaps to prevent real
      mischief; especially since it was agreed by everyone that the woman was no
      adventuress. Whatever was done, they must not forget that she had nursed
      him&mdash;saved him, Barbara had said! She must be treated with all
      kindness and consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastening her toilette, she in turn went to her daughter&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara was already dressed, leaning out of her window towards the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys began almost timidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, is Eustace out of bed yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was to get up to-day for an hour or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Now, would there be any danger if you and I went up and took
      charge over from Mrs. Noel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Eusty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! But, exercise your judgment. Would it harm him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara was silent. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it would,
      now; but it&rsquo;s for the doctor to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys exhibited a manifest relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see him first, of course. Eustace will have to have an ordinary
      nurse, I suppose, for a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking stealthily at Barbara, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to be very nice to her; but one mustn&rsquo;t be romantic, you know,
      Babs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the little smile on Barbara&rsquo;s lips she derived no sense of certainty;
      indeed she was visited by all her late disquietude about her young
      daughter, by all the feeling that she, as well as Miltoun, was hovering on
      the verge of some folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am going down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Barbara lingered a little longer in that bedroom where ten nights ago
      she had lain tossing, till in despair she went and cooled herself in the
      dark sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her last little interview with Courtier stood between her and a fresh
      meeting with Harbinger, whom at the Valleys House gathering she had not
      suffered to be alone with her. She came down late.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening, out on the beach road, under a sky swarming with stars,
      the people were strolling&mdash;folk from the towns, down for their
      fortnight&rsquo;s holiday. In twos and threes, in parties of six or eight, they
      passed the wall at the end of Lord Dennis&rsquo;s little domain; and the sound
      of their sparse talk and laughter, together with the sighing of the young
      waves, was blown over the wall to the ears of Harbinger, Bertie, Barbara,
      and Lily Malvezin, when they strolled out after dinner to sniff the sea.
      The holiday-makers stared dully at the four figures in evening dress
      looking out above their heads; they had other things than these to think
      of, becoming more and more silent as the night grew dark. The four young
      people too were rather silent. There was something in this warm night,
      with its sighing, and its darkness, and its stars, that was not favourable
      to talk, so that presently they split into couples, drifting a little
      apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing there, gripping the wall, it seemed to Harbinger that there were
      no words left in the world. Not even his worst enemy could have called
      this young man romantic; yet that figure beside him, the gleam of her neck
      and her pale cheek in the dark, gave him perhaps the most poignant glimpse
      of mystery that he had ever had. His mind, essentially that of a man of
      affairs, by nature and by habit at home amongst the material aspects of
      things, was but gropingly conscious that here, in this dark night, and the
      dark sea, and the pale figure of this girl whose heart was dark to him and
      secret, there was perhaps something&mdash;yes, something&mdash;which
      surpassed the confines of his philosophy, something beckoning him on out
      of his snug compound into the desert of divinity. If so, it was soon gone
      in the aching of his senses at the scent of her hair, and the longing to
      escape from this weird silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babs,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;have you forgiven me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her answer came, without turn of head, natural, indifferent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I told you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all you have to say to a fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we talk about&mdash;the running of Casetta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Deep down within him Harbinger uttered a noiseless oath. Something
      sinister was making her behave like this to him! It was that fellow&mdash;that
      fellow! And suddenly he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; then speech seemed to stick in his throat.
      No! If there were anything in that, he preferred not to hear it. There was
      a limit!
    </p>
    <p>
      Down below, a pair of lovers passed, very silent, their arms round each
      other&rsquo;s waists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara turned and walked away towards the house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The days when Miltoun was first allowed out of bed were a time of mingled
      joy and sorrow to her who had nursed him. To see him sitting up, amazed at
      his own weakness, was happiness, yet to think that he would be no more
      wholly dependent, no more that sacred thing, a helpless creature, brought
      her the sadness of a mother whose child no longer needs her. With every
      hour he would now get farther from her, back into the fastnesses of his
      own spirit. With every hour she would be less his nurse and comforter,
      more the woman he loved. And though that thought shone out in the obscure
      future like a glamorous flower, it brought too much wistful uncertainty to
      the present. She was very tired, too, now that all excitement was over&mdash;so
      tired that she hardly knew what she did or where she moved. But a smile
      had become so faithful to her eyes that it clung there above the shadows
      of fatigue, and kept taking her lips prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the two bronze busts she had placed a bowl of lilies of the
      valley; and every free niche in that room of books had a little vase of
      roses to welcome Miltoun&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was lying back in his big leather chair, wrapped in a Turkish gown of
      Lord Valleys&rsquo;&mdash;on which Barbara had laid hands, having failed to find
      anything resembling a dressing-gown amongst her brother&rsquo;s austere
      clothing. The perfume of lilies had overcome the scent of books, and a
      bee, dusky, adventurer, filled the room with his pleasant humming.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not speak, but smiled faintly, looking at one another. In this
      still moment, before passion had returned to claim its own, their spirits
      passed through the sleepy air, and became entwined, so that neither could
      withdraw that soft, slow, encountering glance. In mutual contentment, each
      to each, close as music to the strings of a violin, their spirits clung&mdash;so
      lost, the one in the other, that neither for that brief time seemed to
      know which was self.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fulfilment of her resolution, Lady Valleys, who had returned to Town by
      a morning train, started with Barbara for the Temple about three in the
      after noon, and stopped at the doctor&rsquo;s on the way. The whole thing would
      be much simpler if Eustace were fit to be moved at once to Valleys House;
      and with much relief she found that the doctor saw no danger in this
      course. The recovery had been remarkable&mdash;touch and go for bad brain
      fever just avoided! Lord Miltoun&rsquo;s constitution was extremely sound. Yes,
      he would certainly favour a removal. His rooms were too confined in this
      weather. Well nursed&mdash;(decidedly) Oh; yes! Quite! And the doctor&rsquo;s
      eyes became perhaps a trifle more intense. Not a professional, he
      understood. It might be as well to have another nurse, if they were making
      the change. They would have this lady knocking up. Just so! Yes, he would
      see to that. An ambulance carriage he thought advisable. That could all be
      arranged for this afternoon&mdash;at once&mdash;he himself would look to
      it. They might take Lord Miltoun off just as he was; the men would know
      what to do. And when they had him at Valleys House, the moment he showed
      interest in his food, down to the sea-down to the sea! At this time of
      year nothing like it! Then with regard to nourishment, he would be
      inclined already to shove in a leetle stimulant, a thimbleful perhaps four
      times a day with food&mdash;not without&mdash;mixed with an egg, with
      arrowroot, with custard. A week would see him on his legs, a fortnight at
      the sea make him as good a man as ever. Overwork&mdash;burning the candle&mdash;a
      leetlemore would have seen a very different state of things! Quite so!
      quite so! Would come round himself before dinner, and make sure. His
      patient might feel it just at first! He bowed Lady Valleys out; and when
      she had gone, sat down at his telephone with a smile flickering on his
      clean-cut lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greatly fortified by this interview, Lady Valleys rejoined her daughter in
      the ear; but while it slid on amongst the multitudinous traffic, signs of
      unwonted nervousness began to start out through the placidity of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, my dear,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;that someone else had to do this.
      Suppose Eustace refuses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Barbara answered; &ldquo;she looks so tired, poor dear. Besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys gazed with curiosity at that young face, which had flushed
      pink. Yes, this daughter of hers was a woman already, with all a woman&rsquo;s
      intuitions. She said gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a rash stroke of yours, Babs; let&rsquo;s hope it won&rsquo;t lead to
      disaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara bit her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d seen him as I saw him! And, what disaster? Mayn&rsquo;t they love each
      other, if they want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys swallowed a grimace. It was so exactly her own point of view.
      And yet&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only the beginning,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you forget the sort of boy Eustace
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t the poor thing be let out of her cage?&rdquo; cried Barbara. &ldquo;What
      good does it do to anyone? Mother, if ever, when I am married, I want to
      get free, I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of her voice was so quivering, and unlike the happy voice of
      Barbara, that Lady Valleys involuntarily caught hold of her hand and
      squeezed it hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sweet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk of such gloomy things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it. Nothing shall stop me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Valleys&rsquo; face had suddenly become rather grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we think, child; it&rsquo;s not so simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be worse, anyway,&rdquo; muttered Barbara, &ldquo;than being buried alive as
      that wretched woman is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer Lady Valleys only murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor promised that ambulance carriage at four o&rsquo;clock. What am I
      going to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll understand when you look at her. She&rsquo;s that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened to them by Mrs. Noel herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time Lady Valleys had seen her in a house, and there was
      real curiosity mixed with the assurance which masked her nervousness. A
      pretty creature, even lovely! But the quite genuine sympathy in her words:
      &ldquo;I am truly grateful. You must be quite worn out,&rdquo; did not prevent her
      adding hastily: &ldquo;The doctor says he must be got home out of these hot
      rooms. We&rsquo;ll wait here while you tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she saw that it was true; this woman was the sort who understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left in the dark passage, she peered round at Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was standing against the wall with her head thrown back. Lady
      Valleys could not see her face; but she felt all of a sudden exceedingly
      uncomfortable, and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two murders and a theft, Babs; wasn&rsquo;t it &lsquo;Our Mutual Friend&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her face! When you&rsquo;re going to throw away a flower, it looks at you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; murmured Lady Valleys, thoroughly distressed, &ldquo;what things
      you&rsquo;re saying to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This lurking in a dark passage, this whispering girl&mdash;it was all
      queer, unlike an experience in proper life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then through the reopened door she saw Miltoun, stretched out in a
      chair, very pale, but still with that look about his eyes and lips, which
      of all things in the world had a chastening effect on Lady Valleys, making
      her feel somehow incurably mundane.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said rather timidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re better, dear. What a time you must have had! It&rsquo;s too
      bad that I knew nothing till yesterday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miltoun&rsquo;s answer was, as usual, thoroughly disconcerting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, yes! I have had a perfect time&mdash;and have now to pay for it,
      I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Held back by his smile from bending to kiss him, poor Lady Valleys
      fidgeted from head to foot. A sudden impulse of sheer womanliness caused a
      tear to fall on his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Miltoun perceived that moisture, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, mother. I&rsquo;m quite willing to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still wounded by his voice, Lady Valleys hardened instantly. And while
      preparing for departure she watched the two furtively. They hardly looked
      at one another, and when they did, their eyes baffled her. The expression
      was outside her experience, belonging as it were to a different world,
      with its faintly smiling, almost shining, gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vastly relieved when Miltoun, covered with a fur, had been taken down to
      the carriage, she lingered to speak to Mrs. Noel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We owe you a great debt. It might have been so much worse. You mustn&rsquo;t be
      disconsolate. Go to bed and have a good long rest.&rdquo; And from the door, she
      murmured again: &ldquo;He will come and thank you, when he&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Descending the stone stairs, she thought: &ldquo;&lsquo;Anonyma&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Anonyma&rsquo;&mdash;yes,
      it was quite the name.&rdquo; And suddenly she saw Barbara come running up
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Babs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eustace would like some of those lilies.&rdquo; And, passing Lady Valleys, she
      went on up to Miltoun&rsquo;s chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Noel was not in the sitting-room, and going to the bedroom door, the
      girl looked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing by the bed, drawing her hand over and over the white
      surface of the pillow. Stealing noiselessly back, Barbara caught up the
      bunch of lilies, and fled.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miltoun, whose constitution, had the steel-like quality of Lady
      Casterley&rsquo;s, had a very rapid convalescence. And, having begun to take an
      interest in his food, he was allowed to travel on the seventh day to Sea
      House in charge of Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two spent their time in a little summer-house close to the sea; lying
      out on the beach under the groynes; and, as Miltoun grew stronger,
      motoring and walking on the Downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Barbara, keeping a close watch, he seemed tranquilly enough drinking in
      from Nature what was necessary to restore balance after the struggle, and
      breakdown of the past weeks. Yet she could never get rid of a queer
      feeling that he was not really there at all; to look at him was like
      watching an uninhabited house that was waiting for someone to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a whole fortnight he did not make a single allusion to Mrs. Noel,
      till, on the very last morning, as they were watching the sea, he said
      with his queer smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It almost makes one believe her theory, that the old gods are not dead.
      Do you ever see them, Babs; or are you, like me, obtuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly about those lithe invasions of the sea-nymph waves, with ashy,
      streaming hair, flinging themselves into the arms of the land, there was
      the old pagan rapture, an inexhaustible delight, a passionate soft
      acceptance of eternal fate, a wonderful acquiescence in the untiring
      mystery of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Barbara, ever disconcerted by that tone in his voice, and by this
      quick dive into the waters of unaccustomed thought, failed to find an
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says, too, we can hear Apollo singing. Shall we try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But all that came was the sigh of the sea, and of the wind in the
      tamarisk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; muttered Miltoun at last, &ldquo;she alone can hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Barbara saw, once more on his face that look, neither sad nor
      impatient, but as of one uninhabited and waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left Sea House next day to rejoin her mother, who, having been to
      Cowes, and to the Duchess of Gloucester&rsquo;s, was back in Town waiting for
      Parliament to rise, before going off to Scotland. And that same afternoon
      the girl made her way to Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s flat. In paying this visit she was
      moved not so much by compassion, as by uneasiness, and a strange
      curiosity. Now that Miltoun was well again, she was seriously disturbed in
      mind. Had she made a mistake in summoning Mrs. Noel to nurse him?
    </p>
    <p>
      When she went into the little drawing-room Audrey was sitting in the
      deep-cushioned window-seat with a book on her knee; and by the fact that
      it was open at the index, Barbara judged that she had not been reading too
      attentively. She showed no signs of agitation at the sight of her visitor,
      nor any eagerness to hear news of Miltoun. But the girl had not been five
      minutes in the room before the thought came to her: &ldquo;Why! She has the same
      look as Eustace!&rdquo; She, too, was like an empty tenement; without
      impatience, discontent, or grief&mdash;waiting! Barbara had scarcely
      realized this with a curious sense of discomposure, when Courtier was
      announced. Whether there was in this an absolute coincidence or just that
      amount of calculation which might follow on his part from receipt of a
      note written from Sea House&mdash;saying that Miltoun was well again, that
      she was coming up and meant to go and thank Mrs. Noel&mdash;was not clear,
      nor were her own sensations; and she drew over her face that armoured look
      which she perhaps knew Courtier could not bear to see. His face, at all
      events, was very red when he shook hands. He had come, he told Mrs. Noel,
      to say good-bye. He was definitely off next week. Fighting had broken out;
      the revolutionaries were greatly outnumbered. Indeed he ought to have been
      there long before!
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara had gone over to the window; she turned suddenly, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were preaching peace two months ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not all perfectly consistent, Lady Barbara. These poor devils have
      a holy cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara held out her hand to Mrs. Noel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You only think their cause holy because they happen to be weak. Good-bye,
      Mrs. Noel; the world is meant for the strong, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She intended that to hurt him; and from the tone of his voice, she knew it
      had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Lady Barbara; from your mother, yes; not from you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I believe. Good-bye!&rdquo; And she went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had told him that she did not want him to go&mdash;not yet; and he was
      going!
    </p>
    <p>
      But no sooner had she got outside, after that strange outburst, than she
      bit her lips to keep back an angry, miserable feeling. He had been rude to
      her, she had been rude to him; that was the way they had said good-bye!
      Then, as she emerged into the sunlight, she thought: &ldquo;Oh! well; he doesn&rsquo;t
      care, and I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard a voice behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I get you a cab?&rdquo; and at once the sore feeling began to die away; but
      she did not look round, only smiled, and shook her head, and made a little
      room for him on the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though they walked, they did not at first talk. There was rising
      within Barbara a tantalizing devil of desire to know the feelings that
      really lay behind that deferential gravity, to make him show her how much
      he really cared. She kept her eyes demurely lowered, but she let the
      glimmer of a smile flicker about her lips; she knew too that her cheeks
      were glowing, and for that she was not sorry. Was she not to have any&mdash;any&mdash;was
      he calmly to go away&mdash;without&mdash;&mdash;And she thought: &ldquo;He shall
      say something! He shall show me, without that horrible irony of his!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those two are just waiting&mdash;something will happen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is probable,&rdquo; was his grave answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him then&mdash;it pleased her to see him quiver as if that
      glance had gone right into him; and she said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I think they will be quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew those were reckless words, nor cared very much what they meant;
      but she knew the revolt in them would move him. She saw from his face that
      it had; and after a little pause, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happiness is the great thing,&rdquo; and with soft, wicked slowness: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it,
      Mr. Courtier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But all the cheeriness had gone out of his face, which had grown almost
      pale. He lifted his hand, and let it drop. Then she felt sorry. It was
      just as if he had asked her to spare him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;The rough, unfortunately, has to be taken with the
      smooth. But life&rsquo;s frightfully jolly sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with firm gravity, and answered
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sense of utter mortification seized on Barbara. He was too strong for
      her&mdash;he was quixotic&mdash;he was hateful! And, determined not to
      show a sign, to be at least as strong as he, she said calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I think I&rsquo;ll have that cab!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she was in the cab, and he was standing with his hat lifted, she
      looked at him in the way that women can, so that he did not realize that
      she had looked.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Miltoun came to thank her, Audrey Noel was waiting in the middle of
      the room, dressed in white, her lips smiling, her dark eyes smiling, still
      as a flower on a windless day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that first look passing between them, they forgot everything but
      happiness. Swallows, on the first day of summer, in their discovery of the
      bland air, can neither remember that cold winds blow, nor imagine the
      death of sunlight on their feathers, and, flitting hour after hour over
      the golden fields, seem no longer birds, but just the breathing of a new
      season&mdash;swallows were no more forgetful of misfortune than were those
      two. His gaze was as still as her very self; her look at him had in at the
      quietude of all emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they&rsquo; sat down to talk it was as if they had gone back to those days
      at Monkland, when he had come to her so often to discuss everything in
      heaven and earth. And yet, over that tranquil eager drinking&mdash;in of
      each other&rsquo;s presence, hovered a sort of awe. It was the mood of morning
      before the sun has soared. The dew-grey cobwebs enwrapped the flowers of
      their hearts&mdash;yet every prisoned flower could be seen. And he and she
      seemed looking through that web at the colour and the deep-down forms
      enshrouded so jealously; each feared too much to unveil the other&rsquo;s heart.
      They were like lovers who, rambling in a shy wood, never dare stay their
      babbling talk of the trees and birds and lost bluebells, lest in the deep
      waters of a kiss their star of all that is to come should fall and be
      drowned. To each hour its familiar&mdash;and the spirit of that hour was
      the spirit of the white flowers in the bowl on the window-sill above her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke of Monk-land, and Miltoun&rsquo;s illness; of his first speech, his
      impressions of the House of Commons; of music, Barbara, Courtier, the
      river. He told her of his health, and described his days down by the sea.
      She, as ever, spoke little of herself, persuaded that it could not
      interest even him; but she described a visit to the opera; and how she had
      found a picture in the National Gallery which reminded her of him. To all
      these trivial things and countless others, the tone of their voices&mdash;soft,
      almost murmuring, with a sort of delighted gentleness&mdash;gave a high,
      sweet importance, a halo that neither for the world would have dislodged
      from where it hovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was past six when he got up to go, and there had not been a moment to
      break the calm of that sacred feeling in both their hearts. They parted
      with another tranquil look, which seemed to say: &lsquo;It is well with us&mdash;we
      have drunk of happiness.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in this same amazing calm Miltoun remained after he had gone away,
      till about half-past nine in the evening, he started forth, to walk down
      to the House. It was now that sort of warm, clear night, which in the
      country has firefly magic, and even over the Town spreads a dark glamour.
      And for Miltoun, in the delight of his new health and well-being, with
      every sense alive and clean, to walk through the warmth and beauty of this
      night was sheer pleasure. He passed by way of St. James&rsquo;s Park, treading
      down the purple shadows of plane-tree leaves into the pools of lamplight,
      almost with remorse&mdash;so beautiful, and as if alive, were they. There
      were moths abroad, and gnats, born on the water, and scent of new-mown
      grass drifted up from the lawns. His heart felt light as a swallow he had
      seen that morning; swooping at a grey feather, carrying it along, letting
      it flutter away, then diving to seize it again. Such was his elation, this
      beautiful night! Nearing the House of Commons, he thought he would walk a
      little longer, and turned westward to the river: On that warm evening the
      water, without movement at turn of tide, was like the black, snake-smooth
      hair of Nature streaming out on her couch of Earth, waiting for the caress
      of a divine hand. Far away on the further; bank throbbed some huge
      machine, not stilled as yet. A few stars were out in the dark sky, but no
      moon to invest with pallor the gleam of the lamps. Scarcely anyone passed.
      Miltoun strolled along the river wall, then crossed, and came back in
      front of the Mansions where she lived. By the railing he stood still. In
      the sitting-room of her little flat there was no light, but the casement
      window was wide open, and the crown of white flowers in the bowl on the
      window-sill still gleamed out in the darkness like a crescent moon lying
      on its face. Suddenly, he saw two pale hands rise&mdash;one on either side
      of that bowl, lift it, and draw it in. And he quivered, as though they had
      touched him. Again those two hands came floating up; they were parted now
      by darkness; the moon of flowers was gone, in its place had been set
      handfuls of purple or crimson blossoms. And a puff of warm air rising
      quickly out of the night drifted their scent of cloves into his face, so
      that he held his breath for fear of calling out her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the hands had vanished&mdash;through the open window there was
      nothing to be seen but darkness; and such a rush of longing seized on
      Miltoun as stole from him all power of movement. He could hear her
      playing, now. The murmurous current of that melody was like the night
      itself, sighing, throbbing, languorously soft. It seemed that in this
      music she was calling him, telling him that she, too, was longing; her
      heart, too, empty. It died away; and at the window her white figure
      appeared. From that vision he could not, nor did he try to shrink, but
      moved out into the lamplight. And he saw her suddenly stretch out her
      hands to him, and withdraw them to her breast. Then all save the madness
      of his longing deserted Miltoun. He ran down the little garden, across the
      hall, up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was open. He passed through. There, in the sitting-room, where
      the red flowers in the window scented all the air, it was dark, and he
      could not at first see her, till against the piano he caught the glimmer
      of her white dress. She was sitting with hands resting on the pale notes.
      And falling on his knees, he buried his face against her. Then, without
      looking up, he raised his hands. Her tears fell on them covering her
      heart, that throbbed as if the passionate night itself were breathing in
      there, and all but the night and her love had stolen forth.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      On a spur of the Sussex Downs, inland from Nettle-Cold, there stands a
      beech-grove. The traveller who enters it out of the heat and brightness,
      takes off the shoes of his spirit before its, sanctity; and, reaching the
      centre, across the clean beech-mat, he sits refreshing his brow with air,
      and silence. For the flowers of sunlight on the ground under those
      branches are pale and rare, no insects hum, the birds are almost mute. And
      close to the border trees are the quiet, milk-white sheep, in
      congregation, escaping from noon heat. Here, above fields and dwellings,
      above the ceaseless network of men&rsquo;s doings, and the vapour of their talk,
      the traveller feels solemnity. All seems conveying divinity&mdash;the
      great white clouds moving their wings above him, the faint longing murmur
      of the boughs, and in far distance, the sea.... And for a space his
      restlessness and fear know the peace of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was with Miltoun when he reached this temple, three days after that
      passionate night, having walked for hours, alone and full of conflict.
      During those three days he had been borne forward on the flood tide; and
      now, tearing himself out of London, where to think was impossible, he had
      come to the solitude of the Downs to walk, and face his new position.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that position he saw to be very serious. In the flush of full
      realization, there was for him no question of renunciation. She was his,
      he hers; that was determined. But what, then, was he to do? There was no
      chance of her getting free. In her husband&rsquo;s view, it seemed, under no
      circumstances was marriage dissoluble. Nor, indeed, to Miltoun would
      divorce have made things easier, believing as he did that he and she were
      guilty, and that for the guilty there could be no marriage. She, it was
      true, asked nothing but just to be his in secret; and that was the course
      he knew most men would take, without further thought. There was no
      material reason in the world why he should not so act, and maintain
      unchanged every other current of his life. It would be easy, usual. And,
      with her faculty for self-effacement, he knew she would not be unhappy.
      But conscience, in Miltoun, was a terrible and fierce thing. In the
      delirium of his illness it had become that Great Face which had marched
      over him. And, though during the weeks of his recuperation, struggle of
      all kind had ceased, now that he had yielded to his passion, conscience,
      in a new and dismal shape, had crept up again to sit above his heart: He
      must and would let this man, her husband, know; but even if that caused no
      open scandal, could he go on deceiving those who, if they knew of an
      illicit love, would no longer allow him to be their representative? If it
      were known that she was his mistress, he could no longer maintain his
      position in public life&mdash;was he not therefore in honour bound; of his
      own accord, to resign it? Night and day he was haunted by the thought: How
      can I, living in defiance of authority, pretend to authority over my
      fellows? How can I remain in public life? But if he did not remain in
      public life, what was he to do? That way of life was in his blood; he had
      been bred and born into it; had thought of nothing else since he was a
      boy. There was no other occupation or interest that could hold him for a
      moment&mdash;he saw very plainly that he would be cast away on the waters
      of existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the battle raged in his proud and twisted spirit, which took everything
      so hard&mdash;his nature imperatively commanding him to keep his work and
      his power for usefulness; his conscience telling him as urgently that if
      he sought to wield authority, he must obey it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the beech-grove at the height of this misery, flaming with
      rebellion against the dilemma which Fate had placed before him; visited by
      gusts of resentment against a passion, which forced him to pay the price,
      either of his career, or of his self-respect; gusts, followed by remorse
      that he could so for one moment regret his love for that tender creature.
      The face of Lucifer was not more dark, more tortured, than Miltoun&rsquo;s face
      in the twilight of the grove, above those kingdoms of the world, for which
      his ambition and his conscience fought. He threw himself down among the
      trees; and stretching out his arms, by chance touched a beetle trying to
      crawl over the grassless soil. Some bird had maimed it. He took the little
      creature up. The beetle truly could no longer work, but it was spared the
      fate lying before himself. The beetle was not, as he would be, when his
      power of movement was destroyed, conscious of his own wasted life. The
      world would not roll away down there. He would still see himself cumbering
      the ground, when his powers were taken, from him. This thought was
      torture. Why had he been suffered to meet her, to love her, and to be
      loved by her? What had made him so certain from the first moment, if she
      were not meant for him? If he lived to be a hundred, he would never meet
      another. Why, because of his love, must he bury the will and force of a
      man? If there were no more coherence in God&rsquo;s scheme than this, let him
      too be incoherent! Let him hold authority, and live outside authority! Why
      stifle his powers for the sake of a coherence which did not exist! That
      would indeed be madness greater than that of a mad world!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer to his thoughts in the stillness of the grove, unless
      it were the cooing of a dove, or the faint thudding of the sheep issuing
      again into sunlight. But slowly that stillness stole into Miltoun&rsquo;s
      spirit. &ldquo;Is it like this in the grave?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Are the boughs of
      those trees the dark earth over me? And the sound in them the sound the
      dead hear when flowers are growing, and the wind passing through them? And
      is the feel of this earth how it feels to lie looking up for ever at
      nothing? Is life anything but a nightmare, a dream; and is not this the
      reality? And why my fury, my insignificant flame, blowing here and there,
      when there is really no wind, only a shroud of still air, and these
      flowers of sunlight that have been dropped on me! Why not let my spirit
      sleep, instead of eating itself away with rage; why not resign myself at
      once to wait for the substance, of which this is but the shadow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he lay scarcely breathing, looking up at the unmoving branches setting
      with their darkness the pearls of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not peace enough?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Is not love enough? Can I not be
      reconciled, like a woman? Is not that salvation, and happiness? What is
      all the rest, but &lsquo;sound and fury, signifying nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as though afraid to lose his hold of that thought, he got up and
      hurried from the grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole wide landscape of field and wood, cut by the pale roads, was
      glimmering under the afternoon sun, Here was no wild, wind-swept land,
      gleaming red and purple, and guarded by the grey rocks; no home of the
      winds, and the wild gods. It was all serene and silver-golden. In place of
      the shrill wailing pipe of the hunting buzzard-hawks half lost up in the
      wind, invisible larks were letting fall hymns to tranquillity; and even
      the sea&mdash;no adventuring spirit sweeping the shore with its wing&mdash;seemed
      to lie resting by the side of the land.

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      When on the afternoon of that same day Miltoun did not come, all the
      chilly doubts which his presence alone kept away, crowded thick and fast
      into the mind of one only too prone to distrust her own happiness. It
      could not last&mdash;how could it?
    </p>
    <p>
      His nature and her own were so far apart! Even in that giving of herself
      which had been such happiness, she had yet doubted; for there was so much
      in him that was to her mysterious. All that he loved in poetry and nature,
      had in it something craggy and culminating. The soft and fiery, the subtle
      and harmonious, seemed to leave him cold. He had no particular love for
      all those simple natural things, birds, bees, animals, trees, and flowers,
      that seemed to her precious and divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it was not yet four o&rsquo;clock she was already beginning to droop like
      a flower that wants water. But she sat down to her piano, resolutely, till
      tea came; playing on and on with a spirit only half present, the other
      half of her wandering in the Town, seeking for Miltoun. After tea she
      tried first to read, then to sew, and once more came back to her piano.
      The clock struck six; and as if its last stroke had broken the armour of
      her mind, she felt suddenly sick with anxiety. Why was he so long? But she
      kept on playing, turning the pages without taking in the notes, haunted by
      the idea that he might again have fallen ill. Should she telegraph? What
      good, when she could not tell in the least where he might be? And all the
      unreasoning terror of not knowing where the loved one is, beset her so
      that her hands, in sheer numbness, dropped from the keys. Unable to keep
      still, now, she wandered from window to door, out into the little hall,
      and back hastily to the window. Over her anxiety brooded a darkness,
      compounded of vague growing fears. What if it were the end? What if he had
      chosen this as the most merciful way of leaving her? But surely he would
      never be so cruel! Close on the heels of this too painful thought came
      reaction; and she told herself that she was a fool. He was at the House;
      something quite ordinary was keeping him. It was absurd to be anxious! She
      would have to get used to this now. To be a drag on him would be dreadful.
      Sooner than that she would rather&mdash;yes&mdash;rather he never came
      back! And she took up her book, determined to read quietly till he came.
      But the moment she sat down her fears returned with redoubled force-the
      cold sickly horrible feeling of uncertainty, of the knowledge that she
      could do nothing but wait till she was relieved by something over which
      she had no control. And in the superstition that to stay there in the
      window where she could see him come, was keeping him from her, she went
      into her bedroom. From there she could watch the sunset clouds wine-dark
      over the river. A little talking wind shivered along the houses; the dusk
      began creeping in. She would not turn on the light, unwilling to admit
      that it was really getting late, but began to change her dress, lingering
      desperately over every little detail of her toilette, deriving therefrom a
      faint, mysterious comfort, trying to make herself feel beautiful. From
      sheer dread of going back before he came, she let her hair fall, though it
      was quite smooth and tidy, and began brushing it. Suddenly she thought
      with horror of her efforts at adornment&mdash;by specially preparing for
      him, she must seem presumptuous to Fate. At any little sound she stopped
      and stood listening&mdash;save for her hair and eyes, as white from head
      to foot as a double narcissus flower in the dusk, bending towards some
      faint tune played to it somewhere oft in the fields. But all those little
      sounds ceased, one after another&mdash;they had meant nothing; and each
      time, her spirit returning&mdash;within the pale walls of the room, began
      once more to inhabit her lingering fingers. During that hour in her
      bedroom she lived through years. It was dark when she left it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      When Miltoun at last came it was past nine o&rsquo;clock.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Silent, but quivering all over; she clung to him in the hall; and this
      passion of emotion, without sound to give it substance, affected him
      profoundly. How terribly sensitive and tender she was! She seemed to have
      no armour. But though so stirred by her emotion, he was none the less
      exasperated. She incarnated at that moment the life to which he must now
      resign himself&mdash;a life of unending tenderness, consideration, and
      passivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time he could not bring himself to speak of his decision. Every
      look of her eyes, every movement of her body, seemed pleading with him to
      keep silence. But in Miltoun&rsquo;s character there was an element of rigidity,
      which never suffered him to diverge from an objective once determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished telling her, she only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we go on in secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he felt with a sort of horror that he must begin his struggle over
      again. He got up, and threw open the window. The sky was dark above the
      river; the wind had risen. That restless murmuration, and the width of the
      night with its scattered stars, seemed to come rushing at his face. He
      withdrew from it, and leaning on the sill looked down at her. What
      flower-like delicacy she had! There flashed across him the memory of a
      drooping blossom, which, in the Spring, he had seen her throw into the
      flames; with the words: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear flowers to fade, I always want to
      burn them.&rdquo; He could see again those waxen petals yield to the fierce
      clutch of the little red creeping sparks, and the slender stalk quivering,
      and glowing, and writhing to blackness like a live thing. And, distraught,
      he began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t live a lie. What right have I to lead, if I can&rsquo;t follow? I&rsquo;m not
      like our friend Courtier who believes in Liberty. I never have, I never
      shall. Liberty? What is Liberty? But only those who conform to authority
      have the right to wield authority. A man is a churl who enforces laws,
      when he himself has not the strength to observe them. I will not be one of
      whom it can be said: &lsquo;He can rule others, himself&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one will know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall know,&rdquo; he said; but he saw clearly that she did not understand
      him. Her face had a strange, brooding, shut-away look, as though he had
      frightened her. And the thought that she could not understand, angered
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, stubbornly: &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t remain in public life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has it to do with politics? It&rsquo;s such a little thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it had been a little thing to me, should I have left you at Monkland,
      and spent those five weeks in purgatory before my illness? A little
      thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She exclaimed with sudden fire:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Circumstances aye the little thing; it&rsquo;s love that&rsquo;s the great thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun stared at her, for the first time understanding that she had a
      philosophy as deep and stubborn as his own. But he answered cruelly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! the great thing has conquered me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he saw her looking at him, as if, seeing into the recesses of his
      soul, she had made some ghastly discovery. The look was so mournful, so
      uncannily intent that he turned away from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is a little thing,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t see my
      way. I&rsquo;ve lost my bearings; I must find them again before I can do
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as if she had not heard, or not taken in the sense of his words, she
      said again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t let us alter anything; I won&rsquo;t ever want what you can&rsquo;t give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this stubbornness, when he was doing the very thing that would give
      him to her utterly, seemed to him unreasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it out with myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again, with a sort of dry anguish, she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Let us go on as we are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Feeling that he had borne all he could, Miltoun put his hands on her
      shoulders, and said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, in sudden remorse, he lifted her, and clasped her to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she stood inert in his arms, her eyes closed, not returning his
      kisses.

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the last day before Parliament rose, Lord Valleys, with a light heart,
      mounted his horse for a gallop in the Row. Though she was a blood mare he
      rode her with a plain snaffle, having the horsemanship of one who has
      hunted from the age of seven, and been for twenty years a Colonel of
      Yeomanry. Greeting affably everyone he knew, he maintained a frank
      demeanour on all subjects, especially of Government policy, secretly
      enjoying the surmises and prognostications, so pleasantly wide of the
      mark, and the way questions and hints perished before his sphinx-like
      candour. He spoke cheerily too of Miltoun, who was &lsquo;all right again,&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;burning for the fray&rsquo; when the House met again in the autumn. And he
      chaffed Lord Malvezin about his wife. If anything&mdash;he said&mdash;could
      make Bertie take an interest in politics, it would be she. He had two
      capital gallops, being well known to the police: The day was bright, and
      he was sorry to turn home. Falling in with Harbinger, he asked him to come
      back to lunch. There had seemed something different lately, an almost
      morose look, about young Harbinger; and his wife&rsquo;s disquieting words about
      Barbara came back to Lord Valleys with a shock. He had seen little of the
      child lately, and in the general clearing up of this time of year had
      forgotten all about the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agatha, who was still staying at Valleys House with little Ann, waiting to
      travel up to Scotland with her mother, was out, and there was no one at
      lunch except Lady Valleys and Barbara herself. Conversation flagged; for
      the young people were extremely silent, Lady Valleys was considering the
      draft of a report which had to be settled before she left, and Lord
      Valleys himself was rather carefully watching his daughter. The news that
      Lord Miltoun was in the study came as a surprise, and somewhat of a relief
      to all. To an exhortation to luring him in to lunch; the servant replied
      that Lord Miltoun had lunched, and would wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he know there&rsquo;s no one here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys pushed back her plate, and rose:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys also got up, and they went out together, leaving Barbara, who
      had risen, looking doubtfully at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys had recently been told of the nursing episode, and had
      received the news with the dubious air of one hearing something about an
      eccentric person, which, heard about anyone else, could have had but one
      significance. If Eustace had been a normal young man his father would have
      shrugged his shoulder&rsquo;s, and thought: &ldquo;Oh, well! There it is!&rdquo; As it was,
      he had literally not known what to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, crossing the saloon which intervened between the dining-room and
      the study, he said to his wife uneasily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it this woman again, Gertrude&mdash;or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys answered with a shrug:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness knows, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun was standing in the embrasure of a window above the terrace. He
      looked well, and his greeting was the same as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Lord Valleys, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re all right again
      evidently&mdash;what&rsquo;s the news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that I&rsquo;ve decided to resign my seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Valleys, with the greater quickness of women, divining already
      something of the reason, had flushed a deep pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, my dear,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t possibly be necessary, even if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Recovering herself, she added dryly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give us some reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason is simply that I&rsquo;ve joined my life to Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s, and I can&rsquo;t
      go on as I am, living a lie. If it were known I should obviously have to
      resign at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys made a rapid movement. In the face of what she felt to be a
      really serious crisis between these two utterly different creatures of the
      other sex, her husband and her son, she had dropped her mask and become a
      genuine woman. Unconsciously both men felt this change, and in speaking,
      turned towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t argue it,&rdquo; said Miltoun; &ldquo;I consider myself bound in honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys, with a note of real feeling, interjected:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven! I did think you put your country above your private affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geoff!&rdquo; said Lady Valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lord Valleys went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Eustace, I&rsquo;m out of touch with your view of things altogether. I
      don&rsquo;t even begin to understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Miltoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, both of you!&rdquo; said Lady Valleys: &ldquo;You two are altogether
      different; and you must not quarrel. I won&rsquo;t have that. Now, Eustace, you
      are our son, and you have got to be kind and considerate. Sit down, and
      let&rsquo;s talk it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And motioning her husband to a chair, she sat down in the embrasure of a
      window. Miltoun remained standing. Visited by a sudden dread, Lady Valleys
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;you&rsquo;ve not&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t going to be a scandal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell this man, of course, but you may make your minds easy, I
      imagine; I understand that his view of marriage does not permit of divorce
      in any case whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys sighed with an utter and undisguised relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, my dear boy,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;even if you do feel you must tell
      him, there is surely no reason why it should not otherwise be kept
      secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys interrupted her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad if you would point out the connection between your
      honour and the resignation of your seat,&rdquo; he said stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t see already, it would be useless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see. The whole matter is&mdash;is unfortunate, but to give up
      your work, so long as there is no absolute necessity, seems to me
      far-fetched and absurd. How many men are, there into whose lives there has
      not entered some such relation at one time or another? This idea would
      disqualify half the nation.&rdquo; His eyes seemed in that crisis both to
      consult and to avoid his wife&rsquo;s, as though he were at once asking her
      endorsement of his point of view, and observing the proprieties. And for a
      moment in the midst of her anxiety, her sense of humour got the better of
      Lady Valleys. It was so funny that Geoff should have to give himself away;
      she could not for the life of her help fixing him with her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;you underestimate three-quarters, at the very
      least!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lord Valleys, confronted with danger, was growing steadier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It passes my comprehension;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why you should want to mix up sex
      and politics at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun&rsquo;s answer came very slowly, as if the confession were hurting his
      lips:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is&mdash;forgive me for using the word&mdash;such a thing as one&rsquo;s
      religion. I don&rsquo;t happen to regard life as divided into public and private
      departments. My vision is gone&mdash;broken&mdash;I can see no object
      before me now in public life&mdash;no goal&mdash;no certainty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys caught his hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s too dreadfully puritanical!&rdquo; But at
      Miltoun&rsquo;s queer smile, she added hastily: &ldquo;Logical&mdash;I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consult your common sense, Eustace, for goodness&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; broke in Lord
      Valleys. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it your simple duty to put your scruples in your pocket,
      and do the best you can for your country with the powers that have been
      given you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no common sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, of course, it may be just as well that you should leave
      public life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Lady Valleys. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand, Geoffrey. I ask you
      again, Eustace, what will you do afterwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will eat your heart out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite possibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t come to a reasonable arrangement with your conscience,&rdquo;
       again broke in Lord Valleys, &ldquo;for Heaven&rsquo;s sake give her up, like a man,
      and cut all these knots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir!&rdquo; said Miltoun icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys laid her hand on his arm. &ldquo;You must allow us a little logic
      too, my dear. You don&rsquo;t seriously imagine that she would wish you to throw
      away your life for her? I&rsquo;m not such a bad judge of character as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped before the expression on Miltoun&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go too fast,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I may become a free spirit yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this saying, which seemed to her cryptic and sinister, Lady Valleys did
      not know what to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel, as you say,&rdquo; Lord Valleys began once more, &ldquo;that the bottom
      has been knocked out of things for you by this&mdash;this affair, don&rsquo;t,
      for goodness&rsquo; sake, do anything in a hurry. Wait! Go abroad! Get your
      balance back! You&rsquo;ll find the thing settle itself in a few months. Don&rsquo;t
      precipitate matters; you can make your health an excuse to miss the Autumn
      session.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys chimed in eagerly
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really are seeing the thing out of all proportion. What is a
      love-affair. My dear boy, do you suppose for a moment anyone would think
      the worse of you, even if they knew? And really not a soul need know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has not occurred to me to consider what they would think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried Lady Valleys, nettled, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s simply your own pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys, who had turned away, spoke in an almost tragic voice
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not think that on a point of honour I should differ from my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catching at the word honour, Lady Valleys cried suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eustace, promise me, before you do anything, to consult your Uncle
      Dennis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This becomes comic,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that word, which indeed seemed to them quite wanton, Lord and Lady
      Valleys turned on their son, and the three stood staring, perfectly
      silent. A little noise from the doorway interrupted them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Left by her father and mother to the further entertainment of Harbinger,
      Barbara had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have coffee in here,&rdquo; and passed into the withdrawing room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except for that one evening, when together by the sea wall they stood
      contemplating the populace, she had not been alone with him since he
      kissed her under the shelter of the box hedge. And now, after the first
      moment, she looked at him calmly, though in her breast there was a
      fluttering, as if an imprisoned bird were struggling ever so feebly
      against that soft and solid cage. Her last jangled talk with Courtier had
      left an ache in her heart. Besides, did she not know all that Harbinger
      could give her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a nymph pursued by a faun who held dominion over the groves, she,
      fugitive, kept looking back. There was nothing in that fair wood of his
      with which she was not familiar, no thicket she had not travelled, no
      stream she had not crossed, no kiss she could not return. His was a
      discovered land, in which, as of right, she would reign. She had nothing
      to hope from him but power, and solid pleasure. Her eyes said: How am I to
      know whether I shall not want more than you; feel suffocated in your arms;
      be surfeited by all that you will bring me? Have I not already got all
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew, from his downcast gloomy face, how cruel she seemed, and was
      sorry. She wanted to be good to him, and said almost shyly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you angry with me, Claud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harbinger looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you so cruel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are. Where is your heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said Barbara, touching her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; muttered Harbinger; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not joking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said gently:&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it as bad as that, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the softness of her voice seemed to fan the smouldering fires in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something behind all this,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve no right to
      make a fool of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the something, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you to say. But I&rsquo;m not blind. What about this fellow
      Courtier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there was revealed to Barbara a new acquaintance&mdash;the
      male proper. No, to live with him would not be quite lacking in adventure!
    </p>
    <p>
      His face had darkened; his eyes were dilated, his whole figure seemed to
      have grown. She suddenly noticed the hair which covered his clenched
      fists. All his suavity had left him. He came very close.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long that look between them lasted, and of all there was in it, she
      had no clear knowledge; thought after thought, wave after wave of feeling,
      rushed through her. Revolt and attraction, contempt and admiration, queer
      sensations of disgust and pleasure, all mingled&mdash;as on a May day one
      may see the hail fall, and the sun suddenly burn through and steam from
      the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said hoarsely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Babs, you madden me so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smoothing her lips, as if to regain control of them, she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I have had enough,&rdquo; and went out into her father&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of Lord and Lady Valleys so intently staring at Miltoun restored
      hex self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck her as slightly comic, not knowing that the little scene was the
      outcome of that word. In truth, the contrast between Miltoun and his
      parents at this moment was almost ludicrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Valleys was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better comic than romantic. I suppose Barbara may know, considering her
      contribution to this matter. Your brother is resigning his seat, my dear;
      his conscience will not permit him to retain it, under certain
      circumstances that have arisen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Barbara: &ldquo;but surely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter has been argued, Babs,&rdquo; Lord Valleys said shortly; &ldquo;unless you
      have some better reason to advance than those of ordinary common sense,
      public spirit, and consideration for one&rsquo;s family, it will hardly be worth
      your while to reopen the discussion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara looked up at Miltoun, whose face, all but the eyes, was like a
      mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Eusty!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going to spoil your life like this!
      Just think how I shall feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun answered stonily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did what you thought right; as I am doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she want you to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, I should imagine,&rdquo; put in Lord Valleys, &ldquo;not a solitary
      creature in the whole world except your brother himself who would wish for
      this consummation. But with him such a consideration does not weigh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; sighed Barbara; &ldquo;think of Granny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer not to think of her,&rdquo; murmured Lady Valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so wrapped up in you, Eusty. She always has believed in you
      intensely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun sighed. And, encouraged by that sound, Barbara went closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was plain enough that, behind his impassivity, a desperate struggle was
      going on in Miltoun. He spoke at last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have not already yielded to one who is naturally more to me than
      anything, when she begged and entreated, it is because I feel this in a
      way you don&rsquo;t realize. I apologize for using the word comic just now, I
      should have said tragic. I&rsquo;ll enlighten Uncle Dennis, if that will comfort
      you; but this is not exactly a matter for anyone, except myself.&rdquo; And,
      without another look or word, he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed, Barbara ran towards it; and, with a motion strangely
      like the wringing of hands, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! Oh! dear!&rdquo; Then, turning away to a bookcase, she began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ebullition of feeling, surpassing even their own, came as a real
      shock to Lady and Lord Valleys, ignorant of how strung-up she had been
      before she entered the room. They had not seen Barbara cry since she was a
      tiny girl. And in face of her emotion any animus they might have shown her
      for having thrown Miltoun into Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s arms, now melted away. Lord
      Valleys, especially moved, went up to his daughter, and stood with her in
      that dark corner, saying nothing, but gently stroking her hand. Lady
      Valleys, who herself felt very much inclined to cry, went out of sight
      into the embrasure of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara&rsquo;s sobbing was soon subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his face,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;And why? Why? It&rsquo;s so unnecessary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys, continually twisting his moustache, muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly! He makes things for himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Lady Valleys from the window, &ldquo;he was always
      uncomfortable, like that. I remember him as a baby. Bertie never was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the silence was only broken by the little angry sounds of Barbara
      blowing her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go and see mother,&rdquo; said Lady Valleys, suddenly: &ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s whole
      life may be ruined if we can&rsquo;t stop this. Are you coming, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Barbara refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to her room, instead. This crisis in Miltoun&rsquo;s life had strangely
      shaken her. It was as if Fate had suddenly revealed all that any step out
      of the beaten path might lead to, had brought her sharply up against
      herself. To wing out into the blue! See what it meant! If Miltoun kept to
      his resolve, and gave up public life, he was lost! And she herself! The
      fascination of Courtier&rsquo;s chivalrous manner, of a sort of innate
      gallantry, suggesting the quest of everlasting danger&mdash;was it not
      rather absurd? And&mdash;was she fascinated? Was it not simply that she
      liked the feeling of fascinating him? Through the maze of these thoughts,
      darted the memory of Harbinger&rsquo;s face close to her own, his clenched
      hands, the swift revelation of his dangerous masculinity. It was all a
      nightmare of scaring queer sensations, of things that could never be
      settled. She was stirred for once out of all her normal conquering
      philosophy. Her thoughts flew back to Miltoun. That which she had seen in
      their faces, then, had come to pass! And picturing Agatha&rsquo;s horror, when
      she came to hear of it, Barbara could not help a smile. Poor Eustace! Why
      did he take things so hardly? If he really carried out his resolve&mdash;and
      he never changed his mind&mdash;it would be tragic! It would mean the end
      of everything for him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps now he would get tired of Mrs. Noel. But she was not the sort of
      woman a man would get tired of. Even Barbara in her inexperience felt
      that. She would always be too delicately careful never to cloy him, never
      to exact anything from him, or let him feel that he was bound to her by so
      much as a hair. Ah! why couldn&rsquo;t they go on as if nothing had happened?
      Could nobody persuade him? She thought again of Courtier. If he, who knew
      them both, and was so fond of Mrs. Noel, would talk to Miltoun, about the
      right to be happy, the right to revolt? Eustace ought to revolt! It was
      his duty. She sat down to write; then, putting on her hat, took the note
      and slipped downstairs.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The flowers of summer in the great glass house at Ravensham were keeping
      the last afternoon-watch when Clifton summoned Lady Casterley with the
      words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Valleys in the white room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since the news of Miltoun&rsquo;s illness, and of Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s nursing, the
      little old lady had possessed her soul in patience; often, it is true,
      afflicted with poignant misgivings as to this new influence in the life of
      her favourite, affected too by a sort of jealousy, not to be admitted,
      even in her prayers, which, though regular enough, were perhaps somewhat
      formal. Having small liking now for leaving home, even for Catton, her
      country place, she was still at Ravensham, where Lord Dennis had come up
      to stay with her as soon as Miltoun had left Sea House. But Lady Casterley
      was never very dependent on company. She retained unimpaired her intense
      interest in politics, and still corresponded freely with prominent men. Of
      late, too, a slight revival of the June war scare had made its mark on her
      in a certain rejuvenescence, which always accompanied her contemplation of
      national crises, even when such were a little in the air. At blast of
      trumpet her spirit still leaped forward, unsheathed its sword, and stood
      at the salute. At such times, she rose earlier, went to bed later, was far
      less susceptible to draughts, and refused with asperity any food between
      meals. She wrote too with her own hand letters which she would otherwise
      have dictated to her secretary. Unfortunately the scare had died down
      again almost at once; and the passing of danger always left her rather
      irritable. Lady Valleys&rsquo; visit came as a timely consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed her daughter critically; for there was that about her manner
      which she did not like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course I am well!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you bring Barbara?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was tired!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Afraid of meeting me, since she committed that piece of folly over
      Eustace. You must be careful of that child, Gertrude, or she will be doing
      something silly herself. I don&rsquo;t like the way she keeps Claud Harbinger
      hanging in the wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her daughter cut her short:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is bad news about Eustace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley lost the little colour in her cheeks; lost, too, all her
      superfluity of irritable energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having heard, she said nothing; but Lady Valleys noticed with alarm that
      over her eyes had come suddenly the peculiar filminess of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you advise?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herself tired, and troubled, she was conscious of a quite unwonted feeling
      of discouragement before this silent little figure, in the silent white
      room. She had never before seen her mother look as if she heard Defeat
      passing on its dark wings. And moved by sudden tenderness for the little
      frail body that had borne her so long ago, she murmured almost with
      surprise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Casterley, as if speaking to herself, &ldquo;the boy saves
      things up; he stores his feelings&mdash;they burst and sweep him away.
      First his passion; now his conscience. There are two men in him; but this
      will be the death of one of them.&rdquo; And suddenly turning on her daughter,
      she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear about him at Oxford, Gertrude? He broke out once, and
      ate husks with the Gadarenes. You never knew. Of course&mdash;you never
      have known anything of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Resentment rose in Lady Valleys, that anyone should knew her son better
      than herself; but she lost it again looking at the little figure, and
      said, sighing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away, child; I must think. You say he&rsquo;s to consult&rsquo; Dennis? Do you
      know her address? Ask Barbara when you get back and telephone it to me.
      And at her daughter&rsquo;s kiss, she added grimly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall live to see him in the saddle yet, though I am seventy-eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the sound of her daughter&rsquo;s car had died away, she rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Lady Valleys rings up, Clifton, don&rsquo;t take the message, but call me.&rdquo;
       And seeing that Clifton did not move she added sharply: &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no bad news of his young lordship&rsquo;s health, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, my lady, but I have had it on my mind for some time to ask
      you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the old man raised his hand with a peculiar dignity, seeming to say:
      You will excuse me that for the moment I am a human being speaking to a
      human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter of his attachment,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is known to me; it has given
      me acute anxiety, knowing his lordship as I do, and having heard him say
      something singular when he was here in July. I should be grateful if you
      would assure&mdash;me that there is to be no hitch in his career, my
      lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression on Lady Casterley&rsquo;s face was strangely compounded of
      surprise, kindliness, defence, and impatience as with a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I can prevent it, Clifton,&rdquo; she said shortly; &ldquo;in fact, you need
      not concern yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clifton bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me mentioning it, my lady;&rdquo; a quiver ran over his face between its
      long white whiskers, &ldquo;but his young lordship&rsquo;s career is more to me than
      my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had left her, Lady Casterley sat down in a little low chair&mdash;long
      she sat there by the empty hearth, till the daylight, was all gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not far from the dark-haloed indeterminate limbo where dwelt that bugbear
      of Charles Courtier, the great Half-Truth Authority, he himself had a
      couple of rooms at fifteen shillings a week. Their chief attraction was
      that the great Half-Truth Liberty had recommended them. They tied him to
      nothing, and were ever at his disposal when he was in London; for his
      landlady, though not bound by agreement so to do, let them in such a way,
      that she could turn anyone else out at a week&rsquo;s notice. She was a gentle
      soul, married to a socialistic plumber twenty years her senior. The worthy
      man had given her two little boys, and the three of them kept her in such
      permanent order that to be in the presence of Courtier was the greatest
      pleasure she knew. When he disappeared on one of his nomadic missions,
      explorations, or adventures, she enclosed the whole of his belongings in
      two tin trunks and placed them in a cupboard which smelled a little of
      mice. When he reappeared the trunks were reopened, and a powerful scent of
      dried rose-leaves would escape. For, recognizing the mortality of things
      human, she procured every summer from her sister, the wife of a market
      gardener, a consignment of this commodity, which she passionately sewed up
      in bags, and continued to deposit year by year, in Courtier&rsquo;s trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, and the way she made his toast&mdash;very crisp&mdash;and aired his
      linen&mdash;very dry, were practically the only things she could do for a
      man naturally inclined to independence, and accustomed from his manner of
      life to fend for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first signs of his departure she would go into some closet or other,
      away from the plumber and the two marks of his affection, and cry quietly;
      but never in Courtier&rsquo;s presence did she dream of manifesting grief&mdash;as
      soon weep in the presence of death or birth, or any other fundamental
      tragedy or joy. In face of the realities of life she had known from her
      youth up the value of the simple verb &lsquo;sto&mdash;stare-to stand fast.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And to her Courtier was a reality, the chief reality of life, the focus of
      her aspiration, the morning and the evening star.
    </p>
    <p>
      The request, then five days after his farewell visit to Mrs. Noel&mdash;for
      the elephant-hide trunk which accompanied his rovings, produced her
      habitual period of seclusion, followed by her habitual appearance in his
      sitting-room bearing a note, and some bags of dried rose&mdash;leaves on a
      tray. She found him in his shirt sleeves, packing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Benton; off again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Benton, plaiting her hands, for she had not yet lost something of the
      look and manner of a little girl, answered in her flat, but serene voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; and I hope you&rsquo;re not going anywhere very dangerous this time.
      I always think you go to such dangerous places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Persia, Mrs. Benton, where the carpets come from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, sir. Your washing&rsquo;s just come home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her, apparently cast-down, eyes stored up a wealth of little details; the
      way his hair grew, the set of his back, the colour of his braces. But
      suddenly she said in a surprising voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a photograph you could spare, sir, to leave behind? Mr.
      Benton was only saying to me yesterday, we&rsquo;ve nothing to remember him by,
      in case he shouldn&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an old one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Benton took the photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you can see who it is.&rdquo; And holding it perhaps too
      tightly, for her fingers trembled, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A note, please, sir; and the messenger boy is waiting for&mdash;an
      answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he read the note she noticed with concern how packing had brought
      the blood into his head....
    </p>
    <p>
      When, in response to that note, Courtier entered the well-known
      confectioner&rsquo;s called Gustard&rsquo;s, it was still not quite tea-time, and
      there seemed to him at first no one in the room save three middle-aged
      women packing sweets; then in the corner he saw Barbara. The blood was no
      longer in his head; he was pale, walking down that mahogany-coloured room
      impregnated with the scent of wedding-cake. Barbara, too, was pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      So close to her that he could count her every eyelash, and inhale the
      scent of her hair and clothes to listen to her story of Miltoun, so
      hesitatingly, so wistfully told, seemed very like being kept waiting with
      the rope already round his neck, to hear about another person&rsquo;s toothache.
      He felt this to have been unnecessary on the part of Fate! And there came
      to him perversely the memory of that ride over the sun-warmed heather,
      when he had paraphrased the old Sicilian song: &lsquo;Here will I sit and sing.&rsquo;
      He was a long way from singing now; nor was there love in his arms. There
      was instead a cup of tea; and in his nostrils the scent of cake, with now
      and then a whiff of orange-flower water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, when she had finished telling him: &ldquo;&lsquo;Liberty&rsquo;s a
      glorious feast!&rsquo; You want me to go to your brother, and quote Bums? You
      know, of course, that he regards me as dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but he respects and likes you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I respect and like him,&rdquo; answered Courtier.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the middle-aged females passed, carrying a large white card-board
      box; and the creaking of her stays broke the hush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been very sweet to me,&rdquo; said Barbara, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtier&rsquo;s heart stirred, as if it were turning over within him; and
      gazing into his teacup, he answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All men are decent to the evening star. I will go at once and find your
      brother. When shall I bring you news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow at five I&rsquo;ll be at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And repeating, &ldquo;To-morrow at five,&rdquo; he rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back from the door, he saw her face puzzled, rather reproachful,
      and went out gloomily. The scent of cake, and orange-flower water, the
      creaking of the female&rsquo;s stays, the colour of mahogany, still clung to his
      nose and ears, and eyes; but within him it was all dull baffled rage. Why
      had he not made the most of this unexpected chance; why had he not made
      desperate love to her? A conscientious ass! And yet&mdash;the whole thing
      was absurd! She was so young! God knew he would be glad to be out of it.
      If he stayed he was afraid that he would play the fool. But the memory of
      her words: &ldquo;You have been very sweet to me!&rdquo; would not leave him; nor the
      memory of her face, so puzzled, and reproachful. Yes, if he stayed he
      would play the fool! He would be asking her to marry a man double her age,
      of no position but that which he had carved for himself, and without a
      rap. And he would be asking her in such a way that she might possibly have
      some little difficulty in refusing. He would be letting himself go. And
      she was only twenty&mdash;for all her woman-of-the-world air, a child! No!
      He would be useful to her, if possible, this once, and then clear out!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Miltoun left Valleys House he walked in the direction of Westminster.
      During the five days that he had been back in London he had not yet
      entered the House of Commons. After the seclusion of his illness, he still
      felt a yearning, almost painful, towards the movement and stir of the
      town. Everything he heard and saw made an intensely vivid impression. The
      lions in Trafalgar Square, the great buildings of Whitehall, filled him
      with a sort of exultation. He was like a man, who, after a long sea
      voyage, first catches sight of land, and stands straining his eyes, hardly
      breathing, taking in one by one the lost features of that face. He walked
      on to Westminster Bridge, and going to an embrasure in the very centre,
      looked back towards the towers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said that the love of those towers passed into the blood. It was
      said that he who had sat beneath them could never again be quite the same.
      Miltoun knew that it was true&mdash;desperately true, of himself. In
      person he had sat there but three weeks, but in soul he seemed to have
      been sitting there hundreds of years. And now he would sit there no more!
      An almost frantic desire to free himself from this coil rose up within
      him. To be held a prisoner by that most secret of all his instincts, the
      instinct for authority! To be unable to wield authority because to wield
      authority was to insult authority. God! It was hard! He turned his back on
      the towers; and sought distraction in the faces of the passers-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these, he knew, had his struggle to keep self-respect! Or was it
      that they were unconscious of struggle or of self-respect, and just let
      things drift? They looked like that, most of them! And all his inherent
      contempt for the average or common welled up as he watched them. Yes, they
      looked like that! Ironically, the sight of those from whom he had desired
      the comfort of compromise, served instead to stimulate that part of him
      which refused to let him compromise. They looked soft, soggy, without
      pride or will, as though they knew that life was too much for them, and
      had shamefully accepted the fact. They so obviously needed to be told what
      they might do, and which way they should, go; they would accept orders as
      they accepted their work, or pleasures: And the thought that he was now
      debarred from the right to give them orders, rankled in him furiously.
      They, in their turn, glanced casually at his tall figure leaning against
      the parapet, not knowing how their fate was trembling in the balance. His
      thin, sallow face, and hungry eyes gave one or two of them perhaps a
      feeling of interest or discomfort; but to most he was assuredly no more
      than any other man or woman in the hurly-burly. That dark figure of
      conscious power struggling in the fetters of its own belief in power, was
      a piece of sculpture they had neither time nor wish to understand, having
      no taste for tragedy&mdash;for witnessing the human spirit driven to the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was five o&rsquo;clock before Miltoun left the Bridge, and passed, like an
      exile, before the gates of Church and State, on his way to his uncle&rsquo;s
      Club. He stopped to telegraph to Audrey the time he would be coming
      to-morrow afternoon; and on leaving the Post-Office, noticed in the window
      of the adjoining shop some reproductions of old Italian masterpieces,
      amongst them one of Botticelli&rsquo;s &lsquo;Birth of Venus.&rsquo; He had never seen that
      picture; and, remembering that she had told him it was her favourite, he
      stopped to look at it. Averagely well versed in such matters, as became
      one of his caste, Miltoun had not the power of letting a work of art
      insidiously steal the private self from his soul, and replace it with the
      self of all the world; and he examined this far-famed presentment of the
      heathen goddess with aloofness, even irritation. The drawing of the body
      seemed to him crude, the whole picture a little flat and Early; he did not
      like the figure of the Flora. The golden serenity, and tenderness, of
      which she had spoken, left him cold. Then he found himself looking at the
      face, and slowly, but with uncanny certainty, began to feel that he was
      looking at the face of Audrey herself. The hair was golden and different,
      the eyes grey and different, the mouth a little fuller; yet&mdash;it was
      her face; the same oval shape, the same far-apart, arched brows, the same
      strangely tender, elusive spirit. And, as though offended, he turned and
      walked on. In the window of that little shop was the effigy of her for
      whom he had bartered away his life&mdash;the incarnation of passive and
      entwining love, that gentle creature, who had given herself to him so
      utterly, for whom love, and the flowers, and trees, and birds, music, the
      sky, and the quick-flowing streams, were all-sufficing; and who, like the
      goddess in the picture, seemed wondering at her own existence. He had a
      sudden glimpse of understanding, strange indeed in one who had so little
      power of seeing into others&rsquo; hearts: Ought she ever to have been born into
      a world like this? But the flash of insight yielded quickly to that
      sickening consciousness of his own position, which never left him now.
      Whatever else he did, he must get rid of that malaise! But what could he
      do in that coming life? Write books? What sort of books could he write?
      Only such as expressed his views of citizenship, his political and social
      beliefs. As well remain sitting and speaking beneath those towers! He
      could never join the happy band of artists, those soft and indeterminate
      spirits, for whom barriers had no meaning, content-to understand,
      interpret, and create. What should he be doing in that galley? The thought
      was inconceivable. A career at the Bar&mdash;yes, he might take that up;
      but to what end? To become a judge! As well continue to sit beneath those
      towers! Too late for diplomacy. Too late for the Army; besides, he had not
      the faintest taste for military glory. Bury himself in the country like
      Uncle Dennis, and administer one of his father&rsquo;s estates? It would be
      death. Go amongst the poor? For a moment he thought he had found a new
      vocation. But in what capacity&mdash;to order their lives, when he himself
      could not order his own; or, as a mere conduit pipe for money, when he
      believed that charity was rotting the nation to its core? At the head of
      every avenue stood an angel or devil with drawn sword. And then there came
      to him another thought. Since he was being cast forth from Church and
      State, could he not play the fallen spirit like a man&mdash;be Lucifer,
      and destroy! And instinctively he at once saw himself returning to those
      towers, and beneath them crossing the floor; joining the revolutionaries,
      the Radicals, the freethinkers, scourging his present Party, the party of
      authority and institutions. The idea struck him as supremely comic, and he
      laughed out loud in the street....
    </p>
    <p>
      The Club which Lord Dennis frequented was in St. James&rsquo;s untouched by the
      tides of the waters of fashion&mdash;steadily swinging to its moorings in
      a quiet backwater, and Miltoun found his uncle in the library. He was
      reading a volume of Burton&rsquo;s travels, and drinking tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody comes here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so, in spite of that word on the door, we
      shall talk. Waiter, bring some more tea, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Impatiently, but with a sort of pity, Miltoun watched Lord Dennis&rsquo;s urbane
      movements, wherein old age was, pathetically, trying to make each little
      thing seem important, if only to the doer. Nothing his great-uncle could
      say would outweigh the warning of his picturesque old figure! To be a
      bystander; to see it all go past you; to let your sword rust in its
      sheath, as this poor old fellow had done! The notion of explaining what he
      had come about was particularly hateful to Miltoun; but since he had given
      his word, he nerved himself with secret anger, and began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised my mother to ask you a question, Uncle Dennis. You know of my
      attachment, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have joined my life to this lady&rsquo;s. There will be no scandal, but
      I consider it my duty to resign my seat, and leave public life alone. Is
      that right or wrong according to, your view?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis looked at his nephew in silence. A faint flush coloured his
      brown cheeks. He had the appearance of one travelling in mind over the
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong, I think,&rdquo; he said, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if I may ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the pleasure of knowing this lady, and am therefore somewhat
      in the dark; but it appears to me that your decision is not fair to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is beyond me,&rdquo; said Miltoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis answered firmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have asked me a frank question, expecting a frank answer, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear, don&rsquo;t blame me if what I say is unpalatable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! You say you are going to give up public life for the sake of your
      conscience. I should have no criticism to make if it stopped there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and for quite a minute remained silent, evidently searching for
      words to express some intricate thread of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t, Eustace; the public man in you is far stronger than the
      other. You want leadership more than you want love. Your sacrifice will
      kill your affection; what you imagine is your loss and hurt, will prove to
      be this lady&rsquo;s in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis continued very dryly and with a touch of malice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not listening to me; but I can see very well that the process has
      begun already underneath. There&rsquo;s a curious streak of the Jesuit in you,
      Eustace. What you don&rsquo;t want to see, you won&rsquo;t look at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You advise me, then, to compromise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I point out that you will be compromising if you try to
      keep both your conscience and your love. You will be seeking to have, it
      both ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will find yourself having it neither,&rdquo; said Lord Dennis sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun rose. &ldquo;In other words, you, like the others, recommend me to
      desert this lady who loves me, and whom I love. And yet, Uncle, they say
      that in your own case&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lord Dennis had risen, too, having lost all the appanage and manner of
      old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my own case,&rdquo; he said bluntly, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t talk. I don&rsquo;t advise you to
      desert anyone; you quite mistake me. I advise you to know yourself. And I
      tell you my opinion of you&mdash;you were cut out by Nature for a
      statesman, not a lover! There&rsquo;s something dried-up in you, Eustace; I&rsquo;m
      not sure there isn&rsquo;t something dried-up in all our caste. We&rsquo;ve had to do
      with forms and ceremonies too long. We&rsquo;re not good at taking the lyrical
      point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; said Miltoun, &ldquo;I cannot, to fit in with a theory of
      yours, commit a baseness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis began pacing up and down. He was keeping his lips closed very
      tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who gives advice,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;is always something of a fool.
      For all that, you have mistaken mine. I am not so presumptuous as to
      attempt to enter the inner chamber of your spirit. I have merely told you
      that, in my opinion, it would be more honest to yourself, and fairer to
      this lady, to compound with your conscience, and keep both your love and
      your public life, than to pretend that you were capable of sacrificing
      what I know is the stronger element in you for the sake of the weaker. You
      remember the saying, Democritus I think: &lsquo;each man&rsquo;s nature or character
      is his fate or God&rsquo;. I recommend it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a full minute Miltoun stood without replying, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to have troubled you, Uncle Dennis. A middle policy is no use
      to me. Good-bye!&rdquo; And without shaking hands, he went out.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the hall someone rose from a sofa, and came towards him. It was
      Courtier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run you to earth at last,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d come and dine with me.
      I&rsquo;m leaving England to-morrow night, and there are things I want to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There passed through Miltoun&rsquo;s mind the rapid thought: &lsquo;Does he know?&rsquo; He
      assented, however, and they went out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to find a quiet place,&rdquo; said Courtier; &ldquo;but this might
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The place chosen was a little hostel, frequented by racing men, and famed
      for the excellence of its steaks. And as they sat down opposite each other
      in the almost empty room, Miltoun thought: Yes, he does know! Can I stand
      any more of this? He waited almost savagely for the attack he felt was
      coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are going to give up your seat?&rdquo; said Courtier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun looked at him for some seconds, before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what town-crier did you hear that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was that in Courtier&rsquo;s face which checked his anger; its
      friendliness was transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am about her only friend,&rdquo; Courtier proceeded earnestly; &ldquo;and this is
      my last chance&mdash;to say nothing of my feeling towards you, which,
      believe me, is very cordial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, then,&rdquo; Miltoun muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me for putting it bluntly. Have you considered what her position
      was before she met you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun felt the blood rushing to his face, but he sat still, clenching
      his nails into the palms of his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Courtier, &ldquo;but that attitude of mind&mdash;you used to
      have it yourself&mdash;which decrees either living death, or spiritual
      adultery to women, makes my blood boil. You can&rsquo;t deny that those were the
      alternatives, and I say you had the right fundamentally to protest against
      them, not only in words but deeds. You did protest, I know; but this
      present decision of yours is a climb down, as much as to say that your
      protest was wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun rose from his seat. &ldquo;I cannot discuss this,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For her sake, you must. If you give up your public work, you&rsquo;ll spoil her
      life a second time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun again sat down. At the word &lsquo;must&rsquo; a steely feeling had come to
      his aid; his eyes began to resemble the old Cardinal&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Your nature and
      mine, Courtier,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are too far apart; we shall never understand
      each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; answered Courtier. &ldquo;Admitting those two alternatives to
      be horrible, which you never would have done unless the facts had been
      brought home to you personally&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Miltoun icily, &ldquo;I deny your right to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, you do admit them&mdash;if you believe you had not the right to
      rescue her, on what principle do you base that belief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun placed his elbow on the table, and leaning his chin on his hand,
      regarded the champion of lost causes without speaking. There was such a
      turmoil going on within him that with difficulty he could force his lips
      to obey him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what right do you ask me that?&rdquo; he said at last. He saw Courtier&rsquo;s
      face grow scarlet, and his fingers twisting furiously at those flame-like
      moustaches; but his answer was as steadily ironical as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can hardly sit still, my last evening in England, without lifting
      a finger, while you immolate a woman to whom I feel like a brother. I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what your principle is: Authority, unjust or just, desirable or
      undesirable, must be implicitly obeyed. To break a law, no matter on what
      provocation, or for whose sake, is to break the commandment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hesitate&mdash;say, of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of an infallible fixed Power. Is that a true definition of your
      principle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miltoun, between his teeth, &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exceptions prove the rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard cases make bad law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier smiled: &ldquo;I knew you were coming out with that. I deny that they
      do with this law, which is altogether behind the times. You had the right
      to rescue this woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Courtier, if we must fight, let us fight on the naked facts. I have
      not rescued anyone. I have merely stolen sooner than starve. That is why I
      cannot go on pretending to be a pattern. If it were known, I could not
      retain my seat an hour; I can&rsquo;t take advantage of an accidental secrecy.
      Could you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier was silent; and with his eyes Miltoun pressed on him, as though
      he would despatch him with that glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could,&rdquo; said Courtier at last. &ldquo;When this law, by enforcing spiritual
      adultery on those who have come to hate their mates, destroys the sanctity
      of the married state&mdash;the very sanctity it professes to uphold, you
      must expect to have it broken by reasoning men and women without their
      feeling shame, or losing self-respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Miltoun there was rising that vast and subtle passion for dialectic
      combat, which was of his very fibre. He had almost lost the feeling that
      this was his own future being discussed. He saw before him in this
      sanguine man, whose voice and eyes had such a white-hot sound and look,
      the incarnation of all that he temperamentally opposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is devil&rsquo;s advocacy. I admit no individual as judge in
      his own case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Now we&rsquo;re coming to it. By the way, shall we get out of this heat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were no sooner in the cooler street, than the voice of Courtier began
      again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Distrust of human nature, fear&mdash;it&rsquo;s the whole basis of action for
      men of your stamp. You deny the right of the individual to judge, because
      you&rsquo;ve no faith in the essential goodness of men; at heart you believe
      them bad. You give them no freedom, you allow them no consent, because you
      believe that their decisions would move downwards, and not upwards. Well,
      it&rsquo;s the whole difference between the aristocratic and the democratic view
      of life. As you once told me, you hate and fear the crowd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun eyed that steady sanguine face askance:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do believe that men are raised in spite of themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re honest. By whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Miltoun felt rising within him a sort of fury. Once for all he would
      slay this red-haired rebel; he answered with almost savage irony:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strangely enough, by that Being to mention whom you object&mdash;working
      through the medium of the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High-Priest! Look at that girl slinking along there, with her eye on us;
      suppose, instead of withdrawing your garment, you went over and talked to
      her, got her to tell you what she really felt and thought, you&rsquo;d find
      things that would astonish you. At bottom, mankind is splendid. And
      they&rsquo;re raised, sir, by the aspiration that&rsquo;s in all of them. Haven&rsquo;t you
      ever noticed that public sentiment is always in advance of the Law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; said Miltoun, &ldquo;are the man who is never on the side of the
      majority?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The champion of lost causes uttered a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so logical as all that,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;the wind still blows; and
      Life&rsquo;s not a set of rules hung up in an office. Let&rsquo;s see, where are we?&rdquo;
       They had been brought to a stand-still by a group on the pavement in front
      of the Queen&rsquo;s Hall: &ldquo;Shall we go in, and hear some music, and cool our
      tongues?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun nodded, and they went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great lighted hall, filled with the faint bluefish vapour from
      hundreds of little rolls of tobacco leaf, was crowded from floor to
      ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking his stand among the straw-hatted throng, Miltoun heard that steady
      ironical voice behind him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Profanum vulgus! Come to listen to the finest piece of music ever
      written! Folk whom you wouldn&rsquo;t trust a yard to know what was good for
      them! Deplorable sight, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer. The first slow notes of the seventh Symphony of
      Beethoven had begun to steal forth across the bank of flowers; and, save
      for the steady rising of that bluefish vapour, as it were incense burnt to
      the god of melody, the crowd had become deathly still, as though one mind,
      one spirit, possessed each pale face inclined towards that music rising
      and falling like the sighing of the winds, that welcome from death the
      freed spirits of the beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last notes had died away, he turned and walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the voice behind him, &ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t that shown you how things swell
      and grow; how splendid the world is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has shown me how beautiful the world can be made by a great man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly, as if the music had loosened some band within him, he began
      to pour forth words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the crowd in this street, Courtier, which of all crowds in the
      whole world can best afford to be left to itself; secure from pestilence,
      earthquake, cyclone, drought, from extremes of heat and cold, in the heart
      of the greatest and safest city in the world; and yet-see the figure of
      that policeman! Running through all the good behaviour of this crowd,
      however safe and free it looks, there is, there always must be, a central
      force holding it together. Where does that central force come from? From
      the crowd itself, you say. I answer: No. Look back at the origin of human
      States. From the beginnings of things, the best man has been the
      unconscious medium of authority, of the controlling principle, of the
      divine force; he felt that power within him&mdash;physical, at first&mdash;he
      used it to take the lead, he has held the lead ever since, he must always
      hold it. All your processes of election, your so-called democratic
      apparatus, are only a blind to the inquiring, a sop to the hungry, a salve
      to the pride of the rebellious. They are merely surface machinery; they
      cannot prevent the best man from coming to the top; for the best man
      stands nearest to the Deity, and is the first to receive the waves that
      come from Him. I&rsquo;m not speaking of heredity. The best man is not
      necessarily born in my class, and I, at all events, do not believe he is
      any more frequent there than in other classes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped as suddenly as he had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; answered Courtier, &ldquo;that I take you for an
      average specimen. You&rsquo;re at one end, and I at the other, and we probably
      both miss the golden mark. But the world is not ruled by power, and the
      fear which power produces, as you think, it&rsquo;s ruled by love. Society is
      held together by the natural decency in man, by fellow-feeling. The
      democratic principle, which you despise, at root means nothing at all but
      that. Man left to himself is on the upward lay. If it weren&rsquo;t so, do you
      imagine for a moment your &lsquo;boys in blue&rsquo; could keep order? A man knows
      unconsciously what he can and what he can&rsquo;t do, without losing his
      self-respect. He sucks that knowledge in with every breath. Laws and
      authority are not the be-all and end-all, they are conveniences,
      machinery, conduit pipes, main roads. They&rsquo;re not of the structure of the
      building&mdash;they&rsquo;re only scaffolding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun lunged out with the retort
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without which no building could be built.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier parried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather different, my friend, from identifying them with the
      building. They are things to be taken down as fast as ever they can be
      cleared away, to make room for an edifice that begins on earth, not in the
      sky. All the scaffolding of law is merely there to save time, to prevent
      the temple, as it mounts, from losing its way, and straying out of form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Miltoun, &ldquo;no! The scaffolding, as you call it, is the material
      projection of the architect&rsquo;s conception, without which the temple does
      not and cannot rise; and the architect is God, working through the minds
      and spirits most akin to Himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are now at the bed-rock,&rdquo; cried Courtier, &ldquo;your God is outside this
      world. Mine within it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And never the twain shall meet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that followed Miltoun saw that they were in Leicester
      Square, all quiet as yet before the theatres had disgorged; quiet yet
      waiting, with the lights, like yellow stars low-driven from the dark
      heavens, clinging to the white shapes of music-halls and cafes, and a sort
      of flying glamour blanching the still foliage of the plane trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A &lsquo;whitely wanton&rsquo;&mdash;this Square!&rdquo; said Courtier: &ldquo;Alive as a face;
      no end to its queer beauty! And, by Jove, if you went deep enough, you&rsquo;d
      find goodness even here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;d ignore the vice,&rdquo; Miltoun answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt weary all of a sudden, anxious to get to his rooms, unwilling to
      continue this battle of words, that brought him no nearer to relief. It
      was with strange lassitude that he heard the voice still speaking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must make a night of it, since to-morrow we die.... You would curb
      licence from without&mdash;I from within. When I get up and when I go to
      bed, when I draw a breath, see a face, or a flower, or a tree&mdash;if I
      didn&rsquo;t feel that I was looking on the Deity, I believe I should quit this
      palace of varieties, from sheer boredom. You, I understand, can&rsquo;t look on
      your God, unless you withdraw into some high place. Isn&rsquo;t it a bit lonely
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are worse things than loneliness.&rdquo; And they walked on, in silence;
      till suddenly Miltoun broke out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk of tyranny! What tyranny could equal this tyranny of your
      freedom? What tyranny in the world like that of this &lsquo;free&rsquo; vulgar, narrow
      street, with its hundred journals teeming like ants&rsquo; nests, to
      produce-what? In the entrails of that creature of your freedom, Courtier,
      there is room neither for exaltation, discipline, nor sacrifice; there is
      room only for commerce, and licence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer for a moment; and from those tall houses, whose
      lighted windows he had apostrophized, Miltoun turned away towards the
      river. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the voice beside him, &ldquo;for all its faults, the wind
      blows in that street, and there&rsquo;s a chance for everything. By God, I would
      rather see a few stars struggle out in a black sky than any of your
      perfect artificial lighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly it seemed to Miltoun that he could never free himself from
      the echoes of that voice&mdash;it was not worth while to try. &ldquo;We are
      repeating ourselves,&rdquo; he said, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river&rsquo;s black water was making stilly, slow recessional under a
      half-moon. Beneath the cloak of night the chaos on the far bank, the forms
      of cranes, high buildings, jetties, the bodies of the sleeping barges, a&mdash;million
      queer dark shapes, were invested with emotion. All was religious out
      there, all beautiful, all strange. And over this great quiet friend of
      man, lamps&mdash;those humble flowers of night, were throwing down the
      faint continual glamour of fallen petals; and a sweet-scented wind stole
      along from the West, very slow as yet, bringing in advance the tremor and
      perfume of the innumerable trees and fields which the river had loved as
      she came by.
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur that was no true sound, but like the whisper of a heart to a
      heart, accompanied this voyage of the dark water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a small blunt skiff&mdash;manned by two rowers came by under the
      wall, with the thudding and the creak of oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So &lsquo;To-morrow we die&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Miltoun: &ldquo;You mean, I suppose, that &lsquo;public
      life&rsquo; is the breath of my nostrils, and I must die, because I give it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I right in thinking that it was my young sister who sent you on this
      crusade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtier did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; Miltoun went on, looking him through and through; &ldquo;to-morrow is
      to be your last day, too? Well, you&rsquo;re right to go. She is not an ugly
      duckling, who can live out of the social pond; she&rsquo;ll always want her
      native element. And now, we&rsquo;ll say goodbye! Whatever happens to us both, I
      shall remember this evening.&rdquo; Smiling, he put out his hand &lsquo;Moriturus te
      saluto.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Courtier sat in Hyde Park waiting for five o&rsquo;clock. The day had recovered
      somewhat from a grey morning, as though the glow of that long hot summer
      were too burnt-in on the air to yield to the first assault. The sun,
      piercing the crisped clouds, those breast feathers of heavenly doves,
      darted its beams at the mellowed leaves, and showered to the ground their
      delicate shadow stains. The first, too early, scent from leaves about to
      fall, penetrated to the heart. And sorrowful sweet birds were tuning their
      little autumn pipes, blowing into them fragments of Spring odes to
      Liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtier thought of Miltoun and his mistress. By what a strange fate had
      those two been thrown together; to what end was their love coming? The
      seeds of grief were already sown, what flowers of darkness, or of tumult
      would come up? He saw her again as a little, grave, considering child,
      with her soft eyes, set wide apart under the dark arched brows, and the
      little tuck at the corner of her mouth that used to come when he teased
      her. And to that gentle creature who would sooner die than force anyone to
      anything, had been given this queer lover; this aristocrat by birth and
      nature, with the dried fervent soul, whose every fibre had been bred and
      trained in and to the service of Authority; this rejecter of the Unity of
      Life; this worshipper of an old God! A God that stood, whip in hand,
      driving men to obedience. A God that even now Courtier could conjure up
      staring at him from the walls of his nursery. The God his own father had
      believed in. A God of the Old Testament, knowing neither sympathy nor
      understanding. Strange that He should be alive still; that there should
      still be thousands who worshipped Him. Yet, not so very strange, if, as
      they said, man made God in his own image! Here indeed was a curious mating
      of what the philosophers would call the will to Love, and the will to
      Power!
    </p>
    <p>
      A soldier and his girl came and sat down on a bench close by. They looked
      askance at this trim and upright figure with the fighting face; then, some
      subtle thing informing them that he was not of the disturbing breed called
      officer, they ceased to regard him, abandoning themselves to dumb and
      inexpressive felicity. Arm in arm, touching each other, they seemed to
      Courtier very jolly, having that look of living entirely in the moment,
      which always especially appealed to one whose blood ran too fast to allow
      him to speculate much upon the future or brood much over the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      A leaf from the bough above him, loosened by the sun&rsquo;s kisses, dropped,
      and fell yellow at his feet. The leaves were turning very soon?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of this man, who could be so hot over the lost
      causes of others, that, sitting there within half an hour of the final
      loss of his own cause, he could be so calm, so almost apathetic. This
      apathy was partly due to the hopelessness, which Nature had long
      perceived, of trying to make him feel oppressed, but also to the habits of
      a man incurably accustomed to carrying his fortunes in his hand, and that
      hand open. It did not seem real to him that he was actually going to
      suffer a defeat, to have to confess that he had hankered after this girl
      all these past weeks, and that to-morrow all would be wasted, and she as
      dead to him as if he had never seen her. No, it was not exactly
      resignation, it was rather sheer lack of commercial instinct. If only this
      had been the lost cause of another person. How gallantly he would have
      rushed to the assault, and taken her by storm! If only he himself could
      have been that other person, how easily, how passionately could he not
      have pleaded, letting forth from him all those words which had knocked at
      his teeth ever since he knew her, and which would have seemed so
      ridiculous and so unworthy, spoken on his own behalf. Yes, for that other
      person he could have cut her out from under the guns of the enemy; he
      could have taken her, that fairest prize. And in queer, cheery-looking
      apathy&mdash;not far removed perhaps from despair&mdash;he sat, watching
      the leaves turn over and fall, and now and then cutting with his stick at
      the air, where autumn was already riding. And, if in imagination he saw
      himself carrying her away into the wilderness, and with his devotion
      making her happiness to grow, it was so far a flight, that a smile crept
      about his lips, and once or twice he snapped his jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier and his girl rose, passing in front of him down the Row. He
      watched their scarlet and blue figures, moving slowly towards the sun, and
      another couple close to the rails, crossing those receding forms. Very
      straight and tall, there was something exhilarating in the way this new
      couple swung along, holding their heads up, turning towards each other, to
      exchange words or smiles. Even at that distance they could be seen to be
      of high fashion; in their gait was the almost insolent poise of those who
      are above doubts and cares, certain of the world and of themselves. The
      girl&rsquo;s dress was tawny brown, her hair and hat too of the same hue, and
      the pursuing sunlight endowed her with a hazy splendour. Then, Courtier
      saw who they were&mdash;that couple!
    </p>
    <p>
      Except for an unconscious grinding of his teeth, he made no sound or
      movement, so that they went by without seeing him. Her voice, though not
      the words, came to him distinctly. He saw her hand slip up under
      Harbinger&rsquo;s arm and swiftly down again. A smile, of whose existence he was
      unaware, settled on his lips. He got up, shook himself, as a dog shakes
      off a beating, and walked away, with his mouth set very firm.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Left alone among the little mahogany tables of Gustard&rsquo;s, where the scent
      of cake and of orange-flower water made happy all the air, Barbara had sat
      for some minutes, her eyes cast down&mdash;as a child from whom a toy has
      been taken contemplates the ground, not knowing precisely what she is
      feeling. Then, paying one of the middle-aged females, she went out into
      the Square. There a German band was playing Delibes&rsquo; Coppelia; and the
      murdered tune came haunting her, a very ghost of incongruity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went straight back to Valleys House. In the room where three hours ago
      she had been left alone after lunch with Harbinger, her sister was seated
      in the window, looking decidedly upset. In fact, Agatha had just spent an
      awkward hour. Chancing, with little Ann, into that confectioner&rsquo;s where
      she could best obtain a particularly gummy sweet which she believed
      wholesome for her children, she had been engaged in purchasing a pound,
      when looking down, she perceived Ann standing stock-still, with her sudden
      little nose pointed down the shop, and her mouth opening; glancing in the
      direction of those frank, enquiring eyes, Agatha saw to her amazement her
      sister, and a man whom she recognized as Courtier. With a readiness which
      did her complete credit, she placed a sweet in Ann&rsquo;s mouth, and saying to
      the middle-aged female: &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll send those, please. Come, Ann!&rdquo; went
      out. Shocks never coming singly, she had no sooner reached home, than from
      her father she learned of the development of Miltoun&rsquo;s love affair. When
      Barbara returned, she was sitting, unfeignedly disturbed and grieved;
      unable to decide whether or no she ought to divulge what she herself had
      seen, but withal buoyed-up by that peculiar indignation of the essentially
      domestic woman, whose ideals have been outraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judging at once from the expression of her face that she must have heard
      the news of Miltoun, Barbara said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear Angel, any lecture for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Agatha answered coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you were quite mad to take Mrs. Noel to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole duty of woman,&rdquo; murmured Barbara, &ldquo;includes a little madness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Agatha looked at her in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make you out,&rdquo; she said at last; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not a fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a knave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may think it right to joke over the ruin of Miltoun&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; murmured
      Agatha; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara&rsquo;s eyes grew bright; and in a hard voice she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world is not your nursery, Angel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Agatha closed her lips very tightly, as who should imply: &ldquo;Then it ought
      to be!&rdquo; But she only answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you know that I saw you just now in Gustard&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara eyed her for a moment in amazement, and began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;monstrous depravity&mdash;poor old Gustard&rsquo;s!&rdquo; And
      still laughing that dangerous laugh, she turned on her heel and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner and afterwards that evening she was very silent, having on her
      face the same look that she wore out hunting, especially when in
      difficulties of any kind, or if advised to &lsquo;take a pull.&rsquo; When she got
      away to her own room she had a longing to relieve herself by some kind of
      action that would hurt someone, if only herself. To go to bed and toss
      about in a fever&mdash;for she knew herself in these thwarted moods&mdash;was
      of no use! For a moment she thought of going out. That would be fun, and
      hurt them, too; but it was difficult. She did not want to be seen, and
      have the humiliation of an open row. Then there came into her head the
      memory of the roof of the tower, where she had once been as a little girl.
      She would be in the air there, she would be able to breathe, to get rid of
      this feverishness. With the unhappy pleasure of a spoiled child taking its
      revenge, she took care to leave her bedroom door open, so that her maid
      would wonder where she was, and perhaps be anxious, and make them anxious.
      Slipping through the moonlit picture gallery on to the landing, outside
      her father&rsquo;s sanctum, whence rose the stone staircase leading to the roof,
      she began to mount. She was breathless when, after that unending flight of
      stairs she emerged on to the roof at the extreme northern end of the big
      house, where, below her, was a sheer drop of a hundred feet. At first she
      stood, a little giddy, grasping the rail that ran round that garden of
      lead, still absorbed in her brooding, rebellious thoughts. Gradually she
      lost consciousness of everything save the scene before her. High above all
      neighbouring houses, she was almost appalled by the majesty of what she
      saw. This night-clothed city, so remote and dark, so white-gleaming and
      alive, on whose purple hills and valleys grew such myriad golden flowers
      of light, from whose heart came this deep incessant murmur&mdash;could it
      possibly be the same city through which she had been walking that very
      day! From its sleeping body the supreme wistful spirit had emerged in dark
      loveliness, and was low-flying down there, tempting her. Barbara turned
      round, to take in all that amazing prospect, from the black glades of Hyde
      Park, in front, to the powdery white ghost of a church tower, away to the
      East. How marvellous was this city of night! And as, in presence of that
      wide darkness of the sea before dawn, her spirit had felt little and timid
      within her&mdash;so it felt now, in face of this great, brooding,
      beautiful creature, whom man had made. She singled out the shapes of the
      Piccadilly hotels, and beyond them the palaces and towers of Westminster
      and Whitehall; and everywhere the inextricable loveliness of dim blue
      forms and sinuous pallid lines of light, under an indigo-dark sky. Near at
      hand, she could see plainly the still-lighted windows, the motorcars
      gliding by far down, even the tiny shapes of people walking; and the
      thought that each of them meant someone like herself, seemed strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drinking of this wonder-cup, she began to experience a queer intoxication,
      and lost the sense of being little; rather she had the feeling of power,
      as in her dream at Monkland. She too, as well as this great thing below
      her, seemed to have shed her body, to be emancipated from every
      barrier-floating deliciously identified with air. She seemed to be one
      with the enfranchised spirit of the city, drowned in perception of its
      beauty. Then all that feeling went, and left her frowning, shivering,
      though the wind from the West was warm. Her whole adventure of coming up
      here seemed bizarre, ridiculous. Very stealthily she crept down, and had
      reached once more the door into &lsquo;the picture gallery, when she heard her
      mother&rsquo;s voice say in amazement: &ldquo;That you, Babs?&rdquo; And turning, saw her
      coming from the doorway of the sanctum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a sudden very cool, with all her faculties about her, Barbara smiled,
      and stood looking at Lady Valleys, who said with hesitation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in here, dear, a minute, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that room resorted to for comfort, Lord Valleys was standing with his
      back to the hearth, and an expression on his face that wavered between
      vexation and decision. The doubt in Agatha&rsquo;s mind whether she should tell
      or no, had been terribly resolved by little Ann, who in a pause of
      conversation had announced: &ldquo;We saw Auntie Babs and Mr. Courtier in
      Gustard&rsquo;s, but we didn&rsquo;t speak to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upset by the events of the afternoon, Lady Valleys had not shown her usual
      &lsquo;savoir faire&rsquo;. She had told her husband. A meeting of this sort in a shop
      celebrated for little save its wedding cakes was in a sense of no
      importance; but, being disturbed already by the news of Miltoun, it seemed
      to them both nothing less than sinister, as though the heavens were in
      league for the demolition of their house. To Lord Valleys it was
      peculiarly mortifying, because of his real admiration for his daughter,
      and because he had paid so little attention to his wife&rsquo;s warning of some
      weeks back. In consultation, however, they had only succeeded in deciding
      that Lady Valleys should talk with her. Though without much spiritual
      insight, they had, each of them, a certain cool judgment; and were fully
      alive to the danger of thwarting Barbara. This had not prevented Lord
      Valleys from expressing himself strongly on the &lsquo;confounded
      unscrupulousness of that fellow,&rsquo; and secretly forming his own plan for
      dealing with this matter. Lady Valleys, more deeply conversant with her
      daughter&rsquo;s nature, and by reason of femininity more lenient towards the
      other sex, had not tried to excuse Courtier, but had thought privately:
      &lsquo;Babs is rather a flirt.&rsquo; For she could not altogether help remembering
      herself at the same age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summoned thus unexpectedly, Barbara, her lips very firmly pressed
      together, took her stand, coolly enough, by her father&rsquo;s writing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing her suddenly appear, Lord Valleys instinctively relaxed his frown;
      his experience of men and things, his thousands of diplomatic hours,
      served to give him an air of coolness and detachment which he was very far
      from feeling. In truth he would rather have faced a hostile mob than his
      favourite daughter in such circumstances. His tanned face with its crisp
      grey moustache, his whole head indeed, took on, unconsciously, a more than
      ordinarily soldier-like appearance. His eyelids drooped a little, his
      brows rose slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wearing a blue wrap over her evening frock, and he seized
      instinctively on that indifferent trifle to begin this talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Babs, have you been out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alive to her very finger-nails, with every nerve tingling, but showing no
      sign, Barbara answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; on the roof of the tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It gave her a real malicious pleasure to feel the perplexity beneath her
      father&rsquo;s dignified exterior. And detecting that covert mockery, Lord
      Valleys said dryly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Star-gazing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with that sudden resolution peculiar to him, as though he were bored
      with having to delay and temporize, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I doubt whether it&rsquo;s wise to make appointments in
      confectioner&rsquo;s shops when Ann is in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dangerous little gleam in Barbara&rsquo;s eyes escaped his vision but not
      that of Lady Valleys, who said at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt you had the best of reasons, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara curled her lip. Had it not been for the scene they had been
      through that day with Miltoun, and for their very real anxiety, both would
      have seen, then, that while their daughter was in this mood, least said
      was soonest mended. But their nerves were not quite within control; and
      with more than a touch of impatience Lord Valleys ejaculated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t appear to you, I suppose, to require any explanation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Lord Valleys: &ldquo;I see. An explanation can be had no doubt from
      the gentleman whose sense of proportion was such as to cause him to
      suggest such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not suggest it. I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys&rsquo; eyebrows rose still higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geoffrey!&rdquo; murmured Lady Valleys, &ldquo;I thought I was to talk to Babs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would no doubt be wiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Barbara, thus for the first time in her life seriously reprimanded,
      there was at work the most peculiar sensation she had ever felt, as if
      something were scraping her very skin&mdash;a sick, and at the same time
      devilish, feeling. At that moment she could have struck her father dead.
      But she showed nothing, having lowered the lids of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Valleys&rsquo; jaw had become suddenly more prominent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a sequel to your share in Miltoun&rsquo;s business, it is peculiarly
      entrancing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; broke in Lady Valleys very suddenly, &ldquo;Babs will tell me. It&rsquo;s
      nothing, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara&rsquo;s calm voice said again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The repetition of this phrase in that maddening, cool voice almost broke
      down her father&rsquo;s sorely tried control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing from you,&rdquo; he said with deadly coldness. &ldquo;I shall have the honour
      of telling this gentleman what I think of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At those words Barbara drew herself together, and turned her eyes from one
      face to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under that gaze, which for all its cool hardness, was so furiously alive,
      neither Lord nor Lady Valleys could keep quite still. It was as if she had
      stripped from them the well-bred mask of those whose spirits, by long
      unquestioning acceptance of themselves, have become inelastic,
      inexpansive, commoner than they knew. In fact a rather awful moment! Then
      Barbara said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s nothing else, I&rsquo;m going to bed. Goodnight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as calmly as she had come in, she went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had regained her room, she locked the door, threw off her cloak,
      and looked at herself in the glass. With pleasure she saw how firmly her
      teeth were clenched, how her breast was heaving, and how her eyes seemed
      to be stabbing herself. And all the time she thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! My dears! Very well!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      In that mood of rebellious mortification she fell asleep. And, curiously
      enough, dreamed not of him whom she had in mind been so furiously
      defending, but of Harbinger. She fancied herself in prison, lying in a
      cell fashioned like the drawing-room at Sea house; and in the next cell,
      into which she could somehow look, Harbinger was digging at the wall with
      his nails. She could distinctly see the hair on the back of his hands, and
      hear him breathing. The hole he was making grew larger and larger. Her
      heart began to beat furiously; she awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose with a new and malicious resolution to show no sign of rebellion,
      to go through the day as if nothing had happened, to deceive them all, and
      then&mdash;! Exactly what &lsquo;and then&rsquo; meant, she did not explain even to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with this plan of action she presented an untroubled front
      at breakfast, went out riding with little Ann, and shopping with her
      mother afterwards. Owing to this news of Miltoun the journey to Scotland
      had been postponed. She parried with cool ingenuity each attempt made by
      Lady Valleys to draw her into conversation on the subject of that meeting
      at Gustard&rsquo;s, nor would she talk of her brother; in every other way she
      was her usual self. In the afternoon she even volunteered to accompany her
      mother to old Lady Harbinger&rsquo;s in the neighbourhood of Prince&rsquo;s Gate. She
      knew that Harbinger would be there, and with the thought of meeting that
      other at &lsquo;five o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; had a cynical pleasure in thus encountering him.
      It was so complete a blind to them all! Then, feeling that she was
      accomplishing a masterstroke; she even told him, in her mother&rsquo;s hearing,
      that she would walk home, and he might come if he cared. He did care.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when once she had begun to swing along in the mellow afternoon, under
      the mellow trees, where the air was sweetened by the South-West wind, all
      that mutinous, reckless mood of hers vanished, she felt suddenly happy and
      kind, glad to be walking with him. To-day too he was cheerful, as if
      determined not to spoil her gaiety; and she was grateful for this. Once or
      twice she even put her hand up and touched his sleeve, calling his
      attention to birds or trees, friendly, and glad, after all those hours of
      bitter feelings, to be giving happiness. When they parted at the door of
      Valleys House, she looked back at him with a queer, half-rueful smile.
      For, now the hour had come!
    </p>
    <p>
      In a little unfrequented ante-room, all white panels and polish, she sat
      down to wait. The entrance drive was visible from here; and she meant to
      encounter Courtier casually in the hall. She was excited, and a little
      scornful of her own excitement. She had expected him to be punctual, but
      it was already past five; and soon she began to feel uneasy, almost
      ridiculous, sitting in this room where no one ever came. Going to the
      window, she looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden voice behind her, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie Babs!&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning, she saw little Ann regarding her with those wide, frank, hazel
      eyes. A shiver of nerves passed through Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your room? It&rsquo;s a nice room, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a nice room, Ann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve never been in here before. There&rsquo;s somebody just come, so I
      must go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara involuntarily put her hands up to her cheeks, and quickly passed
      with her niece into the hall. At the very door the footman William handed
      her a note. She looked at the superscription. It was from Courtier. She
      went back into the room. Through its half-closed door the figure of little
      Ann could be seen, with her legs rather wide apart, and her hands clasped
      on her low-down belt, pointing up at William her sudden little nose.
      Barbara shut the door abruptly, broke the seal, and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR LADY BARBARA,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to say my interview with your brother was fruitless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happened to be sitting in the Park just now, and I want to wish you
      every happiness before I go. It has been the greatest pleasure to know
      you. I shall never have a thought of you that will not be my pride; nor a
      memory that will not help me to believe that life is good. If I am tempted
      to feel that things are dark, I shall remember that you are breathing this
      same mortal air. And to beauty and joy&rsquo; I shall take off my hat with the
      greater reverence, that once I was permitted to walk and talk, with you.
      And so, good-bye, and God bless you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your faithful servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;CHARLES COURTIER.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her cheeks burned, quick sighs escaped her lips; she read the letter
      again, but before getting to the end could not see the words for mist. If
      in that letter there had been a word of complaint or even of regret! She
      could not let him go like this, without good-bye, without any explanation
      at all. He should not think of her as a cold, stony flirt, who had been
      merely stealing a few weeks&rsquo; amusement out of him. She would explain to
      him at all events that it had not been that. She would make him understand
      that it was not what he thought&mdash;that something in her wanted&mdash;wanted&mdash;&mdash;!
      Her mind was all confused. &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; she thought: &ldquo;What did I do?&rdquo;
       And sore with anger at herself, she screwed the letter up in her glove,
      and ran out. She walked swiftly down to Piccadilly, and crossed into the
      Green Park. There she passed Lord Malvezin and a friend strolling up
      towards Hyde Park Corner, and gave them a very faint bow. The composure of
      those two precise and well-groomed figures sickened her just then. She
      wanted to run, to fly to this meeting that should remove from him the
      odious feelings he must have, that she, Barbara Caradoc, was a vulgar
      enchantress, a common traitress and coquette! And his letter&mdash;without
      a syllable of reproach! Her cheeks burned so, that she could not help
      trying to hide them from people who passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she drew nearer to his rooms she walked slower, forcing herself to
      think what she should do, what she should let him do! But she continued
      resolutely forward. She would not shrink now&mdash;whatever came of it!
      Her heart fluttered, seemed to stop beating, fluttered again. She set her
      teeth; a sort of desperate hilarity rose in her. It was an adventure! Then
      she was gripped by the feeling that had come to her on the roof. The whole
      thing was bizarre, ridiculous! She stopped, and drew the letter from her
      glove. It might be ridiculous, but it was due from her; and closing her
      lips very tight, she walked on. In thought she was already standing close
      to him, her eyes shut, waiting, with her heart beating wildly, to know
      what she would feel when his lips had spoken, perhaps touched her face or
      hand. And she had a sort of mirage vision of herself, with eyelashes
      resting on her cheeks, lips a little parted, arms helpless at her sides.
      Yet, incomprehensibly, his figure was invisible. She discovered then that
      she was standing before his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang the bell calmly, but instead of dropping her hand, pressed the
      little bare patch of palm left open by the glove to her face, to see
      whether it was indeed her own cheek flaming so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door had been opened by some unseen agency, disclosing a passage and
      flight of stairs covered by a red carpet, at the foot of which lay an old,
      tangled, brown-white dog full of fleas and sorrow. Unreasoning terror
      seized on Barbara; her body remained rigid, but her spirit began flying
      back across the Green Park, to the very hall of Valleys House. Then she
      saw coming towards her a youngish woman in a blue apron, with mild,
      reddened eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this where Mr. Courtier lives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss.&rdquo; The teeth of the young woman were few in number and rather
      black; and Barbara could only stand there saying nothing, as if her body
      had been deserted between the sunlight and this dim red passage, which led
      to-what?
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman spoke again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if you was wanting him, miss, he&rsquo;s just gone away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara felt a movement in her heart, like the twang and quiver of an
      elastic band, suddenly relaxed. She bent to stroke the head of the old
      dog, who was smelling her shoes. The woman said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, of course, I can&rsquo;t give you his address, because he&rsquo;s gone to
      foreign parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a murmur, of whose sense she knew nothing, Barbara hurried out into
      the sunshine. Was she glad? Was she sorry? At the corner of the street she
      turned and looked back; the two heads, of the woman and the dog, were
      there still, poked out through the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      A horrible inclination to laugh seized her, followed by as horrible a
      desire to cry.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      By the river the West wind, whose murmuring had visited Courtier and
      Miltoun the night before, was bringing up the first sky of autumn.
      Slow-creeping and fleecy grey, the clouds seemed trying to overpower a sun
      that shone but fitfully even thus early in the day. While Audrey Noel was
      dressing sunbeams danced desperately on the white wall, like little lost
      souls with no to-morrow, or gnats that wheel and wheel in brief joy,
      leaving no footmarks on the air. Through the chinks of a side window
      covered by a dark blind some smoky filaments of light were tethered to the
      back of her mirror. Compounded of trembling grey spirals, so thick to the
      eye that her hand felt astonishment when it failed to grasp them, and so
      jealous as ghosts of the space they occupied, they brought a moment&rsquo;s
      distraction to a heart not happy. For how could she be happy, her lover
      away from her now thirty hours, without having overcome with his last
      kisses the feeling of disaster which had settled on her when he told her
      of his resolve. Her eyes had seen deeper than his; her instinct had
      received a message from Fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be the dragger-down, the destroyer of his usefulness; to be not the
      helpmate, but the clog; not the inspiring sky, but the cloud! And because
      of a scruple which she could not understand! She had no anger with that
      unintelligible scruple; but her fatalism, and her sympathy had followed it
      out into his future. Things being so, it could not be long before he felt
      that her love was maiming him; even if he went on desiring her, it would
      be only with his body. And if, for this scruple, he were capable of giving
      up his public life, he would be capable of living on with her after his
      love was dead! This thought she could not bear. It stung to the very
      marrow of her nerves. And yet surely Life could not be so cruel as to have
      given her such happiness meaning to take it from her! Surely her love was
      not to be only one summer&rsquo;s day; his love but an embrace, and then&mdash;for
      ever nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning, fortified by despair, she admitted her own beauty. He would,
      he must want her more than that other life, at the very thought of which
      her face darkened. That other life so hard, and far from her! So loveless,
      formal, and yet&mdash;to him so real, so desperately, accursedly real! If
      he must indeed give up his career, then surely the life they could live
      together would make up to him&mdash;a life among simple and sweet things,
      all over the world, with music and pictures, and the flowers and all
      Nature, and friends who sought them for themselves, and in being kind to
      everyone, and helping the poor and the unfortunate, and loving each other!
      But he did not want that sort of life! What was the good of pretending
      that he did? It was right and natural he should want, to use his powers!
      To lead and serve! She would not have him otherwise: With these thoughts
      hovering and darting within her, she went on twisting and coiling her dark
      hair, and burying her heart beneath its lace defences. She noted too, with
      her usual care, two fading blossoms in the bowl of flowers on her
      dressing-table, and, removing them, emptied out the water and refilled the
      bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she left her bedroom the sunbeams had already ceased to dance, the
      grey filaments of light were gone. Autumn sky had come into its own.
      Passing the mirror in the hall which was always rough with her, she had
      not courage to glance at it. Then suddenly a woman&rsquo;s belief in the power
      of her charm came to her aid; she felt almost happy&mdash;surely he must
      love her better than his conscience! But that confidence was very
      tremulous, ready to yield to the first rebuff. Even the friendly fresh&mdash;cheeked
      maid seemed that morning to be regarding her with compassion; and all the
      innate sense, not of &lsquo;good form,&rsquo; but of form, which made her shrink from
      anything that should disturb or hurt another, or make anyone think she was
      to be pitied, rose up at once within her; she became more than ever
      careful to show nothing even to herself. So she passed the morning,
      mechanically doing the little usual things. An overpowering longing was
      with her all the time, to get him away with her from England, and see
      whether the thousand beauties she could show him would not fire him with
      love of the things she loved. As a girl she had spent nearly three years
      abroad. And Eustace had never been to Italy, nor to her beloved mountain
      valleys! Then, the remembrance of his rooms at the Temple broke in on that
      vision, and shattered it. No Titian&rsquo;s feast of gentian, tawny brown, and
      alpen-rose could intoxicate the lover of those books, those papers, that
      great map. And the scent of leather came to her now as poignantly as if
      she were once more flitting about noiselessly on her business of nursing.
      Then there rushed through her again the warm wonderful sense that had been
      with her all those precious days&mdash;of love that knew secretly of its
      approaching triumph and fulfilment; the delicious sense of giving every
      minute of her time, every thought, and movement; and all the sweet
      unconscious waiting for the divine, irrevocable moment when at last she
      would give herself and be his. The remembrance too of how tired, how
      sacredly tired she had been, and of how she had smiled all the time with
      her inner joy of being tired for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the bell startled her. His telegram had said, the afternoon!
      She determined to show nothing of the trouble darkening the whole world
      for her, and drew a deep breath, waiting for his kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not Miltoun, but Lady Casterley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock sent the blood buzzing into her temples. Then she noticed that
      the little figure before her was also trembling; drawing up a chair, she
      said: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of that old voice, thanking her, brought back sharply the memory
      of her garden, at Monkland, bathed in the sweetness and shimmer of summer,
      and of Barbara standing at her gate towering above this little figure,
      which now sat there so silent, with very white face. Those carved
      features, those keen, yet veiled eyes, had too often haunted her thoughts;
      they were like a bad dream come true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandson is not here, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Audrey shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have heard of his decision. I will not beat about the bush with you.
      It is a disaster for me a calamity. I have known and loved him since he
      was born, and I have been foolish enough to dream, dreams about him. I
      wondered perhaps whether you knew how much we counted on him. You must
      forgive an old woman&rsquo;s coming here like this. At my age there are few
      things that matter, but they matter very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Audrey thought: &ldquo;And at my age there is but one thing that matters,
      and that matters worse than death.&rdquo; But she did not speak. To whom, to
      what should she speak? To this hard old woman, who personified the world?
      Of what use, words?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can say to you,&rdquo; went on the voice of the little figure, that seemed so
      to fill the room with its grey presence, &ldquo;what I could not bring myself to
      say to others; for you are not hard-hearted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quiver passed up from the heart so praised to the still lips. No, she
      was not hard-hearted! She could even feel for this old woman from whose
      voice anxiety had stolen its despotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eustace cannot live without his career. His career is himself, he must be
      doing, and leading, and spending his powers. What he has given you is not
      his true self. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you, but the truth is the truth, and
      we must all bow before it. I may be hard, but I can respect sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To respect sorrow! Yes, this grey visitor could do that, as the wind
      passing over the sea respects its surface, as the air respects the surface
      of a rose, but to penetrate to the heart, to understand her sorrow, that
      old age could not do for youth! As well try to track out the secret of the
      twistings in the flight of those swallows out there above the river, or to
      follow to its source the faint scent of the lilies in that bowl! How
      should she know what was passing in here&mdash;this little old woman whose
      blood was cold? And Audrey had the sensation of watching someone pelt her
      with the rind and husks of what her own spirit had long devoured. She had
      a longing to get up, and take the hand, the chill, spidery hand of age,
      and thrust it into her breast, and say: &ldquo;Feel that, and cease!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, withal, she never lost her queer dull compassion for the owner of
      that white carved face. It was not her visitor&rsquo;s fault that she had come!
      Again Lady Casterley was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is early days. If you do not end it now, at once, it will only come
      harder on you presently. You know how determined he is. He will not change
      his mind. If you cut him off from his work in life, it will but recoil on
      you. I can only expect your hatred, for talking like this, but believe me,
      it&rsquo;s for your good, as well as his, in the long run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tumultuous heart-beating of ironical rage seized on the listener to that
      speech. Her good! The good of a corse that the breath is just abandoning;
      the good of a flower beneath a heel; the good of an old dog whose master
      leaves it for the last time! Slowly a weight like lead stopped all that
      fluttering of her heart. If she did not end it at once! The words had now
      been spoken that for so many hours, she knew, had lain unspoken within her
      own breast. Yes, if she did not, she could never know a moment&rsquo;s peace,
      feeling that she was forcing him to a death in life, desecrating her own
      love and pride! And the spur had been given by another! The thought that
      someone&mdash;this hard old woman of the hard world&mdash;should have
      shaped in words the hauntings of her love and pride through all those ages
      since Miltoun spoke to her of his resolve; that someone else should have
      had to tell her what her heart had so long known it must do&mdash;this
      stabbed her like a knife! This, at all events, she could not bear!
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood up, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please leave me now! I have a great many things to do, before I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sort of pleasure she saw a look of bewilderment cover that old
      face; with a sort of pleasure she marked the trembling of the hands
      raising their owner from the chair; and heard the stammering in the voice:
      &ldquo;You are going? Before-before he comes? You-you won&rsquo;t be seeing him
      again?&rdquo; With a sort of pleasure she marked the hesitation, which did not
      know whether to thank, or bless, or just say nothing and creep away. With
      a sort of pleasure she watched the flush mount in the faded cheeks, the
      faded lips pressed together. Then, at the scarcely whispered words: &ldquo;Thank
      you, my dear!&rdquo; she turned, unable to bear further sight or sound. She went
      to the window and pressed her forehead against the glass, trying to think
      of nothing. She heard the sound of wheels-Lady Casterley had gone. And
      then, of all the awful feelings man or woman can know, she experienced the
      worst: She could not cry!
    </p>
    <p>
      At this most bitter and deserted moment of her life, she felt strangely
      calm, foreseeing clearly, exactly; what she must do, and where go. Quickly
      it must be done, or it would never be done! Quickly! And without fuss! She
      put some things together, sent the maid out for a cab, and sat down to
      write.
    </p>
    <p>
      She must do and say nothing that could excite him, and bring back his
      illness. Let it all be sober, reasonable! It would be easy to let him know
      where she was going, to write a letter that would bring him flying after
      her. But to write the calm, reasonable words that would keep him waiting
      and thinking, till he never again came to her, broke her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had finished and sealed the letter, she sat motionless with a
      numb feeling in hands and brain, trying to realize what she had next to
      do. To go, and that was all!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her trunks had been taken down already. She chose the little hat that he
      liked her best in, and over it fastened her thickest veil. Then, putting
      on her travelling coat and gloves, she looked in the long mirror, and
      seeing that there was nothing more to keep her, lifted her dressing bag,
      and went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over on the embankment a child was crying; and the passionate screaming
      sound, broken by the gulping of tears, made her cover her lips, as though
      she had heard her own escaped soul wailing out there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned out of the cab to say to the maid:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and comfort that crying, Ella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only when she was alone in the train, secure from all eyes, did she give
      way to desperate weeping. The white smoke rolling past the windows was not
      more evanescent than her joy had been. For she had no illusions&mdash;it
      was over! From first to last&mdash;not quite a year! But even at this
      moment, not for all the world would she have been without her love, gone
      to its grave, like a dead child that evermore would be touching her breast
      with its wistful fingers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Barbara returning from her visit to Courtier&rsquo;s deserted rooms, was met at
      Valleys House with the message: Would she please go at once to Lady
      Casterley?
    </p>
    <p>
      When, in obedience, she reached Ravensham, she found her grandmother and
      Lord-Dennis in the white room. They were standing by one of the tall
      windows, apparently contemplating the view. They turned indeed at sound of
      Barbara&rsquo;s approach, but neither of them spoke or nodded. Not having seen
      her grandfather since before Miltoun&rsquo;s illness, Barbara found it strange
      to be so treated; she too took her stand silently before the window. A
      very large wasp was crawling up the pane, then slipping down with a faint
      buzz.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Lady Casterley spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill that thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dennis drew forth his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with that, Dennis. It will make a mess. Take a paper knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to put it out,&rdquo; murmured Lord Dennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Barbara with her gloves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara moved towards the pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hornet, I think,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is!&rdquo; said Lord Dennis, dreamily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; murmured Lady Casterley, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a common wasp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a hornet, Granny. The rings are darker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley bent down; when she raised herself she had a slipper in her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t irritate him!&rdquo; cried Barbara, catching her wrist. But Lady
      Casterley freed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she said, and brought the sole of the slipper down on the
      insect, so that it dropped on the floor, dead. &ldquo;He has no business in
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as if that little incident had happened to three other people, they
      again stood silently looking through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Lady Casterley turned to Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you realized the mischief that you&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ann!&rdquo; murmured Lord Dennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; she is your favourite, but that won&rsquo;t save her. This woman&mdash;to
      her great credit&mdash;I say to her great credit&mdash;has gone away, so
      as to put herself out of Eustace&rsquo;s reach, until he has recovered his
      senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sharp-drawn breath Barbara said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! poor thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But on Lady Casterley&rsquo;s face had come an almost cruel look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;Exactly. But, curiously enough, I am thinking of
      Eustace.&rdquo; Her little figure was quivering from head to foot: &ldquo;This will be
      a lesson to you not to play with fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ann!&rdquo; murmured Lord Dennis again, slipping his arm through Barbara&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world,&rdquo; went on Lady Casterley, &ldquo;is a place of facts, not of romantic
      fancies. You have done more harm than can possibly be repaired. I went to
      her myself. I was very much moved.&rsquo; If it hadn&rsquo;t been for your foolish
      conduct&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ann!&rdquo; said Lord Dennis once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley paused, tapping the floor with her little foot. Barbara&rsquo;s
      eyes were gleaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything else you would like to squash, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babs!&rdquo; murmured Lord Dennis; but, unconsciously pressing his hand against
      her heart, the girl went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are lucky to be abusing me to-day&mdash;if it had been yesterday&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these dark words Lady Casterley turned away, her shoes leaving little
      dull stains on the polished floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara raised to her cheek the fingers which she had been so convulsively
      embracing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her go on, uncle,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;not just now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my dear,&rdquo; Lord Dennis murmured, &ldquo;certainly not&mdash;it is
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been your sentimental folly,&rdquo; came Lady Casterley&rsquo;s voice from a
      far corner, &ldquo;which has brought this on the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Responding to the pressure of the hand, back now at her waist, Barbara did
      not answer; and the sound of the little feet retracing their steps rose in
      the stillness. Neither of those two at the window turned their heads; once
      more the feet receded, and again began coming back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Barbara, pointing to the floor, cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Granny, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, stand still; haven&rsquo;t you squashed the
      hornet enough, even if he did come in where he hadn&rsquo;t any business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley looked down at the debris of the insect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo; she said; but when she next spoke it was in a less hard,
      more querulous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man&mdash;what was his name&mdash;have you got rid of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara went crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abuse my friends, and I will go straight home and never speak to you
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Lady Casterley looked almost as if she might strike her
      granddaughter; then a little sardonic smile broke out on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A creditable sentiment!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letting fall her uncle&rsquo;s hand, Barbara cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any case, I&rsquo;d better go. I don&rsquo;t know why you sent for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley answered coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To let you and your mother know of this woman&rsquo;s most unselfish behaviour;
      to put you on the &lsquo;qui vive&rsquo; for what Eustace may do now; to give you a
      chance to make up for your folly. Moreover to warn you against&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; interrupted Lord Dennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Uncle Dennis, let Granny take her shoe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had withdrawn against the wall, tall, and as it were, formidable, with
      her head up. Lady Casterley remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got it ready?&rdquo; cried Barbara: &ldquo;Unfortunately he&rsquo;s flown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Miltoun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had come in quietly and quickly, preceding the announcement, and stood
      almost touching that little group at the window before they caught sight
      of him. His face had the rather ghastly look of sunburnt faces from which
      emotion has driven the blood; and his eyes, always so much the most living
      part of him, were full of such stabbing anger, that involuntarily they all
      looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to you alone,&rdquo; he said to Lady Casterley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visibly, for perhaps the first time in her life, that indomitable little
      figure flinched. Lord Dennis drew Barbara away, but at the door he
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here quietly, Babs; I don&rsquo;t like the look of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unnoticed, Barbara remained hovering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two voices, low, and so far off in the long white room, were uncannily
      distinct, emotion charging each word with preternatural power of
      penetration; and every movement of the speakers had to the girl&rsquo;s excited
      eyes a weird precision, as of little figures she had once seen at a Paris
      puppet show. She could hear Miltoun reproaching his grandmother in words
      terribly dry and bitter. She edged nearer and nearer, till, seeing that
      they paid no more heed to her than if she were an attendant statue, she
      had regained her position by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not going to see you ruined before my eyes, Eustace. I did what I
      did at very great cost. I did my best for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara saw Miltoun&rsquo;s face transfigured by a dreadful smile&mdash;the
      smile of one defying his torturer with hate. Lady Casterley went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you stand there looking like a devil. Hate me if you like&mdash;but
      don&rsquo;t betray us, moaning and moping because you can&rsquo;t have the moon. Put
      on your armour, and go down into the battle. Don&rsquo;t play the coward, boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun&rsquo;s answer cut like the lash of a whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God! Be silent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And weirdly, there was silence. It was not the brutality of the words, but
      the sight of force suddenly naked of all disguise&mdash;like a fierce dog
      let for a moment off its chain&mdash;which made Barbara utter a little
      dismayed sound. Lady Casterley had dropped into a chair, trembling. And
      without a look Miltoun passed her. If their grandmother had fallen dead,
      Barbara knew he would not have stopped to see. She ran forward, but the
      old woman waved her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go after him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let him go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And infected by the fear in that wizened voice, Barbara flew.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught her brother as he was entering the taxi-cab in which he had
      come, and without a word slipped in beside him. The driver&rsquo;s face appeared
      at the window, but Miltoun only motioned with his head, as if to say:
      Anywhere, away from here!
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought flashed through Barbara: &ldquo;If only I can keep him in here with
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned out, and said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Nettlefold, in Sussex&mdash;never mind your petrol&mdash;get more on
      the road. You can have what fare you like. Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated, looked in her face, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; miss. By Dorking, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara nodded.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The clock over the stables was chiming seven when Miltoun and Barbara
      passed out of the tall iron gates, in their swift-moving small world, that
      smelled faintly of petrol. Though the cab was closed, light spurts of rain
      drifted in through the open windows, refreshing the girl&rsquo;s hot face,
      relieving a little her dread of this drive. For, now that Fate had been
      really cruel, now that it no longer lay in Miltoun&rsquo;s hands to save himself
      from suffering, her heart bled for him; and she remembered to forget
      herself. The immobility with which he had received her intrusion, was
      ominous. And though silent in her corner, she was desperately working all
      her woman&rsquo;s wits to discover a way of breaking into the house of his
      secret mood. He appeared not even to have noticed that they had turned
      their backs on London, and passed into Richmond Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the trees, made dark by rain, seemed to watch gloomily the progress
      of this whirring-wheeled red box, unreconciled even yet to such harsh
      intruders on their wind-scented tranquillity. And the deer, pursuing
      happiness on the sweet grasses, raised disquieted noses, as who should
      say: Poisoners of the fern, defilers of the trails of air!
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara vaguely felt the serenity out there in the clouds, and the trees,
      and wind. If it would but creep into this dim, travelling prison, and help
      her; if it would but come, like sleep, and steal away dark sorrow, and in
      one moment make grief-joy. But it stayed outside on its wistful wings; and
      that grand chasm which yawns between soul and soul remained unbridged. For
      what could she say? How make him speak of what he was going to do? What
      alternatives indeed were now before him? Would he sullenly resign his
      seat, and wait till he could find Audrey Noel again? But even if he did
      find her, they would only be where they were. She had gone, in order not
      to be a drag on him&mdash;it would only be the same thing all over again!
      Would he then, as Granny had urged him, put on his armour, and go down
      into the fight? But that indeed would mean the end, for if she had had the
      strength to go away now, she would surely never come back and break in on
      his life a second time. And a grim thought swooped down on Barbara. What
      if he resigned everything! Went out into the dark! Men did sometimes&mdash;she
      knew&mdash;caught like this in the full flush of passion. But surely not
      Miltoun, with his faith! &lsquo;If the lark&rsquo;s song means nothing&mdash;if that
      sky is a morass of our invention&mdash;if we are pettily creeping on,
      furthering nothing&mdash;persuade me of it, Babs, and I&rsquo;ll bless you.&rsquo; But
      had he still that anchorage, to prevent him slipping out to sea? This
      sudden thought of death to one for whom life was joy, who had never even
      seen the Great Stillness, was very terrifying. She fixed her eyes on the
      back of the chauffeur, in his drab coat with the red collar, finding some
      comfort in its solidity. They were in a taxi-cab, in Richmond Park! Death&mdash;incongruous,
      incredible death! It was stupid to be frightened! She forced herself to
      look at Miltoun. He seemed to be asleep; his eyes were closed, his arms
      folded&mdash;only a quivering of his eyelids betrayed him. Impossible to
      tell what was going on in that grim waking sleep, which made her feel that
      she was not there at all, so utterly did he seem withdrawn into himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his eyes, and said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think I&rsquo;m going to lay hands on myself, Babs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horribly startled by this reading of her thoughts, Barbara could only edge
      away and stammer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we going in this thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nettlefold. Would you like him stopped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will do as well as anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Terrified lest he should relapse into that grim silence, she timidly
      possessed herself of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fast growing dark; the cab, having left the villas of Surbiton
      behind, was flying along at great speed among pine-trees and stretches of
      heather gloomy with faded daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miltoun said presently, in a queer, slow voice &ldquo;If I want, I have only to
      open that door and jump. You who believe that &lsquo;to-morrow we die&rsquo;&mdash;give
      me the faith to feel that I can free myself by that jump, and out I go!&rdquo;
       Then, seeming to pity her terrified squeeze of his hand, he added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      all right, Babs; we, shall sleep comfortably enough in our beds tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, so desolate to the girl was his voice, that she hoped now for
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us be skinned quietly,&rdquo; muttered Miltoun, &ldquo;if nothing else. Sorry to
      have disturbed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pressing close up to him, Barbara murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only&mdash;&mdash;Talk to me!&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miltoun, though he stroked her hand, was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab, moving at unaccustomed speed along these deserted roads, moaned
      dismally; and Barbara was possessed now by a desire which she dared not
      put in practice, to pull his head down, and rock it against her. Her heart
      felt empty, and timid; to have something warm resting on it would have
      made all the difference. Everything real, substantial, comforting, seemed
      to have slipped away. Among these flying dark ghosts of pine-trees&mdash;as
      it were the unfrequented borderland between two worlds&mdash;the feeling
      of a cheek against her breast alone could help muffle the deep disquiet in
      her, lost like a child in a wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab slackened speed, the driver was lighting his lamps; and his red
      face appeared at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave to stop here, miss; I&rsquo;m out of petrol. Will you get some
      dinner, or go through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through,&rdquo; answered Barbara:
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were passing the little time, buying then petrol, asking the
      way, she felt less miserable, and even looked about her with a sort of
      eagerness. Then when they had started again, she thought: If I could get
      him to sleep&mdash;the sea will comfort him! But his eyes were staring,
      wide-open. She feigned sleep herself; letting her head slip a little to
      one side, causing small sounds of breathing to escape. The whirring of the
      wheels, the moaning of the cab joints, the dark trees slipping by, the
      scent of the wet fern drifting in, all these must surely help! And
      presently she felt that he was indeed slipping into darkness&mdash;and
      then-she felt nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she awoke from the sleep into which she had seen Miltoun fall, the
      cab was slowly mounting a steep hill, above which the moon had risen. The
      air smelled strong and sweet, as though it had passed over leagues of
      grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Downs!&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;I must have been asleep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In sudden terror, she looked round for Miltoun. But he was still there,
      exactly as before, leaning back rigid in his corner of the cab, with
      staring eyes, and no other signs of life. And still only half awake, like
      a great warm sleepy child startled out of too deep slumber, she clutched,
      and clung to him. The thought that he had been sitting like that, with his
      spirit far away, all the time that she had been betraying her watch in
      sleep, was dreadful. But to her embrace there was no response, and awake
      indeed now, ashamed, sore, Barbara released him, and turned her face to
      the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out there, two thin, dense-black, long clouds, shaped like the wings of a
      hawk, had joined themselves together, so that nothing of the moon showed
      but a living brightness imprisoned, like the eyes and life of a bird,
      between those swift sweeps of darkness. This great uncanny spirit,
      brooding malevolent over the high leagues of moon-wan grass, seemed
      waiting to swoop, and pluck up in its talons, and devour, all that
      intruded on the wild loneness of these far-up plains of freedom. Barbara
      almost expected to hear coming from it the lost whistle of the buzzard
      hawks. And her dream came back to her. Where were her wings-the wings that
      in sleep had borne her to the stars; the wings that would never lift her&mdash;waking&mdash;from
      the ground? Where too were Miltoun&rsquo;s wings? She crouched back into her
      corner; a tear stole up and trickled out between her closed lids-another
      and another followed. Faster and faster they came. Then she felt Miltoun&rsquo;s
      arm round her, and heard him say: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Babs!&rdquo; Instinct telling her
      what to do, she laid her head against his chest, and sobbed bitterly.
      Struggling with those sobs, she grew less and less unhappy&mdash;knowing
      that he could never again feel quite so desolate, as before he tried to
      give her comfort. It was all a bad dream, and they would soon wake from
      it! And they would be happy; as happy as they had been before&mdash;before
      these last months! And she whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a little while, Eusty!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Old Lady Harbinger dying in the early February of the following year, the
      marriage of Barbara with her son was postponed till June.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of the wild sweetness of Spring still clung to the high moor borders
      of Monkland on the early morning of the wedding day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara was already up and dressed for riding when her maid came to call
      her; and noting Stacey&rsquo;s astonished eyes fix themselves on her boots, she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Stacey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll tire you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense; I&rsquo;m not going to be hung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Refusing the company of a groom, she made her way towards the stretch of
      high moor where she had ridden with Courtier a year ago. Here over the
      short, as yet unflowering, heather, there was a mile or more of level
      galloping ground. She mounted steadily, and her spirit rode, as it were,
      before her, longing to get up there among the peewits and curlew, to feel
      the crisp, peaty earth slip away under her, and the wind drive in her
      face, under that deep blue sky. Carried by this warm-blooded sweetheart of
      hers, ready to jump out of his smooth hide with pleasure, snuffling and
      sneezing in sheer joy, whose eye she could see straying round to catch a
      glimpse of her intentions, from whose lips she could hear issuing the
      sweet bitt-music, whose vagaries even seemed designed to startle from her
      a closer embracing&mdash;she was filled with a sort of delicious
      impatience with everything that was not this perfect communing with
      vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the top, she put him into a gallop. With the wind furiously
      assailing her face and throat, every muscle crisped; and all her blood
      tingling&mdash;this was a very ecstasy of motion!
    </p>
    <p>
      She reined in at the cairn whence she and Courtier had looked down at the
      herds of ponies. It was the merest memory now, vague and a little sweet,
      like the remembrance of some exceptional Spring day, when trees seem to
      flower before your eyes, and in sheer wantonness exhale a scent of lemons.
      The ponies were there still, and in distance the shining sea. She sat
      thinking of nothing, but how good it was to be alive. The fullness and
      sweetness of it all, the freedom and strength! Away to the West over a
      lonely farm she could see two buzzard hawks hunting in wide circles. She
      did not envy them&mdash;so happy was she, as happy as the morning. And
      there came to her suddenly the true, the overmastering longing of mountain
      tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;I simply must!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slipping off her horse she lay down on her back, and at once everything
      was lost except the sky. Over her body, supported above solid earth by the
      warm, soft heather, the wind skimmed without sound or touch. Her spirit
      became one with that calm unimaginable freedom. Transported beyond her own
      contentment, she no longer even knew whether she was joyful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse Hal, attempting to eat her sleeve, aroused her. She mounted him,
      and rode down. Near home she took a short cut across a meadow, through
      which flowed two thin bright streams, forming a delta full of lingering
      &lsquo;milkmaids,&rsquo; mauve marsh orchis, and yellow flags. From end to end of this
      long meadow, so varied, so pied with trees and stones, and flowers, and
      water, the last of the Spring was passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ponies, shyly curious of Barbara and her horse, stole up, and stood
      at a safe distance, with their noses dubiously stretched out, swishing
      their lean tails. And suddenly, far up, following their own music, two
      cuckoos flew across, seeking the thorn-trees out on the moor. While she
      was watching the arrowy birds, she caught sight of someone coming towards
      her from a clump of beech-trees, and suddenly saw that it was Mrs. Noel!
    </p>
    <p>
      She rode forward, flushing. What dared she say? Could she speak of her
      wedding, and betray Miltoun&rsquo;s presence? Could she open her mouth at all
      without rousing painful feeling of some sort? Then, impatient of
      indecision, she began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to see you again. I didn&rsquo;t know you were still down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only came back to England yesterday, and I&rsquo;m just here to see to the
      packing of my things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Barbara. &ldquo;You know what&rsquo;s happening to me, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Noel smiled, looked up, and said: &ldquo;I heard last night. All joy to
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A lump rose in Barbara&rsquo;s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to have seen you,&rdquo; she murmured once more; &ldquo;I expect I ought
      to be getting on,&rdquo; and with the word &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; gently echoed, she rode
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her mood of delight was gone; even the horse Hal seemed to tread
      unevenly, for all that he was going back to that stable which ever
      appeared to him desirable ten minutes after he had left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except that her eyes seemed darker, Mrs. Noel had not changed. If she had
      shown the faintest sign of self-pity, the girl would never have felt, as
      she did now, so sorry and upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the stables, she saw that the wind was driving up a huge, white,
      shining cloud. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it going to be fine after all!&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Re-entering the house by an old and so-called secret stairway that led
      straight to the library, she had to traverse that great dark room. There,
      buried in an armchair in front of the hearth she saw Miltoun with a book
      on his knee, not reading, but looking up at the picture of the old
      Cardinal. She hurried on, tiptoeing over the soft carpet, holding her
      breath, fearful of disturbing the queer interview, feeling guilty, too, of
      her new knowledge, which she did not mean to impart. She had burnt her
      fingers once at the flame between them; she would not do so a second time!
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the window at the far end she saw that the cloud had burst; it was
      raining furiously. She regained her bedroom unseen. In spite of her joy
      out there on the moor, this last adventure of her girlhood had not been
      all success; she had again the old sensations, the old doubts, the
      dissatisfaction which she had thought dead. Those two! To shut one&rsquo;s eyes,
      and be happy&mdash;was it possible! A great rainbow, the nearest she had
      ever seen, had sprung up in the park, and was come to earth again in some
      fields close by. The sun was shining out already through the wind-driven
      bright rain. Jewels of blue had begun to star the black and white and
      golden clouds. A strange white light-ghost of Spring passing in this last
      violent outburst-painted the leaves of every tree; and a hundred savage
      hues had come down like a motley of bright birds on moor and fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment of desperate beauty caught Barbara by the throat. Its spirit of
      galloping wildness flew straight into her heart. She clasped her hands
      across her breast to try and keep that moment. Far out, a cuckoo
      hooted-and the immortal call passed on the wind. In that call all the
      beauty, and colour, and rapture of life seemed to be flying by. If she
      could only seize and evermore have it in her heart, as the buttercups out
      there imprisoned the sun, or the fallen raindrops on the sweetbriars round
      the windows enclosed all changing light! If only there were no chains, no
      walls, and finality were dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her clock struck ten. At this time to-morrow! Her cheeks turned hot; in a
      mirror she could see them burning, her lips scornfully curved, her eyes
      strange. Standing there, she looked long at herself, till, little by
      little, her face lost every vestige of that disturbance, became solid and
      resolute again. She ceased to have the galloping wild feeling in her
      heart, and instead felt cold. Detached from herself she watched, with
      contentment, her own calm and radiant beauty resume the armour it had for
      that moment put off.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner that night, when the men left the dining-hall, Miltoun
      slipped away to his den. Of all those present in the little church he had
      seemed most unemotional, and had been most moved. Though it had been so
      quiet and private a wedding, he had resented all cheap festivity
      accompanying the passing of his young sister. He would have had that
      ceremony in the little dark disused chapel at the Court; those two, and
      the priest alone. Here, in this half-pagan little country church smothered
      hastily in flowers, with the raw singing of the half-pagan choir, and all
      the village curiosity and homage-everything had jarred, and the stale
      aftermath sickened him. Changing his swallow-tail to an old smoking
      jacket, he went out on to the lawn. In the wide darkness he could rid
      himself of his exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the day of his election he had not once been at Monkland; since Mrs.
      Noel&rsquo;s flight he had never left London. In London and work he had buried
      himself; by London and work he had saved himself! He had gone down into
      the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dew had not yet fallen, and he took the path across the fields. There was
      no moon, no stars, no wind; the cattle were noiseless under the trees;
      there were no owls calling, no night-jars churring, the fly-by-night
      chafers were not abroad. The stream alone was alive in the quiet darkness.
      And as Miltoun followed the wispy line of grey path cleaving the dim
      glamour of daisies and buttercups, there came to him the feeling that he
      was in the presence, not of sleep, but of eternal waiting. The sound of
      his footfalls seemed desecration. So devotional was that hush, burning the
      spicy incense of millions of leaves and blades of grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing the last stile he came out, close to her deserted cottage, under
      her lime-tree, which on the night of Courtier&rsquo;s adventure had hung
      blue-black round the moon. On that side, only a rail, and a few shrubs
      confined her garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was all dark, but the many tall white flowers, like a bright
      vapour rising from earth, clung to the air above the beds. Leaning against
      the tree Miltoun gave himself to memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the silent boughs which drooped round his dark figure, a little
      sleepy bird uttered a faint cheep; a hedgehog, or some small beast of
      night, rustled away in the grass close by; a moth flew past, seeking its
      candle flame. And something in Miltoun&rsquo;s heart took wings after it,
      searching for the warmth and light of his blown candle of love. Then, in
      the hush he heard a sound as of a branch ceaselessly trailed through long
      grass, fainter and fainter, more and more distinct; again fainter; but
      nothing could he see that should make that homeless sound. And the sense
      of some near but unseen presence crept on him, till the hair moved on his
      scalp. If God would light the moon or stars, and let him see! If God would
      end the expectation of this night, let one wan glimmer down into her
      garden, and one wan glimmer into his breast! But it stayed dark, and the
      homeless noise never ceased. The weird thought came to Miltoun that it was
      made by his own heart, wandering out there, trying to feel warm again. He
      closed his eyes and at once knew that it was not his heart, but indeed
      some external presence, unconsoled. And stretching his hands out he moved
      forward to arrest that sound. As he reached the railing, it ceased. And he
      saw a flame leap up, a pale broad pathway of light blanching the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, realizing that she was there, within, he gasped. His fingernails bent
      and broke against the iron railing without his knowing. It was not as on
      that night when the red flowers on her windowsill had wafted their scent
      to him; it was no sheer overpowering rush of passion. Profounder, more
      terrible, was this rising up within him of yearning for love&mdash;as if,
      now defeated, it would nevermore stir, but lie dead on that dark grass
      beneath those dark boughs. And if victorious&mdash;what then? He stole
      back under the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see little white moths travelling down that path of lamplight; he
      could see the white flowers quite plainly now, a pale watch of blossoms
      guarding the dark sleepy ones; and he stood, not reasoning, hardly any
      longer feeling; stunned, battered by struggle. His face and hands were
      sticky with the honey-dew, slowly, invisibly distilling from the
      lime-tree. He bent down and felt the grass. And suddenly there came over
      him the certainty of her presence. Yes, she was there&mdash;out on the
      verandah! He could see her white figure from head to foot; and, not
      realizing that she could not see him, he expected her to utter some cry.
      But no sound came from her, no gesture; she turned back into the house.
      Miltoun ran forward to the railing. But there, once more, he stopped&mdash;unable
      to think, unable to feel; as it were abandoned by himself. And he suddenly
      found his hand up at his mouth, as though there were blood there to be
      staunched that had escaped from his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still holding that hand before his mouth, and smothering the sound of his
      feet in the long grass, he crept away.

      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the great glass house at Ravensham, Lady Casterley stood close to some
      Japanese lilies, with a letter in her hand. Her face was very white, for
      it was the first day she had been allowed down after an attack of
      influenza; nor had the hand in which she held the letter its usual
      steadiness. She read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monkland Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a line, dear, before the post goes, to tell you that Babs has gone
      off happily. The child looked beautiful. She sent you her love, and some
      absurd message&mdash;that you would be glad to hear, she was perfectly
      safe, with both feet firmly on the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A grim little smile played on Lady Casterley&rsquo;s pale lips:&mdash;Yes,
      indeed, and time too! The child had been very near the edge of the cliffs!
      Very near committing a piece of romantic folly! That was well over! And
      raising the letter again, she read on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were all down for it, of course, and come back tomorrow. Geoffrey is
      quite cut up. Things can&rsquo;t be what they were without our Babs. I&rsquo;ve
      watched Eustace very carefully, and I really believe he&rsquo;s safely over that
      affair at last. He is doing extraordinarily well in the House just now.
      Geoffrey says his speech on the Poor Law was head and shoulders the best
      made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Casterley let fall the hand which held the letter. Safe? Yes, he was
      safe! He had done the right&mdash;the natural thing! And in time he would
      be happy! He would rise now to that pinnacle of desired authority which
      she had dreamed of for him, ever since he was a tiny thing, ever since his
      little thin brown hand had clasped hers in their wanderings amongst the
      flowers, and the furniture of tall rooms. But, as she stood&mdash;crumpling
      the letter, grey-white as some small resolute ghost, among her tall lilies
      that filled with their scent the great glass house-shadows flitted across
      her face. Was it the fugitive noon sunshine? Or was it some glimmering
      perception of the old Greek saying&mdash;&lsquo;Character is Fate;&rsquo; some sudden
      sense of the universal truth that all are in bond to their own natures,
      and what a man has most desired shall in the end enslave him?

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
