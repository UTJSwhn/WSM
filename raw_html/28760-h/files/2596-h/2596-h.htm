    <h2>
      AWAKENING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Through the massive skylight illuminating the hall at Robin Hill, the July
      sunlight at five o&rsquo;clock fell just where the broad stairway turned;
      and in that radiant streak little Jon Forsyte stood, blue-linen-suited.
      His hair was shining, and his eyes, from beneath a frown, for he was
      considering how to go downstairs, this last of innumerable times, before
      the car brought his father and mother home. Four at a time, and five at
      the bottom? Stale! Down the banisters? But in which fashion? On his face,
      feet foremost? Very stale. On his stomach, sideways? Paltry! On his back,
      with his arms stretched down on both sides? Forbidden! Or on his face,
      head foremost, in a manner unknown as yet to any but himself? Such was the
      cause of the frown on the illuminated face of little Jon....
    </p>
    <p>
      In that Summer of 1909 the simple souls who even then desired to simplify
      the English tongue, had, of course, no cognizance of little Jon, or they
      would have claimed him for a disciple. But one can be too simple in this
      life, for his real name was Jolyon, and his living father and dead
      half-brother had usurped of old the other shortenings, Jo and Jolly. As a
      fact little Jon had done his best to conform to convention and spell
      himself first Jhon, then John; not till his father had explained the sheer
      necessity, had he spelled his name Jon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up till now that father had possessed what was left of his heart by the
      groom, Bob, who played the concertina, and his nurse &ldquo;Da,&rdquo; who
      wore the violet dress on Sundays, and enjoyed the name of Spraggins in
      that private life lived at odd moments even by domestic servants. His
      mother had only appeared to him, as it were in dreams, smelling delicious,
      smoothing his forehead just before he fell asleep, and sometimes docking
      his hair, of a golden brown colour. When he cut his head open against the
      nursery fender she was there to be bled over; and when he had nightmare
      she would sit on his bed and cuddle his head against her neck. She was
      precious but remote, because &ldquo;Da&rdquo; was so near, and there is
      hardly room for more than one woman at a time in a man&rsquo;s heart. With
      his father, too, of course, he had special bonds of union; for little Jon
      also meant to be a painter when he grew up&mdash;with the one small
      difference, that his father painted pictures, and little Jon intended to
      paint ceilings and walls, standing on a board between two step-ladders, in
      a dirty-white apron, and a lovely smell of whitewash. His father also took
      him riding in Richmond Park, on his pony, Mouse, so-called because it was
      so-coloured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon had been born with a silver spoon in a mouth which was rather
      curly and large. He had never heard his father or his mother speak in an
      angry voice, either to each other, himself, or anybody else; the groom,
      Bob, Cook, Jane, Bella and the other servants, even &ldquo;Da,&rdquo; who
      alone restrained him in his courses, had special voices when they talked
      to him. He was therefore of opinion that the world was a place of perfect
      and perpetual gentility and freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      A child of 1901, he had come to consciousness when his country, just over
      that bad attack of scarlet fever, the Boer War, was preparing for the
      Liberal revival of 1906. Coercion was unpopular, parents had exalted
      notions of giving their offspring a good time. They spoiled their rods,
      spared their children, and anticipated the results with enthusiasm. In
      choosing, moreover, for his father an amiable man of fifty-two, who had
      already lost an only son, and for his mother a woman of thirty-eight,
      whose first and only child he was, little Jon had done well and wisely.
      What had saved him from becoming a cross between a lap dog and a little
      prig, had been his father&rsquo;s adoration of his mother, for even little
      Jon could see that she was not merely just his mother, and that he played
      second fiddle to her in his father&rsquo;s heart: What he played in his
      mother&rsquo;s heart he knew not yet. As for &ldquo;Auntie&rdquo; June,
      his half-sister (but so old that she had grown out of the relationship)
      she loved him, of course, but was too sudden. His devoted &ldquo;Da,&rdquo;
      too, had a Spartan touch. His bath was cold and his knees were bare; he
      was not encouraged to be sorry for himself. As to the vexed question of
      his education, little Jon shared the theory of those who considered that
      children should not be forced. He rather liked the Mademoiselle who came
      for two hours every morning to teach him her language, together with
      history, geography and sums; nor were the piano lessons which his mother
      gave him disagreeable, for she had a way of luring him from tune to tune,
      never making him practise one which did not give him pleasure, so that he
      remained eager to convert ten thumbs into eight fingers. Under his father
      he learned to draw pleasure-pigs and other animals. He was not a highly
      educated little boy. Yet, on the whole, the silver spoon stayed in his
      mouth without spoiling it, though &ldquo;Da&rdquo; sometimes said that
      other children would do him a &ldquo;world of good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a disillusionment, then, when at the age of nearly seven she held
      him down on his back, because he wanted to do something of which she did
      not approve. This first interference with the free individualism of a
      Forsyte drove him almost frantic. There was something appalling in the
      utter helplessness of that position, and the uncertainty as to whether it
      would ever come to an end. Suppose she never let him get up any more! He
      suffered torture at the top of his voice for fifty seconds. Worse than
      anything was his perception that &ldquo;Da&rdquo; had taken all that time
      to realise the agony of fear he was enduring. Thus, dreadfully, was
      revealed to him the lack of imagination in the human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was let up he remained convinced that &ldquo;Da&rdquo; had done a
      dreadful thing. Though he did not wish to bear witness against her, he had
      been compelled, by fear of repetition, to seek his mother and say: &ldquo;Mum,
      don&rsquo;t let &lsquo;Da&rsquo; hold me down on my back again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother, her hands held up over her head, and in them two plaits of
      hair&mdash;&ldquo;couleur de feuille morte,&rdquo; as little Jon had not
      yet learned to call it&mdash;had looked at him with eyes like little bits
      of his brown velvet tunic, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, darling, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She, being in the nature of a goddess, little Jon was satisfied;
      especially when, from under the dining-table at breakfast, where he
      happened to be waiting for a mushroom, he had overheard her say to his
      father:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, will you tell &lsquo;Da,&rsquo; dear, or shall I? She&rsquo;s
      so devoted to him&rdquo;; and his father&rsquo;s answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she mustn&rsquo;t show it that way. I know exactly what it
      feels like to be held down on one&rsquo;s back. No Forsyte can stand it
      for a minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious that they did not know him to be under the table, little Jon was
      visited by the quite new feeling of embarrassment, and stayed where he
      was, ravaged by desire for the mushroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such had been his first dip into the dark abysses of existence. Nothing
      much had been revealed to him after that, till one day, having gone down
      to the cow-house for his drink of milk fresh from the cow, after Garratt
      had finished milking, he had seen Clover&rsquo;s calf, dead. Inconsolable,
      and followed by an upset Garratt, he had sought &ldquo;Da&rdquo;; but
      suddenly aware that she was not the person he wanted, had rushed away to
      find his father, and had run into the arms of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clover&rsquo;s calf&rsquo;s dead! Oh! Oh! It looked so soft!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother&rsquo;s clasp, and her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, darling, there, there!&rdquo; had stayed his sobbing. But if
      Clover&rsquo;s calf could die, anything could&mdash;not only bees, flies,
      beetles and chickens&mdash;and look soft like that! This was appalling&mdash;and
      soon forgotten!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing had been to sit on a bumble bee, a poignant experience,
      which his mother had understood much better than &ldquo;Da&rdquo;; and
      nothing of vital importance had happened after that till the year turned;
      when, following a day of utter wretchedness, he had enjoyed a disease
      composed of little spots, bed, honey in a spoon, and many Tangerine
      oranges. It was then that the world had flowered. To &ldquo;Auntie&rdquo;
      June he owed that flowering, for no sooner was he a little lame duck than
      she came rushing down from London, bringing with her the books which had
      nurtured her own Berserker spirit, born in the noted year of 1869. Aged,
      and of many colours, they were stored with the most formidable happenings.
      Of these she read to little Jon, till he was allowed to read to himself;
      whereupon she whisked back to London and left them with him in a heap.
      Those books cooked his fancy, till he thought and dreamed of nothing but
      midshipmen and dhows, pirates, rafts, sandal-wood traders, iron horses,
      sharks, battles, Tartars, Red Indians, balloons, North Poles and other
      extravagant delights. The moment he was suffered to get up, he rigged his
      bed fore and aft, and set out from it in a narrow bath across green seas
      of carpet, to a rock, which he climbed by means of its mahogany drawer
      knobs, to sweep the horizon with his drinking tumbler screwed to his eye,
      in search of rescuing sails. He made a daily raft out of the towel stand,
      the tea tray, and his pillows. He saved the juice from his French plums,
      bottled it in an empty medicine bottle, and provisioned the raft with the
      rum that it became; also with pemmican made out of little saved-up bits of
      chicken sat on and dried at the fire; and with lime juice against scurvy,
      extracted from the peel of his oranges and a little economised juice. He
      made a North Pole one morning from the whole of his bedclothes except the
      bolster, and reached it in a birch-bark canoe (in private life the
      fender), after a terrible encounter with a polar bear fashioned from the
      bolster and four skittles dressed up in &ldquo;Da&rsquo;s&rdquo;
      nightgown. After that, his father, seeking to steady his imagination,
      brought him Ivanhoe, Bevis, a book about King Arthur, and Tom Brown&rsquo;s
      Schooldays. He read the first, and for three days built, defended and
      stormed Front de Boeuf&rsquo;s castle, taking every part in the piece
      except those of Rebecca and Rowena; with piercing cries of: &ldquo;En
      avant, de Bracy!&rdquo; and similar utterances. After reading the book
      about King Arthur he became almost exclusively Sir Lamorac de Galis,
      because, though there was very little about him, he preferred his name to
      that of any other knight; and he rode his old rocking-horse to death,
      armed with a long bamboo. Bevis he found tame; besides, it required woods
      and animals, of which he had none in his nursery, except his two cats,
      Fitz and Puck Forsyte, who permitted no liberties. For Tom Brown he was as
      yet too young. There was relief in the house when, after the fourth week,
      he was permitted to go down and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The month being March the trees were exceptionally like the masts of
      ships, and for little Jon that was a wonderful Spring, extremely hard on
      his knees, suits, and the patience of &ldquo;Da,&rdquo; who had the
      washing and reparation of his clothes. Every morning the moment his
      breakfast was over, he could be viewed by his mother and father, whose
      windows looked out that way, coming from the study, crossing the terrace,
      climbing the old oak tree, his face resolute and his hair bright. He began
      the day thus because there was not time to go far afield before his
      lessons. The old tree&rsquo;s variety never staled; it had mainmast,
      foremast, top-gallant mast, and he could always come down by the halyards&mdash;or
      ropes of the swing. After his lessons, completed by eleven, he would go to
      the kitchen for a thin piece of cheese, a biscuit and two French plums&mdash;provision
      enough for a jolly-boat at least&mdash;and eat it in some imaginative way;
      then, armed to the teeth with gun, pistols, and sword, he would begin the
      serious climbing of the morning, encountering by the way innumerable
      slavers, Indians, pirates, leopards, and bears. He was seldom seen at that
      hour of the day without a cutlass in his teeth (like Dick Needham) amid
      the rapid explosion of copper caps. And many were the gardeners he brought
      down with yellow peas shot out of his little gun. He lived a life of the
      most violent action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; said his father to his mother, under the oak tree,
      &ldquo;is terrible. I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s going to turn out a
      sailor, or something hopeless. Do you see any sign of his appreciating
      beauty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the faintest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thank heaven he&rsquo;s no turn for wheels or engines! I can
      bear anything but that. But I wish he&rsquo;d take more interest in
      Nature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s imaginative, Jolyon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in a sanguinary way. Does he love anyone just now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; only everyone. There never was anyone born more loving or more
      lovable than Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being your boy, Irene.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment little Jon, lying along a branch high above them, brought
      them down with two peas; but that fragment of talk lodged, thick, in his
      small gizzard. Loving, lovable, imaginative, sanguinary!
    </p>
    <p>
      The leaves also were thick by now, and it was time for his birthday,
      which, occurring every year on the twelfth of May, was always memorable
      for his chosen dinner of sweetbread, mushrooms, macaroons, and ginger
      beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between that eighth birthday, however, and the afternoon when he stood in
      the July radiance at the turning of the stairway, several important things
      had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Da,&rdquo; worn out by washing his knees, or moved by that
      mysterious instinct which forces even nurses to desert their nurslings,
      left the very day after his birthday in floods of tears &ldquo;to be
      married&rdquo;&mdash;of all things&mdash;&ldquo;to a man.&rdquo; Little
      Jon, from whom it had been kept, was inconsolable for an afternoon. It
      ought not to have been kept from him! Two large boxes of soldiers and some
      artillery, together with The Young Buglers, which had been among his
      birthday presents, cooperated with his grief in a sort of conversion, and
      instead of seeking adventures in person and risking his own life, he began
      to play imaginative games, in which he risked the lives of countless tin
      soldiers, marbles, stones and beans. Of these forms of &ldquo;chair a
      canon&rdquo; he made collections, and, using them alternately, fought the
      Peninsular, the Seven Years, the Thirty Years, and other wars, about which
      he had been reading of late in a big History of Europe which had been his
      grandfather&rsquo;s. He altered them to suit his genius, and fought them
      all over the floor in his day nursery, so that nobody could come in, for
      fearing of disturbing Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, or treading on an
      army of Austrians. Because of the sound of the word he was passionately
      addicted to the Austrians, and finding there were so few battles in which
      they were successful he had to invent them in his games. His favourite
      generals were Prince Eugene, the Archduke Charles and Wallenstein. Tilly
      and Mack (&ldquo;music-hall turns&rdquo; he heard his father call them one
      day, whatever that might mean) one really could not love very much,
      Austrian though they were. For euphonic reasons, too, he doted on Turenne.
    </p>
    <p>
      This phase, which caused his parents anxiety, because it kept him indoors
      when he ought to have been out, lasted through May and half of June, till
      his father killed it by bringing home to him Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry
      Finn. When he read those books something happened in him, and he went out
      of doors again in passionate quest of a river. There being none on the
      premises at Robin Hill, he had to make one out of the pond, which
      fortunately had water lilies, dragonflies, gnats, bullrushes, and three
      small willow trees. On this pond, after his father and Garratt had
      ascertained by sounding that it had a reliable bottom and was nowhere more
      than two feet deep, he was allowed a little collapsible canoe, in which he
      spent hours and hours paddling, and lying down out of sight of Indian Joe
      and other enemies. On the shore of the pond, too, he built himself a
      wigwam about four feet square, of old biscuit tins, roofed in by boughs.
      In this he would make little fires, and cook the birds he had not shot
      with his gun, hunting in the coppice and fields, or the fish he did not
      catch in the pond because there were none. This occupied the rest of June
      and that July, when his father and mother were away in Ireland. He led a
      lonely life of &ldquo;make believe&rdquo; during those five weeks of
      summer weather, with gun, wigwam, water and canoe; and, however hard his
      active little brain tried to keep the sense of beauty away, she did creep
      in on him for a second now and then, perching on the wing of a dragon-fly,
      glistening on the water lilies, or brushing his eyes with her blue as he
      lay on his back in ambush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie&rdquo; June, who had been left in charge, had a &ldquo;grown-up&rdquo;
      in the house, with a cough and a large piece of putty which he was making
      into a face; so she hardly ever came down to see him in the pond. Once,
      however, she brought with her two other &ldquo;grown-ups.&rdquo; Little
      Jon, who happened to have painted his naked self bright blue and yellow in
      stripes out of his father&rsquo;s water-colour box, and put some duck&rsquo;s
      feathers in his hair, saw them coming, and&mdash;ambushed himself among
      the willows. As he had foreseen, they came at once to his wigwam and knelt
      down to look inside, so that with a blood-curdling yell he was able to
      take the scalps of &ldquo;Auntie&rdquo; June and the woman &ldquo;grown-up&rdquo;
      in an almost complete manner before they kissed him. The names of the two
      grown-ups were &ldquo;Auntie&rdquo; Holly and &ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; Val, who
      had a brown face and a little limp, and laughed at him terribly. He took a
      fancy to &ldquo;Auntie&rdquo; Holly, who seemed to be a sister too; but
      they both went away the same afternoon and he did not see them again.
      Three days before his father and mother were to come home &ldquo;Auntie&rdquo;
      June also went off in a great hurry, taking the &ldquo;grown-up&rdquo; who
      coughed and his piece of putty; and Mademoiselle said: &ldquo;Poor man, he
      was veree ill. I forbid you to go into his room, Jon.&rdquo; Little Jon,
      who rarely did things merely because he was told not to, refrained from
      going, though he was bored and lonely. In truth the day of the pond was
      past, and he was filled to the brim of his soul with restlessness and the
      want of something&mdash;not a tree, not a gun&mdash;something soft. Those
      last two days had seemed months in spite of Cast Up by the Sea, wherein he
      was reading about Mother Lee and her terrible wrecking bonfire. He had
      gone up and down the stairs perhaps a hundred times in those two days, and
      often from the day nursery, where he slept now, had stolen into his mother&rsquo;s
      room, looked at everything, without touching, and on into the
      dressing-room; and standing on one leg beside the bath, like Slingsby, had
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho, ho! Dog my cats!&rdquo; mysteriously, to bring luck. Then,
      stealing back, he had opened his mother&rsquo;s wardrobe, and taken a long
      sniff which seemed to bring him nearer to&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t know what.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had done this just before he stood in the streak of sunlight, debating
      in which of the several ways he should slide down the banisters. They all
      seemed silly, and in a sudden languor he began descending the steps one by
      one. During that descent he could remember his father quite distinctly&mdash;the
      short grey beard, the deep eyes twinkling, the furrow between them, the
      funny smile, the thin figure which always seemed so tall to little Jon;
      but his mother he couldn&rsquo;t see. All that represented her was
      something swaying with two dark eyes looking back at him; and the scent of
      her wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella was in the hall, drawing aside the big curtains, and opening the
      front door. Little Jon said, wheedling,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Master Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do let&rsquo;s have tea under the oak tree when they come; I know
      they&rsquo;d like it best.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;d like it best.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they would, to please me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella smiled. &ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll take it out if you&rsquo;ll
      stay quiet here and not get into mischief before they come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon sat down on the bottom step, and nodded. Bella came close, and
      looked him over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon got up. She scrutinized him behind; he was not green, and his
      knees seemed clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My! Aren&rsquo;t you brown? Give
      me a kiss!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And little Jon received a peck on his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What jam?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired of waiting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gooseberry and strawberry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Num! They were his favourites!
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone he sat still for quite a minute. It was quiet in the big
      hall open to its East end so that he could see one of his trees, a brig
      sailing very slowly across the upper lawn. In the outer hall shadows were
      slanting from the pillars. Little Jon got up, jumped one of them, and
      walked round the clump of iris plants which filled the pool of grey-white
      marble in the centre. The flowers were pretty, but only smelled a very
      little. He stood in the open doorway and looked out. Suppose!&mdash;suppose
      they didn&rsquo;t come! He had waited so long that he felt he could not
      bear that, and his attention slid at once from such finality to the dust
      motes in the bluish sunlight coming in: Thrusting his hand up, he tried to
      catch some. Bella ought to have dusted that piece of air! But perhaps they
      weren&rsquo;t dust&mdash;only what sunlight was made of, and he looked to
      see whether the sunlight out of doors was the same. It was not. He had
      said he would stay quiet in the hall, but he simply couldn&rsquo;t any
      more; and crossing the gravel of the drive he lay down on the grass
      beyond. Pulling six daisies he named them carefully, Sir Lamorac, Sir
      Tristram, Sir Lancelot, Sir Palimedes, Sir Bors, Sir Gawain, and fought
      them in couples till only Sir Lamorac, whom he had selected for a
      specially stout stalk, had his head on, and even he, after three
      encounters, looked worn and waggly. A beetle was moving slowly in the
      grass, which almost wanted cutting. Every blade was a small tree, round
      whose trunk the beetle had to glide. Little Jon stretched out Sir Lamorac,
      feet foremost, and stirred the creature up. It scuttled painfully. Little
      Jon laughed, lost interest, and sighed. His heart felt empty. He turned
      over and lay on his back. There was a scent of honey from the lime trees
      in flower, and in the sky the blue was beautiful, with a few white clouds
      which looked and perhaps tasted like lemon ice. He could hear Bob playing:
      &ldquo;Way down upon de Suwannee ribber&rdquo; on his concertina, and it
      made him nice and sad. He turned over again and put his ear to the ground&mdash;Indians
      could hear things coming ever so far&mdash;but he could hear nothing&mdash;only
      the concertina! And almost instantly he did hear a grinding sound, a faint
      toot. Yes! it was a car&mdash;coming&mdash;coming! Up he jumped. Should he
      wait in the porch, or rush upstairs, and as they came in, shout: &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
      and slide slowly down the banisters, head foremost? Should he? The car
      turned in at the drive. It was too late! And he only waited, jumping up
      and down in his excitement. The car came quickly, whirred, and stopped.
      His father got out, exactly like life. He bent down and little Jon bobbed
      up&mdash;they bumped. His father said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless us! Well, old man, you are brown!&rdquo; Just as he would;
      and the sense of expectation&mdash;of something wanted&mdash;bubbled
      unextinguished in little Jon. Then, with a long, shy look he saw his
      mother, in a blue dress, with a blue motor scarf over her cap and hair,
      smiling. He jumped as high as ever he could, twined his legs behind her
      back, and hugged. He heard her gasp, and felt her hugging back. His eyes,
      very dark blue just then, looked into hers, very dark brown, till her lips
      closed on his eyebrow, and, squeezing with all his might, he heard her
      creak and laugh, and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are strong, Jon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He slid down at that, and rushed into the hall, dragging her by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was eating his jam beneath the oak tree, he noticed things about
      his mother that he had never seemed to see before, her cheeks for instance
      were creamy, there were silver threads in her dark goldy hair, her throat
      had no knob in it like Bella&rsquo;s, and she went in and out softly. He
      noticed, too, some little lines running away from the corners of her eyes,
      and a nice darkness under them. She was ever so beautiful, more beautiful
      than &ldquo;Da&rdquo; or Mademoiselle, or &ldquo;Auntie&rdquo; June or
      even &ldquo;Auntie&rdquo; Holly, to whom he had taken a fancy; even more
      beautiful than Bella, who had pink cheeks and came out too suddenly in
      places. This new beautifulness of his mother had a kind of particular
      importance, and he ate less than he had expected to.
    </p>
    <p>
      When tea was over his father wanted him to walk round the gardens. He had
      a long conversation with his father about things in general, avoiding his
      private life&mdash;Sir Lamorac, the Austrians, and the emptiness he had
      felt these last three days, now so suddenly filled up. His father told him
      of a place called Glensofantrim, where he and his mother had been; and of
      the little people who came out of the ground there when it was very quiet.
      Little Jon came to a halt, with his heels apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really believe they do, Daddy?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Jon, but I
      thought you might.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re younger than I; and they&rsquo;re fairies.&rdquo;
      Little Jon squared the dimple in his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in fairies. I never see any.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;
      said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Mum?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His father smiled his funny smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she only sees Pan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Pan?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Goaty God who skips about in wild and beautiful places.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he in Glensofantrim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mum said so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon took his heels up, and led on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I only saw Venus Anadyomene.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon reflected; Venus was in his book about the Greeks and Trojans.
      Then Anna was her Christian and Dyomene her surname?
    </p>
    <p>
      But it appeared, on inquiry, that it was one word, which meant rising from
      the foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she rise from the foam in Glensofantrim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; every day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is she like, Daddy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Mum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Then she must be...&rdquo; but he stopped at that, rushed at a
      wall, scrambled up, and promptly scrambled down again. The discovery that
      his mother was beautiful was one which he felt must absolutely be kept to
      himself. His father&rsquo;s cigar, however, took so long to smoke, that at
      last he was compelled to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see what Mum&rsquo;s brought home. Do you mind, Daddy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pitched the motive low, to absolve him from unmanliness, and was a
      little disconcerted when his father looked at him right through, heaved an
      important sigh, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, old man, you go and love her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went, with a pretence of slowness, and then rushed, to make up. He
      entered her bedroom from his own, the door being open. She was still
      kneeling before a trunk, and he stood close to her, quite still.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt up straight, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d just come and see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having given and received another hug, he mounted the window-seat, and
      tucking his legs up under him watched her unpack. He derived a pleasure
      from the operation such as he had not yet known, partly because she was
      taking out things which looked suspicious, and partly because he liked to
      look at her. She moved differently from anybody else, especially from
      Bella; she was certainly the refinedest-looking person he had ever seen.
      She finished the trunk at last, and knelt down in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you missed us, Jon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon nodded, and having thus admitted his feelings, continued to
      nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had &lsquo;Auntie&rsquo; June?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! she had a man with a cough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother&rsquo;s face changed, and looked almost angry. He added
      hastily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a poor man, Mum; he coughed awfully; I&mdash;I liked him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother put her hands behind his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like everybody, Jon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to a point,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Auntie June took me to church
      one Sunday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To church? Oh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wanted to see how it would affect me.&rdquo; &ldquo;And did it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I came over all funny, so she took me home again very quick. I
      wasn&rsquo;t sick after all. I went to bed and had hot brandy and water,
      and read The Boys of Beechwood. It was scrumptious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother bit her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! about&mdash;a long time ago&mdash;I wanted her to take me
      again, but she wouldn&rsquo;t. You and Daddy never go to church, do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear, we both of us went when we were little. Perhaps we went
      when we were too little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said little Jon, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall judge for yourself about all those things as you grow up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon replied in a calculating manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to grow up, much. I don&rsquo;t want to go to
      school.&rdquo; A sudden overwhelming desire to say something more, to say
      what he really felt, turned him red. &ldquo;I&mdash;I want to stay with
      you, and be your lover, Mum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with an instinct to improve the situation, he added quickly &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t want to go to bed to-night, either. I&rsquo;m simply tired of
      going to bed, every night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had any more nightmares?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only about one. May I leave the door open into your room to-night,
      Mum?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just a little.&rdquo; Little Jon heaved a sigh of
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you see in Glensofantrim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but beauty, darling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What exactly is beauty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What exactly is&mdash;Oh! Jon, that&rsquo;s a poser.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I see it, for instance?&rdquo; His mother got up, and sat
      beside him. &ldquo;You do, every day. The sky is beautiful, the stars, and
      moonlit nights, and then the birds, the flowers, the trees&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      all beautiful. Look out of the window&mdash;there&rsquo;s beauty for you,
      Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, that&rsquo;s the view. Is that all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All? no. The sea is wonderfully beautiful, and the waves, with
      their foam flying back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you rise from it every day, Mum?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother smiled. &ldquo;Well, we bathed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon suddenly reached out and caught her neck in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said mysteriously, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re it,
      really, and all the rest is make-believe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed, laughed, said: &ldquo;Oh! Jon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon said critically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Bella beautiful, for instance? I hardly do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella is young; that&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you look younger, Mum. If you bump against Bella she hurts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe &lsquo;Da&rsquo; was beautiful, when I come
      to think of it; and Mademoiselle&rsquo;s almost ugly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle has a very nice face.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! yes; nice. I
      love your little rays, Mum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rays?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon put his finger to the outer corner of her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Those? But they&rsquo;re a sign of age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They come when you smile.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they usen&rsquo;t to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! well, I like them. Do you love me, Mum?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do&mdash;I do love you, darling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than I thought you did?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much&mdash;much more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so do I; so that makes it even.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious that he had never in his life so given himself away, he felt a
      sudden reaction to the manliness of Sir Lamorac, Dick Needham, Huck Finn,
      and other heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I show you a thing or two?&rdquo; he said; and slipping out
      of her arms, he stood on his head. Then, fired by her obvious admiration,
      he mounted the bed, and threw himself head foremost from his feet on to
      his back, without touching anything with his hands. He did this several
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, having inspected what they had brought, he stayed up to
      dinner, sitting between them at the little round table they used when they
      were alone. He was extremely excited. His mother wore a French-grey dress,
      with creamy lace made out of little scriggly roses, round her neck, which
      was browner than the lace. He kept looking at her, till at last his father&rsquo;s
      funny smile made him suddenly attentive to his slice of pineapple. It was
      later than he had ever stayed up, when he went to bed. His mother went up
      with him, and he undressed very slowly so as to keep her there. When at
      last he had nothing on but his pyjamas, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise you won&rsquo;t go while I say my prayers!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kneeling down and plunging his face into the bed, little Jon hurried up,
      under his breath, opening one eye now and then, to see her standing
      perfectly still with a smile on her face. &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo;&mdash;so
      went his last prayer, &ldquo;which art in heaven, hallowed be thy Mum, thy
      Kingdom Mum&mdash;on Earth as it is in heaven, give us this day our daily
      Mum and forgive us our trespasses on earth as it is in heaven and trespass
      against us, for thine is the evil the power and the glory for ever and
      ever. Amum! Look out!&rdquo; He sprang, and for a long minute remained in
      her arms. Once in bed, he continued to hold her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t shut the door any more than that, will you? Are you
      going to be long, Mum?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go down and play to Daddy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! well, I shall hear you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not; you must go to sleep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can sleep any night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is just a night like any other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no&mdash;it&rsquo;s extra special.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On extra special nights one always sleeps soundest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I go to sleep, Mum, I shan&rsquo;t hear you come up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when I do, I&rsquo;ll come in and give you a kiss, then if
      you&rsquo;re awake you&rsquo;ll know, and if you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;ll
      still know you&rsquo;ve had one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon sighed, &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I suppose I
      must put up with that. Mum?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was her name that Daddy believes in? Venus Anna Diomedes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my angel! Anadyomene.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! but I like my name for you much better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is yours, Jon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon answered shyly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guinevere! it&rsquo;s out of the Round Table&mdash;I&rsquo;ve only
      just thought of it, only of course her hair was down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother&rsquo;s eyes, looking past him, seemed to float.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget to come, Mum?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you&rsquo;ll go to sleep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bargain, then.&rdquo; And little Jon screwed up his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her lips on his forehead, heard her footsteps; opened his eyes to
      see her gliding through the doorway, and, sighing, screwed them up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Time began.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some ten minutes of it he tried loyally to sleep, counting a great
      number of thistles in a row, &ldquo;Da&rsquo;s&rdquo; old recipe for
      bringing slumber. He seemed to have been hours counting. It must, he
      thought, be nearly time for her to come up now. He threw the bedclothes
      back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hot!&rdquo; he said, and his voice sounded funny in
      the darkness, like someone else&rsquo;s. Why didn&rsquo;t she come? He sat
      up. He must look! He got out of bed, went to the window and pulled the
      curtain a slice aside. It wasn&rsquo;t dark, but he couldn&rsquo;t tell
      whether because of daylight or the moon, which was very big. It had a
      funny, wicked face, as if laughing at him, and he did not want to look at
      it. Then, remembering that his mother had said moonlit nights were
      beautiful, he continued to stare out in a general way. The trees threw
      thick shadows, the lawn looked like spilt milk, and a long, long way he
      could see; oh! very far; right over the world, and it all looked different
      and swimmy. There was a lovely smell, too, in his open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I had a dove like Noah!&rsquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moony moon was round and bright, It shone and shone and made it
      light.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After that rhyme, which came into his head all at once, he became
      conscious of music, very soft-lovely! Mum playing! He bethought himself of
      a macaroon he had, laid up in his chest of drawers, and, getting it, came
      back to the window. He leaned out, now munching, now holding his jaws to
      hear the music better. &ldquo;Da&rdquo; used to say that angels played on
      harps in heaven; but it wasn&rsquo;t half so lovely as Mum playing in the
      moony night, with him eating a macaroon. A cockchafer buzzed by, a moth
      flew in his face, the music stopped, and little Jon drew his head in. She
      must be coming! He didn&rsquo;t want to be found awake. He got back into
      bed and pulled the clothes nearly over his head; but he had left a streak
      of moonlight coming in. It fell across the floor, near the foot of the
      bed, and he watched it moving ever so slowly towards him, as if it were
      alive. The music began again, but he could only just hear it now; sleepy
      music, pretty&mdash;sleepy&mdash;music&mdash;sleepy&mdash;slee.....
    </p>
    <p>
      And time slipped by, the music rose, fell, ceased; the moonbeam crept
      towards his face. Little Jon turned in his sleep till he lay on his back,
      with one brown fist still grasping the bedclothes. The corners of his eyes
      twitched&mdash;he had begun to dream. He dreamed he was drinking milk out
      of a pan that was the moon, opposite a great black cat which watched him
      with a funny smile like his father&rsquo;s. He heard it whisper: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      drink too much!&rdquo; It was the cat&rsquo;s milk, of course, and he put
      out his hand amicably to stroke the creature; but it was no longer there;
      the pan had become a bed, in which he was lying, and when he tried to get
      out he couldn&rsquo;t find the edge; he couldn&rsquo;t find it&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
      get out! It was dreadful!
    </p>
    <p>
      He whimpered in his sleep. The bed had begun to go round too; it was
      outside him and inside him; going round and round, and getting fiery, and
      Mother Lee out of Cast up by the Sea was stirring it! Oh! so horrible she
      looked! Faster and faster!&mdash;till he and the bed and Mother Lee and
      the moon and the cat were all one wheel going round and round and up and
      up&mdash;awful&mdash;awful&mdash;awful!
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrieked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice saying: &ldquo;Darling, darling!&rdquo; got through the wheel, and
      he awoke, standing on his bed, with his eyes wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was his mother, with her hair like Guinevere&rsquo;s, and, clutching
      her, he buried his face in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, treasure. You&rsquo;re awake now. There!
      There! It&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But little Jon continued to say: &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice went on, velvety in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the moonlight, sweetheart, coming on your face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon burbled into her nightgown
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said it was beautiful. Oh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to sleep in, Jon. Who let it in? Did you draw the curtains?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to see the time; I&mdash;I looked out, I&mdash;I heard you
      playing, Mum; I&mdash;I ate my macaroon.&rdquo; But he was growing slowly
      comforted; and the instinct to excuse his fear revived within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Lee went round in me and got all fiery,&rdquo; he mumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jon, what can you expect if you eat macaroons after you&rsquo;ve
      gone to bed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one, Mum; it made the music ever so more beautiful. I was
      waiting for you&mdash;I nearly thought it was to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My ducky, it&rsquo;s only just eleven now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon was silent, rubbing his nose on her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mum, is Daddy in your room?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish, my precious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Half himself again, little Jon drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look different, Mum; ever so younger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my hair, darling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon laid hold of it, thick, dark gold, with a few silver threads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I like you best of all like this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking her hand, he had begun dragging her towards the door. He shut it as
      they passed, with a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which side of the bed do you like, Mum?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The left side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Wasting no time, giving her no chance to change her mind, little Jon got
      into the bed, which seemed much softer than his own. He heaved another
      sigh, screwed his head into the pillow and lay examining the battle of
      chariots and swords and spears which always went on outside blankets,
      where the little hairs stood up against the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t anything, really, was it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      From before her glass his mother answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but the moon and your imagination heated up. You mustn&rsquo;t
      get so excited, Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, still not quite in possession of his nerves, little Jon answered
      boastfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t afraid, really, of course!&rdquo; And again he lay
      watching the spears and chariots. It all seemed very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Mum, do hurry up!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling, I have to plait my hair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! not to-night. You&rsquo;ll only have to unplait it again
      to-morrow. I&rsquo;m sleepy now; if you don&rsquo;t come, I shan&rsquo;t
      be sleepy soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother stood up white and flowey before the winged mirror: he could
      see three of her, with her neck turned and her hair bright under the
      light, and her dark eyes smiling. It was unnecessary, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do come, Mum; I&rsquo;m waiting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my love, I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jon closed his eyes. Everything was turning out most satisfactory,
      only she must hurry up! He felt the bed shake, she was getting in. And,
      still with his eyes closed, he said sleepily: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her voice say something, felt her lips touching his nose, and,
      snuggling up beside her who lay awake and loved him with her thoughts, he
      fell into the dreamless sleep, which rounded off his past.

    <h2>
      I.&mdash;ENCOUNTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soames Forsyte emerged from the Knightsbridge Hotel, where he was staying,
      in the afternoon of the 12th of May, 1920, with the intention of visiting
      a collection of pictures in a Gallery off Cork Street, and looking into
      the Future. He walked. Since the War he never took a cab if he could help
      it. Their drivers were, in his view, an uncivil lot, though now that the
      War was over and supply beginning to exceed demand again, getting more
      civil in accordance with the custom of human nature. Still, he had not
      forgiven them, deeply identifying them with gloomy memories, and now,
      dimly, like all members, of their class, with revolution. The considerable
      anxiety he had passed through during the War, and the more considerable
      anxiety he had since undergone in the Peace, had produced psychological
      consequences in a tenacious nature. He had, mentally, so frequently
      experienced ruin, that he had ceased to believe in its material
      probability. Paying away four thousand a year in income and super tax, one
      could not very well be worse off! A fortune of a quarter of a million,
      encumbered only by a wife and one daughter, and very diversely invested,
      afforded substantial guarantee even against that &ldquo;wildcat notion&rdquo;
      a levy on capital. And as to confiscation of war profits, he was entirely
      in favour of it, for he had none, and &ldquo;serve the beggars right!&rdquo;
      The price of pictures, moreover, had, if anything, gone up, and he had
      done better with his collection since the War began than ever before.
      Air-raids, also, had acted beneficially on a spirit congenitally cautious,
      and hardened a character already dogged. To be in danger of being entirely
      dispersed inclined one to be less apprehensive of the more partial
      dispersions involved in levies and taxation, while the habit of condemning
      the impudence of the Germans had led naturally to condemning that of
      Labour, if not openly at least in the sanctuary of his soul.

      He walked. There was, moreover, time to spare, for Fleur was to meet him
      at the Gallery at four o&rsquo;clock, and it was as yet but half-past two.
      It was good for him to walk&mdash;his liver was a little constricted, and
      his nerves rather on edge. His wife was always out when she was in Town,
      and his daughter would flibberty-gibbet all over the place like most young
      women since the War. Still, he must be thankful that she had been too
      young to do anything in that War itself. Not, of course, that he had not
      supported the War from its inception, with all his soul, but between that
      and supporting it with the bodies of his wife and daughter, there had been
      a gap fixed by something old-fashioned within him which abhorred emotional
      extravagance. He had, for instance, strongly objected to Annette, so
      attractive, and in 1914 only thirty-four, going to her native France, her
      &ldquo;chere patrie&rdquo; as, under the stimulus of war, she had begun to
      call it, to nurse her &ldquo;braves poilus,&rdquo; forsooth! Ruining her
      health and her looks! As if she were really a nurse! He had put a stopper
      on it. Let her do needlework for them at home, or knit! She had not gone,
      therefore, and had never been quite the same woman since. A bad tendency
      of hers to mock at him, not openly, but in continual little ways, had
      grown. As for Fleur, the War had resolved the vexed problem whether or not
      she should go to school. She was better away from her mother in her war
      mood, from the chance of air-raids, and the impetus to do extravagant
      things; so he had placed her in a seminary as far West as had seemed to
      him compatible with excellence, and had missed her horribly. Fleur! He had
      never regretted the somewhat outlandish name by which at her birth he had
      decided so suddenly to call her&mdash;marked concession though it had been
      to the French. Fleur! A pretty name&mdash;a pretty child! But restless&mdash;too
      restless; and wilful! Knowing her power too over her father! Soames often
      reflected on the mistake it was to dote on his daughter. To get old and
      dote! Sixty-five! He was getting on; but he didn&rsquo;t feel it, for,
      fortunately perhaps, considering Annette&rsquo;s youth and good looks, his
      second marriage had turned out a cool affair. He had known but one real
      passion in his life&mdash;for that first wife of his&mdash;Irene. Yes, and
      that fellow, his cousin Jolyon, who had gone off with her, was looking
      very shaky, they said. No wonder, at seventy-two, after twenty years of a
      third marriage!
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames paused a moment in his march to lean over the railings of the Row.
      A suitable spot for reminiscence, half-way between that house in Park Lane
      which had seen his birth and his parents&rsquo; deaths, and the little
      house in Montpellier Square where thirty-five years ago he had enjoyed his
      first edition of matrimony. Now, after twenty years of his second edition,
      that old tragedy seemed to him like a previous existence&mdash;which had
      ended when Fleur was born in place of the son he had hoped for. For many
      years he had ceased regretting, even vaguely, the son who had not been
      born; Fleur filled the bill in his heart. After all, she bore his name;
      and he was not looking forward at all to the time when she would change
      it. Indeed, if he ever thought of such a calamity, it was seasoned by the
      vague feeling that he could make her rich enough to purchase perhaps and
      extinguish the name of the fellow who married her&mdash;why not, since, as
      it seemed, women were equal to men nowadays? And Soames, secretly
      convinced that they were not, passed his curved hand over his face
      vigorously, till it reached the comfort of his chin. Thanks to abstemious
      habits, he had not grown fat and gabby; his nose was pale and thin, his
      grey moustache close-clipped, his eyesight unimpaired. A slight stoop
      closened and corrected the expansion given to his face by the heightening
      of his forehead in the recession of his grey hair. Little change had Time
      wrought in the &ldquo;warmest&rdquo; of the young Forsytes, as the last of
      the old Forsytes&mdash;Timothy-now in his hundred and first year, would
      have phrased it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shade from the plane-trees fell on his neat Homburg hat; he had given
      up top hats&mdash;it was no use attracting attention to wealth in days
      like these. Plane-trees! His thoughts travelled sharply to Madrid&mdash;the
      Easter before the War, when, having to make up his mind about that Goya
      picture, he had taken a voyage of discovery to study the painter on his
      spot. The fellow had impressed him&mdash;great range, real genius! Highly
      as the chap ranked, he would rank even higher before they had finished
      with him. The second Goya craze would be greater even than the first; oh,
      yes! And he had bought. On that visit he had&mdash;as never before&mdash;commissioned
      a copy of a fresco painting called &ldquo;La Vendimia,&rdquo; wherein was
      the figure of a girl with an arm akimbo, who had reminded him of his
      daughter. He had it now in the Gallery at Mapledurham, and rather poor it
      was&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t copy Goya. He would still look at it,
      however, if his daughter were not there, for the sake of something
      irresistibly reminiscent in the light, erect balance of the figure, the
      width between the arching eyebrows, the eager dreaming of the dark eyes.
      Curious that Fleur should have dark eyes, when his own were grey&mdash;no
      pure Forsyte had brown eyes&mdash;and her mother&rsquo;s blue! But of
      course her grandmother Lamotte&rsquo;s eyes were dark as treacle!
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to walk on again toward Hyde Park Corner. No greater change in
      all England than in the Row! Born almost within hail of it, he could
      remember it from 1860 on. Brought there as a child between the crinolines
      to stare at tight-trousered dandies in whiskers, riding with a cavalry
      seat; to watch the doffing of curly-brimmed and white top hats; the
      leisurely air of it all, and the little bow-legged man in a long red
      waistcoat who used to come among the fashion with dogs on several strings,
      and try to sell one to his mother: King Charles spaniels, Italian
      greyhounds, affectionate to her crinoline&mdash;you never saw them now.
      You saw no quality of any sort, indeed, just working people sitting in
      dull rows with nothing to stare at but a few young bouncing females in pot
      hats, riding astride, or desultory Colonials charging up and down on
      dismal-looking hacks; with, here and there, little girls on ponies, or old
      gentlemen jogging their livers, or an orderly trying a great galumphing
      cavalry horse; no thoroughbreds, no grooms, no bowing, no scraping, no
      gossip&mdash;nothing; only the trees the same&mdash;the trees indifferent
      to the generations and declensions of mankind. A democratic England&mdash;dishevelled,
      hurried, noisy, and seemingly without an apex. And that something
      fastidious in the soul of Soames turned over within him. Gone forever, the
      close borough of rank and polish! Wealth there was&mdash;oh, yes! wealth&mdash;he
      himself was a richer man than his father had ever been; but manners,
      flavour, quality, all gone, engulfed in one vast, ugly, shoulder-rubbing,
      petrol-smelling Cheerio. Little half-beaten pockets of gentility and caste
      lurking here and there, dispersed and chetif, as Annette would say; but
      nothing ever again firm and coherent to look up to. And into this new
      hurly-burly of bad manners and loose morals his daughter&mdash;flower of
      his life&mdash;was flung! And when those Labour chaps got power&mdash;if
      they ever did&mdash;the worst was yet to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed out under the archway, at last no longer&mdash;thank goodness!&mdash;disfigured
      by the gungrey of its search-light. &lsquo;They&rsquo;d better put a
      search-light on to where they&rsquo;re all going,&rsquo; he thought,
      &lsquo;and light up their precious democracy!&rsquo; And he directed his
      steps along the Club fronts of Piccadilly. George Forsyte, of course,
      would be sitting in the bay window of the Iseeum. The chap was so big now
      that he was there nearly all his time, like some immovable, sardonic,
      humorous eye noting the decline of men and things. And Soames hurried,
      ever constitutionally uneasy beneath his cousin&rsquo;s glance. George,
      who, as he had heard, had written a letter signed &ldquo;Patriot&rdquo; in
      the middle of the War, complaining of the Government&rsquo;s hysteria in
      docking the oats of race-horses. Yes, there he was, tall, ponderous, neat,
      clean-shaven, with his smooth hair, hardly thinned, smelling, no doubt, of
      the best hair-wash, and a pink paper in his hand. Well, he didn&rsquo;t
      change! And for perhaps the first time in his life Soames felt a kind of
      sympathy tapping in his waistcoat for that sardonic kinsman. With his
      weight, his perfectly parted hair, and bull-like gaze, he was a guarantee
      that the old order would take some shifting yet. He saw George move the
      pink paper as if inviting him to ascend&mdash;the chap must want to ask
      something about his property. It was still under Soames&rsquo; control;
      for in the adoption of a sleeping partnership at that painful period
      twenty years back when he had divorced Irene, Soames had found himself
      almost insensibly retaining control of all purely Forsyte affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hesitating for just a moment, he nodded and went in. Since the death of
      his brother-in-law Montague Dartie, in Paris, which no one had quite known
      what to make of, except that it was certainly not suicide&mdash;the Iseeum
      Club had seemed more respectable to Soames. George, too, he knew, had sown
      the last of his wild oats, and was committed definitely to the joys of the
      table, eating only of the very best so as to keep his weight down, and
      owning, as he said, &ldquo;just one or two old screws to give me an
      interest in life.&rdquo; He joined his cousin, therefore, in the bay
      window without the embarrassing sense of indiscretion he had been used to
      feel up there. George put out a well-kept hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen you since the War,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
      your wife?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Soames coldly, &ldquo;well enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hidden jest curved, for a moment, George&rsquo;s fleshy face, and
      gloated from his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Belgian chap, Profond,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a member here
      now. He&rsquo;s a rum customer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite!&rdquo; muttered Soames. &ldquo;What did you want to see me
      about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Timothy; he might go off the hooks at any moment. I suppose he&rsquo;s
      made his Will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you or somebody ought to give him a look up&mdash;last of the
      old lot; he&rsquo;s a hundred, you know. They say he&rsquo;s like a mummy.
      Where are you goin&rsquo; to put him? He ought to have a pyramid by
      rights.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shook his head. &ldquo;Highgate, the family vault.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose the old girls would miss him, if he was anywhere
      else. They say he still takes an interest in food. He might last on, you
      know. Don&rsquo;t we get anything for the old Forsytes? Ten of them&mdash;average
      age eighty-eight&mdash;I worked it out. That ought to be equal to
      triplets.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;I must be getting on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You unsociable devil,&rsquo; George&rsquo;s eyes seemed to answer.
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all: Look him up in his mausoleum&mdash;the old
      chap might want to prophesy.&rdquo; The grin died on the rich curves of
      his face, and he added: &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you attorneys invented a way
      yet of dodging this damned income tax? It hits the fixed inherited income
      like the very deuce. I used to have two thousand five hundred a year; now
      I&rsquo;ve got a beggarly fifteen hundred, and the price of living
      doubled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured Soames, &ldquo;the turf&rsquo;s in danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Over George&rsquo;s face moved a gleam of sardonic self-defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they brought me up to do nothing, and
      here I am in the sear and yellow, getting poorer every day. These Labour
      chaps mean to have the lot before they&rsquo;ve done. What are you going
      to do for a living when it comes? I shall work a six-hour day teaching
      politicians how to see a joke. Take my tip, Soames; go into Parliament,
      make sure of your four hundred&mdash;and employ me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as Soames retired, he resumed his seat in the bay window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames moved along Piccadilly deep in reflections excited by his cousin&rsquo;s
      words. He himself had always been a worker and a saver, George always a
      drone and a spender; and yet, if confiscation once began, it was he&mdash;the
      worker and the saver&mdash;who would be looted! That was the negation of
      all virtue, the overturning of all Forsyte principles. Could civilization
      be built on any other? He did not think so. Well, they wouldn&rsquo;t
      confiscate his pictures, for they wouldn&rsquo;t know their worth. But
      what would they be worth, if these maniacs once began to milk capital? A
      drug on the market. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care about myself,&rsquo; he
      thought; &lsquo;I could live on five hundred a year, and never know the
      difference, at my age.&rsquo; But Fleur! This fortune, so widely invested,
      these treasures so carefully chosen and amassed, were all for&mdash;her.
      And if it should turn out that he couldn&rsquo;t give or leave them to her&mdash;well,
      life had no meaning, and what was the use of going in to look at this
      crazy, futuristic stuff with the view of seeing whether it had any future?
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the Gallery off Cork Street, however, he paid his shilling,
      picked up a catalogue, and entered. Some ten persons were prowling round.
      Soames took steps and came on what looked to him like a lamp-post bent by
      collision with a motor omnibus. It was advanced some three paces from the
      wall, and was described in his catalogue as &ldquo;Jupiter.&rdquo; He
      examined it with curiosity, having recently turned some of his attention
      to sculpture. &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s Jupiter,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;I
      wonder what Juno&rsquo;s like.&rsquo; And suddenly he saw her, opposite.
      She appeared to him like nothing so much as a pump with two handles,
      lightly clad in snow. He was still gazing at her, when two of the prowlers
      halted on his left. &ldquo;Epatant!&rdquo; he heard one say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jargon!&rdquo; growled Soames to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other&rsquo;s boyish voice replied
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missed it, old bean; he&rsquo;s pulling your leg. When Jove and
      Juno created he them, he was saying: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see how much these
      fools will swallow.&rsquo; And they&rsquo;ve lapped up the lot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You young duffer! Vospovitch is an innovator. Don&rsquo;t you see
      that he&rsquo;s brought satire into sculpture? The future of plastic art,
      of music, painting, and even architecture, has set in satiric. It was
      bound to. People are tired&mdash;the bottom&rsquo;s tumbled out of
      sentiment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m quite equal to taking a little interest in beauty.
      I was through the War. You&rsquo;ve dropped your handkerchief, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames saw a handkerchief held out in front of him. He took it with some
      natural suspicion, and approached it to his nose. It had the right scent&mdash;of
      distant Eau de Cologne&mdash;and his initials in a corner. Slightly
      reassured, he raised his eyes to the young man&rsquo;s face. It had rather
      fawn-like ears, a laughing mouth, with half a toothbrush growing out of it
      on each side, and small lively eyes, above a normally dressed appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said; and moved by a sort of irritation,
      added: &ldquo;Glad to hear you like beauty; that&rsquo;s rare, nowadays.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dote on it,&rdquo; said the young man; &ldquo;but you and I are
      the last of the old guard, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really care for pictures,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
      my card. I can show you some quite good ones any Sunday, if you&rsquo;re
      down the river and care to look in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully nice of you, sir. I&rsquo;ll drop in like a bird. My name&rsquo;s
      Mont-Michael.&rdquo; And he took off his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, already regretting his impulse, raised his own slightly in
      response, with a downward look at the young man&rsquo;s companion, who had
      a purple tie, dreadful little sluglike whiskers, and a scornful look&mdash;as
      if he were a poet!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first indiscretion he had committed for so long that he went
      and sat down in an alcove. What had possessed him to give his card to a
      rackety young fellow, who went about with a thing like that? And Fleur,
      always at the back of his thoughts, started out like a filigree figure
      from a clock when the hour strikes. On the screen opposite the alcove was
      a large canvas with a great many square tomato-coloured blobs on it, and
      nothing else, so far as Soames could see from where he sat. He looked at
      his catalogue: &ldquo;No. 32 &lsquo;The Future Town&rsquo;&mdash;Paul
      Post.&rdquo; &lsquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s satiric too,&rsquo; he thought.
      &lsquo;What a thing!&rsquo; But his second impulse was more cautious. It
      did not do to condemn hurriedly. There had been those stripey, streaky
      creations of Monet&rsquo;s, which had turned out such trumps; and then the
      stippled school; and Gauguin. Why, even since the Post-Impressionists
      there had been one or two painters not to be sneezed at. During the
      thirty-eight years of his connoisseur&rsquo;s life, indeed, he had marked
      so many &ldquo;movements,&rdquo; seen the tides of taste and technique so
      ebb and flow, that there was really no telling anything except that there
      was money to be made out of every change of fashion. This too might quite
      well be a case where one must subdue primordial instinct, or lose the
      market. He got up and stood before the picture, trying hard to see it with
      the eyes of other people. Above the tomato blobs was what he took to be a
      sunset, till some one passing said: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the airplanes
      wonderfully, don&rsquo;t you think!&rdquo; Below the tomato blobs was a
      band of white with vertical black stripes, to which he could assign no
      meaning whatever, till some one else came by, murmuring: &ldquo;What
      expression he gets with his foreground!&rdquo; Expression? Of what? Soames
      went back to his seat. The thing was &ldquo;rich,&rdquo; as his father
      would have said, and he wouldn&rsquo;t give a damn for it. Expression! Ah!
      they were all Expressionists now, he had heard, on the Continent. So it
      was coming here too, was it? He remembered the first wave of influenza in
      1887&mdash;or &lsquo;8&mdash;hatched in China, so they said. He wondered
      where this&mdash;this Expressionism had been hatched. The thing was a
      regular disease!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had become conscious of a woman and a youth standing between him and
      the &ldquo;Future Town.&rdquo; Their backs were turned; but very suddenly
      Soames put his catalogue before his face, and drawing his hat forward,
      gazed through the slit between. No mistaking that back, elegant as ever
      though the hair above had gone grey. Irene! His divorced wife&mdash;Irene!
      And this, no doubt, was&mdash;her son&mdash;by that fellow Jolyon Forsyte&mdash;their
      boy, six months older than his own girl! And mumbling over in his mind the
      bitter days of his divorce, he rose to get out of sight, but quickly sat
      down again. She had turned her head to speak to her boy; her profile was
      still so youthful that it made her grey hair seem powdery, as if
      fancy-dressed; and her lips were smiling as Soames, first possessor of
      them, had never seen them smile. Grudgingly he admitted her still
      beautiful and in figure almost as young as ever. And how that boy smiled
      back at her! Emotion squeezed Soames&rsquo; heart. The sight infringed his
      sense of justice. He grudged her that boy&rsquo;s smile&mdash;it went
      beyond what Fleur gave him, and it was undeserved. Their son might have
      been his son; Fleur might have been her daughter, if she had kept
      straight! He lowered his catalogue. If she saw him, all the better! A
      reminder of her conduct in the presence of her son, who probably knew
      nothing of it, would be a salutary touch from the finger of that Nemesis
      which surely must soon or late visit her! Then, half-conscious that such a
      thought was extravagant for a Forsyte of his age, Soames took out his
      watch. Past four! Fleur was late. She had gone to his niece Imogen
      Cardigan&rsquo;s, and there they would keep her smoking cigarettes and
      gossiping, and that. He heard the boy laugh, and say eagerly: &ldquo;I
      say, Mum, is this by one of Auntie June&rsquo;s lame ducks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul Post&mdash;I believe it is, darling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The word produced a little shock in Soames; he had never heard her use it.
      And then she saw him. His eyes must have had in them something of George
      Forsyte&rsquo;s sardonic look; for her gloved hand crisped the folds of
      her frock, her eyebrows rose, her face went stony. She moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a caution,&rdquo; said the boy, catching her arm again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stared after them. That boy was good-looking, with a Forsyte chin,
      and eyes deep-grey, deep in; but with something sunny, like a glass of old
      sherry spilled over him; his smile perhaps, his hair. Better than they
      deserved&mdash;those two! They passed from his view into the next room,
      and Soames continued to regard the Future Town, but saw it not. A little
      smile snarled up his lips. He was despising the vehemence of his own
      feelings after all these years. Ghosts! And yet as one grew old&mdash;was
      there anything but what was ghost-like left? Yes, there was Fleur! He
      fixed his eyes on the entrance. She was due; but she would keep him
      waiting, of course! And suddenly he became aware of a sort of human breeze&mdash;a
      short, slight form clad in a sea-green djibbah with a metal belt and a
      fillet binding unruly red-gold hair all streaked with grey. She was
      talking to the Gallery attendants, and something familiar riveted his gaze&mdash;in
      her eyes, her chin, her hair, her spirit&mdash;something which suggested a
      thin Skye terrier just before its dinner. Surely June Forsyte! His cousin
      June&mdash;and coming straight to his recess! She sat down beside him,
      deep in thought, took out a tablet, and made a pencil note. Soames sat
      unmoving. A confounded thing, cousinship! &ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo; he
      heard her murmur; then, as if resenting the presence of an overhearing
      stranger, she looked at him. The worst had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soames!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames turned his head a very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen you for
      twenty years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Whatever made you come here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sins,&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;What stuff!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff? Oh, yes&mdash;of course; it hasn&rsquo;t arrived yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It never will,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;it must be making a dead
      loss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my Gallery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames sniffed from sheer surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours? What on earth makes you run a show like this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t treat Art as if it were grocery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames pointed to the Future Town. &ldquo;Look at that! Who&rsquo;s going
      to live in a town like that, or with it on his walls?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June contemplated the picture for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a vision,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence, then June rose. &lsquo;Crazylooking creature!&rsquo; he
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find your young
      stepbrother here with a woman I used to know. If you take my advice, you&rsquo;ll
      close this exhibition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June looked back at him. &ldquo;Oh! You Forsyte!&rdquo; she said, and
      moved on. About her light, fly-away figure, passing so suddenly away, was
      a look of dangerous decisions. Forsyte! Of course, he was a Forsyte! And
      so was she! But from the time when, as a mere girl, she brought Bosinney
      into his life to wreck it, he had never hit it off with June and never
      would! And here she was, unmarried to this day, owning a Gallery!... And
      suddenly it came to Soames how little he knew now of his own family. The
      old aunts at Timothy&rsquo;s had been dead so many years; there was no
      clearing-house for news. What had they all done in the War? Young Roger&rsquo;s
      boy had been wounded, St. John Hayman&rsquo;s second son killed; young
      Nicholas&rsquo; eldest had got an O. B. E., or whatever they gave them.
      They had all joined up somehow, he believed. That boy of Jolyon&rsquo;s
      and Irene&rsquo;s, he supposed, had been too young; his own generation, of
      course, too old, though Giles Hayman had driven a car for the Red Cross&mdash;and
      Jesse Hayman been a special constable&mdash;those &ldquo;Dromios&rdquo;
      had always been of a sporting type! As for himself, he had given a motor
      ambulance, read the papers till he was sick of them, passed through much
      anxiety, bought no clothes, lost seven pounds in weight; he didn&rsquo;t
      know what more he could have done at his age. Indeed, thinking it over, it
      struck him that he and his family had taken this war very differently to
      that affair with the Boers, which had been supposed to tax all the
      resources of the Empire. In that old war, of course, his nephew Val Dartie
      had been wounded, that fellow Jolyon&rsquo;s first son had died of
      enteric, &ldquo;the Dromios&rdquo; had gone out on horses, and June had
      been a nurse; but all that had seemed in the nature of a portent, while in
      this war everybody had done &ldquo;their bit,&rdquo; so far as he could
      make out, as a matter of course. It seemed to show the growth of something
      or other&mdash;or perhaps the decline of something else. Had the Forsytes
      become less individual, or more Imperial, or less provincial? Or was it
      simply that one hated Germans?... Why didn&rsquo;t Fleur come, so that he
      could get away? He saw those three return together from the other room and
      pass back along the far side of the screen. The boy was standing before
      the Juno now. And, suddenly, on the other side of her, Soames saw&mdash;his
      daughter, with eyebrows raised, as well they might be. He could see her
      eyes glint sideways at the boy, and the boy look back at her. Then Irene
      slipped her hand through his arm, and drew him on. Soames saw him glancing
      round, and Fleur looking after them as the three went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice said cheerfully: &ldquo;Bit thick, isn&rsquo;t it, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man who had handed him his handkerchief was again passing.
      Soames nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re coming to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s all right, sir,&rdquo; answered the young man
      cheerfully; &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur&rsquo;s voice said: &ldquo;Hallo, Father! Here you are!&rdquo;
      precisely as if he had been keeping her waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, snatching off his hat, passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Soames, looking her up and down, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
      a punctual sort of young woman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This treasured possession of his life was of medium height and colour,
      with short, dark chestnut hair; her wide-apart brown eyes were set in
      whites so clear that they glinted when they moved, and yet in repose were
      almost dreamy under very white, black-lashed lids, held over them in a
      sort of suspense. She had a charming profile, and nothing of her father in
      her face save a decided chin. Aware that his expression was softening as
      he looked at her, Soames frowned to preserve the unemotionalism proper to
      a Forsyte. He knew she was only too inclined to take advantage of his
      weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slipping her hand under his arm, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He picked up my handkerchief. We talked about the pictures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to buy that, Father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Soames grimly; &ldquo;nor that Juno you&rsquo;ve
      been looking at.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur dragged at his arm. &ldquo;Oh! Let&rsquo;s go! It&rsquo;s a ghastly
      show.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the doorway they passed the young man called Mont and his partner. But
      Soames had hung out a board marked &ldquo;Trespassers will be prosecuted,&rdquo;
      and he barely acknowledged the young fellow&rsquo;s salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said in the street, &ldquo;whom did you meet at
      Imogen&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Winifred, and that Monsieur Profond.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; muttered Soames; &ldquo;that chap! What does your aunt
      see in him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He looks pretty deep&mdash;mother says she
      likes him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Val and his wife were there, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;I thought they were back in South
      Africa.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! They&rsquo;ve sold their farm. Cousin Val is going to train
      race-horses on the Sussex Downs. They&rsquo;ve got a jolly old
      manor-house; they asked me down there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames coughed: the news was distasteful to him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his
      wife like now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very quiet, but nice, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames coughed again. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a rackety chap, your Cousin Val.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, Father; they&rsquo;re awfully devoted. I promised to go&mdash;Saturday
      to Wednesday next.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Training race-horses!&rdquo; said Soames. It was extravagant, but
      not the reason for his distaste. Why the deuce couldn&rsquo;t his nephew
      have stayed out in South Africa? His own divorce had been bad enough,
      without his nephew&rsquo;s marriage to the daughter of the co-respondent;
      a half-sister too of June, and of that boy whom Fleur had just been
      looking at from under the pump-handle. If he didn&rsquo;t look out, she
      would come to know all about that old disgrace! Unpleasant things! They
      were round him this afternoon like a swarm of bees!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see the race-horses,&rdquo; murmured Fleur; &ldquo;and
      they&rsquo;ve promised I shall ride. Cousin Val can&rsquo;t walk much, you
      know; but he can ride perfectly. He&rsquo;s going to show me their
      gallops.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Racing!&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity the War didn&rsquo;t
      knock that on the head. He&rsquo;s taking after his father, I&rsquo;m
      afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about his father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Soames, grimly. &ldquo;He took an interest in
      horses and broke his neck in Paris, walking down-stairs. Good riddance for
      your aunt.&rdquo; He frowned, recollecting the inquiry into those stairs
      which he had attended in Paris six years ago, because Montague Dartie
      could not attend it himself&mdash;perfectly normal stairs in a house where
      they played baccarat. Either his winnings or the way he had celebrated
      them had gone to his brother-in-law&rsquo;s head. The French procedure had
      been very loose; he had had a lot of trouble with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sound from Fleur distracted his attention. &ldquo;Look! The people who
      were in the Gallery with us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What people?&rdquo; muttered Soames, who knew perfectly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that woman&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into this pastry-cook&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Soames abruptly,
      and tightening his grip on her arm he turned into a confectioner&rsquo;s.
      It was&mdash;for him&mdash;a surprising thing to do, and he said rather
      anxiously: &ldquo;What will you have?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t want anything. I had a cocktail and a tremendous
      lunch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have something now we&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; muttered
      Soames, keeping hold of her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two teas,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and two of those nougat things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But no sooner was his body seated than his soul sprang up. Those three&mdash;those
      three were coming in! He heard Irene say something to her boy, and his
      answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, Mum; this place is all right. My stunt.&rdquo; And the
      three sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, most awkward of his existence, crowded with ghosts and
      shadows from his past, in presence of the only two women he had ever loved&mdash;his
      divorced wife and his daughter by her successor&mdash;Soames was not so
      much afraid of them as of his cousin June. She might make a scene&mdash;she
      might introduce those two children&mdash;she was capable of anything. He
      bit too hastily at the nougat, and it stuck to his plate. Working at it
      with his finger, he glanced at Fleur. She was masticating dreamily, but
      her eyes were on the boy. The Forsyte in him said: &ldquo;Think, feel, and
      you&rsquo;re done for!&rdquo; And he wiggled his finger desperately.
      Plate! Did Jolyon wear a plate? Did that woman wear a plate? Time had been
      when he had seen her wearing nothing! That was something, anyway, which
      had never been stolen from him. And she knew it, though she might sit
      there calm and self-possessed, as if she had never been his wife. An acid
      humour stirred in his Forsyte blood; a subtle pain divided by hair&rsquo;s
      breadth from pleasure. If only June did not suddenly bring her hornets
      about his ears! The boy was talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Auntie June&rdquo;&mdash;so he called his half-sister
      &ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; did he?&mdash;well, she must be fifty, if she was a
      day!&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s jolly good of you to encourage them. Only&mdash;hang
      it all!&rdquo; Soames stole a glance. Irene&rsquo;s startled eyes were
      bent watchfully on her boy. She&mdash;she had these devotions&mdash;for
      Bosinney&mdash;for that boy&rsquo;s father&mdash;for this boy! He touched
      Fleur&rsquo;s arm, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you had enough?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more, Father, please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She would be sick! He went to the counter to pay. When he turned round
      again he saw Fleur standing near the door, holding a handkerchief which
      the boy had evidently just handed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F. F.,&rdquo; he heard her say. &ldquo;Fleur Forsyte&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      mine all right. Thank you ever so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Good God! She had caught the trick from what he&rsquo;d told her in the
      Gallery&mdash;monkey!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forsyte? Why&mdash;that&rsquo;s my name too. Perhaps we&rsquo;re
      cousins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really! We must be. There aren&rsquo;t any others. I live at
      Mapledurham; where do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robin Hill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Question and answer had been so rapid that all was over before he could
      lift a finger. He saw Irene&rsquo;s face alive with startled feeling, gave
      the slightest shake of his head, and slipped his arm through Fleur&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear, Father? Isn&rsquo;t it queer&mdash;our name&rsquo;s
      the same. Are we cousins?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Forsyte? Distant,
      perhaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Jolyon, sir. Jon, for short.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Ah!&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;Yes. Distant. How are you? Very
      good of you. Good-bye!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks awfully,&rdquo; Fleur was saying. &ldquo;Au revoir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Au revoir!&rdquo; he heard the boy reply.
    </p>

    <h2>
      II.&mdash;FINE FLEUR FORSYTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emerging from the &ldquo;pastry-cook&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Soames&rsquo; first
      impulse was to vent his nerves by saying to his daughter: &lsquo;Dropping
      your hand-kerchief!&rsquo; to which her reply might well be: &lsquo;I
      picked that up from you!&rsquo; His second impulse therefore was to let
      sleeping dogs lie. But she would surely question him. He gave her a
      sidelong look, and found she was giving him the same. She said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you like those cousins, Father?&rdquo; Soames
      lifted the corner of his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you think that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cela se voit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That sees itself!&rsquo; What a way of putting it! After twenty
      years of a French wife Soames had still little sympathy with her language;
      a theatrical affair and connected in his mind with all the refinements of
      domestic irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know them; and you didn&rsquo;t make a sign. I saw them
      looking at you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen the boy in my life,&rdquo; replied Soames
      with perfect truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but you&rsquo;ve seen the others, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames gave her another look. What had she picked up? Had her Aunt
      Winifred, or Imogen, or Val Dartie and his wife, been talking? Every
      breath of the old scandal had been carefully kept from her at home, and
      Winifred warned many times that he wouldn&rsquo;t have a whisper of it
      reach her for the world. So far as she ought to know, he had never been
      married before. But her dark eyes, whose southern glint and clearness
      often almost frightened him, met his with perfect innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your grandfather and his brother had a
      quarrel. The two families don&rsquo;t know each other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How romantic!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, what does she mean by that?&rsquo; he thought. The word was to
      him extravagant and dangerous&mdash;it was as if she had said: &ldquo;How
      jolly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll continue not to know each, other,&rdquo; he
      added, but instantly regretted the challenge in those words. Fleur was
      smiling. In this age, when young people prided themselves on going their
      own ways and paying no attention to any sort of decent prejudice, he had
      said the very thing to excite her wilfulness. Then, recollecting the
      expression on Irene&rsquo;s face, he breathed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a quarrel?&rdquo; he heard Fleur say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a house. It&rsquo;s ancient history for you. Your grandfather
      died the day you were born. He was ninety.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ninety? Are there many Forsytes besides those in the Red Book?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all
      dispersed now. The old ones are dead, except Timothy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur clasped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Timothy? Isn&rsquo;t that delicious?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Soames. It offended him that she should
      think &ldquo;Timothy&rdquo; delicious&mdash;a kind of insult to his breed.
      This new generation mocked at anything solid and tenacious. &ldquo;You go
      and see the old boy. He might want to prophesy.&rdquo; Ah! If Timothy
      could see the disquiet England of his great-nephews and great-nieces, he
      would certainly give tongue. And involuntarily he glanced up at the
      Iseeum; yes&mdash;George was still in the window, with the same pink paper
      in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Robin Hill, Father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Robin Hill! Robin Hill, round which all that tragedy had centred! What did
      she want to know for?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Surrey,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;not far from Richmond. Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the house there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That they quarrelled about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But what&rsquo;s all that to do with you? We&rsquo;re going
      home to-morrow&mdash;you&rsquo;d better be thinking about your frocks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you! They&rsquo;re all thought about. A family feud? It&rsquo;s
      like the Bible, or Mark Twain&mdash;awfully exciting. What did you do in
      the feud, Father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! But if I&rsquo;m to keep it up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said you were to keep it up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, darling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I said it had nothing to do with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I think, you know; so that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was too sharp for him; fine, as Annette sometimes called her. Nothing
      for it but to distract her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bit of rosaline point in here,&rdquo; he said,
      stopping before a shop, &ldquo;that I thought you might like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had paid for it and they had resumed their progress, Fleur said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that boy&rsquo;s mother is the most beautiful
      woman of her age you&rsquo;ve ever seen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shivered. Uncanny, the way she stuck to it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I noticed her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, I saw the corner of your eye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see everything&mdash;and a great deal more, it seems to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her husband like? He must be your first cousin, if
      your fathers were brothers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead, for all I know,&rdquo; said Soames, with sudden vehemence.
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him for twenty years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A painter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite jolly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words: &ldquo;If you want to please me you&rsquo;ll put those people
      out of your head,&rdquo; sprang to Soames&rsquo; lips, but he choked them
      back&mdash;he must not let her see his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He once insulted me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her quick eyes rested on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see! You didn&rsquo;t avenge it, and it rankles. Poor Father! You
      let me have a go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was really like lying in the dark with a mosquito hovering above his
      face. Such pertinacity in Fleur was new to him, and, as they reached the
      hotel, he said grimly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did my best. And that&rsquo;s enough about these people. I&rsquo;m
      going up till dinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall sit here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a parting look at her extended in a chair&mdash;a look
      half-resentful, half-adoring&mdash;Soames moved into the lift and was
      transported to their suite on the fourth floor. He stood by the window of
      the sitting-room which gave view over Hyde Park, and drummed a finger on
      its pane. His feelings were confused, tetchy, troubled. The throb of that
      old wound, scarred over by Time and new interests, was mingled with
      displeasure and anxiety, and a slight pain in his chest where that nougat
      stuff had disagreed. Had Annette come in? Not that she was any good to him
      in such a difficulty. Whenever she had questioned him about his first
      marriage, he had always shut her up; she knew nothing of it, save that it
      had been the great passion of his life, and his marriage with herself but
      domestic makeshift. She had always kept the grudge of that up her sleeve,
      as it were, and used it commercially. He listened. A sound&mdash;the vague
      murmur of a woman&rsquo;s movements&mdash;was coming through the door. She
      was in. He tapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been changing her frock, and was still imperfectly clothed; a
      striking figure before her glass. There was a certain magnificence about
      her arms, shoulders, hair, which had darkened since he first knew her,
      about the turn of her neck, the silkiness of her garments, her
      dark-lashed, greyblue eyes&mdash;she was certainly as handsome at forty as
      she had ever been. A fine possession, an excellent housekeeper, a sensible
      and affectionate enough mother. If only she weren&rsquo;t always so
      frankly cynical about the relations between them! Soames, who had no more
      real affection for her than she had for him, suffered from a kind of
      English grievance in that she had never dropped even the thinnest veil of
      sentiment over their partnership. Like most of his countrymen and women,
      he held the view that marriage should be based on mutual love, but that
      when from a marriage love had disappeared, or, been found never to have
      really existed&mdash;so that it was manifestly not based on love&mdash;you
      must not admit it. There it was, and the love was not&mdash;but there you
      were, and must continue to be! Thus you had it both ways, and were not
      tarred with cynicism, realism, and immorality like the French. Moreover,
      it was necessary in the interests of property. He knew that she knew that
      they both knew there was no love between them, but he still expected her
      not to admit in words or conduct such a thing, and he could never
      understand what she meant when she talked of the hypocrisy of the English.
      He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom have you got at &lsquo;The Shelter&rsquo; next week?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette went on touching her lips delicately with salve&mdash;he always
      wished she wouldn&rsquo;t do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister Winifred, and the Car-r-digans&rdquo;&mdash;she took up
      a tiny stick of black&mdash;&ldquo;and Prosper Profond.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Belgian chap? Why him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette turned her neck lazily, touched one eyelash, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He amuses Winifred.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want some one to amuse Fleur; she&rsquo;s restive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;R-restive?&rdquo; repeated Annette. &ldquo;Is it the first time you
      see that, my friend? She was born r-restive, as you call it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Would she never get that affected roll out of her r&rsquo;s?
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched the dress she had taken off, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette looked at him, reflected in her glass. Her just-brightened lips
      smiled, rather full, rather ironical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enjoying myself,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; answered Soames glumly. &ldquo;Ribbandry, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his word for all that incomprehensible running in and out of shops
      that women went in for. &ldquo;Has Fleur got her summer dresses?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ask if I have mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care whether I do or not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. Well, she has; and I have mine&mdash;terribly
      expensive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;What does that chap Profond
      do in England?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette raised the eyebrows she had just finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He yachts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a sleepy chap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; answered Annette, and her face had a sort of
      quiet enjoyment. &ldquo;But sometimes very amusing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a touch of the tar-brush about him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette stretched herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tar-brush?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What is that? His mother was
      Armenienne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, then,&rdquo; muttered Soames. &ldquo;Does he know
      anything about pictures?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows about everything&mdash;a man of the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, get some one for Fleur. I want to distract her. She&rsquo;s
      going off on Saturday to Val Dartie and his wife; I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the reason could not be explained without going into family history,
      Soames merely answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Racketing about. There&rsquo;s too much of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like that little Mrs. Val; she is very quiet and clever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of her except&mdash;This thing&rsquo;s new.&rdquo;
      And Soames took up a creation from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette received it from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you hook me?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames hooked. Glancing once over her shoulder into the glass, he saw the
      expression on her face, faintly amused, faintly contemptuous, as much as
      to say: &ldquo;Thanks! You will never learn!&rdquo; No, thank God, he wasn&rsquo;t
      a Frenchman! He finished with a jerk, and the words: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
      low here.&rdquo; And he went to the door, with the wish to get away from
      her and go down to Fleur again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette stayed a powder-puff, and said with startling suddenness
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Que tu es grossier!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew the expression&mdash;he had reason to. The first time she had used
      it he had thought it meant &ldquo;What a grocer you are!&rdquo; and had
      not known whether to be relieved or not when better informed. He resented
      the word&mdash;he was not coarse! If he was coarse, what was that chap in
      the room beyond his, who made those horrible noises in the morning when he
      cleared his throat, or those people in the Lounge who thought it well-bred
      to say nothing but what the whole world could hear at the top of their
      voices&mdash;quacking inanity! Coarse, because he had said her dress was
      low! Well, so it was! He went out without reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming into the Lounge from the far end, he at once saw Fleur where he had
      left her. She sat with crossed knees, slowly balancing a foot in silk
      stocking and grey shoe, sure sign that she was dreaming. Her eyes showed
      it too&mdash;they went off like that sometimes. And then, in a moment, she
      would come to life, and be as quick and restless as a monkey. And she knew
      so much, so self-assured, and not yet nineteen. What was that odious word?
      Flapper! Dreadful young creatures&mdash;squealing and squawking and
      showing their legs! The worst of them bad dreams, the best of them
      powdered angels! Fleur was not a flapper, not one of those slangy,
      ill-bred young females. And yet she was frighteningly self-willed, and
      full of life, and determined to enjoy it. Enjoy! The word brought no
      puritan terror to Soames; but it brought the terror suited to his
      temperament. He had always been afraid to enjoy to-day for fear he might
      not enjoy tomorrow so much. And it was terrifying to feel that his
      daughter was divested of that safeguard. The very way she sat in that
      chair showed it&mdash;lost in her dream. He had never been lost in a dream
      himself&mdash;there was nothing to be had out of it; and where she got it
      from he did not know! Certainly not from Annette! And yet Annette, as a
      young girl, when he was hanging about her, had once had a flowery look.
      Well, she had lost it now!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur rose from her chair-swiftly, restlessly; and flung herself down at a
      writing-table. Seizing ink and writing paper, she began to write as if she
      had not time to breathe before she got her letter written. And suddenly
      she saw him. The air of desperate absorption vanished, she smiled, waved a
      kiss, made a pretty face as if she were a little puzzled and a little
      bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! She was &ldquo;fine&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;fine!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      III.&mdash;AT ROBIN HILL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jolyon Forsyte had spent his boy&rsquo;s nineteenth birthday at Robin
      Hill, quietly going into his affairs. He did everything quietly now,
      because his heart was in a poor way, and, like all his family, he disliked
      the idea of dying. He had never realised how much till one day, two years
      ago, he had gone to his doctor about certain symptoms, and been told:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any moment, on any overstrain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken it with a smile&mdash;the natural Forsyte reaction against an
      unpleasant truth. But with an increase of symptoms in the train on the way
      home, he had realised to the full the sentence hanging over him. To leave
      Irene, his boy, his home, his work&mdash;though he did little enough work
      now! To leave them for unknown darkness, for the unimaginable state, for
      such nothingness that he would not even be conscious of wind stirring
      leaves above his grave, nor of the scent of earth and grass. Of such
      nothingness that, however hard he might try to conceive it, he never
      could, and must still hover on the hope that he might see again those he
      loved! To realise this was to endure very poignant spiritual anguish.
      Before he reached home that day he had determined to keep it from Irene.
      He would have to be more careful than man had ever been, for the least
      thing would give it away and make her as wretched as himself, almost. His
      doctor had passed him sound in other respects, and seventy was nothing of
      an age&mdash;he would last a long time yet, if he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a conclusion, followed out for nearly two years, develops to the full
      the subtler side of character. Naturally not abrupt, except when nervously
      excited, Jolyon had become control incarnate. The sad patience of old
      people who cannot exert themselves was masked by a smile which his lips
      preserved even in private. He devised continually all manner of cover to
      conceal his enforced lack of exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mocking himself for so doing, he counterfeited conversion to the Simple
      Life; gave up wine and cigars, drank a special kind of coffee with no
      coffee in it. In short, he made himself as safe as a Forsyte in his
      condition could, under the rose of his mild irony. Secure from discovery,
      since his wife and son had gone up to Town, he had spent the fine May day
      quietly arranging his papers, that he might die to-morrow without
      inconveniencing any one, giving in fact a final polish to his terrestrial
      state. Having docketed and enclosed it in his father&rsquo;s old Chinese
      cabinet, he put the key into an envelope, wrote the words outside: &ldquo;Key
      of the Chinese cabinet, wherein will be found the exact state of me, J.
      F.,&rdquo; and put it in his breast-pocket, where it would be always about
      him, in case of accident. Then, ringing for tea, he went out to have it
      under the old oak-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      All are under sentence of death; Jolyon, whose sentence was but a little
      more precise and pressing, had become so used to it that he thought
      habitually, like other people, of other things. He thought of his son now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon was nineteen that day, and Jon had come of late to a decision.
      Educated neither at Eton like his father, nor at Harrow, like his dead
      half-brother, but at one of those establishments which, designed to avoid
      the evil and contain the good of the Public School system, may or may not
      contain the evil and avoid the good, Jon had left in April perfectly
      ignorant of what he wanted to become. The War, which had promised to go on
      for ever, had ended just as he was about to join the Army, six months
      before his time. It had taken him ever since to get used to the idea that
      he could now choose for himself. He had held with his father several
      discussions, from which, under a cheery show of being ready for anything&mdash;except,
      of course, the Church, Army, Law, Stage, Stock Exchange, Medicine,
      Business, and Engineering&mdash;Jolyon had gathered rather clearly that
      Jon wanted to go in for nothing. He himself had felt exactly like that at
      the same age. With him that pleasant vacuity had soon been ended by an
      early marriage, and its unhappy consequences. Forced to become an
      underwriter at Lloyd&rsquo;s, he had regained prosperity before his
      artistic talent had outcropped. But having&mdash;as the simple say&mdash;&ldquo;learned&rdquo;
      his boy to draw pigs and other animals, he knew that Jon would never be a
      painter, and inclined to the conclusion that his aversion from everything
      else meant that he was going to be a writer. Holding, however, the view
      that experience was necessary even for that profession, there seemed to
      Jolyon nothing in the meantime, for Jon, but University, travel, and
      perhaps the eating of dinners for the Bar. After that one would see, or
      more probably one would not. In face of these proffered allurements,
      however, Jon had remained undecided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such discussions with his son had confirmed in Jolyon a doubt whether the
      world had really changed. People said that it was a new age. With the
      profundity of one not too long for any age, Jolyon perceived that under
      slightly different surfaces the era was precisely what it had been.
      Mankind was still divided into two species: The few who had &ldquo;speculation&rdquo;
      in their souls, and the many who had none, with a belt of hybrids like
      himself in the middle. Jon appeared to have speculation; it seemed to his
      father a bad lookout.
    </p>
    <p>
      With something deeper, therefore, than his usual smile, he had heard the
      boy say, a fortnight ago: &ldquo;I should like to try farming, Dad; if it
      won&rsquo;t cost you too much. It seems to be about the only sort of life
      that doesn&rsquo;t hurt anybody; except art, and of course that&rsquo;s
      out of the question for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon subdued his smile, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; you shall skip back to where we were under the first
      Jolyon in 1760. It&rsquo;ll prove the cycle theory, and incidentally, no
      doubt, you may grow a better turnip than he did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A little dashed, Jon had answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a good scheme, Dad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twill serve, my dear; and if you should really take to it,
      you&rsquo;ll do more good than most men, which is little enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To himself, however, he had said: &lsquo;But he won&rsquo;t take to it. I
      give him four years. Still, it&rsquo;s healthy, and harmless.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After turning the matter over and consulting with Irene, he wrote to his
      daughter, Mrs. Val Dartie, asking if they knew of a farmer near them on
      the Downs who would take Jon as an apprentice. Holly&rsquo;s answer had
      been enthusiastic. There was an excellent man quite close; she and Val
      would love Jon to live with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was due to go to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sipping weak tea with lemon in it, Jolyon gazed through the leaves of the
      old oak-tree at that view which had appeared to him desirable for
      thirty-two years. The tree beneath which he sat seemed not a day older! So
      young, the little leaves of brownish gold; so old, the whitey-grey-green
      of its thick rough trunk. A tree of memories, which would live on hundreds
      of years yet, unless some barbarian cut it down&mdash;would see old
      England out at the pace things were going! He remembered a night three
      years before, when, looking from his window, with his arm close round
      Irene, he had watched a German aeroplane hovering, it seemed, right over
      the old tree. Next day they had found a bomb hole in a field on Gage&rsquo;s
      farm. That was before he knew that he was under sentence of death. He
      could almost have wished the bomb had finished him. It would have saved a
      lot of hanging about, many hours of cold fear in the pit of his stomach.
      He had counted on living to the normal Forsyte age of eighty-five or more,
      when Irene would be seventy. As it was, she would miss him. Still there
      was Jon, more important in her life than himself; Jon, who adored his
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under that tree, where old Jolyon&mdash;waiting for Irene to come to him
      across the lawn&mdash;had breathed his last, Jolyon wondered, whimsically,
      whether, having put everything in such perfect order, he had not better
      close his own eyes and drift away. There was something undignified in
      parasitically clinging on to the effortless close of a life wherein he
      regretted two things only&mdash;the long division between his father and
      himself when he was young, and the lateness of his union with Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      From where he sat he could see a cluster of apple-trees in blossom.
      Nothing in Nature moved him so much as fruit-trees in blossom; and his
      heart ached suddenly because he might never see them flower again. Spring!
      Decidedly no man ought to have to die while his heart was still young
      enough to love beauty! Blackbirds sang recklessly in the shrubbery,
      swallows were flying high, the leaves above him glistened; and over the
      fields was every imaginable tint of early foliage, burnished by the level
      sunlight, away to where the distant &ldquo;smoke-bush&rdquo; blue was
      trailed along the horizon. Irene&rsquo;s flowers in their narrow beds had
      startling individuality that evening, little deep assertions of gay life.
      Only Chinese and Japanese painters, and perhaps Leonardo, had known how to
      get that startling little ego into each painted flower, and bird, and
      beast&mdash;the ego, yet the sense of species, the universality of life as
      well. They were the fellows! &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve made nothing that will
      live!&rsquo; thought Jolyon; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been an amateur&mdash;a
      mere lover, not a creator. Still, I shall leave Jon behind me when I go.&rsquo;
      What luck that the boy had not been caught by that ghastly war! He might
      so easily have been killed, like poor Jolly twenty years ago out in the
      Transvaal. Jon would do something some day&mdash;if the Age didn&rsquo;t
      spoil him&mdash;an imaginative chap! His whim to take up farming was but a
      bit of sentiment, and about as likely to last. And just then he saw them
      coming up the field: Irene and the boy; walking from the station, with
      their arms linked. And getting up, he strolled down through the new rose
      garden to meet them....
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene came into his room that night and sat down by the window. She sat
      there without speaking till he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, my love?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had an encounter to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soames.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames! He had kept that name out of his thoughts these last two years;
      conscious that it was bad for him. And, now, his heart moved in a
      disconcerting manner, as if it had side-slipped within his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene went on quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and his daughter were in the Gallery, and afterward at the
      confectioner&rsquo;s where we had tea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon went over and put his hand on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he look?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grey; but otherwise much the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the daughter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty. At least, Jon thought so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon&rsquo;s heart side-slipped again. His wife&rsquo;s face had a
      strained and puzzled look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t-?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but Jon knows their name. The girl dropped her handkerchief and
      he picked it up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon sat down on his bed. An evil chance!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;June was with you. Did she put her foot into it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but it was all very queer and strained, and Jon could see it
      was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon drew a long breath, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered whether we&rsquo;ve been right to keep it
      from him. He&rsquo;ll find out some day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The later the better, Jolyon; the young have such cheap, hard
      judgment. When you were nineteen what would you have thought of your
      mother if she had done what I have?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! There it was! Jon worshipped his mother; and knew nothing of the
      tragedies, the inexorable necessities of life, nothing of the prisoned
      grief in an unhappy marriage, nothing of jealousy or passion&mdash;knew
      nothing at all, as yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you told him?&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That they were relations, but we didn&rsquo;t know them; that you
      had never cared much for your family, or they for you. I expect he will be
      asking you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon smiled. &ldquo;This promises to take the place of air-raids,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;After all, one misses them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene looked up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known it would come some day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered her with sudden energy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could never stand seeing Jon blame you. He shan&rsquo;t do that,
      even in thought. He has imagination; and he&rsquo;ll understand if it&rsquo;s
      put to him properly. I think I had better tell him before he gets to know
      otherwise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, Jolyon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was like her&mdash;she had no foresight, and never went to meet
      trouble. Still&mdash;who knew?&mdash;she might be right. It was ill going
      against a mother&rsquo;s instinct. It might be well to let the boy go on,
      if possible, till experience had given him some touchstone by which he
      could judge the values of that old tragedy; till love, jealousy, longing,
      had deepened his charity. All the same, one must take precautions&mdash;every
      precaution possible! And, long after Irene had left him, he lay awake
      turning over those precautions. He must write to Holly, telling her that
      Jon knew nothing as yet of family history. Holly was discreet, she would
      make sure of her husband, she would see to it! Jon could take the letter
      with him when he went to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the day on which he had put the polish on his material estate died
      out with the chiming of the stable clock; and another began for Jolyon in
      the shadow of a spiritual disorder which could not be so rounded off and
      polished....
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jon, whose room had once been his day nursery, lay awake too, the prey
      of a sensation disputed by those who have never known it, &ldquo;love at
      first sight!&rdquo; He had felt it beginning in him with the glint of
      those dark eyes gazing into his athwart the Juno&mdash;a conviction that
      this was his &lsquo;dream&rsquo;. so that what followed had seemed to him
      at once natural and miraculous. Fleur! Her name alone was almost enough
      for one who was terribly susceptible to the charm of words. In a
      homoeopathic Age, when boys and girls were co-educated, and mixed up in
      early life till sex was almost abolished, Jon was singularly
      old-fashioned. His modern school took boys only, and his holidays had been
      spent at Robin Hill with boy friends, or his parents alone. He had never,
      therefore, been inoculated against the germs of love by small doses of the
      poison. And now in the dark his temperature was mounting fast. He lay
      awake, featuring Fleur&mdash;as they called it&mdash;recalling her words,
      especially that &ldquo;Au revoir!&rdquo; so soft and sprightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still so wide awake at dawn that he got up, slipped on tennis
      shoes, trousers, and a sweater, and in silence crept downstairs and out
      through the study window. It was just light; there was a smell of grass.
      &lsquo;Fleur!&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;Fleur!&rsquo; It was mysteriously
      white out of doors, with nothing awake except the birds just beginning to
      chirp. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go down into the coppice,&rsquo; he thought. He
      ran down through the fields, reached the pond just as the sun rose, and
      passed into the coppice. Bluebells carpeted the ground there; among the
      larch-trees there was mystery&mdash;the air, as it were, composed of that
      romantic quality. Jon sniffed its freshness, and stared at the bluebells
      in the sharpening light. Fleur! It rhymed with her! And she lived at
      Mapleduram&mdash;a jolly name, too, on the river somewhere. He could find
      it in the atlas presently. He would write to her. But would she answer?
      Oh! She must. She had said &ldquo;Au revoir!&rdquo; Not good-bye! What
      luck that she had dropped her handkerchief! He would never have known her
      but for that. And the more he thought of that handkerchief, the more
      amazing his luck seemed. Fleur! It certainly rhymed with her! Rhythm
      thronged his head; words jostled to be joined together; he was on the
      verge of a poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon remained in this condition for more than half an hour, then returned
      to the house, and getting a ladder, climbed in at his bedroom window out
      of sheer exhilaration. Then, remembering that the study window was open,
      he went down and shut it, first removing the ladder, so as to obliterate
      all traces of his feeling. The thing was too deep to be revealed to mortal
      soul-even-to his mother.

    <h2>
      IV.&mdash;THE MAUSOLEUM
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are houses whose souls have passed into the limbo of Time, leaving
      their bodies in the limbo of London. Such was not quite the condition of
      &ldquo;Timothy&rsquo;s&rdquo; on the Bayswater Road, for Timothy&rsquo;s
      soul still had one foot in Timothy Forsyte&rsquo;s body, and Smither kept
      the atmosphere unchanging, of camphor and port wine and house whose
      windows are only opened to air it twice a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Forsyte imagination that house was now a sort of Chinese pill-box, a
      series of layers in the last of which was Timothy. One did not reach him,
      or so it was reported by members of the family who, out of old-time habit
      or absentmindedness, would drive up once in a blue moon and ask after
      their surviving uncle. Such were Francie, now quite emancipated from God
      (she frankly avowed atheism), Euphemia, emancipated from old Nicholas, and
      Winifred Dartie from her &ldquo;man of the world.&rdquo; But, after all,
      everybody was emancipated now, or said they were&mdash;perhaps not quite
      the same thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Soames, therefore, took it on his way to Paddington station on the
      morning after that encounter, it was hardly with the expectation of seeing
      Timothy in the flesh. His heart made a faint demonstration within him
      while he stood in full south sunlight on the newly whitened doorstep of
      that little house where four Forsytes had once lived, and now but one
      dwelt on like a winter fly; the house into which Soames had come and out
      of which he had gone times without number, divested of, or burdened with,
      fardels of family gossip; the house of the &ldquo;old people&rdquo; of
      another century, another age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of Smither&mdash;still corseted up to the armpits because the
      new fashion which came in as they were going out about 1903 had never been
      considered &ldquo;nice&rdquo; by Aunts Juley and Hester&mdash;brought a
      pale friendliness to Soames&rsquo; lips; Smither, still faithfully
      arranged to old pattern in every detail, an invaluable servant&mdash;none
      such left&mdash;smiling back at him, with the words: &ldquo;Why! it&rsquo;s
      Mr. Soames, after all this time! And how are you, sir? Mr. Timothy will be
      so pleased to know you&rsquo;ve been.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he keeps fairly bobbish for his age, sir; but of course he&rsquo;s
      a wonderful man. As I said to Mrs. Dartie when she was here last: It would
      please Miss Forsyte and Mrs. Juley and Miss Hester to see how he relishes
      a baked apple still. But he&rsquo;s quite deaf. And a mercy, I always
      think. For what we should have done with him in the air-raids, I don&rsquo;t
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;What did you do with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We just left him in his bed, and had the bell run down into the
      cellar, so that Cook and I could hear him if he rang. It would never have
      done to let him know there was a war on. As I said to Cook, &lsquo;If Mr.
      Timothy rings, they may do what they like&mdash;I&rsquo;m going up. My
      dear mistresses would have a fit if they could see him ringing and nobody
      going to him.&rsquo; But he slept through them all beautiful. And the one
      in the daytime he was having his bath. It was a mercy, because he might
      have noticed the people in the street all looking up&mdash;he often looks
      out of the window.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite!&rdquo; murmured Soames. Smither was getting garrulous!
      &ldquo;I just want to look round and see if there&rsquo;s anything to be
      done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything except a smell
      of mice in the dining-room that we don&rsquo;t know how to get rid of. It&rsquo;s
      funny they should be there, and not a crumb, since Mr. Timothy took to not
      coming down, just before the War. But they&rsquo;re nasty little things;
      you never know where they&rsquo;ll take you next.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he leave his bed?&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, sir; he takes nice exercise between his bed and the window
      in the morning, not to risk a change of air. And he&rsquo;s quite
      comfortable in himself; has his Will out every day regular. It&rsquo;s a
      great consolation to him&mdash;that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Smither, I want to see him, if I can; in case he has anything
      to say to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Smither coloured up above her corsets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be an occasion!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Shall I take you
      round the house, sir, while I send Cook to break it to him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you go to him,&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;I can go round the
      house by myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One could not confess to sentiment before another, and Soames felt that he
      was going to be sentimental nosing round those rooms so saturated with the
      past. When Smither, creaking with excitement, had left him, Soames entered
      the dining-room and sniffed. In his opinion it wasn&rsquo;t mice, but
      incipient wood-rot, and he examined the panelling. Whether it was worth a
      coat of paint, at Timothy&rsquo;s age, he was not sure. The room had
      always been the most modern in the house; and only a faint smile curled
      Soames&rsquo; lips and nostrils. Walls of a rich green surmounted the oak
      dado; a heavy metal chandelier hung by a chain from a ceiling divided by
      imitation beams. The pictures had been bought by Timothy, a bargain, one
      day at Jobson&rsquo;s sixty years ago&mdash;three Snyder &ldquo;still
      lifes,&rdquo; two faintly coloured drawings of a boy and a girl, rather
      charming, which bore the initials &ldquo;J. R.&rdquo;&mdash;Timothy had
      always believed they might turn out to be Joshua Reynolds, but Soames, who
      admired them, had discovered that they were only John Robinson; and a
      doubtful Morland of a white pony being shod. Deep-red plush curtains, ten
      high-backed dark mahogany chairs with deep-red plush seats, a Turkey
      carpet, and a mahogany dining-table as large as the room was small, such
      was an apartment which Soames could remember unchanged in soul or body
      since he was four years old. He looked especially at the two drawings, and
      thought: &lsquo;I shall buy those at the sale.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From the dining-room he passed into Timothy&rsquo;s study. He did not
      remember ever having been in that room. It was lined from floor to ceiling
      with volumes, and he looked at them with curiosity. One wall seemed
      devoted to educational books, which Timothy&rsquo;s firm had published two
      generations back-sometimes as many as twenty copies of one book. Soames
      read their titles and shuddered. The middle wall had precisely the same
      books as used to be in the library at his own father&rsquo;s in Park Lane,
      from which he deduced the fancy that James and his youngest brother had
      gone out together one day and bought a brace of small libraries. The third
      wall he approached with more excitement. Here, surely, Timothy&rsquo;s own
      taste would be found. It was. The books were dummies. The fourth wall was
      all heavily curtained window. And turned toward it was a large chair with
      a mahogany reading-stand attached, on which a yellowish and folded copy of
      The Times, dated July 6, 1914, the day Timothy first failed to come down,
      as if in preparation for the War, seemed waiting for him still. In a
      corner stood a large globe of that world never visited by Timothy, deeply
      convinced of the unreality of everything but England, and permanently
      upset by the sea, on which he had been very sick one Sunday afternoon in
      1836, out of a pleasure boat off the pier at Brighton, with Juley and
      Hester, Swithin and Hatty Chessman; all due to Swithin, who was always
      taking things into his head, and who, thank goodness, had been sick too.
      Soames knew all about it, having heard the tale fifty times at least from
      one or other of them. He went up to the globe, and gave it a spin; it
      emitted a faint creak and moved about an inch, bringing into his purview a
      daddy-long-legs which had died on it in latitude 44.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mausoleum!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;George was right!&rsquo; And
      he went out and up the stairs. On the half-landing he stopped before the
      case of stuffed humming-birds which had delighted his childhood. They
      looked not a day older, suspended on wires above pampas-grass. If the case
      were opened the birds would not begin to hum, but the whole thing would
      crumble, he suspected. It wouldn&rsquo;t be worth putting that into the
      sale! And suddenly he was caught by a memory of Aunt Ann&mdash;dear old
      Aunt Ann&mdash;holding him by the hand in front of that case and saying:
      &ldquo;Look, Soamey! Aren&rsquo;t they bright and pretty, dear little
      humming-birds!&rdquo; Soames remembered his own answer: &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t
      hum, Auntie.&rdquo; He must have been six, in a black velveteen suit with
      a light-blue collar-he remembered that suit well! Aunt Ann with her
      ringlets, and her spidery kind hands, and her grave old aquiline smile&mdash;a
      fine old lady, Aunt Ann! He moved on up to the drawing-room door. There on
      each side of it were the groups of miniatures. Those he would certainly
      buy in! The miniatures of his four aunts, one of his Uncle Swithin
      adolescent, and one of his Uncle Nicholas as a boy. They had all been
      painted by a young lady friend of the family at a time, 1830, about, when
      miniatures were considered very genteel, and lasting too, painted as they
      were on ivory. Many a time had he heard the tale of that young lady:
      &ldquo;Very talented, my dear; she had quite a weakness for Swithin, and
      very soon after she went into a consumption and died: so like Keats&mdash;we
      often spoke of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, there they were! Ann, Juley, Hester, Susan&mdash;quite a small
      child; Swithin, with sky-blue eyes, pink cheeks, yellow curls, white
      waistcoat-large as life; and Nicholas, like Cupid with an eye on heaven.
      Now he came to think of it, Uncle Nick had always been rather like that&mdash;a
      wonderful man to the last. Yes, she must have had talent, and miniatures
      always had a certain back-watered cachet of their own, little subject to
      the currents of competition on aesthetic Change. Soames opened the
      drawing-room door. The room was dusted, the furniture uncovered, the
      curtains drawn back, precisely as if his aunts still dwelt there patiently
      waiting. And a thought came to him: When Timothy died&mdash;why not? Would
      it not be almost a duty to preserve this house&mdash;like Carlyle&rsquo;s&mdash;and
      put up a tablet, and show it? &ldquo;Specimen of mid-Victorian abode&mdash;entrance,
      one shilling, with catalogue.&rdquo; After all, it was the completest
      thing, and perhaps the deadest in the London of to-day. Perfect in its
      special taste and culture, if, that is, he took down and carried over to
      his own collection the four Barbizon pictures he had given them. The still
      sky-blue walls, tile green curtains patterned with red flowers and ferns;
      the crewel-worked fire-screen before the cast-iron grate; the mahogany
      cupboard with glass windows, full of little knickknacks; the beaded
      footstools; Keats, Shelley, Southey, Cowper, Coleridge, Byron&rsquo;s
      Corsair (but nothing else), and the Victorian poets in a bookshelf row;
      the marqueterie cabinet lined with dim red plush, full of family relics:
      Hester&rsquo;s first fan; the buckles of their mother&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s
      shoes; three bottled scorpions; and one very yellow elephant&rsquo;s tusk,
      sent home from India by Great-uncle Edgar Forsyte, who had been in jute; a
      yellow bit of paper propped up, with spidery writing on it, recording God
      knew what! And the pictures crowding on the walls&mdash;all water-colours
      save those four Barbizons looking like the foreigners they were, and
      doubtful customers at that&mdash;pictures bright and illustrative, &ldquo;Telling
      the Bees,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey for the Ferry!&rdquo; and two in the style of
      Frith, all thimblerig and crinolines, given them by Swithin. Oh! many,
      many pictures at which Soames had gazed a thousand times in supercilious
      fascination; a marvellous collection of bright, smooth gilt frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the boudoir-grand piano, beautifully dusted, hermetically sealed as
      ever; and Aunt Juley&rsquo;s album of pressed seaweed on it. And the
      gilt-legged chairs, stronger than they looked. And on one side of the
      fireplace the sofa of crimson silk, where Aunt Ann, and after her Aunt
      Juley, had been wont to sit, facing the light and bolt upright. And on the
      other side of the fire the one really easy chair, back to the light, for
      Aunt Hester. Soames screwed up his eyes; he seemed to see them sitting
      there. Ah! and the atmosphere&mdash;even now, of too many stuffs and
      washed lace curtains, lavender in bags, and dried bees&rsquo; wings.
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nothing like it left;
      it ought to be preserved.&rsquo; And, by George, they might laugh at it,
      but for a standard of gentle life never departed from, for fastidiousness
      of skin and eye and nose and feeling, it beat to-day hollow&mdash;to-day
      with its Tubes and cars, its perpetual smoking, its cross-legged,
      bare-necked girls visible up to the knees and down to the waist if you
      took the trouble (agreeable to the satyr within each Forsyte but hardly
      his idea of a lady), with their feet, too, screwed round the legs of their
      chairs while they ate, and their &ldquo;So longs,&rdquo; and their &ldquo;Old
      Beans,&rdquo; and their laughter&mdash;girls who gave him the shudders
      whenever he thought of Fleur in contact with them; and the hard-eyed,
      capable, older women who managed life and gave him the shudders too. No!
      his old aunts, if they never opened their minds, their eyes, or very much
      their windows, at least had manners, and a standard, and reverence for
      past and future.
    </p>
    <p>
      With rather a choky feeling he closed the door and went tiptoeing
      upstairs. He looked in at a place on the way: H&rsquo;m! in perfect order
      of the eighties, with a sort of yellow oilskin paper on the walls. At the
      top of the stairs he hesitated between four doors. Which of them was
      Timothy&rsquo;s? And he listened. A sound, as of a child slowly dragging a
      hobby-horse about, came to his ears. That must be Timothy! He tapped, and
      a door was opened by Smither, very red in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Timothy was taking his walk, and she had not been able to get him to
      attend. If Mr. Soames would come into the back-room, he could see him
      through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames went into the back-room and stood watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last of the old Forsytes was on his feet, moving with the most
      impressive slowness, and an air of perfect concentration on his own
      affairs, backward and forward between the foot of his bed and the window,
      a distance of some twelve feet. The lower part of his square face, no
      longer clean-shaven, was covered with snowy beard clipped as short as it
      could be, and his chin looked as broad as his brow where the hair was also
      quite white, while nose and cheeks and brow were a good yellow. One hand
      held a stout stick, and the other grasped the skirt of his Jaeger
      dressing-gown, from under which could be seen his bed-socked ankles and
      feet thrust into Jaeger slippers. The expression on his face was that of a
      crossed child, intent on something that he has not got. Each time he
      turned he stumped the stick, and then dragged it, as if to show that he
      could do without it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He still looks strong,&rdquo; said Soames under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, sir. You should see him take his bath&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      wonderful; he does enjoy it so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Those quite loud words gave Soames an insight. Timothy had resumed his
      babyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he take any interest in things generally?&rdquo; he said, also
      loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, sir; his food and his Will. It&rsquo;s quite a sight to
      see him turn it over and over, not to read it, of course; and every now
      and then he asks the price of Consols, and I write it on a slate for him&mdash;very
      large. Of course, I always write the same, what they were when he last
      took notice, in 1914. We got the doctor to forbid him to read the paper
      when the War broke out. Oh! he did take on about that at first. But he
      soon came round, because he knew it tired him; and he&rsquo;s a wonder to
      conserve energy as he used to call it when my dear mistresses were alive,
      bless their hearts! How he did go on at them about that; they were always
      so active, if you remember, Mr. Soames.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would happen if I were to go in?&rdquo; asked Soames: &ldquo;Would
      he remember me? I made his Will, you know, after Miss Hester died in 1907.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that, sir,&rdquo; replied Smither doubtfully, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
      take on me to say. I think he might; he really is a wonderful man for his
      age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames moved into the doorway, and waiting for Timothy to turn, said in a
      loud voice: &ldquo;Uncle Timothy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy trailed back half-way, and halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soames,&rdquo; cried Soames at the top of his voice, holding out
      his hand, &ldquo;Soames Forsyte!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Timothy, and stumping his stick loudly on the
      floor, he continued his walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to work,&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Smither, rather crestfallen; &ldquo;you
      see, he hasn&rsquo;t finished his walk. It always was one thing at a time
      with him. I expect he&rsquo;ll ask me this afternoon if you came about the
      gas, and a pretty job I shall have to make him understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he ought to have a man about him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Smither held up her hands. &ldquo;A man! Oh! no. Cook and me can manage
      perfectly. A strange man about would send him crazy in no time. And my
      mistresses wouldn&rsquo;t like the idea of a man in the house. Besides, we&rsquo;re
      so&mdash;proud of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the doctor comes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every morning. He makes special terms for such a quantity, and Mr.
      Timothy&rsquo;s so used, he doesn&rsquo;t take a bit of notice, except to
      put out his tongue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Soames, turning away, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s rather
      sad and painful to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sir,&rdquo; returned Smither anxiously, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t
      think that. Now that he can&rsquo;t worry about things, he quite enjoys
      his life, really he does. As I say to Cook, Mr. Timothy is more of a man
      than he ever was. You see, when he&rsquo;s not walkin&rsquo;, or takin&rsquo;
      his bath, he&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo;, and when he&rsquo;s not eatin&rsquo;,
      he&rsquo;s sleepin&rsquo;. and there it is. There isn&rsquo;t an ache or a
      care about him anywhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something in that. I&rsquo;ll
      go down. By the way, let me see his Will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have to take my time about that, sir; he keeps it under
      his pillow, and he&rsquo;d see me, while he&rsquo;s active.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only want to know if it&rsquo;s the one I made,&rdquo; said
      Soames; &ldquo;you take a look at its date some time, and let me know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the same, because me and
      Cook witnessed, you remember, and there&rsquo;s our names on it still, and
      we&rsquo;ve only done it once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Soames. He did remember. Smither and Jane had
      been proper witnesses, having been left nothing in the Will that they
      might have no interest in Timothy&rsquo;s death. It had been&mdash;he
      fully admitted&mdash;an almost improper precaution, but Timothy had wished
      it, and, after all, Aunt Hester had provided for them amply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;good-bye, Smither. Look after
      him, and if he should say anything at any time, put it down, and let me
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, Mr. Soames; I&rsquo;ll be sure to do that. It&rsquo;s been
      such a pleasant change to see you. Cook will be quite excited when I tell
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shook her hand and went down-stairs. He stood for fully two minutes
      by the hat-stand whereon he had hung his hat so many times. &lsquo;So it
      all passes,&rsquo; he was thinking; &lsquo;passes and begins again. Poor
      old chap!&rsquo; And he listened, if perchance the sound of Timothy
      trailing his hobby-horse might come down the well of the stairs; or some
      ghost of an old face show over the bannisters, and an old voice say:
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s dear Soames, and we were only saying that we hadn&rsquo;t
      seen him for a week!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing&mdash;nothing! Just the scent of camphor, and dust-motes in a
      sunbeam through the fanlight over the door. The little old house! A
      mausoleum! And, turning on his heel, he went out, and caught his train.

    <h2>
      V.&mdash;THE NATIVE HEATH
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;His foot&rsquo;s upon his native heath,
           His name&rsquo;s&mdash;Val Dartie.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      With some such feeling did Val Dartie, in the fortieth year of his age,
      set out that same Thursday morning very early from the old manor-house he
      had taken on the north side of the Sussex Downs. His destination was
      Newmarket, and he had not been there since the autumn of 1899, when he
      stole over from Oxford for the Cambridgeshire. He paused at the door to
      give his wife a kiss, and put a flask of port into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t overtire your leg, Val, and don&rsquo;t bet too much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With the pressure of her chest against his own, and her eyes looking into
      his, Val felt both leg and pocket safe. He should be moderate; Holly was
      always right&mdash;she had a natural aptitude. It did not seem so
      remarkable to him, perhaps, as it might to others, that&mdash;half Dartie
      as he was&mdash;he should have been perfectly faithful to his young first
      cousin during the twenty years since he married her romantically out in
      the Boer War; and faithful without any feeling of sacrifice or boredom&mdash;she
      was so quick, so slyly always a little in front of his mood. Being first
      cousins they had decided, rather needlessly, to have no children; and,
      though a little sallower, she had kept her looks, her slimness, and the
      colour of her dark hair. Val particularly admired the life of her own she
      carried on, besides carrying on his, and riding better every year. She
      kept up her music, she read an awful lot&mdash;novels, poetry, all sorts
      of stuff. Out on their farm in Cape colony she had looked after all the
      &ldquo;nigger&rdquo; babies and women in a miraculous manner. She was, in
      fact, clever; yet made no fuss about it, and had no &ldquo;side.&rdquo;
      Though not remarkable for humility, Val had come to have the feeling that
      she was his superior, and he did not grudge it&mdash;a great tribute. It
      might be noted that he never looked at Holly without her knowing of it,
      but that she looked at him sometimes unawares.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had kissed her in the porch because he should not be doing so on the
      platform, though she was going to the station with him, to drive the car
      back. Tanned and wrinkled by Colonial weather and the wiles inseparable
      from horses, and handicapped by the leg which, weakened in the Boer War,
      had probably saved his life in the War just past, Val was still much as he
      had been in the days of his courtship; his smile as wide and charming, his
      eyelashes, if anything, thicker and darker, his eyes screwed up under
      them, as bright a grey, his freckles rather deeper, his hair a little
      grizzled at the sides. He gave the impression of one who has lived
      actively with horses in a sunny climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twisting the car sharp round at the gate, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is young Jon coming?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything you want for him? I could bring it down on
      Saturday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but you might come by the same train as Fleur&mdash;one-forty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val gave the Ford full rein; he still drove like a man in a new country on
      bad roads, who refuses to compromise, and expects heaven at every hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a young woman who knows her way about,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I say, has it struck you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Holly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Soames and your Dad&mdash;bit awkward, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t know, and he won&rsquo;t know, and nothing must be
      said, of course. It&rsquo;s only for five days, Val.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stable secret! Righto!&rdquo; If Holly thought it safe, it was.
      Glancing slyly round at him, she said: &ldquo;Did you notice how
      beautifully she asked herself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she did. What do you think of her, Val?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty and clever; but she might run out at any corner if she got
      her monkey up, I should say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering,&rdquo; Holly murmured, &ldquo;whether she is
      the modern young woman. One feels at sea coming home into all this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? You get the hang of things so quick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly slid her hand into his coat-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You keep one in the know,&rdquo; said Val encouraged. &ldquo;What
      do you think of that Belgian fellow, Profond?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s rather &lsquo;a good devil.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to me a queer fish for a friend of our family. In fact,
      our family is in pretty queer waters, with Uncle Soames marrying a
      Frenchwoman, and your Dad marrying Soames&rsquo;s first. Our grandfathers
      would have had fits!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would anybody&rsquo;s, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This car,&rdquo; Val said suddenly, &ldquo;wants rousing; she doesn&rsquo;t
      get her hind legs under her uphill. I shall have to give her her head on
      the slope if I&rsquo;m to catch that train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was that about horses which had prevented him from ever really
      sympathising with a car, and the running of the Ford under his guidance
      compared with its running under that of Holly was always noticeable. He
      caught the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care going home; she&rsquo;ll throw you down if she can.
      Good-bye, darling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; called Holly, and kissed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the train, after quarter of an hour&rsquo;s indecision between thoughts
      of Holly, his morning paper, the look of the bright day, and his dim
      memory of Newmarket, Val plunged into the recesses of a small square book,
      all names, pedigrees, tap-roots, and notes about the make and shape of
      horses. The Forsyte in him was bent on the acquisition of a certain strain
      of blood, and he was subduing resolutely as yet the Dartie hankering for a
      Nutter. On getting back to England, after the profitable sale of his South
      African farm and stud, and observing that the sun seldom shone, Val had
      said to himself: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve absolutely got to have an interest in
      life, or this country will give me the blues. Hunting&rsquo;s not enough,
      I&rsquo;ll breed and I&rsquo;ll train.&rdquo; With just that extra pinch
      of shrewdness and decision imparted by long residence in a new country,
      Val had seen the weak point of modern breeding. They were all hypnotised
      by fashion and high price. He should buy for looks, and let names go hang!
      And here he was already, hypnotised by the prestige of a certain strain of
      blood! Half-consciously, he thought: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s something in
      this damned climate which makes one go round in a ring. All the same, I
      must have a strain of Mayfly blood.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In this mood he reached the Mecca of his hopes. It was one of those quiet
      meetings favourable to such as wish to look into horses, rather than into
      the mouths of bookmakers; and Val clung to the paddock. His twenty years
      of Colonial life, divesting him of the dandyism in which he had been bred,
      had left him the essential neatness of the horseman, and given him a queer
      and rather blighting eye over what he called &ldquo;the silly haw-haw&rdquo;
      of some Englishmen, the &ldquo;flapping cockatoory&rdquo; of some
      English-women&mdash;Holly had none of that and Holly was his model.
      Observant, quick, resourceful, Val went straight to the heart of a
      transaction, a horse, a drink; and he was on his way to the heart of a
      Mayfly filly, when a slow voice said at his elbow:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Val Dartie? How&rsquo;s Mrs. Val Dartie? She&rsquo;s well, I
      hope.&rdquo; And he saw beside him the Belgian he had met at his sister
      Imogen&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prosper Profond&mdash;I met you at lunch,&rdquo; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; murmured Val.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very well,&rdquo; replied Monsieur Profond, smiling with
      a certain inimitable slowness. &ldquo;A good devil,&rdquo; Holly had
      called him. Well! He looked a little like a devil, with his dark, clipped,
      pointed beard; a sleepy one though, and good-humoured, with fine eyes,
      unexpectedly intelligent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a gentleman wants to know you&mdash;cousin of yours&mdash;Mr.
      George Forsyde.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val saw a large form, and a face clean-shaven, bull-like, a little
      lowering, with sardonic humour bubbling behind a full grey eye; he
      remembered it dimly from old days when he would dine with his father at
      the Iseeum Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to go racing with your father,&rdquo; George was saying:
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the stud? Like to buy one of my screws?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val grinned, to hide the sudden feeling that the bottom had fallen out of
      breeding. They believed in nothing over here, not even in horses. George
      Forsyte, Prosper Profond! The devil himself was not more disillusioned
      than those two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know you were a racing man,&rdquo; he said to Monsieur
      Profond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. I don&rsquo;t care for it. I&rsquo;m a yachtin&rsquo;
      man. I don&rsquo;t care for yachtin&rsquo; either, but I like to see my
      friends. I&rsquo;ve got some lunch, Mr. Val Dartie, just a small lunch, if
      you&rsquo;d like to &lsquo;ave some; not much&mdash;just a small one&mdash;in
      my car.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Val; &ldquo;very good of you. I&rsquo;ll come
      along in about quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over there. Mr. Forsyde&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and Monsieur
      Profond &ldquo;poinded&rdquo; with a yellow-gloved finger; &ldquo;small
      car, with a small lunch&rdquo;; he moved on, groomed, sleepy, and remote,
      George Forsyte following, neat, huge, and with his jesting air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val remained gazing at the Mayfly filly. George Forsyte, of course, was an
      old chap, but this Profond might be about his own age; Val felt extremely
      young, as if the Mayfly filly were a toy at which those two had laughed.
      The animal had lost reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &lsquo;small&rsquo; mare&rdquo;&mdash;he seemed to hear the
      voice of Monsieur Profond&mdash;&ldquo;what do you see in her?&mdash;we
      must all die!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And George Forsyte, crony of his father, racing still! The Mayfly strain&mdash;was
      it any better than any other? He might just as well have a flutter with
      his money instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by gum!&rdquo; he muttered suddenly, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s no
      good breeding horses, it&rsquo;s no good doing anything. What did I come
      for? I&rsquo;ll buy her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood back and watched the ebb of the paddock visitors toward the
      stand. Natty old chips, shrewd portly fellows, Jews, trainers looking as
      if they had never been guilty of seeing a horse in their lives; tall,
      flapping, languid women, or brisk, loud-voiced women; young men with an
      air as if trying to take it seriously&mdash;two or three of them with only
      one arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Life over here&rsquo;s a game!&rsquo; thought Val. &lsquo;Muffin
      bell rings, horses run, money changes hands; ring again, run again, money
      changes back.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, alarmed at his own philosophy, he went to the paddock gate to watch
      the Mayfly filly canter down. She moved well; and he made his way over to
      the &ldquo;small&rdquo; car. The &ldquo;small&rdquo; lunch was the sort a
      man dreams of but seldom gets; and when it was concluded Monsieur Profond
      walked back with him to the paddock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife&rsquo;s a nice woman,&rdquo; was his surprising remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicest woman I know,&rdquo; returned Val dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Monsieur Profond; &ldquo;she has a nice face. I
      admire nice women.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val looked at him suspiciously, but something kindly and direct in the
      heavy diabolism of his companion disarmed him for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any time you like to come on my yacht, I&rsquo;ll give her a small
      cruise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Val, in arms again, &ldquo;she hates the sea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Monsieur Profond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you yacht?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Belgian&rsquo;s eyes smiled. &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve
      done everything; it&rsquo;s the last thing I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be d-d expensive. I should want more reason than that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Prosper Profond raised his eyebrows, and puffed out a heavy lower
      lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an easy-goin&rsquo; man,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you in the War?&rdquo; asked Val.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es. I&rsquo;ve done that too. I was gassed; it was a small bit
      unpleasant.&rdquo; He smiled with a deep and sleepy air of prosperity, as
      if he had caught it from his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether his saying &ldquo;small&rdquo; when he ought to have said &ldquo;little&rdquo;
      was genuine mistake or affectation Val could not decide; the fellow was
      evidently capable of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the ring of buyers round the Mayfly filly who had won her race,
      Monsieur Profond said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You goin&rsquo; to bid?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val nodded. With this sleepy Satan at his elbow, he felt in need of faith.
      Though placed above the ultimate blows of Providence by the forethought of
      a grand-father who had tied him up a thousand a year to which was added
      the thousand a year tied up for Holly by her grand-father, Val was not
      flush of capital that he could touch, having spent most of what he had
      realised from his South African farm on his establishment in Sussex. And
      very soon he was thinking: &lsquo;Dash it! she&rsquo;s going beyond me!&rsquo;
      His limit-six hundred-was exceeded; he dropped out of the bidding. The
      Mayfly filly passed under the hammer at seven hundred and fifty guineas.
      He was turning away vexed when the slow voice of Monsieur Profond said in
      his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve bought that small filly, but I don&rsquo;t want
      her; you take her and give her to your wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val looked at the fellow with renewed suspicion, but the good humour in
      his eyes was such that he really could not take offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made a small lot of money in the War,&rdquo; began Monsieur
      Profond in answer to that look. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ad armament shares. I like
      to give it away. I&rsquo;m always makin&rsquo; money. I want very small
      lot myself. I like my friends to &lsquo;ave it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy her of you at the price you gave,&rdquo; said Val
      with sudden resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Monsieur Profond. &ldquo;You take her. I don&rsquo;
      want her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it! one doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; smiled Monsieur Profond. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a friend
      of your family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven hundred and fifty guineas is not a box of cigars,&rdquo; said
      Val impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; you keep her for me till I want her, and do what you
      like with her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as she&rsquo;s yours,&rdquo; said Val. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      mind that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; murmured Monsieur Profond, and moved
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val watched; he might be &ldquo;a good devil,&rdquo; but then again he
      might not. He saw him rejoin George Forsyte, and thereafter saw him no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent those nights after racing at his mother&rsquo;s house in Green
      Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred Dartie at sixty-two was marvellously preserved, considering the
      three-and-thirty years during which she had put up with Montague Dartie,
      till almost happily released by a French staircase. It was to her a
      vehement satisfaction to have her favourite son back from South Africa
      after all this time, to feel him so little changed, and to have taken a
      fancy to his wife. Winifred, who in the late seventies, before her
      marriage, had been in the vanguard of freedom, pleasure, and fashion,
      confessed her youth outclassed by the donzellas of the day. They seemed,
      for instance, to regard marriage as an incident, and Winifred sometimes
      regretted that she had not done the same; a second, third, fourth incident
      might have secured her a partner of less dazzling inebriety; though, after
      all, he had left her Val, Imogen, Maud, Benedict (almost a colonel and
      unharmed by the War)&mdash;none of whom had been divorced as yet. The
      steadiness of her children often amazed one who remembered their father;
      but, as she was fond of believing, they were really all Forsytes,
      favouring herself, with the exception, perhaps, of Imogen. Her brother&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;little girl&rdquo; Fleur frankly puzzled Winifred. The child was as
      restless as any of these modern young women&mdash;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a
      small flame in a draught,&rdquo; Prosper Profond had said one day after
      dinner&mdash;but she did not flap, or talk at the top of her voice. The
      steady Forsyteism in Winifred&rsquo;s own character instinctively resented
      the feeling in the air, the modern girl&rsquo;s habits and her motto:
      &ldquo;All&rsquo;s much of a muchness! Spend, to-morrow we shall be poor!&rdquo;
      She found it a saving grace in Fleur that, having set her heart on a
      thing, she had no change of heart until she got it&mdash;though&mdash;what
      happened after, Fleur was, of course, too young to have made evident. The
      child was a &ldquo;very pretty little thing,&rdquo; too, and quite a
      credit to take about, with her mother&rsquo;s French taste and gift for
      wearing clothes; everybody turned to look at Fleur&mdash;great
      consideration to Winifred, a lover of the style and distinction which had
      so cruelly deceived her in the case of Montague Dartie.
    </p>
    <p>
      In discussing her with Val, at breakfast on Saturday morning, Winifred
      dwelt on the family skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little affair of your father-in-law and your Aunt Irene, Val&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      old as the hills, of course, Fleur need know nothing about it&mdash;making
      a fuss. Your Uncle Soames is very particular about that. So you&rsquo;ll
      be careful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! But it&rsquo;s dashed awkward&mdash;Holly&rsquo;s young
      half-brother is coming to live with us while he learns farming. He&rsquo;s
      there already.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Winifred. &ldquo;That is a gaff! What is he like?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only saw him once&mdash;at Robin Hill, when we were home in 1909;
      he was naked and painted blue and yellow in stripes&mdash;a jolly little
      chap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred thought that &ldquo;rather nice,&rdquo; and added comfortably:
      &ldquo;Well, Holly&rsquo;s sensible; she&rsquo;ll know how to deal with
      it. I shan&rsquo;t tell your uncle. It&rsquo;ll only bother him. It&rsquo;s
      a great comfort to have you back, my dear boy, now that I&rsquo;m getting
      on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting on! Why! you&rsquo;re as young as ever. That chap Profond,
      Mother, is he all right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prosper Profond! Oh! the most amusing man I know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val grunted, and recounted the story of the Mayfly filly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so like him,&rdquo; murmured Winifred. &ldquo;He does
      all sorts of things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Val shrewdly, &ldquo;our family haven&rsquo;t
      been too lucky with that kind of cattle; they&rsquo;re too light-hearted
      for us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true, and Winifred&rsquo;s blue study lasted a full minute before
      she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! well! He&rsquo;s a foreigner, Val; one must make allowances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll use his filly and make it up to him, somehow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And soon after he gave her his blessing, received a kiss, and left her for
      his bookmaker&rsquo;s, the Iseeum Club, and Victoria station.

    <h2>
      VI.&mdash;JON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Val Dartie, after twenty years of South Africa, had fallen deeply in
      love, fortunately with something of her own, for the object of her passion
      was the prospect in front of her windows, the cool clear light on the
      green Downs. It was England again, at last! England more beautiful than
      she had dreamed. Chance had, in fact, guided the Val Darties to a spot
      where the South Downs had real charm when the sun shone. Holly had enough
      of her father&rsquo;s eye to apprehend the rare quality of their outlines
      and chalky radiance; to go up there by the ravine-like lane and wander
      along toward Chanctonbury or Amberley, was still a delight which she
      hardly attempted to share with Val, whose admiration of Nature was
      confused by a Forsyte&rsquo;s instinct for getting something out of it,
      such as the condition of the turf for his horses&rsquo; exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driving the Ford home with a certain humouring, smoothness, she promised
      herself that the first use she would make of Jon would be to take him up
      there, and show him &ldquo;the view&rdquo; under this May-day sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was looking forward to her young half-brother with a motherliness not
      exhausted by Val. A three-day visit to Robin Hill, soon after their
      arrival home, had yielded no sight of him&mdash;he was still at school; so
      that her recollection, like Val&rsquo;s, was of a little sunny-haired boy,
      striped blue and yellow, down by the pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those three days at Robin Hill had been exciting, sad, embarrassing.
      Memories of her dead brother, memories of Val&rsquo;s courtship; the
      ageing of her father, not seen for twenty years, something funereal in his
      ironic gentleness which did not escape one who had much subtle instinct;
      above all, the presence of her stepmother, whom she could still vaguely
      remember as the &ldquo;lady in grey&rdquo; of days when she was little and
      grandfather alive and Mademoiselle Beauce so cross because that intruder
      gave her music lessons&mdash;all these confused and tantalised a spirit
      which had longed to find Robin Hill untroubled. But Holly was adept at
      keeping things to herself, and all had seemed to go quite well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father had kissed her when she left him, with lips which she was sure
      had trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the War hasn&rsquo;t changed
      Robin Hill, has it? If only you could have brought Jolly back with you! I
      say, can you stand this spiritualistic racket? When the oak-tree dies, it
      dies, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From the warmth of her embrace he probably divined that he had let the cat
      out of the bag, for he rode off at once on irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spiritualism&mdash;queer word, when the more they manifest the more
      they prove that they&rsquo;ve got hold of matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Holly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! Look at their photographs of auric presences. You must have
      something material for light and shade to fall on before you can take a
      photograph. No, it&rsquo;ll end in our calling all matter spirit, or all
      spirit matter&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know which.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you believe in survival, Dad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon had looked at her, and the sad whimsicality of his face impressed
      her deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear, I should like to get something out of death. I&rsquo;ve
      been looking into it a bit. But for the life of me I can&rsquo;t find
      anything that telepathy, sub-consciousness, and emanation from the
      storehouse of this world can&rsquo;t account for just as well. Wish I
      could! Wishes father thought but they don&rsquo;t breed evidence.&rdquo;
      Holly had pressed her lips again to his forehead with the feeling that it
      confirmed his theory that all matter was becoming spirit&mdash;his brow
      felt, somehow, so insubstantial.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most poignant memory of that little visit had been watching,
      unobserved, her stepmother reading to herself a letter from Jon. It was&mdash;she
      decided&mdash;the prettiest sight she had ever seen. Irene, lost as it
      were in the letter of her boy, stood at a window where the light fell on
      her face and her fine grey hair; her lips were moving, smiling, her dark
      eyes laughing, dancing, and the hand which did not hold the letter was
      pressed against her breast. Holly withdrew as from a vision of perfect
      love, convinced that Jon must be nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw him coming out of the station with a kit-bag in either hand,
      she was confirmed in her predisposition. He was a little like Jolly, that
      long-lost idol of her childhood, but eager-looking and less formal, with
      deeper eyes and brighter-coloured hair, for he wore no hat; altogether a
      very interesting &ldquo;little&rdquo; brother!
    </p>
    <p>
      His tentative politeness charmed one who was accustomed to assurance in
      the youthful manner; he was disturbed because she was to drive him home,
      instead of his driving her. Shouldn&rsquo;t he have a shot? They hadn&rsquo;t
      a car at Robin Hill since the War, of course, and he had only driven once,
      and landed up a bank, so she oughtn&rsquo;t to mind his trying. His laugh,
      soft and infectious, was very attractive, though that word, she had heard,
      was now quite old-fashioned. When they reached the house he pulled out a
      crumpled letter which she read while he was washing&mdash;a quite short
      letter, which must have cost her father many a pang to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and Val will not forget, I trust, that Jon knows nothing of
      family history. His mother and I think he is too young at present. The boy
      is very dear, and the apple of her eye. Verbum sapientibus,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your loving father,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;J. F.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all; but it renewed in Holly an uneasy regret that Fleur was
      coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea she fulfilled that promise to herself and took Jon up the hill.
      They had a long talk, sitting above an old chalk-pit grown over with
      brambles and goosepenny. Milkwort and liverwort starred the green slope,
      the larks sang, and thrushes in the brake, and now and then a gull
      flighting inland would wheel very white against the paling sky, where the
      vague moon was coming up. Delicious fragrance came to them, as if little
      invisible creatures were running and treading scent out of the blades of
      grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon, who had fallen silent, said rather suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, this is wonderful! There&rsquo;s no fat on it at all. Gull&rsquo;s
      flight and sheep-bells.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gull&rsquo;s flight and sheep-bells&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re a
      poet, my dear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Golly! No go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try! I used to at your age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? Mother says &lsquo;try&rsquo; too; but I&rsquo;m so
      rotten. Have you any of yours for me to see?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; Holly murmured, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been married
      nineteen years. I only wrote verses when I wanted to be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Jon, and turned over on his face: the one cheek she
      could see was a charming colour. Was Jon &ldquo;touched in the wind,&rdquo;
      then, as Val would have called it? Already? But, if so, all the better, he
      would take no notice of young Fleur. Besides, on Monday he would begin his
      farming. And she smiled. Was it Burns who followed the plough, or only
      Piers Plowman? Nearly every young man and most young women seemed to be
      poets now, judging from the number of their books she had read out in
      South Africa, importing them from Hatchus and Bumphards; and quite good&mdash;oh!
      quite; much better than she had been herself! But then poetry had only
      really come in since her day&mdash;with motor-cars. Another long talk
      after dinner over a wood fire in the low hall, and there seemed little
      left to know about Jon except anything of real importance. Holly parted
      from him at his bedroom door, having seen twice over that he had
      everything, with the conviction that she would love him, and Val would
      like him. He was eager, but did not gush; he was a splendid listener,
      sympathetic, reticent about himself. He evidently loved their father, and
      adored his mother. He liked riding, rowing, and fencing better than games.
      He saved moths from candles, and couldn&rsquo;t bear spiders, but put them
      out of doors in screws of paper sooner than kill them. In a word, he was
      amiable. She went to sleep, thinking that he would suffer horribly if
      anybody hurt him; but who would hurt him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon, on the other hand, sat awake at his window with a bit of paper and a
      pencil, writing his first &ldquo;real poem&rdquo; by the light of a candle
      because there was not enough moon to see by, only enough to make the night
      seem fluttery and as if engraved on silver. Just the night for Fleur to
      walk, and turn her eyes, and lead on-over the hills and far away. And Jon,
      deeply furrowed in his ingenuous brow, made marks on the paper and rubbed
      them out and wrote them in again, and did all that was necessary for the
      completion of a work of art; and he had a feeling such as the winds of
      Spring must have, trying their first songs among the coming blossom. Jon
      was one of those boys (not many) in whom a home-trained love of beauty had
      survived school life. He had had to keep it to himself, of course, so that
      not even the drawing-master knew of it; but it was there, fastidious and
      clear within him. And his poem seemed to him as lame and stilted as the
      night was winged. But he kept it, all the same. It was a &ldquo;beast,&rdquo;
      but better than nothing as an expression of the inexpressible. And he
      thought with a sort of discomfiture: &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t be able to show
      it to Mother.&rsquo; He slept terribly well, when he did sleep,
      overwhelmed by novelty.

    <h2>
      VII.&mdash;FLEUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      To avoid the awkwardness of questions which could not be answered, all
      that had been told Jon was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a girl coming down with Val for the week-end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the same reason, all that had been told Fleur was: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
      got a youngster staying with us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two yearlings, as Val called them in his thoughts, met therefore in a
      manner which for unpreparedness left nothing to be desired. They were thus
      introduced by Holly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Jon, my little brother; Fleur&rsquo;s a cousin of ours,
      Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon, who was coming in through a French window out of strong sunlight, was
      so confounded by the providential nature of this miracle, that he had time
      to hear Fleur say calmly: &ldquo;Oh, how do you do?&rdquo; as if he had
      never seen her, and to understand dimly from the quickest imaginable
      little movement of her head that he never had seen her. He bowed therefore
      over her hand in an intoxicated manner, and became more silent than the
      grave. He knew better than to speak. Once in his early life, surprised
      reading by a nightlight, he had said fatuously &ldquo;I was just turning
      over the leaves, Mum,&rdquo; and his mother had replied: &ldquo;Jon, never
      tell stories, because of your face nobody will ever believe them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The saying had permanently undermined the confidence necessary to the
      success of spoken untruth. He listened therefore to Fleur&rsquo;s swift
      and rapt allusions to the jolliness of everything, plied her with scones
      and jam, and got away as soon as might be. They say that in delirium
      tremens you see a fixed object, preferably dark, which suddenly changes
      shape and position. Jon saw the fixed object; it had dark eyes and
      passably dark hair, and changed its position, but never its shape. The
      knowledge that between him and that object there was already a secret
      understanding (however impossible to understand) thrilled him so that he
      waited feverishly, and began to copy out his poem&mdash;which of course he
      would never dare to&mdash;show her&mdash;till the sound of horses&rsquo;
      hoofs roused him, and, leaning from his window, he saw her riding forth
      with Val. It was clear that she wasted no time, but the sight filled him
      with grief. He wasted his. If he had not bolted, in his fearful ecstasy,
      he might have been asked to go too. And from his window he sat and watched
      them disappear, appear again in the chine of the road, vanish, and emerge
      once more for a minute clear on the outline of the Down. &lsquo;Silly
      brute!&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;I always miss my chances.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Why couldn&rsquo;t he be self-confident and ready? And, leaning his chin
      on his hands, he imagined the ride he might have had with her. A week-end
      was but a week-end, and he had missed three hours of it. Did he know any
      one except himself who would have been such a flat? He did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dressed for dinner early, and was first down. He would miss no more.
      But he missed Fleur, who came down last. He sat opposite her at dinner,
      and it was terrible&mdash;impossible to say anything for fear of saying
      the wrong thing, impossible to keep his eyes fixed on her in the only
      natural way; in sum, impossible to treat normally one with whom in fancy
      he had already been over the hills and far away; conscious, too, all the
      time, that he must seem to her, to all of them, a dumb gawk. Yes, it was
      terrible! And she was talking so well&mdash;swooping with swift wing this
      way and that. Wonderful how she had learned an art which he found so
      disgustingly difficult. She must think him hopeless indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      His sister&rsquo;s eyes, fixed on him with a certain astonishment, obliged
      him at last to look at Fleur; but instantly her eyes, very wide and eager,
      seeming to say, &ldquo;Oh! for goodness&rsquo; sake!&rdquo; obliged him to
      look at Val, where a grin obliged him to look at his cutlet&mdash;that, at
      least, had no eyes, and no grin, and he ate it hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jon is going to be a farmer,&rdquo; he heard Holly say; &ldquo;a
      farmer and a poet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up reproachfully, caught the comic lift of her eyebrow just
      like their father&rsquo;s, laughed, and felt better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val recounted the incident of Monsieur Prosper Profond; nothing could have
      been more favourable, for, in relating it, he regarded Holly, who in turn
      regarded him, while Fleur seemed to be regarding with a slight frown some
      thought of her own, and Jon was really free to look at her at last. She
      had on a white frock, very simple and well made; her arms were bare, and
      her hair had a white rose in it. In just that swift moment of free vision,
      after such intense discomfort, Jon saw her sublimated, as one sees in the
      dark a slender white fruit-tree; caught her like a verse of poetry flashed
      before the eyes of the mind, or a tune which floats out in the distance
      and dies. He wondered giddily how old she was&mdash;she seemed so much
      more self-possessed and experienced than himself. Why mustn&rsquo;t he say
      they had met? He remembered suddenly his mother&rsquo;s face; puzzled,
      hurt-looking, when she answered: &ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re relations, but
      we don&rsquo;t know them.&rdquo; Impossible that his mother, who loved
      beauty, should not admire Fleur if she did know her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone with Val after dinner, he sipped port deferentially and answered the
      advances of this new-found brother-in-law. As to riding (always the first
      consideration with Val) he could have the young chestnut, saddle and
      unsaddle it himself, and generally look after it when he brought it in.
      Jon said he was accustomed to all that at home, and saw that he had gone
      up one in his host&rsquo;s estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleur,&rdquo; said Val, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t ride much yet, but she&rsquo;s
      keen. Of course, her father doesn&rsquo;t know a horse from a cart-wheel.
      Does your Dad ride?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He used to; but now he&rsquo;s&mdash;you know, he&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
      He stopped, so hating the word &ldquo;old.&rdquo; His father was old, and
      yet not old; no&mdash;never!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; muttered Val. &ldquo;I used to know your brother up
      at Oxford, ages ago, the one who died in the Boer War. We had a fight in
      New College Gardens. That was a queer business,&rdquo; he added, musing;
      &ldquo;a good deal came out of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon&rsquo;s eyes opened wide; all was pushing him toward historical
      research, when his sister&rsquo;s voice said gently from the doorway:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, you two,&rdquo; and he rose, his heart pushing him
      toward something far more modern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur having declared that it was &ldquo;simply too wonderful to stay
      indoors,&rdquo; they all went out. Moonlight was frosting the dew, and an
      old sundial threw a long shadow. Two box hedges at right angles, dark and
      square, barred off the orchard. Fleur turned through that angled opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; she called. Jon glanced at the others, and
      followed. She was running among the trees like a ghost. All was lovely and
      foamlike above her, and there was a scent of old trunks, and of nettles.
      She vanished. He thought he had lost her, then almost ran into her
      standing quite still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it jolly?&rdquo; she cried, and Jon answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached up, twisted off a blossom and, twirling it in her fingers,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I can call you Jon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so just.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! But you know there&rsquo;s a feud between our families?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon stammered: &ldquo;Feud? Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ever so romantic and silly. That&rsquo;s why I pretended
      we hadn&rsquo;t met. Shall we get up early to-morrow morning and go for a
      walk before breakfast and have it out? I hate being slow about things, don&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon murmured a rapturous assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock, then. I think your mother&rsquo;s beautiful&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon said fervently: &ldquo;Yes, she is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love all kinds of beauty,&rdquo; went on Fleur, &ldquo;when it&rsquo;s
      exciting. I don&rsquo;t like Greek things a bit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Not Euripides?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Euripides? Oh! no, I can&rsquo;t bear Greek plays; they&rsquo;re so
      long. I think beauty&rsquo;s always swift. I like to look at one picture,
      for instance, and then run off. I can&rsquo;t bear a lot of things
      together. Look!&rdquo; She held up her blossom in the moonlight. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      better than all the orchard, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, suddenly, with her other hand she caught Jon&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all things in the world, don&rsquo;t you think caution&rsquo;s
      the most awful? Smell the moonlight!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She thrust the blossom against his face; Jon agreed giddily that of all
      things in the world caution was the worst, and bending over, kissed the
      hand which held his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice and old-fashioned,&rdquo; said Fleur calmly.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re frightfully silent, Jon. Still I like silence when it&rsquo;s
      swift.&rdquo; She let go his hand. &ldquo;Did you think I dropped my
      handkerchief on purpose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Jon, intensely shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did, of course. Let&rsquo;s get back, or they&rsquo;ll
      think we&rsquo;re doing this on purpose too.&rdquo; And again she ran like
      a ghost among the trees. Jon followed, with love in his heart, Spring in
      his heart, and over all the moonlit white unearthly blossom. They came out
      where they had gone in, Fleur walking demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite wonderful in there,&rdquo; she said dreamily to
      Holly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon preserved silence, hoping against hope that she might be thinking it
      swift.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bade him a casual and demure good-night, which made him think he had
      been dreaming....
    </p>
    <p>
      In her bedroom Fleur had flung off her gown, and, wrapped in a shapeless
      garment, with the white flower still in her hair, she looked like a
      mousme, sitting cross-legged on her bed, writing by candlelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAREST CHERRY,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;m in love. I&rsquo;ve got it in the neck, only
      the feeling is really lower down. He&rsquo;s a second cousin-such a child,
      about six months older and ten years younger than I am. Boys always fall
      in love with their seniors, and girls with their juniors or with old men
      of forty. Don&rsquo;t laugh, but his eyes are the truest things I ever
      saw; and he&rsquo;s quite divinely silent! We had a most romantic first
      meeting in London under the Vospovitch Juno. And now he&rsquo;s sleeping
      in the next room and the moonlight&rsquo;s on the blossom; and to-morrow
      morning, before anybody&rsquo;s awake, we&rsquo;re going to walk off into
      Down fairyland. There&rsquo;s a feud between our families, which makes it
      really exciting. Yes! and I may have to use subterfuge and come on you for
      invitations&mdash;if so, you&rsquo;ll know why! My father doesn&rsquo;t
      want us to know each other, but I can&rsquo;t help that. Life&rsquo;s too
      short. He&rsquo;s got the most beautiful mother, with lovely silvery hair
      and a young face with dark eyes. I&rsquo;m staying with his sister&mdash;who
      married my cousin; it&rsquo;s all mixed up, but I mean to pump her
      to-morrow. We&rsquo;ve often talked about love being a spoil-sport; well,
      that&rsquo;s all tosh, it&rsquo;s the beginning of sport, and the sooner
      you feel it, my dear, the better for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jon (not simplified spelling, but short for Jolyon, which is a name
      in my family, they say) is the sort that lights up and goes out; about
      five feet ten, still growing, and I believe he&rsquo;s going to be a poet.
      If you laugh at me I&rsquo;ve done with you forever. I perceive all sorts
      of difficulties, but you know when I really want a thing I get it. One of
      the chief effects of love is that you see the air sort of inhabited, like
      seeing a face in the moon; and you feel&mdash;you feel dancey and soft at
      the same time, with a funny sensation&mdash;like a continual first sniff
      of orange&mdash;blossom&mdash;Just above your stays. This is my first, and
      I feel as if it were going to be my last, which is absurd, of course, by
      all the laws of Nature and morality. If you mock me I will smite you, and
      if you tell anybody I will never forgive you. So much so, that I almost
      don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll send this letter. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll sleep
      over it. So good-night, my Cherry&mdash;oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FLEUR.&rdquo; <a name="link2H_4_0104" id="link2H_4_0104">

    <h2>
      VIII.&mdash;IDYLL ON GRASS
    </h2>
    <p>
      When those two young Forsytes emerged from the chine lane, and set their
      faces east toward the sun, there was not a cloud in heaven, and the Downs
      were dewy. They had come at a good bat up the slope and were a little out
      of breath; if they had anything to say they did not say it, but marched in
      the early awkwardness of unbreakfasted morning under the songs of the
      larks. The stealing out had been fun, but with the freedom of the tops the
      sense of conspiracy ceased, and gave place to dumbness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made one blooming error,&rdquo; said Fleur, when they
      had gone half a mile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon produced a stick of chocolate. They shared it and their tongues were
      loosened. They discussed the nature of their homes and previous
      existences, which had a kind of fascinating unreality up on that lonely
      height. There remained but one thing solid in Jon&rsquo;s past&mdash;his
      mother; but one thing solid in Fleur&rsquo;s&mdash;her father; and of
      these figures, as though seen in the distance with disapproving faces,
      they spoke little.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Down dipped and rose again toward Chanctonbury Ring; a sparkle of far
      sea came into view, a sparrow-hawk hovered in the sun&rsquo;s eye so that
      the blood-nourished brown of his wings gleamed nearly red. Jon had a
      passion for birds, and an aptitude for sitting very still to watch them;
      keen-sighted, and with a memory for what interested him, on birds he was
      almost worth listening to. But in Chanctonbury Ring there were none&mdash;its
      great beech temple was empty of life, and almost chilly at this early
      hour; they came out willingly again into the sun on the far side. It was
      Fleur&rsquo;s turn now. She spoke of dogs, and the way people treated
      them. It was wicked to keep them on chains! She would like to flog people
      who did that. Jon was astonished to find her so humanitarian. She knew a
      dog, it seemed, which some farmer near her home kept chained up at the end
      of his chicken run, in all weathers, till it had almost lost its voice
      from barking!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the misery is,&rdquo; she said vehemently, &ldquo;that if the
      poor thing didn&rsquo;t bark at every one who passes it wouldn&rsquo;t be
      kept there. I do think men are cunning brutes. I&rsquo;ve let it go twice,
      on the sly; it&rsquo;s nearly bitten me both times, and then it goes
      simply mad with joy; but it always runs back home at last, and they chain
      it up again. If I had my way, I&rsquo;d chain that man up.&rdquo; Jon saw
      her teeth and her eyes gleam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d brand him on his forehead
      with the word &lsquo;Brute&rsquo;. that would teach him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon agreed that it would be a good remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their sense of property,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which
      makes people chain things. The last generation thought of nothing but
      property; and that&rsquo;s why there was the War.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Fleur, &ldquo;I never thought of that. Your people
      and mine quarrelled about property. And anyway we&rsquo;ve all got it&mdash;at
      least, I suppose your people have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, luckily; I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall be any good at
      making money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were, I don&rsquo;t believe I should like you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon slipped his hand tremulously under her arm. Fleur looked straight
      before her and chanted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jon, Jon, the farmer&rsquo;s son, Stole a pig, and away he run!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon&rsquo;s arm crept round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is rather sudden,&rdquo; said Fleur calmly; &ldquo;do you
      often do it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon dropped his arm. But when she laughed his arm stole back again; and
      Fleur began to sing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O who will oer the downs so free, O who will with me ride? O who
      will up and follow me&mdash;-&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sing, Jon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon sang. The larks joined in, sheep-bells, and an early morning church
      far away over in Steyning. They went on from tune to tune, till Fleur
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! I am hungry now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am sorry!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jon, you&rsquo;re rather a darling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And she pressed his hand against her waist. Jon almost reeled from
      happiness. A yellow-and-white dog coursing a hare startled them apart.
      They watched the two vanish down the slope, till Fleur said with a sigh:
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never catch it, thank goodness! What&rsquo;s the time?
      Mine&rsquo;s stopped. I never wound it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon looked at his watch. &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;mine&rsquo;s
      stopped; too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on again, but only hand in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the grass is dry,&rdquo; said Fleur, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s sit down
      for half a minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon took off his coat, and they shared it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smell! Actually wild thyme!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With his arm round her waist again, they sat some minutes in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are goats!&rdquo; cried Fleur, jumping up; &ldquo;we shall be
      most fearfully late, and look so silly, and put them on their guard. Look
      here, Jon We only came out to get an appetite for breakfast, and lost our
      way. See?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s serious; there&rsquo;ll be a stopper put on us. Are you
      a good liar?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe not very; but I can try.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I realize that they don&rsquo;t
      mean us to be friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s silly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but you don&rsquo;t know my father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s fearfully fond of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m an only child. And so are you&mdash;of your
      mother. Isn&rsquo;t it a bore? There&rsquo;s so much expected of one. By
      the time they&rsquo;ve done expecting, one&rsquo;s as good as dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; muttered Jon, &ldquo;life&rsquo;s beastly short. One
      wants to live forever, and know everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And love everybody?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Jon; &ldquo;I only want to love once&mdash;you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! You&rsquo;re coming on! Oh! Look! There&rsquo;s the
      chalk-pit; we can&rsquo;t be very far now. Let&rsquo;s run.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon followed, wondering fearfully if he had offended her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chalk-pit was full of sunshine and the murmuration of bees. Fleur
      flung back her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in case of accidents, you may give me
      one kiss, Jon,&rdquo; and she pushed her cheek forward. With ecstasy he
      kissed that hot soft cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, remember! We lost our way; and leave it to me as much as you
      can. I&rsquo;m going to be rather beastly to you; it&rsquo;s safer; try
      and be beastly to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon shook his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just to please me; till five o&rsquo;clock, at all events.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody will be able to see through it,&rdquo; said Jon gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do your best. Look! There they are! Wave your hat! Oh! you
      haven&rsquo;t got one. Well, I&rsquo;ll cooee! Get a little away from me,
      and look sulky.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later, entering the house and doing his utmost to look sulky,
      Jon heard her clear voice in the dining-room:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m simply ravenous! He&rsquo;s going to be a farmer&mdash;and
      he loses his way! The boy&rsquo;s an idiot!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IX. GOYA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lunch was over and Soames mounted to the picture-gallery in his house near
      Mapleduram. He had what Annette called &ldquo;a grief.&rdquo; Fleur was
      not yet home. She had been expected on Wednesday; had wired that it would
      be Friday; and again on Friday that it would be Sunday afternoon; and here
      were her aunt, and her cousins the Cardigans, and this fellow Profond, and
      everything flat as a pancake for the want of her. He stood before his
      Gauguin&mdash;sorest point of his collection. He had bought the ugly great
      thing with two early Matisses before the War, because there was such a
      fuss about those Post-Impressionist chaps. He was wondering whether
      Profond would take them off his hands&mdash;the fellow seemed not to know
      what to do with his money&mdash;when he heard his sister&rsquo;s voice
      say: &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a horrid thing, Soames,&rdquo; and saw
      that Winifred had followed him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you do?&rdquo; he said dryly; &ldquo;I gave five hundred for
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy! Women aren&rsquo;t made like that even if they are black.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames uttered a glum laugh. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come up to tell me
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Do you know that Jolyon&rsquo;s boy is staying with Val and his
      wife?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames spun round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; drawled Winifred; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone to live with
      them there while he learns farming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames had turned away, but her voice pursued him as he walked up and
      down. &ldquo;I warned Val that neither of them was to be spoken to about
      old matters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me before?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred shrugged her substantial shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleur does what she likes. You&rsquo;ve always spoiled her.
      Besides, my dear boy, what&rsquo;s the harm?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The harm!&rdquo; muttered Soames. &ldquo;Why, she&mdash;&rdquo; he
      checked himself. The Juno, the handkerchief, Fleur&rsquo;s eyes, her
      questions, and now this delay in her return&mdash;the symptoms seemed to
      him so sinister that, faithful to his nature, he could not part with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you take too much care,&rdquo; said Winifred. &ldquo;If I
      were you, I should tell her of that old matter. It&rsquo;s no good
      thinking that girls in these days are as they used to be. Where they pick
      up their knowledge I can&rsquo;t tell, but they seem to know everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Over Soames&rsquo; face, closely composed, passed a sort of spasm, and
      Winifred added hastily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like to speak of it, I could for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shook his head. Unless there was absolute necessity the thought
      that his adored daughter should learn of that old scandal hurt his pride
      too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not yet. Never if I can help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, my dear. Think what people are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty years is a long time,&rdquo; muttered Soames. &ldquo;Outside
      our family, who&rsquo;s likely to remember?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred was silenced. She inclined more and more to that peace and
      quietness of which Montague Dartie had deprived her in her youth. And,
      since pictures always depressed her, she soon went down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames passed into the corner where, side by side, hung his real Goya and
      the copy of the fresco &ldquo;La Vendimia.&rdquo; His acquisition of the
      real Goya rather beautifully illustrated the cobweb of vested interests
      and passions which mesh the bright-winged fly of human life. The real Goya&rsquo;s
      noble owner&rsquo;s ancestor had come into possession of it during some
      Spanish war&mdash;it was in a word loot. The noble owner had remained in
      ignorance of its value until in the nineties an enterprising critic
      discovered that a Spanish painter named Goya was a genius. It was only a
      fair Goya, but almost unique in England, and the noble owner became a
      marked man. Having many possessions and that aristocratic culture which,
      independent of mere sensuous enjoyment, is founded on the sounder
      principle that one must know everything and be fearfully interested in
      life, he had fully intended to keep an article which contributed to his
      reputation while he was alive, and to leave it to the nation after he was
      dead. Fortunately for Soames, the House of Lords was violently attacked in
      1909, and the noble owner became alarmed and angry. &lsquo;If,&rsquo; he
      said to himself, &lsquo;they think they can have it both ways they are
      very much mistaken. So long as they leave me in quiet enjoyment the nation
      can have some of my pictures at my death. But if the nation is going to
      bait me, and rob me like this, I&rsquo;m damned if I won&rsquo;t sell the
      lot. They can&rsquo;t have my private property and my public spirit-both.&rsquo;
      He brooded in this fashion for several months till one morning, after
      reading the speech of a certain statesman, he telegraphed to his agent to
      come down and bring Bodkin. On going over the collection Bodkin, than
      whose opinion on market values none was more sought, pronounced that with
      a free hand to sell to America, Germany, and other places where there was
      an interest in art, a lot more money could be made than by selling in
      England. The noble owner&rsquo;s public spirit&mdash;he said&mdash;was
      well known but the pictures were unique. The noble owner put this opinion
      in his pipe and smoked it for a year. At the end of that time he read
      another speech by the same statesman, and telegraphed to his agents:
      &ldquo;Give Bodkin a free hand.&rdquo; It was at this juncture that Bodkin
      conceived the idea which saved the Goya and two other unique pictures for
      the native country of the noble owner. With one hand Bodkin proffered the
      pictures to the foreign market, with the other he formed a list of private
      British collectors. Having obtained what he considered the highest
      possible bids from across the seas, he submitted pictures and bids to the
      private British collectors, and invited them, of their public spirit, to
      outbid. In three instances (including the Goya) out of twenty-one he was
      successful. And why? One of the private collectors made buttons&mdash;he
      had made so many that he desired that his wife should be called Lady
      &ldquo;Buttons.&rdquo; He therefore bought a unique picture at great cost,
      and gave it to the nation. It was &ldquo;part,&rdquo; his friends said,
      &ldquo;of his general game.&rdquo; The second of the private collectors
      was an Americophobe, and bought an unique picture to &ldquo;spite the
      damned Yanks.&rdquo; The third of the private collectors was Soames, who&mdash;more
      sober than either of the, others&mdash;bought after a visit to Madrid,
      because he was certain that Goya was still on the up grade. Goya was not
      booming at the moment, but he would come again; and, looking at that
      portrait, Hogarthian, Manetesque in its directness, but with its own queer
      sharp beauty of paint, he was perfectly satisfied still that he had made
      no error, heavy though the price had been&mdash;heaviest he had ever paid.
      And next to it was hanging the copy of &ldquo;La Vendimia.&rdquo; There
      she was&mdash;the little wretch&mdash;looking back at him in her dreamy
      mood, the mood he loved best because he felt so much safer when she looked
      like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still gazing when the scent of a cigar impinged on his nostrils,
      and a voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Forsyde, what you goin&rsquo; to do with this small lot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That Belgian chap, whose mother&mdash;as if Flemish blood were not enough&mdash;had
      been Armenian! Subduing a natural irritation, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a judge of pictures?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got a few myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any Post-Impressionists?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, I rather like them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of this?&rdquo; said Soames, pointing to the
      Gauguin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Profond protruded his lower lip and short pointed beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather fine, I think,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;do you want to sell
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames checked his instinctive &ldquo;Not particularly&rdquo;&mdash;he
      would not chaffer with this alien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want for it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I gave.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Monsieur Profond. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad
      to take that small picture. Post-Impressionists&mdash;they&rsquo;re awful
      dead, but they&rsquo;re amusin&rsquo;. I don&rsquo; care for pictures
      much, but I&rsquo;ve got some, just a small lot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you care for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Profond shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s awful like a lot of monkeys scramblin&rsquo; for empty
      nuts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re young,&rdquo; said Soames. If the fellow must make a
      generalization, he needn&rsquo;t suggest that the forms of property lacked
      solidity!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo; worry,&rdquo; replied Monsieur Profond smiling;
      &ldquo;we&rsquo;re born, and we die. Half the world&rsquo;s starvin&rsquo;.
      I feed a small lot of babies out in my mother&rsquo;s country; but what&rsquo;s
      the use? Might as well throw my money in the river.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames looked at him, and turned back toward his Goya. He didn&rsquo;t
      know what the fellow wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I make my cheque for?&rdquo; pursued Monsieur Profond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred,&rdquo; said Soames shortly; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
      want you to take it if you don&rsquo;t care for it more than that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Monsieur Profond; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      be &lsquo;appy to &lsquo;ave that picture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote a cheque with a fountain-pen heavily chased with gold. Soames
      watched the process uneasily. How on earth had the fellow known that he
      wanted to sell that picture? Monsieur Profond held out the cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The English are awful funny about pictures,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So
      are the French, so are my people. They&rsquo;re all awful funny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said Soames stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like hats,&rdquo; said Monsieur Profond enigmatically,
      &ldquo;small or large, turnin&rsquo; up or down&mdash;just the fashion.
      Awful funny.&rdquo; And, smiling, he drifted out of the gallery again,
      blue and solid like the smoke of his excellent cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames had taken the cheque, feeling as if the intrinsic value of
      ownership had been called in question. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a cosmopolitan,&rsquo;
      he thought, watching Profond emerge from under the verandah with Annette,
      and saunter down the lawn toward the river. What his wife saw in the
      fellow he didn&rsquo;t know, unless it was that he could speak her
      language; and there passed in Soames what Monsieur Profond would have
      called a &ldquo;small doubt&rdquo; whether Annette was not too handsome to
      be walking with any one so &ldquo;cosmopolitan.&rdquo; Even at that
      distance he could see the blue fumes from Profond&rsquo;s cigar wreath out
      in the quiet sunlight; and his grey buckskin shoes, and his grey hat&mdash;the
      fellow was a dandy! And he could see the quick turn of his wife&rsquo;s
      head, so very straight on her desirable neck and shoulders. That turn of
      her neck always seemed to him a little too showy, and in the &ldquo;Queen
      of all I survey&rdquo; manner&mdash;not quite distinguished. He watched
      them walk along the path at the bottom of the garden. A young man in
      flannels joined them down there&mdash;a Sunday caller no doubt, from up
      the river. He went back to his Goya. He was still staring at that replica
      of Fleur, and worrying over Winifred&rsquo;s news, when his wife&rsquo;s
      voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Michael Mont, Soames. You invited him to see your pictures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the cheerful young man of the Gallery off Cork Street!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turned up, you see, sir; I live only four miles from Pangbourne.
      Jolly day, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Confronted with the results of his expansiveness, Soames scrutinized his
      visitor. The young man&rsquo;s mouth was excessively large and curly&mdash;he
      seemed always grinning. Why didn&rsquo;t he grow the rest of those idiotic
      little moustaches, which made him look like a music-hall buffoon? What on
      earth were young men about, deliberately lowering their class with these
      tooth-brushes, or little slug whiskers? Ugh! Affected young idiots! In
      other respects he was presentable, and his flannels very clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy to see you!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, who had been turning his head from side to side, became
      transfixed. &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&lsquo;some&rsquo;
      picture!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames saw, with mixed sensations, that he had addressed the remark to the
      Goya copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said dryly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not a Goya. It&rsquo;s
      a copy. I had it painted because it reminded me of my daughter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! I thought I knew the face, sir. Is she here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The frankness of his interest almost disarmed Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be in after tea,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shall we go
      round the pictures?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Soames began that round which never tired him. He had not anticipated
      much intelligence from one who had mistaken a copy for an original, but as
      they passed from section to section, period to period, he was startled by
      the young man&rsquo;s frank and relevant remarks. Natively shrewd himself,
      and even sensuous beneath his mask, Soames had not spent thirty-eight
      years over his one hobby without knowing something more about pictures
      than their market values. He was, as it were, the missing link between the
      artist and the commercial public. Art for art&rsquo;s sake and all that,
      of course, was cant. But aesthetics and good taste were necessary. The
      appreciation of enough persons of good taste was what gave a work of art
      its permanent market value, or in other words made it &ldquo;a work of
      art.&rdquo; There was no real cleavage. And he was sufficiently accustomed
      to sheep-like and unseeing visitors, to be intrigued by one who did not
      hesitate to say of Mauve: &ldquo;Good old haystacks!&rdquo; or of James
      Maris: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he just paint and paper &lsquo;em! Mathew was
      the real swell, sir; you could dig into his surfaces!&rdquo; It was after
      the young man had whistled before a Whistler, with the words, &ldquo;D&rsquo;you
      think he ever really saw a naked woman, sir?&rdquo; that Soames remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you, Mr. Mont, if I may ask?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, sir? I was going to be a painter, but the War knocked that. Then
      in the trenches, you know, I used to dream of the Stock Exchange, snug and
      warm and just noisy enough. But the Peace knocked that, shares seem off,
      don&rsquo;t they? I&rsquo;ve only been demobbed about a year. What do you
      recommend, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered the young man, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
      father; I kept him alive during the War, so he&rsquo;s bound to keep me
      alive now. Though, of course, there&rsquo;s the question whether he ought
      to be allowed to hang on to his property. What do you think about that,
      sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, pale and defensive, smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man has fits when I tell him he may have to work yet. He&rsquo;s
      got land, you know; it&rsquo;s a fatal disease.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my real Goya,&rdquo; said Soames dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George! He was a swell. I saw a Goya in Munich once that bowled
      me middle stump. A most evil-looking old woman in the most gorgeous lace.
      He made no compromise with the public taste. That old boy was &lsquo;some&rsquo;
      explosive; he must have smashed up a lot of convention in his day. Couldn&rsquo;t
      he just paint! He makes Velasquez stiff, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no Velasquez,&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man stared. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;only nations or
      profiteers can afford him, I suppose. I say, why shouldn&rsquo;t all the
      bankrupt nations sell their Velasquez and Titians and other swells to the
      profiteers by force, and then pass a law that any one who holds a picture
      by an Old Master&mdash;see schedule&mdash;must hang it in a public
      gallery? There seems something in that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go down to tea?&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s ears seemed to droop on his skull. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
      not dense,&rsquo; thought Soames, following him off the premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goya, with his satiric and surpassing precision, his original &ldquo;line,&rdquo;
      and the daring of his light and shade, could have reproduced to admiration
      the group assembled round Annette&rsquo;s tea-tray in the inglenook below.
      He alone, perhaps, of painters would have done justice to the sunlight
      filtering through a screen of creeper, to the lovely pallor of brass, the
      old cut glasses, the thin slices of lemon in pale amber tea; justice to
      Annette in her black lacey dress; there was something of the fair Spaniard
      in her beauty, though it lacked the spirituality of that rare type; to
      Winifred&rsquo;s grey-haired, corseted solidity; to Soames, of a certain
      grey and flat-cheeked distinction; to the vivacious Michael Mont, pointed
      in ear and eye; to Imogen, dark, luscious of glance, growing a little
      stout; to Prosper Profond, with his expression as who should say, &ldquo;Well,
      Mr. Goya, what&rsquo;s the use of paintin&rsquo; this small party?&rdquo;
      finally, to Jack Cardigan, with his shining stare and tanned sanguinity
      betraying the moving principle: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m English, and I live to be
      fit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Curious, by the way, that Imogen, who as a girl had declared solemnly one
      day at Timothy&rsquo;s that she would never marry a good man&mdash;they
      were so dull&mdash;should have married Jack Cardigan, in whom health had
      so destroyed all traces of original sin, that she might have retired to
      rest with ten thousand other Englishmen without knowing the difference
      from the one she had chosen to repose beside. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she would
      say of him, in her &ldquo;amusing&rdquo; way, &ldquo;Jack keeps himself so
      fearfully fit; he&rsquo;s never had a day&rsquo;s illness in his life. He
      went right through the War without a finger-ache. You really can&rsquo;t
      imagine how fit he is!&rdquo; Indeed, he was so &ldquo;fit&rdquo; that he
      couldn&rsquo;t see when she was flirting, which was such a comfort in a
      way. All the same she was quite fond of him, so far as one could be of a
      sports-machine, and of the two little Cardigans made after his pattern.
      Her eyes just then were comparing him maliciously with Prosper Profond.
      There was no &ldquo;small&rdquo; sport or game which Monsieur Profond had
      not played at too, it seemed, from skittles to tarpon-fishing, and worn
      out every one. Imogen would sometimes wish that they had worn out Jack,
      who continued to play at them and talk of them with the simple zeal of a
      school-girl learning hockey; at the age of Great-uncle Timothy she well
      knew that Jack would be playing carpet golf in her bedroom, and &ldquo;wiping
      somebody&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was telling them now how he had &ldquo;pipped the pro&mdash;a charmin&rsquo;
      fellow, playin&rsquo; a very good game,&rdquo; at the last hole this
      morning; and how he had pulled down to Caversham since lunch, and trying
      to incite Prosper Profond to play him a set of tennis after tea&mdash;do
      him good&mdash;&ldquo;keep him fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the use of keepin&rsquo; fit?&rdquo; said Monsieur
      Profond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; murmured Michael Mont, &ldquo;what do you keep fit
      for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; cried Imogen, enchanted, &ldquo;what do you keep fit
      for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Cardigan stared with all his health. The questions were like the buzz
      of a mosquito, and he put up his hand to wipe them away. During the War,
      of course, he had kept fit to kill Germans; now that it was over he either
      did not know, or shrank in delicacy from explanation of his moving
      principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Monsieur Profond unexpectedly,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; left but keepin&rsquo; fit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The saying, too deep for Sunday afternoon, would have passed unanswered,
      but for the mercurial nature of young Mont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the great discovery of
      the War. We all thought we were progressing&mdash;now we know we&rsquo;re
      only changing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the worse,&rdquo; said Monsieur Profond genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you are cheerful, Prosper!&rdquo; murmured Annette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come and play tennis!&rdquo; said Jack Cardigan; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
      got the hump. We&rsquo;ll soon take that down. D&rsquo;you play, Mr. Mont?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hit the ball about, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Soames rose, ruffled in that deep instinct of preparation
      for the future which guided his existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Fleur comes&mdash;&rdquo; he heard Jack Cardigan say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! and why didn&rsquo;t she come? He passed through drawing-room, hall,
      and porch out on to the drive, and stood there listening for the car. All
      was still and Sundayfied; the lilacs in full flower scented the air. There
      were white clouds, like the feathers of ducks gilded by the sunlight.
      Memory of the day when Fleur was born, and he had waited in such agony
      with her life and her mother&rsquo;s balanced in his hands, came to him
      sharply. He had saved her then, to be the flower of his life. And now! was
      she going to give him trouble&mdash;pain&mdash;give him trouble? He did
      not like the look of things! A blackbird broke in on his reverie with an
      evening song&mdash;a great big fellow up in that acacia-tree. Soames had
      taken quite an interest in his birds of late years; he and Fleur would
      walk round and watch them; her eyes were sharp as needles, and she knew
      every nest. He saw her dog, a retriever, lying on the drive in a patch of
      sunlight, and called to him. &ldquo;Hallo, old fellow-waiting for her too!&rdquo;
      The dog came slowly with a grudging tail, and Soames mechanically laid a
      pat on his head. The dog, the bird, the lilac, all were part of Fleur for
      him; no more, no less. &lsquo;Too fond of her!&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;too
      fond!&rsquo; He was like a man uninsured, with his ships at sea. Uninsured
      again&mdash;as in that other time, so long ago, when he would wander dumb
      and jealous in the wilderness of London, longing for that woman&mdash;his
      first wife&mdash;the mother of this infernal boy. Ah! There was the car at
      last! It drew up, it had luggage, but no Fleur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Fleur is walking up, sir, by the towing-path.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking all those miles? Soames stared. The man&rsquo;s face had the
      beginning of a smile on it. What was he grinning at? And very quickly he
      turned, saying, &ldquo;All right, Sims!&rdquo; and went into the house. He
      mounted to the picture-gallery once more. He had from there a view of the
      river bank, and stood with his eyes fixed on it, oblivious of the fact
      that it would be an hour at least before her figure showed there. Walking
      up! And that fellow&rsquo;s grin! The boy&mdash;! He turned abruptly from
      the window. He couldn&rsquo;t spy on her. If she wanted to keep things
      from him&mdash;she must; he could not spy on her. His heart felt empty,
      and bitterness mounted from it into his very mouth. The staccato shouts of
      Jack Cardigan pursuing the ball, the laugh of young Mont rose in the
      stillness and came in. He hoped they were making that chap Profond run.
      And the girl in &ldquo;La Vendimia&rdquo; stood with her arm akimbo and
      her dreamy eyes looking past him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done all I could for
      you,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;since you were no higher than my knee. You
      aren&rsquo;t going to&mdash;to&mdash;hurt me, are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Goya copy answered not, brilliant in colour just beginning to tone
      down. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no real life in it,&rsquo; thought Soames.
      &lsquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t she come?&rsquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      X.&mdash;TRIO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among those four Forsytes of the third, and, as one might say, fourth
      generation, at Wansdon under the Downs, a week-end prolonged unto the
      ninth day had stretched the crossing threads of tenacity almost to
      snapping-point. Never had Fleur been so &ldquo;fine,&rdquo; Holly so
      watchful, Val so stable-secretive, Jon so silent and disturbed. What he
      learned of farming in that week might have been balanced on the point of a
      penknife and puffed off. He, whose nature was essentially averse from
      intrigue, and whose adoration of Fleur disposed him to think that any need
      for concealing it was &ldquo;skittles,&rdquo; chafed and fretted, yet
      obeyed, taking what relief he could in the few moments when they were
      alone. On Thursday, while they were standing in the bay window of the
      drawing-room, dressed for dinner, she said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jon, I&rsquo;m going home on Sunday by the 3.40 from Paddington; if
      you were to go home on Saturday you could come up on Sunday and take me
      down, and just get back here by the last train, after. You were going home
      anyway, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything to be with you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;only why need I
      pretend&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur slipped her little finger into his palm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no instinct, Jon; you must leave things to me. It&rsquo;s
      serious about our people. We&rsquo;ve simply got to be secret at present,
      if we want to be together.&rdquo; The door was opened, and she added
      loudly: &ldquo;You are a duffer, Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something turned over within Jon; he could not bear this subterfuge about
      a feeling so natural, so overwhelming, and so sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Friday night about eleven he had packed his bag, and was leaning out of
      his window, half miserable, and half lost in a dream of Paddington
      station, when he heard a tiny sound, as of a finger-nail tapping on his
      door. He rushed to it and listened. Again the sound. It was a nail. He
      opened. Oh! What a lovely thing came in!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to show you my fancy dress,&rdquo; it said, and struck an
      attitude at the foot of his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon drew a long breath and leaned against the door. The apparition wore
      white muslin on its head, a fichu round its bare neck over a wine-coloured
      dress, fulled out below its slender waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      It held one arm akimbo, and the other raised, right-angled, holding a fan
      which touched its head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ought to be a basket of grapes,&rdquo; it whispered, &ldquo;but
      I haven&rsquo;t got it here. It&rsquo;s my Goya dress. And this is the
      attitude in the picture. Do you like it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dream.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The apparition pirouetted. &ldquo;Touch it, and see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon knelt down and took the skirt reverently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grape colour,&rdquo; came the whisper, &ldquo;all grapes&mdash;La
      Vendimia&mdash;the vintage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon&rsquo;s fingers scarcely touched each side of the waist; he looked up,
      with adoring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Jon,&rdquo; it whispered; bent, kissed his forehead, pirouetted
      again, and, gliding out, was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon stayed on his knees, and his head fell forward against the bed. How
      long he stayed like that he did not know. The little noises&mdash;of the
      tapping nail, the feet, the skirts rustling&mdash;as in a dream&mdash;went
      on about him; and before his closed eyes the figure stood and smiled and
      whispered, a faint perfume of narcissus lingering in the air. And his
      forehead where it had been kissed had a little cool place between the
      brows, like the imprint of a flower. Love filled his soul, that love of
      boy for girl which knows so little, hopes so much, would not brush the
      down off for the world, and must become in time a fragrant memory&mdash;a
      searing passion&mdash;a humdrum mateship&mdash;or, once in many times,
      vintage full and sweet with sunset colour on the grapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enough has been said about Jon Forsyte here and in another place to show
      what long marches lay between him and his great-great-grandfather, the
      first Jolyon, in Dorset down by the sea. Jon was sensitive as a girl, more
      sensitive than nine out of ten girls of the day; imaginative as one of his
      half-sister June&rsquo;s &ldquo;lame duck&rdquo; painters; affectionate as
      a son of his father and his mother naturally would be. And yet, in his
      inner tissue, there was something of the old founder of his family, a
      secret tenacity of soul, a dread of showing his feelings, a determination
      not to know when he was beaten. Sensitive, imaginative, affectionate boys
      get a bad time at school, but Jon had instinctively kept his nature dark,
      and been but normally unhappy there. Only with his mother had he, up till
      then, been absolutely frank and natural; and when he went home to Robin
      Hill that Saturday his heart was heavy because Fleur had said that he must
      not be frank and natural with her from whom he had never yet kept
      anything, must not even tell her that they had met again, unless he found
      that she knew already. So intolerable did this seem to him that he was
      very near to telegraphing an excuse and staying up in London. And the
      first thing his mother said to him was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve had our little friend of the confectioner&rsquo;s
      there, Jon. What is she like on second thoughts?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With relief, and a high colour, Jon answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! awfully jolly, Mum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her arm pressed his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon had never loved her so much as in that minute which seemed to falsify
      Fleur&rsquo;s fears and to release his soul. He turned to look at her, but
      something in her smiling face&mdash;something which only he perhaps would
      have caught&mdash;stopped the words bubbling up in him. Could fear go with
      a smile? If so, there was fear in her face. And out of Jon tumbled quite
      other words, about farming, Holly, and the Downs. Talking fast, he waited
      for her to come back to Fleur. But she did not. Nor did his father mention
      her, though of course he, too, must know. What deprivation, and killing of
      reality was in his silence about Fleur&mdash;when he was so full of her;
      when his mother was so full of Jon, and his father so full of his mother!
      And so the trio spent the evening of that Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner his mother played; she seemed to play all the things he liked
      best, and he sat with one knee clasped, and his hair standing up where his
      fingers had run through it. He gazed at his mother while she played, but
      he saw Fleur&mdash;Fleur in the moonlit orchard, Fleur in the sunlit
      gravel-pit, Fleur in that fancy dress, swaying, whispering, stooping,
      kissing his forehead. Once, while he listened, he forgot himself and
      glanced at his father in that other easy chair. What was Dad looking like
      that for? The expression on his face was so sad and puzzling. It filled
      him with a sort of remorse, so that he got up and went and sat on the arm
      of his father&rsquo;s chair. From there he could not see his face; and
      again he saw Fleur&mdash;in his mother&rsquo;s hands, slim and white on
      the keys, in the profile of her face and her powdery hair; and down the
      long room in the open window where the May night walked outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went up to bed his mother came into his room. She stood at the
      window, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those cypresses your grandfather planted down there have done
      wonderfully. I always think they look beautiful under a dropping moon. I
      wish you had known your grandfather, Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you married to father when he was alive?&rdquo; asked Jon
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear; he died in &lsquo;92&mdash;very old&mdash;eighty-five, I
      think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Father like him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little, but more subtle, and not quite so solid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, from grandfather&rsquo;s portrait; who painted that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of June&rsquo;s &lsquo;lame ducks.&rsquo; But it&rsquo;s quite
      good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon slipped his hand through his mother&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Tell me about
      the family quarrel, Mum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her arm quivering. &ldquo;No, dear; that&rsquo;s for your Father
      some day, if he thinks fit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was serious,&rdquo; said Jon, with a catch in his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And there was a silence, during which neither knew
      whether the arm or the hand within it were quivering most.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people,&rdquo; said Irene softly, &ldquo;think the moon on her
      back is evil; to me she&rsquo;s always lovely. Look at those cypress
      shadows! Jon, Father says we may go to Italy, you and I, for two months.
      Would you like?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon took his hand from under her arm; his sensation was so sharp and so
      confused. Italy with his mother! A fortnight ago it would have been
      perfection; now it filled him with dismay; he felt that the sudden
      suggestion had to do with Fleur. He stammered out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes; only&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. Ought I&mdash;now I&rsquo;ve
      just begun? I&rsquo;d like to think it over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice answered, cool and gentle:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear; think it over. But better now than when you&rsquo;ve
      begun farming seriously. Italy with you! It would be nice!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon put his arm round her waist, still slim and firm as a girl&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you ought to leave Father?&rdquo; he said feebly,
      feeling very mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father suggested it; he thinks you ought to see Italy at least
      before you settle down to anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of meanness died in Jon; he knew, yes&mdash;he knew&mdash;that
      his father and his mother were not speaking frankly, no more than he
      himself. They wanted to keep him from Fleur. His heart hardened. And, as
      if she felt that process going on, his mother said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, darling. Have a good sleep and think it over. But it
      would be lovely!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed him to her so quickly that he did not see her face. Jon stood
      feeling exactly as he used to when he was a naughty little boy; sore
      because he was not loving, and because he was justified in his own eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Irene, after she had stood a moment in her own room, passed through
      the dressing-room between it and her husband&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will think it over, Jolyon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching her lips that wore a little drawn smile, Jolyon said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better let me tell him, and have done with it. After all,
      Jon has the instincts of a gentleman. He has only to understand&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only! He can&rsquo;t understand; that&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I could have at his age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene caught his hand. &ldquo;You were always more of a realist than Jon;
      and never so innocent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Jolyon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer, isn&rsquo;t
      it? You and I would tell our stories to the world without a particle of
      shame; but our own boy stumps us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never cared whether the world approves or not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jon would not disapprove of us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Jolyon, yes. He&rsquo;s in love, I feel he&rsquo;s in love. And
      he&rsquo;d say: &lsquo;My mother once married without love! How could she
      have!&rsquo; It&rsquo;ll seem to him a crime! And so it was!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon took her hand, and said with a wry smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! why on earth are we born young? Now, if only we were born old
      and grew younger year by year, we should understand how things happen, and
      drop all our cursed intolerance. But you know if the boy is really in
      love, he won&rsquo;t forget, even if he goes to Italy. We&rsquo;re a
      tenacious breed; and he&rsquo;ll know by instinct why he&rsquo;s being
      sent. Nothing will really cure him but the shock of being told.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me try, anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon stood a moment without speaking. Between this devil and this deep
      sea&mdash;the pain of a dreaded disclosure and the grief of losing his
      wife for two months&mdash;he secretly hoped for the devil; yet if she
      wished for the deep sea he must put up with it. After all, it would be
      training for that departure from which there would be no return. And,
      taking her in his arms, he kissed her eyes, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will, my love.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      XI.&mdash;DUET
    </h2>
    <p>
      That &ldquo;small&rdquo; emotion, love, grows amazingly when threatened
      with extinction. Jon reached Paddington station half an hour before his
      time and a full week after, as it seemed to him. He stood at the appointed
      bookstall, amid a crowd of Sunday travellers, in a Harris tweed suit
      exhaling, as it were, the emotion of his thumping heart. He read the names
      of the novels on the book-stall, and bought one at last, to avoid being
      regarded with suspicion by the book-stall clerk. It was called &ldquo;The
      Heart of the Trail!&rdquo; which must mean something, though it did not
      seem to. He also bought &ldquo;The Lady&rsquo;s Mirror&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
      Landsman.&rdquo; Every minute was an hour long, and full of horrid
      imaginings. After nineteen had passed, he saw her with a bag and a porter
      wheeling her luggage. She came swiftly; she came cool. She greeted him as
      if he were a brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First class,&rdquo; she said to the porter, &ldquo;corner seats;
      opposite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon admired her frightful self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we get a carriage to ourselves,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good; it&rsquo;s a stopping train. After Maidenhead perhaps.
      Look natural, Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon screwed his features into a scowl. They got in&mdash;with two other
      beasts!&mdash;oh! heaven! He tipped the porter unnaturally, in his
      confusion. The brute deserved nothing for putting them in there, and
      looking as if he knew all about it into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur hid herself behind &ldquo;The Lady&rsquo;s Mirror.&rdquo; Jon
      imitated her behind &ldquo;The Landsman.&rdquo; The train started. Fleur
      let &ldquo;The Lady&rsquo;s Mirror&rdquo; fall and leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s seemed about fifteen days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, and Jon&rsquo;s face lighted up at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look natural,&rdquo; murmured Fleur, and went off into a bubble of
      laughter. It hurt him. How could he look natural with Italy hanging over
      him? He had meant to break it to her gently, but now he blurted it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want me to go to Italy with Mother for two months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur drooped her eyelids; turned a little pale, and bit her lips. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
      she said. It was all, but it was much.
    </p>
    <p>
      That &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; was like the quick drawback of the wrist in fencing
      ready for riposte. It came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go?&rdquo; said Jon in a strangled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;two months&mdash;it&rsquo;s ghastly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Fleur, &ldquo;six weeks. You&rsquo;ll have
      forgotten me by then. We&rsquo;ll meet in the National Gallery the day
      after you get back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose you&rsquo;ve forgotten me,&rdquo; he muttered into the
      noise of the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some other beast&mdash;&rdquo; murmured Jon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her foot touched his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other beast,&rdquo; she said, lifting &ldquo;The Lady&rsquo;s
      Mirror.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The train stopped; two passengers got out, and one got in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall die,&rsquo; thought Jon, &lsquo;if we&rsquo;re not alone at
      all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The train went on; and again Fleur leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never let go,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon shook his head vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you write to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but you can&mdash;to my Club.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a Club; she was wonderful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you pump Holly?&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I got nothing. I didn&rsquo;t dare pump hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; cried Jon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall find out all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A long silence followed till Fleur said: &ldquo;This is Maidenhead; stand
      by, Jon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The train stopped. The remaining passenger got out. Fleur drew down her
      blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Hang out! Look as much of a beast
      as you can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon blew his nose, and scowled; never in all his life had he scowled like
      that! An old lady recoiled, a young one tried the handle. It turned, but
      the door would not open. The train moved, the young lady darted to another
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What luck!&rdquo; cried Jon. &ldquo;It Jammed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fleur; &ldquo;I was holding it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The train moved out, and Jon fell on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for the corridor,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;and&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips met his. And though their kiss only lasted perhaps ten seconds,
      Jon&rsquo;s soul left his body and went so far beyond, that, when he was
      again sitting opposite that demure figure, he was pale as death. He heard
      her sigh, and the sound seemed to him the most precious he had ever heard&mdash;an
      exquisite declaration that he meant something to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six weeks isn&rsquo;t really long,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and you
      can easily make it six if you keep your head out there, and never seem to
      think of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is just what&rsquo;s really wanted, Jon, to convince them, don&rsquo;t
      you see? If we&rsquo;re just as bad when you come back they&rsquo;ll stop
      being ridiculous about it. Only, I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s not Spain;
      there&rsquo;s a girl in a Goya picture at Madrid who&rsquo;s like me,
      Father says. Only she isn&rsquo;t&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got a copy of her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to Jon like a ray of sunshine piercing through a fog. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      make it Spain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mother won&rsquo;t mind; she&rsquo;s
      never been there. And my Father thinks a lot of Goya.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, he&rsquo;s a painter&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only water-colour,&rdquo; said Jon, with honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we come to Reading, Jon, get out first and go down to
      Caversham lock and wait for me. I&rsquo;ll send the car home and we&rsquo;ll
      walk by the towing-path.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon seized her hand in gratitude, and they sat silent, with the world well
      lost, and one eye on the corridor. But the train seemed to run twice as
      fast now, and its sound was almost lost in that of Jon&rsquo;s sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting near,&rdquo; said Fleur; &ldquo;the towing-path&rsquo;s
      awfully exposed. One more! Oh! Jon, don&rsquo;t forget me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon answered with his kiss. And very soon, a flushed, distracted-looking
      youth could have been seen&mdash;as they say&mdash;leaping from the train
      and hurrying along the platform, searching his pockets for his ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last she rejoined him on the towing-path a little beyond Caversham
      lock he had made an effort, and regained some measure of equanimity. If
      they had to part, he would not make a scene! A breeze by the bright river
      threw the white side of the willow leaves up into the sunlight, and
      followed those two with its faint rustle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told our chauffeur that I was train-giddy,&rdquo; said Fleur.
      &ldquo;Did you look pretty natural as you went out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. What is natural?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural to you to look seriously happy. When I first saw
      you I thought you weren&rsquo;t a bit like other people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what I thought when I saw you. I knew at once I should
      never love anybody else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re absurdly young. And love&rsquo;s young dream is out of
      date, Jon. Besides, it&rsquo;s awfully wasteful. Think of all the fun you
      might have. You haven&rsquo;t begun, even; it&rsquo;s a shame, really. And
      there&rsquo;s me. I wonder!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Confusion came on Jon&rsquo;s spirit. How could she say such things just
      as they were going to part?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel like that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go. I
      shall tell Mother that I ought to try and work. There&rsquo;s always the
      condition of the world!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The condition of the world!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon thrust his hands deep into his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;think of the people starving!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur shook her head. &ldquo;No, no, I never, never will make myself
      miserable for nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing! But there&rsquo;s an awful state of things, and of course
      one ought to help.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, I know all that. But you can&rsquo;t help people, Jon;
      they&rsquo;re hopeless. When you pull them out they only get into another
      hole. Look at them, still fighting and plotting and struggling, though
      they&rsquo;re dying in heaps all the time. Idiots!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you sorry for them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sorry&mdash;yes, but I&rsquo;m not going to make myself unhappy
      about it; that&rsquo;s no good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And they were silent, disturbed by this first glimpse of each other&rsquo;s
      natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think people are brutes and idiots,&rdquo; said Fleur stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re poor wretches,&rdquo; said Jon. It was as if
      they had quarrelled&mdash;and at this supreme and awful moment, with
      parting visible out there in that last gap of the willows!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go and help your poor wretches, and don&rsquo;t think of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon stood still. Sweat broke out on his forehead, and his limbs trembled.
      Fleur too had stopped, and was frowning at the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must believe in things,&rdquo; said Jon with a sort of agony;
      &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all meant to enjoy life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur laughed. &ldquo;Yes; and that&rsquo;s what you won&rsquo;t do, if
      you don&rsquo;t take care. But perhaps your idea of enjoyment is to make
      yourself wretched. There are lots of people like that, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was pale, her eyes had darkened, her lips had thinned. Was it Fleur
      thus staring at the water? Jon had an unreal feeling as if he were passing
      through the scene in a book where the lover has to choose between love and
      duty. But just then she looked round at him. Never was anything so
      intoxicating as that vivacious look. It acted on him exactly as the tug of
      a chain acts on a dog&mdash;brought him up to her with his tail wagging
      and his tongue out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s be silly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;time&rsquo;s
      too short. Look, Jon, you can just see where I&rsquo;ve got to cross the
      river. There, round the bend, where the woods begin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon saw a gable, a chimney or two, a patch of wall through the trees&mdash;and
      felt his heart sink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t dawdle any more. It&rsquo;s no good going beyond
      the next hedge, it gets all open. Let&rsquo;s get on to it and say
      good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They went side by side, hand in hand, silently toward the hedge, where the
      may-flower, both pink and white, was in full bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Club&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Talisman,&rsquo; Stratton Street,
      Piccadilly. Letters there will be quite safe, and I&rsquo;m almost always
      up once a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon nodded. His face had become extremely set, his eyes stared straight
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day&rsquo;s the twenty-third of May,&rdquo; said Fleur; &ldquo;on
      the ninth of July I shall be in front of the &lsquo;Bacchus and Ariadne&rsquo;
      at three o&rsquo;clock; will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel as bad as I it&rsquo;s all right. Let those people
      pass!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A man and woman airing their children went by strung out in Sunday
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last of them passed the wicket gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Domesticity!&rdquo; said Fleur, and blotted herself against the
      hawthorn hedge. The blossom sprayed out above her head, and one pink
      cluster brushed her cheek. Jon put up his hand jealously to keep it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Jon.&rdquo; For a second they stood with hands hard
      clasped. Then their lips met for the third time, and when they parted
      Fleur broke away and fled through the wicket gate. Jon stood where she had
      left him, with his forehead against that pink cluster. Gone! For an
      eternity&mdash;for seven weeks all but two days! And here he was, wasting
      the last sight of her! He rushed to the gate. She was walking swiftly on
      the heels of the straggling children. She turned her head, he saw her hand
      make a little flitting gesture; then she sped on, and the trailing family
      blotted her out from his view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words of a comic song&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;Paddington groan-worst ever known
         He gave a sepulchral Paddington groan&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      came into his head, and he sped incontinently back to Reading station. All
      the way up to London and down to Wansdon he sat with &ldquo;The Heart of
      the Trail&rdquo; open on his knee, knitting in his head a poem so full of
      feeling that it would not rhyme.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      XII.&mdash;CAPRICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fleur sped on. She had need of rapid motion; she was late, and wanted all
      her wits about her when she got in. She passed the islands, the station,
      and hotel, and was about to take the ferry, when she saw a skiff with a
      young man standing up in it, and holding to the bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Forsyte,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;let me put you across. I&rsquo;ve
      come on purpose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in blank amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, I&rsquo;ve been having tea with your people.
      I thought I&rsquo;d save you the last bit. It&rsquo;s on my way, I&rsquo;m
      just off back to Pangbourne. My name&rsquo;s Mont. I saw you at the
      picture-gallery&mdash;you remember&mdash;when your father invited me to
      see his pictures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Fleur; &ldquo;yes&mdash;the handkerchief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To this young man she owed Jon; and, taking his hand, she stepped down
      into the skiff. Still emotional, and a little out of breath, she sat
      silent; not so the young man. She had never heard any one say so much in
      so short a time. He told her his age, twenty-four; his weight, ten stone
      eleven; his place of residence, not far away; described his sensations
      under fire, and what it felt like to be gassed; criticized the Juno,
      mentioned his own conception of that goddess; commented on the Goya copy,
      said Fleur was not too awfully like it; sketched in rapidly the condition
      of England; spoke of Monsieur Profond&mdash;or whatever his name was&mdash;as
      &ldquo;an awful sport&rdquo;; thought her father had some &ldquo;ripping&rdquo;
      pictures and some rather &ldquo;dug-up&rdquo;; hoped he might row down
      again and take her on the river because he was quite trustworthy; inquired
      her opinion of Tchekov, gave her his own; wished they could go to the
      Russian ballet together some time&mdash;considered the name Fleur Forsyte
      simply topping; cursed his people for giving him the name of Michael on
      the top of Mont; outlined his father, and said that if she wanted a good
      book she should read &ldquo;Job&rdquo;; his father was rather like Job
      while Job still had land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Job didn&rsquo;t have land,&rdquo; Fleur murmured; &ldquo;he
      only had flocks and herds and moved on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; answered Michael Mont, &ldquo;I wish my gov&rsquo;nor
      would move on. Not that I want his land. Land&rsquo;s an awful bore in
      these days, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never have it in my family,&rdquo; said Fleur. &ldquo;We have
      everything else. I believe one of my great-uncles once had a sentimental
      farm in Dorset, because we came from there originally, but it cost him
      more than it made him happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he sell it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he kept it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because nobody would buy it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for the old boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t good for him. Father says it soured him. His
      name was Swithin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a corking name!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that we&rsquo;re getting farther off, not nearer? This
      river flows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; cried Mont, dipping his sculls vaguely; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      good to meet a girl who&rsquo;s got wit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But better to meet a young man who&rsquo;s got it in the plural.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mont raised a hand to tear his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; cried Fleur. &ldquo;Your scull!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! It&rsquo;s thick enough to bear a scratch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind sculling?&rdquo; said Fleur severely. &ldquo;I want to
      get in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mont; &ldquo;but when you get in, you see, I shan&rsquo;t
      see you any more to-day. Fini, as the French girl said when she jumped on
      her bed after saying her prayers. Don&rsquo;t you bless the day that gave
      you a French mother, and a name like yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like my name, but Father gave it me. Mother wanted me called
      Marguerite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is absurd. Do you mind calling me M. M. and letting me call
      you F. F.? It&rsquo;s in the spirit of the age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind anything, so long as I get in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mont caught a little crab, and answered: &ldquo;That was a nasty one!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please row.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; And he did for several strokes, looking at her with
      rueful eagerness. &ldquo;Of course, you know,&rdquo; he ejaculated,
      pausing, &ldquo;that I came to see you, not your father&rsquo;s pictures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t row, I shall get out and swim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really and truly? Then I could come in after you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Mont, I&rsquo;m late and tired; please put me on shore at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When she stepped out on to the garden landing-stage he rose, and grasping
      his hair with both hands, looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the irrepressible Mont. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re
      going to say: &lsquo;Out, damned hair!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur whisked round, threw him a wave of her hand. &ldquo;Good-bye, Mr.
      M.M.!&rdquo; she called, and was gone among the rose-trees. She looked at
      her wrist-watch and the windows of the house. It struck her as curiously
      uninhabited. Past six! The pigeons were just gathering to roost, and
      sunlight slanted on the dovecot, on their snowy feathers, and beyond in a
      shower on the top boughs of the woods. The click of billiard-balls came
      from the ingle-nook&mdash;Jack Cardigan, no doubt; a faint rustling, too,
      from an eucalyptus-tree, startling Southerner in this old English garden.
      She reached the verandah and was passing in, but stopped at the sound of
      voices from the drawing-room to her left. Mother! Monsieur Profond! From
      behind the verandah screen which fenced the ingle-nook she heard these
      words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, Annette.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Father know that he called her mother &ldquo;Annette&rdquo;? Always on
      the side of her Father&mdash;as children are ever on one side or the other
      in houses where relations are a little strained&mdash;she stood,
      uncertain. Her mother was speaking in her low, pleasing, slightly metallic
      voice&mdash;one word she caught: &ldquo;Demain.&rdquo; And Profond&rsquo;s
      answer: &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Fleur frowned. A little sound came out
      into the stillness. Then Profond&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo;
      a small stroll.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur darted through the window into the morning-room. There he came from
      the drawing-room, crossing the verandah, down the lawn; and the click of
      billiard-balls which, in listening for other sounds, she had ceased to
      hear, began again. She shook herself, passed into the hall, and opened the
      drawing-room door. Her mother was sitting on the sofa between the windows,
      her knees crossed, her head resting on a cushion, her lips half parted,
      her eyes half closed. She looked extraordinarily handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Here you are, Fleur! Your father is beginning to fuss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the picture-gallery. Go up!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do to-morrow, Mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow? I go up to London with your aunt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you might be. Will you get me a quite plain parasol?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What colour?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Green. They&rsquo;re all going back, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all; you will console your father. Kiss me, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur crossed the room, stooped, received a kiss on her forehead, and went
      out past the impress of a form on the sofa-cushions in the other corner.
      She ran up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur was by no means the old-fashioned daughter who demands the
      regulation of her parents&rsquo; lives in accordance with the standard
      imposed upon herself. She claimed to regulate her own life, not those of
      others; besides, an unerring instinct for what was likely to advantage her
      own case was already at work. In a disturbed domestic atmosphere the heart
      she had set on Jon would have a better chance. None the less was she
      offended, as a flower by a crisping wind. If that man had really been
      kissing her mother it was&mdash;serious, and her father ought to know.
      &ldquo;Demain!&rdquo; &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; And her mother going up to
      Town! She turned into her bedroom and hung out of the window to cool her
      face, which had suddenly grown very hot. Jon must be at the station by
      now! What did her father know about Jon? Probably everything&mdash;pretty
      nearly!
    </p>
    <p>
      She changed her dress, so as to look as if she had been in some time, and
      ran up to the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames was standing stubbornly still before his Alfred Stevens&mdash;the
      picture he loved best. He did not turn at the sound of the door, but she
      knew he had heard, and she knew he was hurt. She came up softly behind
      him, put her arms round his neck, and poked her face over his shoulder
      till her cheek lay against his. It was an advance which had never yet
      failed, but it failed her now, and she augured the worst. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
      he said stonily, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;ve come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all,&rdquo; murmured Fleur, &ldquo;from a bad parent?&rdquo;
      And she rubbed her cheek against his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shook his head so far as that was possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you keep me on tenterhooks like this, putting me off and
      off?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling, it was very harmless.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harmless! Much you know what&rsquo;s harmless and what isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur dropped her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, dear, suppose you tell me; and be quite frank about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And she went over to the window-seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father had turned from his picture, and was staring at his feet. He
      looked very grey. &lsquo;He has nice small feet,&rsquo; she thought,
      catching his eye, at once averted from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my only comfort,&rdquo; said Soames suddenly, &ldquo;and
      you go on like this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur&rsquo;s heart began to beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like what, dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Soames gave her a look which, but for the affection in it, might
      have been called furtive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I told you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      choose to have anything to do with that branch of our family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ducky, but I don&rsquo;t know why I shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames turned on his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going into the reasons,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you
      ought to trust me, Fleur!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The way he spoke those words affected Fleur, but she thought of Jon, and
      was silent, tapping her foot against the wainscot. Unconsciously she had
      assumed a modern attitude, with one leg twisted in and out of the other,
      with her chin on one bent wrist, her other arm across her chest, and its
      hand hugging her elbow; there was not a line of her that was not
      involuted, and yet&mdash;in spite of all&mdash;she retained a certain
      grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew my wishes,&rdquo; Soames went on, &ldquo;and yet you
      stayed on there four days. And I suppose that boy came with you to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur kept her eyes on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you anything,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;I make
      no inquisition where you&rsquo;re concerned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur suddenly stood up, leaning out at the window with her chin on her
      hands. The sun had sunk behind trees, the pigeons were perched, quite
      still, on the edge of the dove-cot; the click of the billiard-balls
      mounted, and a faint radiance shone out below where Jack Cardigan had
      turned the light up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it make you any happier,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;if I
      promise you not to see him for say&mdash;the next six weeks?&rdquo; She
      was not prepared for a sort of tremble in the blankness of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six weeks? Six years&mdash;sixty years more like. Don&rsquo;t
      delude yourself, Fleur; don&rsquo;t delude yourself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur turned in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, what is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames came close enough to see her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re
      foolish enough to have any feeling beyond caprice. That would be too much!&rdquo;
      And he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur, who had never heard him laugh like that, thought: &lsquo;Then it is
      deep! Oh! what is it?&rsquo; And putting her hand through his arm she said
      lightly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course; caprice. Only, I like my caprices and I don&rsquo;t
      like yours, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; said Soames bitterly, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light outside had chilled, and threw a chalky whiteness on the river.
      The trees had lost all gaiety of colour. She felt a sudden hunger for Jon&rsquo;s
      face, for his hands, and the feel of his lips again on hers. And pressing
      her arms tight across her breast she forced out a little light laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O la! la! What a small fuss! as Profond would say. Father, I don&rsquo;t
      like that man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw him stop, and take something out of his breast pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; murmured Fleur; &ldquo;just caprice!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;not caprice!&rdquo; And he tore what
      was in his hands across. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I don&rsquo;t like him
      either!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Fleur softly. &ldquo;There he goes! I hate his
      shoes; they don&rsquo;t make any noise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in the failing light Prosper Profond moved, his hands in his side
      pockets, whistling softly in his beard; he stopped, and glanced up at the
      sky, as if saying: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of that small moon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur drew back. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a great cat?&rdquo; she whispered;
      and the sharp click of the billiard-balls rose, as if Jack Cardigan had
      capped the cat, the moon, caprice, and tragedy with: &ldquo;In off the
      red!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Profond had resumed his stroll, to a teasing little tune in his
      beard. What was it? Oh! yes, from &ldquo;Rigoletto&rdquo;: &ldquo;Donna a
      mobile.&rdquo; Just what he would think! She squeezed her father&rsquo;s
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prowling!&rdquo; she muttered, as he turned the corner of the
      house. It was past that disillusioned moment which divides the day and
      night-still and lingering and warm, with hawthorn scent and lilac scent
      clinging on the riverside air. A blackbird suddenly burst out. Jon would
      be in London by now; in the Park perhaps, crossing the Serpentine,
      thinking of her! A little sound beside her made her turn her eyes; her
      father was again tearing the paper in his hands. Fleur saw it was a
      cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t sell him my Gauguin,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know what your aunt and Imogen see in him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or Mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother!&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Father!&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;He never looks happy&mdash;not
      really happy. I don&rsquo;t want to make him worse, but of course I shall
      have to, when Jon comes back. Oh! well, sufficient unto the night!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to dress,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her room she had a fancy to put on her &ldquo;freak&rdquo; dress. It
      was of gold tissue with little trousers of the same, tightly drawn in at
      the ankles, a page&rsquo;s cape slung from the shoulders, little gold
      shoes, and a gold-winged Mercury helmet; and all over her were tiny gold
      bells, especially on the helmet; so that if she shook her head she pealed.
      When she was dressed she felt quite sick because Jon could not see her; it
      even seemed a pity that the sprightly young man Michael Mont would not
      have a view. But the gong had sounded, and she went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a sensation in the drawing-room. Winifred thought it &ldquo;Most
      amusing.&rdquo; Imogen was enraptured. Jack Cardigan called it &ldquo;stunning,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;ripping,&rdquo; &ldquo;topping,&rdquo; and &ldquo;corking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Profond, smiling with his eyes, said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice
      small dress!&rdquo; Her mother, very handsome in black, sat looking at
      her, and said nothing. It remained for her father to apply the test of
      common sense. &ldquo;What did you put on that thing for? You&rsquo;re not
      going to dance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur spun round, and the bells pealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caprice!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stared at her, and, turning away, gave his arm to Winifred. Jack
      Cardigan took her mother. Prosper Profond took Imogen. Fleur went in by
      herself, with her bells jingling....
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;small&rdquo; moon had soon dropped down, and May night had
      fallen soft and warm, enwrapping with its grape-bloom colour and its
      scents the billion caprices, intrigues, passions, longings, and regrets of
      men and women. Happy was Jack Cardigan who snored into Imogen&rsquo;s
      white shoulder, fit as a flea; or Timothy in his &ldquo;mausoleum,&rdquo;
      too old for anything but baby&rsquo;s slumber. For so many lay awake, or
      dreamed, teased by the criss-cross of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dew fell and the flowers closed; cattle grazed on in the river
      meadows, feeling with their tongues for the grass they could not see; and
      the sheep on the Downs lay quiet as stones. Pheasants in the tall trees of
      the Pangbourne woods, larks on their grassy nests above the gravel-pit at
      Wansdon, swallows in the eaves at Robin Hill, and the sparrows of Mayfair,
      all made a dreamless night of it, soothed by the lack of wind. The Mayfly
      filly, hardly accustomed to her new quarters, scraped at her straw a
      little; and the few night-flitting things&mdash;bats, moths, owls&mdash;were
      vigorous in the warm darkness; but the peace of night lay in the brain of
      all day-time Nature, colourless and still. Men and women, alone, riding
      the hobby-horses of anxiety or love, burned their wavering tapers of dream
      and thought into the lonely hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur, leaning out of her window, heard the hall clock&rsquo;s muffled
      chime of twelve, the tiny splash of a fish, the sudden shaking of an aspen&rsquo;s
      leaves in the puffs of breeze that rose along the river, the distant
      rumble of a night train, and time and again the sounds which none can put
      a name to in the darkness, soft obscure expressions of uncatalogued
      emotions from man and beast, bird and machine, or, maybe, from departed
      Forsytes, Darties, Cardigans, taking night strolls back into a world which
      had once suited their embodied spirits. But Fleur heeded not these sounds;
      her spirit, far from disembodied, fled with swift wing from
      railway-carriage to flowery hedge, straining after Jon, tenacious of his
      forbidden image, and the sound of his voice, which was taboo. And she
      crinkled her nose, retrieving from the perfume of the riverside night that
      moment when his hand slipped between the mayflowers and her cheek. Long
      she leaned out in her freak dress, keen to burn her wings at life&rsquo;s
      candle; while the moths brushed her cheeks on their pilgrimage to the lamp
      on her dressing-table, ignorant that in a Forsyte&rsquo;s house there is
      no open flame. But at last even she felt sleepy, and, forgetting her
      bells, drew quickly in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the open window of his room, alongside Annette&rsquo;s, Soames,
      wakeful too, heard their thin faint tinkle, as it might be shaken from
      stars, or the dewdrops falling from a flower, if one could hear such
      sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Caprice!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell. She&rsquo;s
      wilful. What shall I do? Fleur!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And long into the &ldquo;small&rdquo; night he brooded.

      I.&mdash;MOTHER AND SON
    </h2>
    <p>
      To say that Jon Forsyte accompanied his mother to Spain unwillingly would
      scarcely have been adequate. He went as a well-natured dog goes for a walk
      with its mistress, leaving a choice mutton-bone on the lawn. He went
      looking back at it. Forsytes deprived of their mutton-bones are wont to
      sulk. But Jon had little sulkiness in his composition. He adored his
      mother, and it was his first travel. Spain had become Italy by his simply
      saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go to Spain, Mum; you&rsquo;ve been to
      Italy so many times; I&rsquo;d like it new to both of us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow was subtle besides being naive. He never forgot that he was
      going to shorten the proposed two months into six weeks, and must
      therefore show no sign of wishing to do so. For one with so enticing a
      mutton-bone and so fixed an idea, he made a good enough travelling
      companion, indifferent to where or when he arrived, superior to food, and
      thoroughly appreciative of a country strange to the most travelled
      Englishman. Fleur&rsquo;s wisdom in refusing to write to him was profound,
      for he reached each new place entirely without hope or fever, and could
      concentrate immediate attention on the donkeys and tumbling bells, the
      priests, patios, beggars, children, crowing cocks, sombreros,
      cactus-hedges, old high white villages, goats, olive-trees, greening
      plains, singing birds in tiny cages, watersellers, sunsets, melons, mules,
      great churches, pictures, and swimming grey-brown mountains of a
      fascinating land.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already hot, and they enjoyed an absence of their compatriots. Jon,
      who, so far as he knew, had no blood in him which was not English, was
      often innately unhappy in the presence of his own countrymen. He felt they
      had no nonsense about them, and took a more practical view of things than
      himself. He confided to his mother that he must be an unsociable beast&mdash;it
      was jolly to be away from everybody who could talk about the things people
      did talk about. To which Irene had replied simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Jon, I know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In this isolation he had unparalleled opportunities of appreciating what
      few sons can apprehend, the whole-heartedness of a mother&rsquo;s love.
      Knowledge of something kept from her made him, no doubt, unduly sensitive;
      and a Southern people stimulated his admiration for her type of beauty,
      which he had been accustomed to hear called Spanish, but which he now
      perceived to be no such thing. Her beauty was neither English, French,
      Spanish, nor Italian&mdash;it was special! He appreciated, too, as never
      before, his mother&rsquo;s subtlety of instinct. He could not tell, for
      instance, whether she had noticed his absorption in that Goya picture,
      &ldquo;La Vendimia,&rdquo; or whether she knew that he had slipped back
      there after lunch and again next morning, to stand before it full half an
      hour, a second and third time. It was not Fleur, of course, but like
      enough to give him heartache&mdash;so dear to lovers&mdash;remembering her
      standing at the foot of his bed with her hand held above her head. To keep
      a postcard reproduction of this picture in his pocket and slip it out to
      look at became for Jon one of those bad habits which soon or late disclose
      themselves to eyes sharpened by love, fear, or jealousy. And his mother&rsquo;s
      were sharpened by all three. In Granada he was fairly caught, sitting on a
      sun-warmed stone bench in a little battlemented garden on the Alhambra
      hill, whence he ought to have been looking at the view. His mother, he had
      thought, was examining the potted stocks between the polled acacias, when
      her voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your favourite Goya, Jon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He checked, too late, a movement such as he might have made at school to
      conceal some surreptitious document, and answered: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is most charming; but I think I prefer the &lsquo;Quitasol&rsquo;
      Your father would go crazy about Goya; I don&rsquo;t believe he saw them
      when he was in Spain in &lsquo;92.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In &lsquo;92&mdash;nine years before he had been born! What had been the
      previous existences of his father and his mother? If they had a right to
      share in his future, surely he had a right to share in their pasts. He
      looked up at her. But something in her face&mdash;a look of life
      hard-lived, the mysterious impress of emotions, experience, and
      suffering-seemed, with its incalculable depth, its purchased sanctity, to
      make curiosity impertinent. His mother must have had a wonderfully
      interesting life; she was so beautiful, and so&mdash;so&mdash;but he could
      not frame what he felt about her. He got up, and stood gazing down at the
      town, at the plain all green with crops, and the ring of mountains
      glamorous in sinking sunlight. Her life was like the past of this old
      Moorish city, full, deep, remote&mdash;his own life as yet such a baby of
      a thing, hopelessly ignorant and innocent! They said that in those
      mountains to the West, which rose sheer from the blue-green plain, as if
      out of a sea, Phoenicians had dwelt&mdash;a dark, strange, secret race,
      above the land! His mother&rsquo;s life was as unknown to him, as secret,
      as that Phoenician past was to the town down there, whose cocks crowed and
      whose children played and clamoured so gaily, day in, day out. He felt
      aggrieved that she should know all about him and he nothing about her
      except that she loved him and his father, and was beautiful. His callow
      ignorance&mdash;he had not even had the advantage of the War, like nearly
      everybody else!&mdash;made him small in his own eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, from the balcony of his bedroom, he gazed down on the roof of
      the town&mdash;as if inlaid with honeycomb of jet, ivory, and gold; and,
      long after, he lay awake, listening to the cry of the sentry as the hours
      struck, and forming in his head these lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Voice in the night crying, down in the old sleeping
      Spanish city darkened under her white stars!

     &ldquo;What says the voice-its clear-lingering anguish?
      Just the watchman, telling his dateless tale of safety?
      Just a road-man, flinging to the moon his song?

     &ldquo;No!  Tis one deprived, whose lover&rsquo;s heart is weeping,
      Just his cry: &lsquo;How long?&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The word &ldquo;deprived&rdquo; seemed to him cold and unsatisfactory, but
      &ldquo;bereaved&rdquo; was too final, and no other word of two syllables
      short-long came to him, which would enable him to keep &ldquo;whose lover&rsquo;s
      heart is weeping.&rdquo; It was past two by the time he had finished it,
      and past three before he went to sleep, having said it over to himself at
      least twenty-four times. Next day he wrote it out and enclosed it in one
      of those letters to Fleur which he always finished before he went down, so
      as to have his mind free and companionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon that same day, on the tiled terrace of their hotel, he felt a
      sudden dull pain in the back of his head, a queer sensation in the eyes,
      and sickness. The sun had touched him too affectionately. The next three
      days were passed in semi-darkness, and a dulled, aching indifference to
      all except the feel of ice on his forehead and his mother&rsquo;s smile.
      She never moved from his room, never relaxed her noiseless vigilance,
      which seemed to Jon angelic. But there were moments when he was extremely
      sorry for himself, and wished terribly that Fleur could see him. Several
      times he took a poignant imaginary leave of her and of the earth, tears
      oozing out of his eyes. He even prepared the message he would send to her
      by his mother&mdash;who would regret to her dying day that she had ever
      sought to separate them&mdash;his poor mother! He was not slow, however,
      in perceiving that he had now his excuse for going home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward half-past six each evening came a &ldquo;gasgacha&rdquo; of bells&mdash;a
      cascade of tumbling chimes, mounting from the city below and falling back
      chime on chime. After listening to them on the fourth day he said
      suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be back in England, Mum, the sun&rsquo;s too hot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, darling. As soon as you&rsquo;re fit to travel&rdquo;
      And at once he felt better, and&mdash;meaner.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been out five weeks when they turned toward home. Jon&rsquo;s
      head was restored to its pristine clarity, but he was confined to a hat
      lined by his mother with many layers of orange and green silk and he still
      walked from choice in the shade. As the long struggle of discretion
      between them drew to its close, he wondered more and more whether she
      could see his eagerness to get back to that which she had brought him away
      from. Condemned by Spanish Providence to spend a day in Madrid between
      their trains, it was but natural to go again to the Prado. Jon was
      elaborately casual this time before his Goya girl. Now that he was going
      back to her, he could afford a lesser scrutiny. It was his mother who
      lingered before the picture, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The face and the figure of the girl are exquisite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon heard her uneasily. Did she understand? But he felt once more that he
      was no match for her in self-control and subtlety. She could, in some
      supersensitive way, of which he had not the secret, feel the pulse of his
      thoughts; she knew by instinct what he hoped and feared and wished. It
      made him terribly uncomfortable and guilty, having, beyond most boys, a
      conscience. He wished she would be frank with him, he almost hoped for an
      open struggle. But none came, and steadily, silently, they travelled
      north. Thus did he first learn how much better than men women play a
      waiting game. In Paris they had again to pause for a day. Jon was grieved
      because it lasted two, owing to certain matters in connection with a
      dressmaker; as if his mother, who looked beautiful in anything, had any
      need of dresses! The happiest moment of his travel was that when he
      stepped on to the Folkestone boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing by the bulwark rail, with her arm in his, she said
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you haven&rsquo;t enjoyed it much, Jon. But you&rsquo;ve
      been very sweet to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon squeezed her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it awfully-except for my head lately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that the end had come, he really had, feeling a sort of glamour
      over the past weeks&mdash;a kind of painful pleasure, such as he had tried
      to screw into those lines about the voice in the night crying; a feeling
      such as he had known as a small boy listening avidly to Chopin, yet
      wanting to cry. And he wondered why it was that he couldn&rsquo;t say to
      her quite simply what she had said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were very sweet to me.&rdquo; Odd&mdash;one never could be nice
      and natural like that! He substituted the words: &ldquo;I expect we shall
      be sick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were, and reached London somewhat attenuated, having been away six
      weeks and two days, without a single allusion to the subject which had
      hardly ever ceased to occupy their minds.

    <h2>
      II.&mdash;FATHERS AND DAUGHTERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Deprived of his wife and son by the Spanish adventure, Jolyon found the
      solitude at Robin Hill intolerable. A philosopher when he has all that he
      wants is different from a philosopher when he has not. Accustomed,
      however, to the idea, if not to the reality of resignation, he would
      perhaps have faced it out but for his daughter June. He was a &ldquo;lame
      duck&rdquo; now, and on her conscience. Having achieved&mdash;momentarily&mdash;the
      rescue of an etcher in low circumstances, which she happened to have in
      hand, she appeared at Robin Hill a fortnight after Irene and Jon had gone.
      June was living now in a tiny house with a big studio at Chiswick. A
      Forsyte of the best period, so far as the lack of responsibility was
      concerned, she had overcome the difficulty of a reduced income in a manner
      satisfactory to herself and her father. The rent of the Gallery off Cork
      Street which he had bought for her and her increased income tax happening
      to balance, it had been quite simple&mdash;she no longer paid him the
      rent. The Gallery might be expected now at any time, after eighteen years
      of barren usufruct, to pay its way, so that she was sure her father would
      not feel it. Through this device she still had twelve hundred a year, and
      by reducing what she ate, and, in place of two Belgians in a poor way,
      employing one Austrian in a poorer, practically the same surplus for the
      relief of genius. After three days at Robin Hill she carried her father
      back with her to Town. In those three days she had stumbled on the secret
      he had kept for two years, and had instantly decided to cure him. She
      knew, in fact, the very man. He had done wonders with. Paul Post&mdash;that
      painter a little in advance of Futurism; and she was impatient with her
      father because his eyebrows would go up, and because he had heard of
      neither. Of course, if he hadn&rsquo;t &ldquo;faith&rdquo; he would never
      get well! It was absurd not to have faith in the man who had healed Paul
      Post so that he had only just relapsed, from having overworked, or
      overlived, himself again. The great thing about this healer was that he
      relied on Nature. He had made a special study of the symptoms of Nature&mdash;when
      his patient failed in any natural symptom he supplied the poison which
      caused it&mdash;and there you were! She was extremely hopeful. Her father
      had clearly not been living a natural life at Robin Hill, and she intended
      to provide the symptoms. He was&mdash;she felt&mdash;out of touch with the
      times, which was not natural; his heart wanted stimulating. In the little
      Chiswick house she and the Austrian&mdash;a grateful soul, so devoted to
      June for rescuing her that she was in danger of decease from overwork&mdash;stimulated
      Jolyon in all sorts of ways, preparing him for his cure. But they could
      not keep his eyebrows down; as, for example, when the Austrian woke him at
      eight o&rsquo;clock just as he was going to sleep, or June took The Times
      away from him, because it was unnatural to read &ldquo;that stuff&rdquo;
      when he ought to be taking an interest in &ldquo;life.&rdquo; He never
      failed, indeed, to be astonished at her resource, especially in the
      evenings. For his benefit, as she declared, though he suspected that she
      also got something out of it, she assembled the Age so far as it was
      satellite to genius; and with some solemnity it would move up and down the
      studio before him in the Fox-trot, and that more mental form of dancing&mdash;the
      One-step&mdash;which so pulled against the music, that Jolyon&rsquo;s
      eyebrows would be almost lost in his hair from wonder at the strain it
      must impose on the dancer&rsquo;s will-power. Aware that, hung on the line
      in the Water Colour Society, he was a back number to those with any
      pretension to be called artists, he would sit in the darkest corner he
      could find, and wonder about rhythm, on which so long ago he had been
      raised. And when June brought some girl or young man up to him, he would
      rise humbly to their level so far as that was possible, and think: &lsquo;Dear
      me! This is very dull for them!&rsquo; Having his father&rsquo;s perennial
      sympathy with Youth, he used to get very tired from entering into their
      points of view. But it was all stimulating, and he never failed in
      admiration of his daughter&rsquo;s indomitable spirit. Even genius itself
      attended these gatherings now and then, with its nose on one side; and
      June always introduced it to her father. This, she felt, was exceptionally
      good for him, for genius was a natural symptom he had never had&mdash;fond
      as she was of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain as a man can be that she was his own daughter, he often wondered
      whence she got herself&mdash;her red-gold hair, now greyed into a special
      colour; her direct, spirited face, so different from his own rather folded
      and subtilised countenance, her little lithe figure, when he and most of
      the Forsytes were tall. And he would dwell on the origin of species, and
      debate whether she might be Danish or Celtic. Celtic, he thought, from her
      pugnacity, and her taste in fillets and djibbahs. It was not too much to
      say that he preferred her to the Age with which she was surrounded,
      youthful though, for the greater part, it was. She took, however, too much
      interest in his teeth, for he still had some of those natural symptoms.
      Her dentist at once found &ldquo;Staphylococcus aureus present in pure
      culture&rdquo; (which might cause boils, of course), and wanted to take
      out all the teeth he had and supply him with two complete sets of
      unnatural symptoms. Jolyon&rsquo;s native tenacity was roused, and in the
      studio that evening he developed his objections. He had never had any
      boils, and his own teeth would last his time. Of course&mdash;June
      admitted&mdash;they would last his time if he didn&rsquo;t have them out!
      But if he had more teeth he would have a better heart and his time would
      be longer. His recalcitrance&mdash;she said&mdash;was a symptom of his
      whole attitude; he was taking it lying down. He ought to be fighting. When
      was he going to see the man who had cured Paul Post? Jolyon was very
      sorry, but the fact was he was not going to see him. June chafed.
      Pondridge&mdash;she said&mdash;the healer, was such a fine man, and he had
      such difficulty in making two ends meet, and getting his theories
      recognised. It was just such indifference and prejudice as her father
      manifested which was keeping him back. It would be so splendid for both of
      them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive,&rdquo; said Jolyon, &ldquo;that you are trying to kill
      two birds with one stone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To cure, you mean!&rdquo; cried June.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, it&rsquo;s the same thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June protested. It was unfair to say that without a trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon thought he might not have the chance, of saying it after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; cried June, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re hopeless.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Jolyon, &ldquo;is a fact, but I wish to remain
      hopeless as long as possible. I shall let sleeping dogs lie, my child.
      They are quiet at present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not giving science a chance,&rdquo; cried June.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea how devoted Pondridge is. He puts his science
      before everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just,&rdquo; replied Jolyon, puffing the mild cigarette to which he
      was reduced, &ldquo;as Mr. Paul Post puts his art, eh? Art for Art&rsquo;s
      sake&mdash;Science for the sake of Science. I know those enthusiastic
      egomaniac gentry. They vivisect you without blinking. I&rsquo;m enough of
      a Forsyte to give them the go-by, June.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; said June, &ldquo;if you only knew how old-fashioned
      that sounds! Nobody can afford to be half-hearted nowadays.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; murmured Jolyon, with his smile, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      the only natural symptom with which Mr. Pondridge need not supply me. We
      are born to be extreme or to be moderate, my dear; though, if you&rsquo;ll
      forgive my saying so, half the people nowadays who believe they&rsquo;re
      extreme are really very moderate. I&rsquo;m getting on as well as I can
      expect, and I must leave it at that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June was silent, having experienced in her time the inexorable character
      of her father&rsquo;s amiable obstinacy so far as his own freedom of
      action was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      How he came to let her know why Irene had taken Jon to Spain puzzled
      Jolyon, for he had little confidence in her discretion. After she had
      brooded on the news, it brought a rather sharp discussion, during which he
      perceived to the full the fundamental opposition between her active
      temperament and his wife&rsquo;s passivity. He even gathered that a little
      soreness still remained from that generation-old struggle between them
      over the body of Philip Bosinney, in which the passive had so signally
      triumphed over the active principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to June, it was foolish and even cowardly to hide the past from
      Jon. Sheer opportunism, she called it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which,&rdquo; Jolyon put in mildly, &ldquo;is the working principle
      of real life, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried June, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t really defend her for
      not telling Jon, Dad. If it were left to you, you would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might, but simply because I know he must find out, which will be
      worse than if we told him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you tell him? It&rsquo;s just sleeping dogs
      again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Jolyon, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t for the world
      go against Irene&rsquo;s instinct. He&rsquo;s her boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours too,&rdquo; cried June.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a man&rsquo;s instinct compared with a mother&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think it&rsquo;s very weak of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; said Jolyon, &ldquo;I dare say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was all she got from him; but the matter rankled in her brain.
      She could not bear sleeping dogs. And there stirred in her a tortuous
      impulse to push the matter toward decision. Jon ought to be told, so that
      either his feeling might be nipped in the bud, or, flowering in spite of
      the past, come to fruition. And she determined to see Fleur, and judge for
      herself. When June determined on anything, delicacy became a somewhat
      minor consideration. After all, she was Soames&rsquo; cousin, and they
      were both interested in pictures. She would go and tell him that he ought
      to buy a Paul Post, or perhaps a piece of sculpture by Boris Strumolowski,
      and of course she would say nothing to her father. She went on the
      following Sunday, looking so determined that she had some difficulty in
      getting a cab at Reading station. The river country was lovely in those
      days of her own month, and June ached at its loveliness. She who had
      passed through this life without knowing what union was had a love of
      natural beauty which was almost madness. And when she came to that choice
      spot where Soames had pitched his tent, she dismissed her cab, because,
      business over, she wanted to revel in the bright water and the woods. She
      appeared at his front door, therefore, as a mere pedestrian, and sent in
      her card. It was in June&rsquo;s character to know that when her nerves
      were fluttering she was doing something worth while. If one&rsquo;s nerves
      did not flutter, she was taking the line of least resistance, and knew
      that nobleness was not obliging her. She was conducted to a drawing-room,
      which, though not in her style, showed every mark of fastidious elegance.
      Thinking, &lsquo;Too much taste&mdash;too many knick-knacks,&rsquo; she
      saw in an old lacquer-framed mirror the figure of a girl coming in from
      the verandah. Clothed in white, and holding some white roses in her hand,
      she had, reflected in that silvery-grey pool of glass, a vision-like
      appearance, as if a pretty ghost had come out of the green garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; said June, turning round. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
      cousin of your father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I saw you in that confectioner&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my young stepbrother. Is your father in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be directly. He&rsquo;s only gone for a little walk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June slightly narrowed her blue eyes, and lifted her decided chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name&rsquo;s Fleur, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ve heard of you
      from Holly. What do you think of Jon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl lifted the roses in her hand, looked at them, and answered
      calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite a nice boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit like Holly or me, is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s cool,&rsquo; thought June.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly the girl said: &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d tell me why our
      families don&rsquo;t get on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Confronted with the question she had advised her father to answer, June
      was silent; whether because this girl was trying to get something out of
      her, or simply because what one would do theoretically is not always what
      one will do when it comes to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;the surest way to make
      people find out the worst is to keep them ignorant. My father&rsquo;s told
      me it was a quarrel about property. But I don&rsquo;t believe it; we&rsquo;ve
      both got heaps. They wouldn&rsquo;t have been so bourgeois as all that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June flushed. The word applied to her grandfather and father offended her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandfather,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was very generous, and my
      father is, too; neither of them was in the least bourgeois.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what was it then?&rdquo; repeated the girl: Conscious that
      this young Forsyte meant having what she wanted, June at once determined
      to prevent her, and to get something for herself instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you want to know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl smelled at her roses. &ldquo;I only want to know because they won&rsquo;t
      tell me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was about property, but there&rsquo;s more than one kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes it worse. Now I really must know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June&rsquo;s small and resolute face quivered. She was wearing a round
      cap, and her hair had fluffed out under it. She looked quite young at that
      moment, rejuvenated by encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I saw you drop your handkerchief.
      Is there anything between you and Jon? Because, if so, you&rsquo;d better
      drop that too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl grew paler, but she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were, that isn&rsquo;t the way to make me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the gallantry of that reply, June held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you; but I don&rsquo;t like your father; I never have. We
      may as well be frank.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come down to tell him that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June laughed. &ldquo;No; I came down to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This girl could fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m two and a half times your age,&rdquo; said June, &ldquo;but
      I quite sympathize. It&rsquo;s horrid not to have one&rsquo;s own way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled again. &ldquo;I really think you might tell me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How the child stuck to her point
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my secret. But I&rsquo;ll see what I can do, because
      I think both you and Jon ought to be told. And now I&rsquo;ll say
      good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you wait and see Father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June shook her head. &ldquo;How can I get over to the other side?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll row you across.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said June impulsively, &ldquo;next time you&rsquo;re
      in London, come and see me. This is where I live. I generally have young
      people in the evening. But I shouldn&rsquo;t tell your father that you&rsquo;re
      coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching her scull the skiff across, June thought: &lsquo;She&rsquo;s
      awfully pretty and well made. I never thought Soames would have a daughter
      as pretty as this. She and Jon would make a lovely couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instinct to couple, starved within herself, was always at work in
      June. She stood watching Fleur row back; the girl took her hand off a
      scull to wave farewell, and June walked languidly on between the meadows
      and the river, with an ache in her heart. Youth to youth, like the
      dragon-flies chasing each other, and love like the sun warming them
      through and through. Her youth! So long ago&mdash;when Phil and she&mdash;And
      since? Nothing&mdash;no one had been quite what she had wanted. And so she
      had missed it all. But what a coil was round those two young things, if
      they really were in love, as Holly would have it&mdash;as her father, and
      Irene, and Soames himself seemed to dread. What a coil, and what a
      barrier! And the itch for the future, the contempt, as it were, for what
      was overpast, which forms the active principle, moved in the heart of one
      who ever believed that what one wanted was more important than what other
      people did not want. From the bank, awhile, in the warm summer stillness,
      she watched the water-lily plants and willow leaves, the fishes rising;
      sniffed the scent of grass and meadow-sweet, wondering how she could force
      everybody to be happy. Jon and Fleur! Two little lame ducks&mdash;charming
      callow yellow little ducks! A great pity! Surely something could be done!
      One must not take such situations lying down. She walked on, and reached a
      station, hot and cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, faithful to the impulse toward direct action, which made
      many people avoid her, she said to her father:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;ve been down to see young Fleur. I think she&rsquo;s
      very attractive. It&rsquo;s no good hiding our heads under our wings, is
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The startled Jolyon set down his barley-water, and began crumbling his
      bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what you appear to be doing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do
      you realise whose daughter she is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t the dead past bury its dead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain things can never be buried.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I disagree,&rdquo; said June. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that which stands
      in the way of all happiness and progress. You don&rsquo;t understand the
      Age, Dad. It&rsquo;s got no use for outgrown things. Why do you think it
      matters so terribly that Jon should know about his mother? Who pays any
      attention to that sort of thing now? The marriage laws are just as they
      were when Soames and Irene couldn&rsquo;t get a divorce, and you had to
      come in. We&rsquo;ve moved, and they haven&rsquo;t. So nobody cares.
      Marriage without a decent chance of relief is only a sort of slave-owning;
      people oughtn&rsquo;t to own each other. Everybody sees that now. If Irene
      broke such laws, what does it matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for me to disagree there,&rdquo; said Jolyon;
      &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s all quite beside the mark. This is a matter of
      human feeling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; cried June, &ldquo;the human feeling of
      those two young things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Jolyon with gentle exasperation; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
      talking nonsense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. If they prove to be really fond of each other, why
      should they be made unhappy because of the past?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t lived that past. I have&mdash;through the
      feelings of my wife; through my own nerves and my imagination, as only one
      who is devoted can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June, too, rose, and began to wander restlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;she were the daughter of
      Philip Bosinney, I could understand you better. Irene loved him, she never
      loved Soames.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon uttered a deep sound-the sort of noise an Italian peasant woman
      utters to her mule. His heart had begun beating furiously, but he paid no
      attention to it, quite carried away by his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shows how little you understand. Neither I nor Jon, if I know
      him, would mind a love-past. It&rsquo;s the brutality of a union without
      love. This girl is the daughter of the man who once owned Jon&rsquo;s
      mother as a negro-slave was owned. You can&rsquo;t lay that ghost; don&rsquo;t
      try to, June! It&rsquo;s asking us to see Jon joined to the flesh and
      blood of the man who possessed Jon&rsquo;s mother against her will. It&rsquo;s
      no good mincing words; I want it clear once for all. And now I mustn&rsquo;t
      talk any more, or I shall have to sit up with this all night.&rdquo; And,
      putting his hand over his heart, Jolyon turned his back on his daughter
      and stood looking at the river Thames.
    </p>
    <p>
      June, who by nature never saw a hornet&rsquo;s nest until she had put her
      head into it, was seriously alarmed. She came and slipped her arm through
      his. Not convinced that he was right, and she herself wrong, because that
      was not natural to her, she was yet profoundly impressed by the obvious
      fact that the subject was very bad for him. She rubbed her cheek against
      his shoulder, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After taking her elderly cousin across, Fleur did not land at once, but
      pulled in among the reeds, into the sunshine. The peaceful beauty of the
      afternoon seduced for a little one not much given to the vague and poetic.
      In the field beyond the bank where her skiff lay up, a machine drawn by a
      grey horse was turning an early field of hay. She watched the grass
      cascading over and behind the light wheels with fascination&mdash;it
      looked so cool and fresh. The click and swish blended with the rustle of
      the willows and the poplars, and the cooing of a wood-pigeon, in a true
      river song. Alongside, in the deep green water, weeds, like yellow snakes,
      were writhing and nosing with the current; pied cattle on the farther side
      stood in the shade lazily swishing their tails. It was an afternoon to
      dream. And she took out Jon&rsquo;s letters&mdash;not flowery effusions,
      but haunted in their recital of things seen and done by a longing very
      agreeable to her, and all ending &ldquo;Your devoted J.&rdquo; Fleur was
      not sentimental, her desires were ever concrete and concentrated, but what
      poetry there was in the daughter of Soames and Annette had certainly in
      those weeks of waiting gathered round her memories of Jon. They all
      belonged to grass and blossom, flowers and running water. She enjoyed him
      in the scents absorbed by her crinkling nose. The stars could persuade her
      that she was standing beside him in the centre of the map of Spain; and of
      an early morning the dewy cobwebs, the hazy sparkle and promise of the day
      down in the garden, were Jon personified to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two white swans came majestically by, while she was reading his letters,
      followed by their brood of six young swans in a line, with just so much
      water between each tail and head, a flotilla of grey destroyers. Fleur
      thrust her letters back, got out her sculls, and pulled up to the
      landing-stage. Crossing the lawn, she wondered whether she should tell her
      father of June&rsquo;s visit. If he learned of it from the butler, he
      might think it odd if she did not. It gave her, too, another chance to
      startle out of him the reason of the feud. She went, therefore, up the
      road to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames had gone to look at a patch of ground on which the Local
      Authorities were proposing to erect a Sanatorium for people with weak
      lungs. Faithful to his native individualism, he took no part in local
      affairs, content to pay the rates which were always going up. He could
      not, however, remain indifferent to this new and dangerous scheme. The
      site was not half a mile from his own house. He was quite of opinion that
      the country should stamp out tuberculosis; but this was not the place. It
      should be done farther away. He took, indeed, an attitude common to all
      true Forsytes, that disability of any sort in other people was not his
      affair, and the State should do its business without prejudicing in any
      way the natural advantages which he had acquired or inherited. Francie,
      the most free-spirited Forsyte of his generation (except perhaps that
      fellow Jolyon) had once asked him in her malicious way: &ldquo;Did you
      ever see the name Forsyte in a subscription list, Soames?&rdquo; That was
      as it might be, but a Sanatorium would depreciate the neighbourhood, and
      he should certainly sign the petition which was being got up against it.
      Returning with this decision fresh within him, he saw Fleur coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was showing him more affection of late, and the quiet time down here
      with her in this summer weather had been making him feel quite young;
      Annette was always running up to Town for one thing or another, so that he
      had Fleur to himself almost as much as he could wish. To be sure, young
      Mont had formed a habit of appearing on his motor-cycle almost every other
      day. Thank goodness, the young fellow had shaved off his
      half-toothbrushes, and no longer looked like a mountebank! With a girl
      friend of Fleur&rsquo;s who was staying in the house, and a neighbouring
      youth or so, they made two couples after dinner, in the hall, to the music
      of the electric pianola, which performed Fox-trots unassisted, with a
      surprised shine on its expressive surface. Annette, even, now and then
      passed gracefully up and down in the arms of one or other of the young
      men. And Soames, coming to the drawing-room door, would lift his nose a
      little sideways, and watch them, waiting to catch a smile from Fleur; then
      move back to his chair by the drawing-room hearth, to peruse The Times or
      some other collector&rsquo;s price list. To his ever-anxious eyes Fleur
      showed no signs of remembering that caprice of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached him on the dusty road, he slipped his hand within her
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, do you think, has been to see you, Dad? She couldn&rsquo;t
      wait! Guess!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never guess,&rdquo; said Soames uneasily. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cousin, June Forsyte.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite unconsciously Soames gripped her arm. &ldquo;What did she want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But it was rather breaking through the feud,
      wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feud? What feud?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one that exists in your imagination, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames dropped her arm. Was she mocking, or trying to draw him on?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she wanted me to buy a picture,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Perhaps it was just family affection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s only a first cousin once removed,&rdquo; muttered
      Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the daughter of your enemy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean by that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, dear; I thought he was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enemy!&rdquo; repeated Soames. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ancient history. I
      don&rsquo;t know where you get your notions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From June Forsyte.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It had come to her as an inspiration that if he thought she knew, or were
      on the edge of knowledge, he would tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames was startled, but she had underrated his caution and tenacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know,&rdquo; he said coldly, &ldquo;why do you plague me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur saw that she had overreached herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to plague you, darling. As you say, why want to
      know more? Why want to know anything of that &lsquo;small&rsquo; mystery&mdash;Je
      m&rsquo;en fiche, as Profond says?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That chap!&rdquo; said Soames profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That chap, indeed, played a considerable, if invisible, part this summer&mdash;for
      he had not turned up again. Ever since the Sunday when Fleur had drawn
      attention to him prowling on the lawn, Soames had thought of him a good
      deal, and always in connection with Annette, for no reason, except that
      she was looking handsomer than for some time past. His possessive
      instinct, subtle, less formal, more elastic since the War, kept all
      misgiving underground. As one looks on some American river, quiet and
      pleasant, knowing that an alligator perhaps is lying in the mud with his
      snout just raised and indistinguishable from a snag of wood&mdash;so
      Soames looked on the river of his own existence, subconscious of Monsieur
      Profond, refusing to see more than the suspicion of his snout. He had at
      this epoch in his life practically all he wanted, and was as nearly happy
      as his nature would permit. His senses were at rest; his affections found
      all the vent they needed in his daughter; his collection was well known,
      his money well invested; his health excellent, save for a touch of liver
      now and again; he had not yet begun to worry seriously about what would
      happen after death, inclining to think that nothing would happen. He
      resembled one of his own gilt-edged securities, and to knock the gilt off
      by seeing anything he could avoid seeing would be, he felt instinctively,
      perverse and retrogressive. Those two crumpled rose-leaves, Fleur&rsquo;s
      caprice and Monsieur Profond&rsquo;s snout, would level away if he lay on
      them industriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Chance, which visits the lives of even the best-invested
      Forsytes, put a clue into Fleur&rsquo;s hands. Her father came down to
      dinner without a handkerchief, and had occasion to blow his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you one, dear,&rdquo; she had said, and ran
      upstairs. In the sachet where she sought for it&mdash;an old sachet of
      very faded silk&mdash;there were two compartments: one held handkerchiefs;
      the other was buttoned, and contained something flat and hard. By some
      childish impulse Fleur unbuttoned it. There was a frame and in it a
      photograph of herself as a little girl. She gazed at it, fascinated, as
      one is by one&rsquo;s own presentment. It slipped under her fidgeting
      thumb, and she saw that another photograph was behind. She pressed her own
      down further, and perceived a face, which she seemed to know, of a young
      woman, very good-looking, in a very old style of evening dress. Slipping
      her own photograph up over it again, she took out a handkerchief and went
      down. Only on the stairs did she identify that face. Surely&mdash;surely
      Jon&rsquo;s mother! The conviction came as a shock. And she stood still in
      a flurry of thought. Why, of course! Jon&rsquo;s father had married the
      woman her father had wanted to marry, had cheated him out of her, perhaps.
      Then, afraid of showing by her manner that she had lighted on his secret,
      she refused to think further, and, shaking out the silk handkerchief,
      entered the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I chose the softest, Father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;I only use those after a
      cold. Never mind!&rdquo;

    <p>
      That evening passed for Fleur in putting two and two together; recalling
      the look on her father&rsquo;s face in the confectioner&rsquo;s shop&mdash;a
      look strange and coldly intimate, a queer look. He must have loved that
      woman very much to have kept her photograph all this time, in spite of
      having lost her. Unsparing and matter-of-fact, her mind darted to his
      relations with her own mother. Had he ever really loved her? She thought
      not. Jon was the son of the woman he had really loved. Surely, then, he
      ought not to mind his daughter loving him; it only wanted getting used to.
      And a sigh of sheer relief was caught in the folds of her nightgown
      slipping over her head.

    <h2>
      III.&mdash;MEETINGS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Youth only recognises Age by fits and starts. Jon, for one, had never
      really seen his father&rsquo;s age till he came back from Spain. The face
      of the fourth Jolyon, worn by waiting, gave him quite a shock&mdash;it
      looked so wan and old. His father&rsquo;s mask had been forced awry by the
      emotion of the meeting, so that the boy suddenly realised how much he must
      have felt their absence. He summoned to his aid the thought: &lsquo;Well,
      I didn&rsquo;t want to go!&rsquo; It was out of date for Youth to defer to
      Age. But Jon was by no means typically modern. His father had always been
      &ldquo;so jolly&rdquo; to him, and to feel that one meant to begin again
      at once the conduct which his father had suffered six weeks&rsquo;
      loneliness to cure was not agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the question, &ldquo;Well, old man, how did the great Goya strike you?&rdquo;
      his conscience pricked him badly. The great Goya only existed because he
      had created a face which resembled Fleur&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of their return, he went to bed full of compunction; but
      awoke full of anticipation. It was only the fifth of July, and no meeting
      was fixed with Fleur until the ninth. He was to have three days at home
      before going back to farm. Somehow he must contrive to see her!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lives of men an inexorable rhythm, caused by the need for trousers,
      not even the fondest parents can deny. On the second day, therefore, Jon
      went to Town, and having satisfied his conscience by ordering what was
      indispensable in Conduit Street, turned his face toward Piccadilly.
      Stratton Street, where her Club was, adjoined Devonshire House. It would
      be the merest chance that she should be at her Club. But he dawdled down
      Bond Street with a beating heart, noticing the superiority of all other
      young men to himself. They wore their clothes with such an air; they had
      assurance; they were old. He was suddenly overwhelmed by the conviction
      that Fleur must have forgotten him. Absorbed in his own feeling for her
      all these weeks, he had mislaid that possibility. The corners of his mouth
      drooped, his hands felt clammy. Fleur with the pick of youth at the beck
      of her smile-Fleur incomparable! It was an evil moment. Jon, however, had
      a great idea that one must be able to face anything. And he braced himself
      with that dour reflection in front of a bric-a-brac shop. At this
      high-water mark of what was once the London season, there was nothing to
      mark it out from any other except a grey top hat or two, and the sun. Jon
      moved on, and turning the corner into Piccadilly, ran into Val Dartie
      moving toward the Iseeum Club, to which he had just been elected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! young man! Where are you off to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon gushed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been to my tailor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val looked him up and down. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good! I&rsquo;m going in
      here to order some cigarettes; then come and have some lunch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon thanked him. He might get news of her from Val!
    </p>
    <p>
      The condition of England, that nightmare of its Press and Public men, was
      seen in different perspective within the tobacconist&rsquo;s which they
      now entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; precisely the cigarette I used to supply your father
      with. Bless me! Mr. Montague Dartie was a customer here from&mdash;let me
      see&mdash;the year Melton won the Derby. One of my very best customers he
      was.&rdquo; A faint smile illumined the tobacconist&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Many&rsquo;s
      the tip he&rsquo;s given me, to be sure! I suppose he took a couple of
      hundred of these every week, year in, year out, and never changed his
      cigarette. Very affable gentleman, brought me a lot of custom. I was sorry
      he met with that accident. One misses an old customer like him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val smiled. His father&rsquo;s decease had closed an account which had
      been running longer, probably, than any other; and in a ring of smoke
      puffed out from that time-honoured cigarette he seemed to see again his
      father&rsquo;s face, dark, good-looking, moustachioed, a little puffy, in
      the only halo it had earned. His father had his fame here, anyway&mdash;a
      man who smoked two hundred cigarettes a week, who could give tips, and run
      accounts for ever! To his tobacconist a hero! Even that was some
      distinction to inherit!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pay cash,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;how much?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To his son, sir, and cash&mdash;ten and six. I shall never forget
      Mr. Montague Dartie. I&rsquo;ve known him stand talkin&rsquo; to me half
      an hour. We don&rsquo;t get many like him now, with everybody in such a
      hurry. The War was bad for manners, sir&mdash;it was bad for manners. You
      were in it, I see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Val, tapping his knee, &ldquo;I got this in the war
      before. Saved my life, I expect. Do you want any cigarettes, Jon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather ashamed, Jon murmured, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t smoke, you know,&rdquo;
      and saw the tobacconist&rsquo;s lips twisted, as if uncertain whether to
      say &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s your chance, sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Val; &ldquo;keep off it while you
      can. You&rsquo;ll want it when you take a knock. This is really the same
      tobacco, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Identical, sir; a little dearer, that&rsquo;s all. Wonderful
      staying power&mdash;the British Empire, I always say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send me down a hundred a week to this address, and invoice it
      monthly. Come on, Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon entered the Iseeum with curiosity. Except to lunch now and then at the
      Hotch-Potch with his father, he had never been in a London Club. The
      Iseeum, comfortable and unpretentious, did not move, could not, so long as
      George Forsyte sat on its Committee, where his culinary acumen was almost
      the controlling force. The Club had made a stand against the newly rich,
      and it had taken all George Forsyte&rsquo;s prestige, and praise of him as
      a &ldquo;good sportsman,&rdquo; to bring in Prosper Profond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two were lunching together when the half-brothers-in-law entered the
      dining-room, and attracted by George&rsquo;s forefinger, sat down at their
      table, Val with his shrewd eyes and charming smile, Jon with solemn lips
      and an attractive shyness in his glance. There was an air of privilege
      around that corner table, as though past masters were eating there. Jon
      was fascinated by the hypnotic atmosphere. The waiter, lean in the chaps,
      pervaded with such free-masonical deference. He seemed to hang on George
      Forsyte&rsquo;s lips, to watch the gloat in his eye with a kind of
      sympathy, to follow the movements of the heavy club-marked silver fondly.
      His liveried arm and confidential voice alarmed Jon, they came so secretly
      over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except for George&rsquo;s &ldquo;Your grandfather tipped me once; he was a
      deuced good judge of a cigar!&rdquo; neither he nor the other past master
      took any notice of him, and he was grateful for this. The talk was all
      about the breeding, points, and prices of horses, and he listened to it
      vaguely at first, wondering how it was possible to retain so much
      knowledge in a head. He could not take his eyes off the dark past master&mdash;what
      he said was so deliberate and discouraging&mdash;such heavy, queer,
      smiled-out words. Jon was thinking of butterflies, when he heard him say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see Mr. Soames Forsyde take an interest in &lsquo;orses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Soames! He&rsquo;s too dry a file!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his might Jon tried not to grow red, while the dark past master
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His daughter&rsquo;s an attractive small girl. Mr. Soames Forsyde
      is a bit old-fashioned. I want to see him have a pleasure some day.&rdquo;
      George Forsyte grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry; he&rsquo;s not so miserable as he looks. He&rsquo;ll
      never show he&rsquo;s enjoying anything&mdash;they might try and take it
      from him. Old Soames! Once bit, twice shy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jon,&rdquo; said Val, hastily, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve
      finished, we&rsquo;ll go and have coffee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who were those?&rdquo; Jon asked, on the stairs. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      quite&mdash;-&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old George Forsyte is a first cousin of your father&rsquo;s and of
      my Uncle Soames. He&rsquo;s always been here. The other chap, Profond, is
      a queer fish. I think he&rsquo;s hanging round Soames&rsquo; wife, if you
      ask me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon looked at him, startled. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s awful,&rdquo; he
      said: &ldquo;I mean&mdash;for Fleur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose Fleur cares very much; she&rsquo;s very
      up-to-date.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very green, Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon grew red. &ldquo;Mothers,&rdquo; he stammered angrily, &ldquo;are
      different.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Val suddenly; &ldquo;but things
      aren&rsquo;t what they were when I was your age. There&rsquo;s a &lsquo;To-morrow
      we die&rsquo; feeling. That&rsquo;s what old George meant about my Uncle
      Soames. He doesn&rsquo;t mean to die to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon said, quickly: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter between him and my
      father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stable secret, Jon. Take my advice, and bottle up. You&rsquo;ll do
      no good by knowing. Have a liqueur?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate the way people keep things from one,&rdquo; he muttered,
      &ldquo;and then sneer at one for being green.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can ask Holly. If she won&rsquo;t tell you, you&rsquo;ll
      believe it&rsquo;s for your own good, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon got up. &ldquo;I must go now; thanks awfully for the lunch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val smiled up at him half-sorry, and yet amused. The boy looked so upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! See you on Friday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; murmured Jon.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he did not. This conspiracy of silence made him desperate. It was
      humiliating to be treated like a child! He retraced his moody steps to
      Stratton Street. But he would go to her Club now, and find out the worst!
      To his enquiry the reply was that Miss Forsyte was not in the Club. She
      might be in perhaps later. She was often in on Monday&mdash;they could not
      say. Jon said he would call again, and, crossing into the Green Park,
      flung himself down under a tree. The sun was bright, and a breeze
      fluttered the leaves of the young lime-tree beneath which he lay; but his
      heart ached. Such darkness seemed gathered round his happiness. He heard
      Big Ben chime &ldquo;Three&rdquo; above the traffic. The sound moved
      something in him, and, taking out a piece of paper, he began to scribble
      on it with a pencil. He had jotted a stanza, and was searching the grass
      for another verse, when something hard touched his shoulder-a green
      parasol. There above him stood Fleur!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told me you&rsquo;d been, and were coming back. So I thought
      you might be out here; and you are&mdash;it&rsquo;s rather wonderful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Fleur! I thought you&rsquo;d have forgotten me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I told you that I shouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon seized her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much luck! Let&rsquo;s get away from this side.&rdquo;
      He almost dragged her on through that too thoughtfully regulated Park, to
      find some cover where they could sit and hold each other&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t anybody cut in?&rdquo; he said, gazing round at her
      lashes, in suspense above her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a young idiot, but he doesn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon felt a twitch of compassion for the-young idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve had sunstroke; I didn&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really! Was it interesting?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Mother was an angel. Has anything happened to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Except that I think I&rsquo;ve found out what&rsquo;s
      wrong between our families, Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart began beating very fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe my father wanted to marry your mother, and your father
      got her instead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came on a photo of her; it was in a frame behind a photo of me.
      Of course, if he was very fond of her, that would have made him pretty
      mad, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon thought for a minute. &ldquo;Not if she loved my father best.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose they were engaged?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we were engaged, and you found you loved somebody better, I
      might go cracked, but I shouldn&rsquo;t grudge it you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should. You mustn&rsquo;t ever do that with me, Jon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! Not much!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that he&rsquo;s ever really cared for my
      mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon was silent. Val&rsquo;s words&mdash;the two past masters in the Club!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, we don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; went on Fleur; &ldquo;it may
      have been a great shock. She may have behaved badly to him. People do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we know much
      about our fathers and mothers. We just see them in the light of the way
      they treat us; but they&rsquo;ve treated other people, you know, before we
      were born-plenty, I expect. You see, they&rsquo;re both old. Look at your
      father, with three separate families!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any place,&rdquo; cried Jon, &ldquo;in all this
      beastly London where we can be alone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a taxi.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get one, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were installed, Fleur asked suddenly: &ldquo;Are you going back
      to Robin Hill? I should like to see where you live, Jon. I&rsquo;m staying
      with my aunt for the night, but I could get back in time for dinner. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t come to the house, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon gazed at her enraptured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid! I can show it you from the copse, we shan&rsquo;t meet
      anybody. There&rsquo;s a train at four.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The god of property and his Forsytes great and small, leisured, official,
      commercial, or professional, like the working classes, still worked their
      seven hours a day, so that those two of the fourth generation travelled
      down to Robin Hill in an empty first-class carriage, dusty and sun-warmed,
      of that too early train. They travelled in blissful silence, holding each
      other&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the station they saw no one except porters, and a villager or two
      unknown to Jon, and walked out up the lane, which smelled of dust and
      honeysuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Jon&mdash;sure of her now, and without separation before him&mdash;it
      was a miraculous dawdle, more wonderful than those on the Downs, or along
      the river Thames. It was love-in-a-mist&mdash;one of those illumined pages
      of Life, where every word and smile, and every light touch they gave each
      other were as little gold and red and blue butterflies and flowers and
      birds scrolled in among the text&mdash;a happy communing, without
      afterthought, which lasted thirty-seven minutes. They reached the coppice
      at the milking hour. Jon would not take her as far as the farmyard; only
      to where she could see the field leading up to the gardens, and the house
      beyond. They turned in among the larches, and suddenly, at the winding of
      the path, came on Irene, sitting on an old log seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various kinds of shocks: to the vertebrae; to the nerves; to
      moral sensibility; and, more potent and permanent, to personal dignity.
      This last was the shock Jon received, coming thus on his mother. He became
      suddenly conscious that he was doing an indelicate thing. To have brought
      Fleur down openly&mdash;yes! But to sneak her in like this! Consumed with
      shame, he put on a front as brazen as his nature would permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur was smiling, a little defiantly; his mother&rsquo;s startled face
      was changing quickly to the impersonal and gracious. It was she who
      uttered the first words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to see you. It was nice of Jon to think of
      bringing you down to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t coming to the house,&rdquo; Jon blurted out.
      &ldquo;I just wanted Fleur to see where I lived.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come up and have tea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling that he had but aggravated his breach of breeding, he heard Fleur
      answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks very much; I have to get back to dinner. I met Jon by
      accident, and we thought it would be rather jolly just to see his home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How self-possessed she was!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; but you must have tea. We&rsquo;ll send you down to the
      station. My husband will enjoy seeing you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression of his mother&rsquo;s eyes, resting on him for a moment,
      cast Jon down level with the ground&mdash;a true worm. Then she led on,
      and Fleur followed her. He felt like a child, trailing after those two,
      who were talking so easily about Spain and Wansdon, and the house up there
      beyond the trees and the grassy slope. He watched the fencing of their
      eyes, taking each other in&mdash;the two beings he loved most in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see his father sitting under the oaktree; and suffered in advance
      all the loss of caste he must go through in the eyes of that tranquil
      figure, with his knees crossed, thin, old, and elegant; already he could
      feel the faint irony which would come into his voice and smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Fleur Forsyte, Jolyon; Jon brought her down to see the
      house. Let&rsquo;s have tea at once&mdash;she has to catch a train. Jon,
      tell them, dear, and telephone to the Dragon for a car.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To leave her alone with them was strange, and yet, as no doubt his mother
      had foreseen, the least of evils at the moment; so he ran up into the
      house. Now he would not see Fleur alone again&mdash;not for a minute, and
      they had arranged no further meeting! When he returned under cover of the
      maids and teapots, there was not a trace of awkwardness beneath the tree;
      it was all within himself, but not the less for that. They were talking of
      the Gallery off Cork Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We back numbers,&rdquo; his father was saying, &ldquo;are awfully
      anxious to find out why we can&rsquo;t appreciate the new stuff; you and
      Jon must tell us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s supposed to be satiric, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said
      Fleur.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw his father&rsquo;s smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satiric? Oh! I think it&rsquo;s more than that. What do you say,
      Jon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know at all,&rdquo; stammered Jon. His father&rsquo;s
      face had a sudden grimness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young are tired of us, our gods and our ideals. Off with their
      heads, they say&mdash;smash their idols! And let&rsquo;s get back
      to-nothing! And, by Jove, they&rsquo;ve done it! Jon&rsquo;s a poet. He&rsquo;ll
      be going in, too, and stamping on what&rsquo;s left of us. Property,
      beauty, sentiment&mdash;all smoke. We mustn&rsquo;t own anything nowadays,
      not even our feelings. They stand in the way of&mdash;Nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon listened, bewildered, almost outraged by his father&rsquo;s words,
      behind which he felt a meaning that he could not reach. He didn&rsquo;t
      want to stamp on anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s the god of to-day,&rdquo; continued Jolyon; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
      back where the Russians were sixty years ago, when they started Nihilism.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dad,&rdquo; cried Jon suddenly, &ldquo;we only want to live,
      and we don&rsquo;t know how, because of the Past&mdash;that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; said Jolyon, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s profound, Jon.
      Is it your own? The Past! Old ownerships, old passions, and their
      aftermath. Let&rsquo;s have cigarettes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious that his mother had lifted her hand to her lips, quickly, as if
      to hush something, Jon handed the cigarettes. He lighted his father&rsquo;s
      and Fleur&rsquo;s, then one for himself. Had he taken the knock that Val
      had spoken of? The smoke was blue when he had not puffed, grey when he
      had; he liked the sensation in his nose, and the sense of equality it gave
      him. He was glad no one said: &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve begun!&rdquo; He felt
      less young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur looked at her watch, and rose. His mother went with her into the
      house. Jon stayed with his father, puffing at the cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See her into the car, old man,&rdquo; said Jolyon; &ldquo;and when
      she&rsquo;s gone, ask your mother to come back to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon went. He waited in the hall. He saw her into the car. There was no
      chance for any word; hardly for a pressure of the hand. He waited all that
      evening for something to be said to him. Nothing was said. Nothing might
      have happened. He went up to bed, and in the mirror on his dressing-table
      met himself. He did not speak, nor did the image; but both looked as if
      they thought the more.

    <h2>
      IV.&mdash;IN GREEN STREET
    </h2>
    <p>
      Uncertain whether the impression that Prosper Profond was dangerous should
      be traced to his attempt to give Val the Mayfly filly; to a remark of
      Fleur&rsquo;s: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like the hosts of Midian&mdash;he prowls
      and prowls around&rdquo;; to his preposterous inquiry of Jack Cardigan:
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of keepin&rsquo; fit?&rdquo; or, more simply,
      to the fact that he was a foreigner, or alien as it was now called.
      Certain, that Annette was looking particularly handsome, and that Soames&mdash;had
      sold him a Gauguin and then torn up the cheque, so that Monsieur Profond
      himself had said: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get that small picture I bought
      from Mr. Forsyde.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      However suspiciously regarded, he still frequented Winifred&rsquo;s
      evergreen little house in Green Street, with a good-natured obtuseness
      which no one mistook for naivete, a word hardly applicable to Monsieur
      Prosper Profond. Winifred still found him &ldquo;amusing,&rdquo; and would
      write him little notes saying: &ldquo;Come and have a &lsquo;jolly&rsquo;
      with us&rdquo;&mdash;it was breath of life to her to keep up with the
      phrases of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery, with which all felt him to be surrounded, was due to his
      having done, seen, heard, and known everything, and found nothing in it&mdash;which
      was unnatural. The English type of disillusionment was familiar enough to
      Winifred, who had always moved in fashionable circles. It gave a certain
      cachet or distinction, so that one got something out of it. But to see
      nothing in anything, not as a pose, but because there was nothing in
      anything, was not English; and that which was not English one could not
      help secretly feeling dangerous, if not precisely bad form. It was like
      having the mood which the War had left, seated&mdash;dark, heavy, smiling,
      indifferent&mdash;in your Empire chair; it was like listening to that mood
      talking through thick pink lips above a little diabolic beard. It was, as
      Jack Cardigan expressed it&mdash;for the English character at large&mdash;&ldquo;a
      bit too thick&rdquo;&mdash;for if nothing was really worth getting excited
      about, there were always games, and one could make it so! Even Winifred,
      ever a Forsyte at heart, felt that there was nothing to be had out of such
      a mood of disillusionment, so that it really ought not to be there.
      Monsieur Profond, in fact, made the mood too plain in a country which
      decently veiled such realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Fleur, after her hurried return from Robin Hill, came down to dinner
      that evening, the mood was standing at the window of Winifred&rsquo;s
      little drawing-room, looking out into Green Street, with an air of seeing
      nothing in it. And Fleur gazed promptly into the fireplace with an air of
      seeing a fire which was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Profond came from the window. He was in full fig, with a white
      waistcoat and a white flower in his buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Forsyde,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful pleased
      to see you. Mr. Forsyde well? I was sayin&rsquo; to-day I want to see him
      have some pleasure. He worries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; said Fleur shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worries,&rdquo; repeated Monsieur Profond, burring the r&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur spun round. &ldquo;Shall I tell you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what
      would give him pleasure?&rdquo; But the words, &ldquo;To hear that you had
      cleared out,&rdquo; died at the expression on his face. All his fine white
      teeth were showing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was hearin&rsquo; at the Club to-day about his old trouble.&rdquo;
      Fleur opened her eyes. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Profond moved his sleek head as if to minimize his statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you were born,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that small business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though conscious that he had cleverly diverted her from his own share in
      her father&rsquo;s worry, Fleur was unable to withstand a rush of nervous
      curiosity. &ldquo;Tell me what you heard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; murmured Monsieur Profond, &ldquo;you know all that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect I do. But I should like to know that you haven&rsquo;t
      heard it all wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His first wife,&rdquo; murmured Monsieur Profond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choking back the words, &ldquo;He was never married before,&rdquo; she
      said: &ldquo;Well, what about her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. George Forsyde was tellin&rsquo; me about your father&rsquo;s
      first wife marryin&rsquo; his cousin Jolyon afterward. It was a small bit
      unpleasant, I should think. I saw their boy&mdash;nice boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur looked up. Monsieur Profond was swimming, heavily diabolical, before
      her. That&mdash;the reason! With the most heroic effort of her life so
      far, she managed to arrest that swimming figure. She could not tell
      whether he had noticed. And just then Winifred came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! here you both are already; Imogen and I have had the most
      amusing afternoon at the Babies&rsquo; bazaar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What babies?&rdquo; said Fleur mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Save the Babies.&rsquo; I got such a bargain, my dear. A
      piece of old Armenian work&mdash;from before the Flood. I want your
      opinion on it, Prosper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; whispered Fleur suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the tone in the girl&rsquo;s voice Winifred closed in on her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Aren&rsquo;t you well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Profond had withdrawn into the window, where he was practically
      out of hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie, he-he told me that father has been married before. Is it
      true that he divorced her, and she married Jon Forsyte&rsquo;s father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Never in all the life of the mother of four little Darties had Winifred
      felt more seriously embarrassed. Her niece&rsquo;s face was so pale, her
      eyes so dark, her voice so whispery and strained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father didn&rsquo;t wish you to hear,&rdquo; she said, with
      all the aplomb she could muster. &ldquo;These things will happen. I&rsquo;ve
      often told him he ought to let you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Fleur, and that was all, but it made Winifred pat
      her shoulder&mdash;a firm little shoulder, nice and white! She never could
      help an appraising eye and touch in the matter of her niece, who would
      have to be married, of course&mdash;though not to that boy Jon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve forgotten all about it years and years ago,&rdquo; she
      said comfortably. &ldquo;Come and have dinner!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Auntie. I don&rsquo;t feel very well. May I go upstairs?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; murmured Winifred, concerned, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
      not taking this to heart? Why, you haven&rsquo;t properly come out yet!
      That boy&rsquo;s a child!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What boy? I&rsquo;ve only got a headache. But I can&rsquo;t stand
      that man to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;go and lie down. I&rsquo;ll
      send you some bromide, and I shall talk to Prosper Profond. What business
      had he to gossip? Though I must say I think it&rsquo;s much better you
      should know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur smiled. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, and slipped from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went up with her head whirling, a dry sensation in her throat, a
      guttered frightened feeling in her breast. Never in her life as yet had
      she suffered from even momentary fear that she would not get what she had
      set her heart on. The sensations of the afternoon had been full and
      poignant, and this gruesome discovery coming on the top of them had really
      made her head ache. No wonder her father had hidden that photograph, so
      secretly behind her own-ashamed of having kept it! But could he hate Jon&rsquo;s
      mother and yet keep her photograph? She pressed her hands over her
      forehead, trying to see things clearly. Had they told Jon&mdash;had her
      visit to Robin Hill forced them to tell him? Everything now turned on
      that! She knew, they all knew, except&mdash;perhaps&mdash;Jon!
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked up and down, biting her lip and thinking desperately hard. Jon
      loved his mother. If they had told him, what would he do? She could not
      tell. But if they had not told him, should she not&mdash;could she not get
      him for herself&mdash;get married to him, before he knew? She searched her
      memories of Robin Hill. His mother&rsquo;s face so passive&mdash;with its
      dark eyes and as if powdered hair, its reserve, its smile&mdash;baffled
      her; and his father&rsquo;s&mdash;kindly, sunken, ironic. Instinctively
      she felt they would shrink from telling Jon, even now, shrink from hurting
      him&mdash;for of course it would hurt him awfully to know!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her aunt must be made not to tell her father that she knew. So long as
      neither she herself nor Jon were supposed to know, there was still a
      chance&mdash;freedom to cover one&rsquo;s tracks, and get what her heart
      was set on. But she was almost overwhelmed by her isolation. Every one&rsquo;s
      hand was against her&mdash;every one&rsquo;s! It was as Jon had said&mdash;he
      and she just wanted to live and the past was in their way, a past they
      hadn&rsquo;t shared in, and didn&rsquo;t understand! Oh! What a shame! And
      suddenly she thought of June. Would she help them? For somehow June had
      left on her the impression that she would be sympathetic with their love,
      impatient of obstacle. Then, instinctively, she thought: &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t
      give anything away, though, even to her. I daren&rsquo;t. I mean to have
      Jon; against them all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soup was brought up to her, and one of Winifred&rsquo;s pet headache
      cachets. She swallowed both. Then Winifred herself appeared. Fleur opened
      her campaign with the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Auntie, I do wish people wouldn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m
      in love with that boy. Why, I&rsquo;ve hardly seen him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred, though experienced, was not &ldquo;fine.&rdquo; She accepted the
      remark with considerable relief. Of course, it was not pleasant for the
      girl to hear of the family scandal, and she set herself to minimise the
      matter, a task for which she was eminently qualified, &ldquo;raised&rdquo;
      fashionably under a comfortable mother and a father whose nerves might not
      be shaken, and for many years the wife of Montague Dartie. Her description
      was a masterpiece of understatement. Fleur&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s first
      wife had been very foolish. There had been a young man who had got run
      over, and she had left Fleur&rsquo;s father. Then, years after, when it
      might all have come&mdash;right again, she had taken up with their cousin
      Jolyon; and, of course, her father had been obliged to have a divorce.
      Nobody remembered anything of it now, except just the family. And,
      perhaps, it had all turned out for the best; her father had Fleur; and
      Jolyon and Irene had been quite happy, they said, and their boy was a nice
      boy. &ldquo;Val having Holly, too, is a sort of plaster, don&rsquo;t you
      know?&rdquo; With these soothing words, Winifred patted her niece&rsquo;s
      shoulder; thought: &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a nice, plump little thing!&rsquo;
      and went back to Prosper Profond, who, in spite of his indiscretion, was
      very &ldquo;amusing&rdquo; this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes after her aunt had gone Fleur remained under influence of
      bromide material and spiritual. But then reality came back. Her aunt had
      left out all that mattered&mdash;all the feeling, the hate, the love, the
      unforgivingness of passionate hearts. She, who knew so little of life, and
      had touched only the fringe of love, was yet aware by instinct that words
      have as little relation to fact and feeling as coin to the bread it buys.
      &lsquo;Poor Father!&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;Poor me! Poor Jon! But I
      don&rsquo;t care, I mean to have him!&rsquo; From the window of her
      darkened room she saw &ldquo;that man&rdquo; issue from the door below and
      &ldquo;prowl&rdquo; away. If he and her mother&mdash;how would that affect
      her chance? Surely it must make her father cling to her more closely, so
      that he would consent in the end to anything she wanted, or become
      reconciled the sooner to what she did without his knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took some earth from the flower-box in the window, and with all her
      might flung it after that disappearing figure. It fell short, but the
      action did her good.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a little puff of air came up from Green Street, smelling of petrol,
      not sweet.

    <h2>
      V.&mdash;PURELY FORSYTE AFFAIRS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soames, coming up to the City, with the intention of calling in at Green
      Street at the end of his day and taking Fleur back home with him, suffered
      from rumination. Sleeping partner that he was, he seldom visited the City
      now, but he still had a room of his own at Cuthcott, Kingson and Forsyte&rsquo;s,
      and one special clerk and a half assigned to the management of purely
      Forsyte affairs. They were somewhat in flux just now&mdash;an auspicious
      moment for the disposal of house property. And Soames was unloading the
      estates of his father and Uncle Roger, and to some extent of his Uncle
      Nicholas. His shrewd and matter-of-course probity in all money concerns
      had made him something of an autocrat in connection with these trusts. If
      Soames thought this or thought that, one had better save oneself the
      bother of thinking too. He guaranteed, as it were, irresponsibility to
      numerous Forsytes of the third and fourth generations. His fellow
      trustees, such as his cousins Roger or Nicholas, his cousins-in-law
      Tweetyman and Spender, or his sister Cicely&rsquo;s husband, all trusted
      him; he signed first, and where he signed first they signed after, and
      nobody was a penny the worse. Just now they were all a good many pennies
      the better, and Soames was beginning to see the close of certain trusts,
      except for distribution of the income from securities as gilt-edged as was
      compatible with the period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing the more feverish parts of the City toward the most perfect
      backwater in London, he ruminated. Money was extraordinarily tight; and
      morality extraordinarily loose! The War had done it. Banks were not
      lending; people breaking contracts all over the place. There was a feeling
      in the air and a look on faces that he did not like. The country seemed in
      for a spell of gambling and bankruptcies. There was satisfaction in the
      thought that neither he nor his trusts had an investment which could be
      affected by anything less maniacal than national repudiation or a levy on
      capital. If Soames had faith, it was in what he called &ldquo;English
      common sense&rdquo;&mdash;or the power to have things, if not one way then
      another. He might&mdash;like his father James before him&mdash;say he didn&rsquo;t
      know what things were coming to, but he never in his heart believed they
      were. If it rested with him, they wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;and, after all, he
      was only an Englishman like any other, so quietly tenacious of what he had
      that he knew he would never really part with it without something more or
      less equivalent in exchange. His mind was essentially equilibristic in
      material matters, and his way of putting the national situation difficult
      to refute in a world composed of human beings. Take his own case, for
      example! He was well off. Did that do anybody harm? He did not eat ten
      meals a day; he ate no more than, perhaps not so much as, a poor man. He
      spent no money on vice; breathed no more air, used no more water to speak
      of than the mechanic or the porter. He certainly had pretty things about
      him, but they had given employment in the making, and somebody must use
      them. He bought pictures, but Art must be encouraged. He was, in fact, an
      accidental channel through which money flowed, employing labour. What was
      there objectionable in that? In his charge money was in quicker and more
      useful flux than it would be in charge of the State and a lot of slow-fly
      money-sucking officials. And as to what he saved each year&mdash;it was
      just as much in flux as what he didn&rsquo;t save, going into Water Board
      or Council Stocks, or something sound and useful. The State paid him no
      salary for being trustee of his own or other people&rsquo;s money he did
      all that for nothing. Therein lay the whole case against nationalisation&mdash;owners
      of private property were unpaid, and yet had every incentive to quicken up
      the flux. Under nationalisation&mdash;just the opposite! In a country
      smarting from officialism he felt that he had a strong case.
    </p>
    <p>
      It particularly annoyed him, entering that backwater of perfect peace, to
      think that a lot of unscrupulous Trusts and Combinations had been
      cornering the market in goods of all kinds, and keeping prices at an
      artificial height. Such abusers of the individualistic system were the
      ruffians who caused all the trouble, and it was some satisfaction to see
      them getting into a stew at last lest the whole thing might come down with
      a run&mdash;and land them in the soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The offices of Cuthcott, Kingson and Forsyte occupied the ground and first
      floors of a house on the right-hand side; and, ascending to his room,
      Soames thought: &lsquo;Time we had a coat of paint.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His old clerk Gradman was seated, where he always was, at a huge bureau
      with countless pigeonholes. Half-the-clerk stood beside him, with a broker&rsquo;s
      note recording investment of the proceeds from sale of the Bryanston
      Square house, in Roger Forsyte&rsquo;s estate. Soames took it, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vancouver City Stock. H&rsquo;m. It&rsquo;s down today!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sort of grating ingratiation old Gradman answered him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es; but everything&rsquo;s down, Mr. Soames.&rdquo; And
      half-the-clerk withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames skewered the document on to a number of other papers and hung up
      his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to look at my Will and Marriage Settlement, Gradman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Gradman, moving to the limit of his swivel chair, drew out two drafts
      from the bottom lefthand drawer. Recovering his body, he raised his
      grizzle-haired face, very red from stooping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Copies, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames took them. It struck him suddenly how like Gradman was to the stout
      brindled yard dog they had been wont to keep on his chain at The Shelter,
      till one day Fleur had come and insisted it should be let loose, so that
      it had at once bitten the cook and been destroyed. If you let Gradman off
      his chain, would he bite the cook?
    </p>
    <p>
      Checking this frivolous fancy, Soames unfolded his Marriage Settlement. He
      had not looked at it for over eighteen years, not since he remade his Will
      when his father died and Fleur was born. He wanted to see whether the
      words &ldquo;during coverture&rdquo; were in. Yes, they were&mdash;odd
      expression, when you thought of it, and derived perhaps from
      horse-breeding! Interest on fifteen thousand pounds (which he paid her
      without deducting income tax) so long as she remained his wife, and
      afterward during widowhood &ldquo;dum casta&rdquo;&mdash;old-fashioned and
      rather pointed words, put in to insure the conduct of Fleur&rsquo;s
      mother. His Will made it up to an annuity of a thousand under the same
      conditions. All right! He returned the copies to Gradman, who took them
      without looking up, swung the chair, restored the papers to their drawer,
      and went on casting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gradman! I don&rsquo;t like the condition of the country; there are
      a lot of people about without any common sense. I want to find a way by
      which I can safeguard Miss Fleur against anything which might arise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradman wrote the figure &ldquo;2&rdquo; on his blotting-paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a nahsty spirit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ordinary restraint against anticipation doesn&rsquo;t meet the
      case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nao,&rdquo; said Gradman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose those Labour fellows come in, or worse! It&rsquo;s these
      people with fixed ideas who are the danger. Look at Ireland!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Gradman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I were to make a settlement on her at once with myself as
      beneficiary for life, they couldn&rsquo;t take anything but the interest
      from me, unless of course they alter the law.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradman moved his head and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they wouldn&rsquo;t do tha-at!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; muttered Soames; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      trust them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take two years, sir, to be valid against death duties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames sniffed. Two years! He was only sixty-five!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point. Draw a form of settlement that passes
      all my property to Miss Fleur&rsquo;s children in equal shares, with
      antecedent life-interests first to myself and then to her without power of
      anticipation, and add a clause that in the event of anything happening to
      divert her life-interest, that interest passes to the trustees, to apply
      for her benefit, in their absolute discretion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradman grated: &ldquo;Rather extreme at your age, sir; you lose control.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business,&rdquo; said Soames sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradman wrote on a piece of paper: &ldquo;Life-interest&mdash;anticipation&mdash;divert
      interest&mdash;absolute discretion....&rdquo; and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What trustees? There&rsquo;s young Mr. Kingson; he&rsquo;s a nice
      steady young fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he might do for one. I must have three. There isn&rsquo;t a
      Forsyte now who appeals to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not young Mr. Nicholas? He&rsquo;s at the Bar. We&rsquo;ve given
      &lsquo;im briefs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never set the Thames on fire,&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile oozed out on Gradman&rsquo;s face, greasy from countless
      mutton-chops, the smile of a man who sits all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect it, at his age, Mr. Soames.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? What is he? Forty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, quite a young fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, put him in; but I want somebody who&rsquo;ll take a personal
      interest. There&rsquo;s no one that I can see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Mr. Valerius, now he&rsquo;s come home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Val Dartie? With that father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-ell,&rdquo; murmured Gradman, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s been dead seven
      years&mdash;the Statute runs against him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the connection.&rdquo;
      He rose. Gradman said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they were makin&rsquo; a levy on capital, they could come on the
      trustees, sir. So there you&rsquo;d be just the same. I&rsquo;d think it
      over, if I were you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;I will. What have you
      done about that dilapidation notice in Vere Street?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;aven&rsquo;t served it yet. The party&rsquo;s very old.
      She won&rsquo;t want to go out at her age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. This spirit of unrest touches every one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; at things broadly, sir. She&rsquo;s
      eighty-one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better serve it,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;and see what she says.
      Oh! and Mr. Timothy? Is everything in order in case of&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the inventory of his estate all ready; had the
      furniture and pictures valued so that we know what reserves to put on. I
      shall be sorry when he goes, though. Dear me! It is a time since I first
      saw Mr. Timothy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t live for ever,&rdquo; said Soames, taking down his
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nao,&rdquo; said Gradman; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;ll be a pity&mdash;the
      last of the old family! Shall I take up the matter of that nuisance in Old
      Compton Street? Those organs&mdash;they&rsquo;re nahsty things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do. I must call for Miss Fleur and catch the four o&rsquo;clock.
      Good-day, Gradman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day, Mr. Soames. I hope Miss Fleur&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well enough, but gads about too much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; grated Gradman; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s young.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames went out, musing: &ldquo;Old Gradman! If he were younger I&rsquo;d
      put him in the trust. There&rsquo;s nobody I can depend on to take a real
      interest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the bilious and mathematical exactitude, the preposterous peace of
      that backwater, he thought suddenly: &lsquo;During coverture! Why can&rsquo;t
      they exclude fellows like Profond, instead of a lot of hard-working
      Germans?&rsquo; and was surprised at the depth of uneasiness which could
      provoke so unpatriotic a thought. But there it was! One never got a moment
      of real peace. There was always something at the back of everything! And
      he made his way toward Green Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later by his watch, Thomas Gradman, stirring in his swivel
      chair, closed the last drawer of his bureau, and putting into his
      waistcoat pocket a bunch of keys so fat that they gave him a protuberance
      on the liver side, brushed his old top hat round with his sleeve, took his
      umbrella, and descended. Thick, short, and buttoned closely into his old
      frock coat, he walked toward Covent Garden market. He never missed that
      daily promenade to the Tube for Highgate, and seldom some critical
      transaction on the way in connection with vegetables and fruit.
      Generations might be born, and hats might change, wars be fought, and
      Forsytes fade away, but Thomas Gradman, faithful and grey, would take his
      daily walk and buy his daily vegetable. Times were not what they were, and
      his son had lost a leg, and they never gave him those nice little plaited
      baskets to carry the stuff in now, and these Tubes were convenient things&mdash;still
      he mustn&rsquo;t complain; his health was good considering his time of
      life, and after fifty-four years in the Law he was getting a round eight
      hundred a year and a little worried of late, because it was mostly
      collector&rsquo;s commission on the rents, and with all this conversion of
      Forsyte property going on, it looked like drying up, and the price of
      living still so high; but it was no good worrying&mdash;&ldquo;The good
      God made us all&rdquo;&mdash;as he was in the habit of saying; still,
      house property in London&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t know what Mr. Roger or Mr.
      James would say if they could see it being sold like this&mdash;seemed to
      show a lack of faith; but Mr. Soames&mdash;he worried. Life and lives in
      being and twenty-one years after&mdash;beyond that you couldn&rsquo;t go;
      still, he kept his health wonderfully&mdash;and Miss Fleur was a pretty
      little thing&mdash;she was; she&rsquo;d marry; but lots of people had no
      children nowadays&mdash;he had had his first child at twenty-two; and Mr.
      Jolyon, married while he was at Cambridge, had his child the same year&mdash;gracious
      Peter! That was back in &lsquo;69, a long time before old Mr. Jolyon&mdash;fine
      judge of property&mdash;had taken his Will away from Mr. James&mdash;dear,
      yes! Those were the days when they were buyin&rsquo; property right and
      left, and none of this khaki and fallin&rsquo; over one another to get out
      of things; and cucumbers at twopence; and a melon&mdash;the old melons,
      that made your mouth water! Fifty years since he went into Mr. James&rsquo;
      office, and Mr. James had said to him: &ldquo;Now, Gradman, you&rsquo;re
      only a shaver&mdash;you pay attention, and you&rsquo;ll make your five
      hundred a year before you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo; And he had, and feared
      God, and served the Forsytes, and kept a vegetable diet at night. And,
      buying a copy of John Bull&mdash;not that he approved of it, an
      extravagant affair&mdash;he entered the Tube elevator with his mere
      brown-paper parcel, and was borne down into the bowels of the earth.

    <h2>
      VI.&mdash;SOAMES&rsquo; PRIVATE LIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On his way to Green Street it occurred to Soames that he ought to go into
      Dumetrius&rsquo; in Suffolk Street about the possibility of the Bolderby
      Old Crome. Almost worth while to have fought the war to have the Bolderby
      Old Crome, as it were, in flux! Old Bolderby had died, his son and
      grandson had been killed&mdash;a cousin was coming into the estate, who
      meant to sell it, some said because of the condition of England, others
      said because he had asthma.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Dumetrius once got hold of it the price would become prohibitive; it
      was necessary for Soames to find out whether Dumetrius had got it, before
      he tried to get it himself. He therefore confined himself to discussing
      with Dumetrius whether Monticellis would come again now that it was the
      fashion for a picture to be anything except a picture; and the future of
      Johns, with a side-slip into Buxton Knights. It was only when leaving that
      he added: &ldquo;So they&rsquo;re not selling the Bolderby Old Crome,
      after all?&rdquo; In sheer pride of racial superiority, as he had
      calculated would be the case, Dumetrius replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I shall get it, Mr. Forsyte, sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The flutter of his eyelid fortified Soames in a resolution to write direct
      to the new Bolderby, suggesting that the only dignified way of dealing
      with an Old Crome was to avoid dealers. He therefore said, &ldquo;Well,
      good-day!&rdquo; and went, leaving Dumetrius the wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Green Street he found that Fleur was out and would be all the evening;
      she was staying one more night in London. He cabbed on dejectedly, and
      caught his train.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached his house about six o&rsquo;clock. The air was heavy, midges
      biting, thunder about. Taking his letters he went up to his dressing-room
      to cleanse himself of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      An uninteresting post. A receipt, a bill for purchases on behalf of Fleur.
      A circular about an exhibition of etchings. A letter beginning:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel it my duty...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That would be an appeal or something unpleasant. He looked at once for the
      signature. There was none! Incredulously he turned the page over and
      examined each corner. Not being a public man, Soames had never yet had an
      anonymous letter, and his first impulse was to tear it up, as a dangerous
      thing; his second to read it, as a thing still more dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel it my duty to inform you that having no interest in the
      matter your lady is carrying on with a foreigner&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching that word Soames stopped mechanically and examined the postmark.
      So far as he could pierce the impenetrable disguise in which the Post
      Office had wrapped it, there was something with a &ldquo;sea&rdquo; at the
      end and a &ldquo;t&rdquo; in it. Chelsea? No! Battersea? Perhaps! He read
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These foreigners are all the same. Sack the lot. This one meets
      your lady twice a week. I know it of my own knowledge&mdash;and to see an
      Englishman put on goes against the grain. You watch it and see if what I
      say isn&rsquo;t true. I shouldn&rsquo;t meddle if it wasn&rsquo;t a dirty
      foreigner that&rsquo;s in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours obedient.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sensation with which Soames dropped the letter was similar to that he
      would have had entering his bedroom and finding it full of black-beetles.
      The meanness of anonymity gave a shuddering obscenity to the moment. And
      the worst of it was that this shadow had been at the back of his mind ever
      since the Sunday evening when Fleur had pointed down at Prosper Profond
      strolling on the lawn, and said: &ldquo;Prowling cat!&rdquo; Had he not in
      connection therewith, this very day, perused his Will and Marriage
      Settlement? And now this anonymous ruffian, with nothing to gain,
      apparently, save the venting of his spite against foreigners, had wrenched
      it out of the obscurity in which he had hoped and wished it would remain.
      To have such knowledge forced on him, at his time of life, about Fleur&rsquo;s
      mother! He picked the letter up from the carpet, tore it across, and then,
      when it hung together by just the fold at the back, stopped tearing, and
      reread it. He was taking at that moment one of the decisive resolutions of
      his life. He would not be forced into another scandal. No! However he
      decided to deal with this matter&mdash;and it required the most
      far-sighted and careful consideration he would do nothing that might
      injure Fleur. That resolution taken, his mind answered the helm again, and
      he made his ablutions. His hands trembled as he dried them. Scandal he
      would not have, but something must be done to stop this sort of thing! He
      went into his wife&rsquo;s room and stood looking around him. The idea of
      searching for anything which would incriminate, and entitle him to hold a
      menace over her, did not even come to him. There would be nothing&mdash;she
      was much too practical. The idea of having her watched had been dismissed
      before it came&mdash;too well he remembered his previous experience of
      that. No! He had nothing but this torn-up letter from some anonymous
      ruffian, whose impudent intrusion into his private life he so violently
      resented. It was repugnant to him to make use of it, but he might have to.
      What a mercy Fleur was not at home to-night! A tap on the door broke up
      his painful cogitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Michael Mont, sir, is in the drawing-room. Will you see him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;yes. I&rsquo;ll come down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Anything that would take his mind off for a few minutes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael Mont in flannels stood on the verandah smoking a cigarette. He
      threw it away as Soames came up, and ran his hand through his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames&rsquo; feeling toward this young man was singular. He was no doubt
      a rackety, irresponsible young fellow according to old standards, yet
      somehow likeable, with his extraordinarily cheerful way of blurting out
      his opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;have you had tea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mont came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Fleur would have been back, sir; but I&rsquo;m glad she
      isn&rsquo;t. The fact is, I&mdash;I&rsquo;m fearfully gone on her; so
      fearfully gone that I thought you&rsquo;d better know. It&rsquo;s
      old-fashioned, of course, coming to fathers first, but I thought you&rsquo;d
      forgive that. I went to my own Dad, and he says if I settle down he&rsquo;ll
      see me through. He rather cottons to the idea, in fact. I told him about
      your Goya.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Soames, inexpressibly dry. &ldquo;He rather
      cottons?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; resumed Mont, twiddling his straw hat, while his
      hair, ears, eyebrows, all seemed to stand up from excitement, &ldquo;when
      you&rsquo;ve been through the War you can&rsquo;t help being in a hurry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get married; and unmarried afterward,&rdquo; said Soames slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from Fleur, sir. Imagine, if you were me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames cleared his throat. That way of putting it was forcible enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleur&rsquo;s too young,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, sir. We&rsquo;re awfully old nowadays. My Dad seems to me a
      perfect babe; his thinking apparatus hasn&rsquo;t turned a hair. But he&rsquo;s
      a Baronight, of course; that keeps him back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baronight,&rdquo; repeated Soames; &ldquo;what may that be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bart, sir. I shall be a Bart some day. But I shall live it down,
      you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away and live this down,&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mont said imploringly: &ldquo;Oh! no, sir. I simply must hang
      around, or I shouldn&rsquo;t have a dog&rsquo;s chance. You&rsquo;ll let
      Fleur do what she likes, I suppose, anyway. Madame passes me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Soames frigidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really bar me, do you?&rdquo; and the young man
      looked so doleful that Soames smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may think you&rsquo;re very old,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but you
      strike me as extremely young. To rattle ahead of everything is not a proof
      of maturity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir; I give you our age. But to show you I mean business&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      got a job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to hear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joined a publisher; my governor is putting up the stakes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames put his hand over his mouth&mdash;he had so very nearly said:
      &ldquo;God help the publisher!&rdquo; His grey eyes scrutinised the
      agitated young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dislike you, Mr. Mont, but Fleur is everything to me:
      Everything&mdash;do you understand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I know; but so she is to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve told me,
      however. And now I think there&rsquo;s nothing more to be said.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it rests with her, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will rest with her a long time, I hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t cheering,&rdquo; said Mont suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;my experience of life has not made
      me anxious to couple people in a hurry. Good-night, Mr. Mont. I shan&rsquo;t
      tell Fleur what you&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Mont blankly; &ldquo;I really could knock my
      brains out for want of her. She knows that perfectly well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say.&rdquo; And Soames held out his hand. A distracted
      squeeze, a heavy sigh, and soon after sounds from the young man&rsquo;s
      motor-cycle called up visions of flying dust and broken bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The younger generation!&rsquo; he thought heavily, and went out on
      to the lawn. The gardeners had been mowing, and there was still the smell
      of fresh-cut grass&mdash;the thundery air kept all scents close to earth.
      The sky was of a purplish hue&mdash;the poplars black. Two or three boats
      passed on the river, scuttling, as it were, for shelter before the storm.
      &lsquo;Three days&rsquo; fine weather,&rsquo; thought Soames, &lsquo;and
      then a storm!&rsquo; Where was Annette? With that chap, for all he knew&mdash;she
      was a young woman! Impressed with the queer charity of that thought, he
      entered the summerhouse and sat down. The fact was&mdash;and he admitted
      it&mdash;Fleur was so much to him that his wife was very little&mdash;very
      little; French&mdash;had never been much more than a mistress, and he was
      getting indifferent to that side of things! It was odd how, with all this
      ingrained care for moderation and secure investment, Soames ever put his
      emotional eggs into one basket. First Irene&mdash;now Fleur. He was dimly
      conscious of it, sitting there, conscious of its odd dangerousness. It had
      brought him to wreck and scandal once, but now&mdash;now it should save
      him! He cared so much for Fleur that he would have no further scandal. If
      only he could get at that anonymous letter-writer, he would teach him not
      to meddle and stir up mud at the bottom of water which he wished should
      remain stagnant!... A distant flash, a low rumble, and large drops of rain
      spattered on the thatch above him. He remained indifferent, tracing a
      pattern with his finger on the dusty surface of a little rustic table.
      Fleur&rsquo;s future! &lsquo;I want fair sailing for her,&rsquo; he
      thought. &lsquo;Nothing else matters at my time of life.&rsquo; A lonely
      business&mdash;life! What you had you never could keep to yourself! As you
      warned one off, you let another in. One could make sure of nothing! He
      reached up and pulled a red rambler rose from a cluster which blocked the
      window. Flowers grew and dropped&mdash;Nature was a queer thing! The
      thunder rumbled and crashed, travelling east along a river, the paling
      flashes flicked his eyes; the poplar tops showed sharp and dense against
      the sky, a heavy shower rustled and rattled and veiled in the little house
      wherein he sat, indifferent, thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the storm was over, he left his retreat and went down the wet path to
      the river bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two swans had come, sheltering in among the reeds. He knew the birds well,
      and stood watching the dignity in the curve of those white necks and
      formidable snake-like heads. &lsquo;Not dignified&mdash;what I have to do!&rsquo;
      he thought. And yet it must be tackled, lest worse befell. Annette must be
      back by now from wherever she had gone, for it was nearly dinner-time, and
      as the moment for seeing her approached, the difficulty of knowing what to
      say and how to say it had increased. A new and scaring thought occurred to
      him. Suppose she wanted her liberty to marry this fellow! Well, if she
      did, she couldn&rsquo;t have it. He had not married her for that. The
      image of Prosper Profond dawdled before him reassuringly. Not a marrying
      man! No, no! Anger replaced that momentary scare. &lsquo;He had better not
      come my way,&rsquo; he thought. The mongrel represented&mdash;-! But what
      did Prosper Profond represent? Nothing that mattered surely. And yet
      something real enough in the world&mdash;unmorality let off its chain,
      disillusionment on the prowl! That expression Annette had caught from him:
      &ldquo;Je m&rsquo;en fiche!&rdquo; A fatalistic chap! A continental&mdash;a
      cosmopolitan&mdash;a product of the age! If there were condemnation more
      complete, Soames felt that he did not know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The swans had turned their heads, and were looking past him into some
      distance of their own. One of them uttered a little hiss, wagged its tail,
      turned as if answering to a rudder, and swam away. The other followed.
      Their white bodies, their stately necks, passed out of his sight, and he
      went toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette was in the drawing-room, dressed for dinner, and he thought as he
      went up-stairs &lsquo;Handsome is as handsome does.&rsquo; Handsome!
      Except for remarks about the curtains in the drawing-room, and the storm,
      there was practically no conversation during a meal distinguished by
      exactitude of quantity and perfection of quality. Soames drank nothing. He
      followed her into the drawing-room afterward, and found her smoking a
      cigarette on the sofa between the two French windows. She was leaning
      back, almost upright, in a low black frock, with her knees crossed and her
      blue eyes half-closed; grey-blue smoke issued from her red, rather full
      lips, a fillet bound her chestnut hair, she wore the thinnest silk
      stockings, and shoes with very high heels showing off her instep. A fine
      piece in any room! Soames, who held that torn letter in a hand thrust deep
      into the side-pocket of his dinner-jacket, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to shut the window; the damp&rsquo;s lifting in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so, and stood looking at a David Cox adorning the cream-panelled
      wall close by.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was she thinking of? He had never understood a woman in his life&mdash;except
      Fleur&mdash;and Fleur not always! His heart beat fast. But if he meant to
      do it, now was the moment. Turning from the David Cox, he took out the
      torn letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes widened, stared at him, and hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames handed her the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s torn, but you can read it.&rdquo; And he turned back to
      the David Cox&mdash;a sea-piece, of good tone&mdash;but without movement
      enough. &lsquo;I wonder what that chap&rsquo;s doing at this moment?&rsquo;
      he thought. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll astonish him yet.&rsquo; Out of the corner
      of his eye he saw Annette holding the letter rigidly; her eyes moved from
      side to side under her darkened lashes and frowning darkened eyes. She
      dropped the letter, gave a little shiver, smiled, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dirrty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;degrading. Is it true?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A tooth fastened on her red lower lip. &ldquo;And what if it were?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was brazen!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all you have to say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, speak out!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good of talking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames said icily: &ldquo;So you admit it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit nothing. You are a fool to ask. A man like you should not
      ask. It is dangerous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames made a tour of the room, to subdue his rising anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; he said, halting in front of her, &ldquo;what
      you were when I married you? Working at accounts in a restaurant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember that I was not half your age?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames broke off the hard encounter of their eyes, and went back to the
      David Cox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to bandy words. I require you to give up this&mdash;friendship.
      I think of the matter entirely as it affects Fleur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;Fleur!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Soames stubbornly; &ldquo;Fleur. She is your child
      as well as mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is kind to admit that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to do what I say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse to tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must make you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Soames,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are helpless. Do not say
      things that you will regret.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Anger swelled the veins on his forehead. He opened his mouth to vent that
      emotion, and could not. Annette went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There shall be no more such letters, I promise you. That is enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames writhed. He had a sense of being treated like a child by this woman
      who had deserved he did not know what.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When two people have married, and lived like us, Soames, they had
      better be quiet about each other. There are things one does not drag up
      into the light for people to laugh at. You will be quiet, then; not for my
      sake for your own. You are getting old; I am not, yet. You have made me
      ver-ry practical&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, who had passed through all the sensations of being choked,
      repeated dully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I require you to give up this friendship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I do not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then I will cut you out of my Will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow it did not seem to meet the case. Annette laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will live a long time, Soames.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you are a bad woman,&rdquo; said Soames suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think so. Living with you has killed things in me, it is
      true; but I am not a bad woman. I am sensible&mdash;that is all. And so
      will you be when you have thought it over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see this man,&rdquo; said Soames sullenly, &ldquo;and warn
      him off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon cher, you are funny. You do not want me, you have as much of me
      as you want; and you wish the rest of me to be dead. I admit nothing, but
      I am not going to be dead, Soames, at my age; so you had better be quiet,
      I tell you. I myself will make no scandal; none. Now, I am not saying any
      more, whatever you do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached out, took a French novel off a little table, and opened it.
      Soames watched her, silenced by the tumult of his feelings. The thought of
      that man was almost making him want her, and this was a revelation of
      their relationship, startling to one little given to introspective
      philosophy. Without saying another word he went out and up to the
      picture-gallery. This came of marrying a Frenchwoman! And yet, without her
      there would have been no Fleur! She had served her purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;I can do nothing. I
      don&rsquo;t even know that there&rsquo;s anything in it.&rsquo; The
      instinct of self-preservation warned him to batten down his hatches, to
      smother the fire with want of air. Unless one believed there was something
      in a thing, there wasn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he went into her room. She received him in the most
      matter-of-fact way, as if there had been no scene between them. And he
      returned to his own room with a curious sense of peace. If one didn&rsquo;t
      choose to see, one needn&rsquo;t. And he did not choose&mdash;in future he
      did not choose. There was nothing to be gained by it&mdash;nothing!
      Opening the drawer he took from the sachet a handkerchief, and the framed
      photograph of Fleur. When he had looked at it a little he slipped it down,
      and there was that other one&mdash;that old one of Irene. An owl hooted
      while he stood in his window gazing at it. The owl hooted, the red
      climbing roses seemed to deepen in colour, there came a scent of
      lime-blossom. God! That had been a different thing! Passion&mdash;Memory!
      Dust!

    <h2>
      VII.&mdash;JUNE TAKES A HAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      One who was a sculptor, a Slav, a sometime resident in New York, an
      egoist, and impecunious, was to be found of an evening in June Forsyte&rsquo;s
      studio on the bank of the Thames at Chiswick. On the evening of July 6,
      Boris Strumolowski&mdash;several of whose works were on show there because
      they were as yet too advanced to be on show anywhere else&mdash;had begun
      well, with that aloof and rather Christ-like silence which admirably
      suited his youthful, round, broad cheek-boned countenance framed in bright
      hair banged like a girl&rsquo;s. June had known him three weeks, and he
      still seemed to her the principal embodiment of genius, and hope of the
      future; a sort of Star of the East which had strayed into an
      unappreciative West. Until that evening he had conversationally confined
      himself to recording his impressions of the United States, whose dust he
      had just shaken from off his feet&mdash;a country, in his opinion, so
      barbarous in every way that he had sold practically nothing there, and
      become an object of suspicion to the police; a country, as he said,
      without a race of its own, without liberty, equality, or fraternity,
      without principles, traditions, taste, without&mdash;in a word&mdash;a
      soul. He had left it for his own good, and come to the only other country
      where he could live well. June had dwelt unhappily on him in her lonely
      moments, standing before his creations&mdash;frightening, but powerful and
      symbolic once they had been explained! That he, haloed by bright hair like
      an early Italian painting, and absorbed in his genius to the exclusion of
      all else&mdash;the only sign of course by which real genius could be told&mdash;should
      still be a &ldquo;lame duck&rdquo; agitated her warm heart almost to the
      exclusion of Paul Post. And she had begun to take steps to clear her
      Gallery, in order to fill it with Strumolowski masterpieces. She had at
      once encountered trouble. Paul Post had kicked; Vospovitch had stung. With
      all the emphasis of a genius which she did not as yet deny them, they had
      demanded another six weeks at least of her Gallery. The American stream,
      still flowing in, would soon be flowing out. The American stream was their
      right, their only hope, their salvation&mdash;since nobody in this &ldquo;beastly&rdquo;
      country cared for Art. June had yielded to the demonstration. After all
      Boris would not mind their having the full benefit of an American stream,
      which he himself so violently despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evening she had put that to Boris with nobody else present, except
      Hannah Hobdey, the mediaeval black-and-whitist, and Jimmy Portugal, editor
      of the Neo-Artist. She had put it to him with that sudden confidence which
      continual contact with the neo-artistic world had never been able to dry
      up in her warm and generous nature. He had not broken his Christ-like
      silence, however, for more than two minutes before she began to move her
      blue eyes from side to side, as a cat moves its tail. This&mdash;he said&mdash;was
      characteristic of England, the most selfish country in the world; the
      country which sucked the blood of other countries; destroyed the brains
      and hearts of Irishmen, Hindus, Egyptians, Boers, and Burmese, all the
      best races in the world; bullying, hypocritical England! This was what he
      had expected, coming to, such a country, where the climate was all fog,
      and the people all tradesmen perfectly blind to Art, and sunk in
      profiteering and the grossest materialism. Conscious that Hannah Hobdey
      was murmuring, &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; and Jimmy Portugal sniggering,
      June grew crimson, and suddenly rapped out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you ever come? We didn&rsquo;t ask you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The remark was so singularly at variance with all she had led him to
      expect from her, that Strumolowski stretched out his hand and took a
      cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;England never wants an idealist,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in June something primitively English was thoroughly upset; old Jolyon&rsquo;s
      sense of justice had risen, as it were, from bed. &ldquo;You come and
      sponge on us,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and then abuse us. If you think that&rsquo;s
      playing the game, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She now discovered that which others had discovered before her&mdash;the
      thickness of hide beneath which the sensibility of genius is sometimes
      veiled. Strumolowski&rsquo;s young and ingenuous face became the
      incarnation of a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sponge, one does not sponge, one takes what is owing&mdash;a tenth
      part of what is owing. You will repent to say that, Miss Forsyte.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said June, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! We know very well, we artists&mdash;you take us to get what you
      can out of us. I want nothing from you&rdquo;&mdash;and he blew out a
      cloud of June&rsquo;s smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decision rose in an icy puff from the turmoil of insulted shame within
      her. &ldquo;Very well, then, you can take your things away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, almost in the same moment, she thought: &lsquo;Poor boy! He&rsquo;s
      only got a garret, and probably not a taxi fare. In front of these people,
      too; it&rsquo;s positively disgusting!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Strumolowski shook his head violently; his hair, thick, smooth,
      close as a golden plate, did not fall off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can live on nothing,&rdquo; he said shrilly; &ldquo;I have often
      had to for the sake of my Art. It is you bourgeois who force us to spend
      money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words hit June like a pebble, in the ribs. After all she had done for
      Art, all her identification with its troubles and lame ducks. She was
      struggling for adequate words when the door was opened, and her Austrian
      murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young lady, gnadiges Fraulein.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the little meal-room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a glance at Boris Strumolowski, at Hannah Hobdey, at Jimmy Portugal,
      June said nothing, and went out, devoid of equanimity. Entering the
      &ldquo;little meal-room,&rdquo; she perceived the young lady to be Fleur&mdash;looking
      very pretty, if pale. At this disenchanted moment a little lame duck of
      her own breed was welcome to June, so homoeopathic by instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl must have come, of course, because of Jon; or, if not, at least
      to get something out of her. And June felt just then that to assist
      somebody was the only bearable thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve remembered to come,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What a jolly little duck of a house! But please don&rsquo;t
      let me bother you, if you&rsquo;ve got people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said June. &ldquo;I want to let them stew in
      their own juice for a bit. Have you come about Jon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you thought we ought to be told. Well, I&rsquo;ve found
      out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said June blankly. &ldquo;Not nice, is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing one on each side of the little bare table at which June
      took her meals. A vase on it was full of Iceland poppies; the girl raised
      her hand and touched them with a gloved finger. To her new-fangled dress,
      frilly about the hips and tight below the knees, June took a sudden liking&mdash;a
      charming colour, flax-blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She makes a picture,&rsquo; thought June. Her little room, with its
      whitewashed walls, its floor and hearth of old pink brick, its black
      paint, and latticed window athwart which the last of the sunlight was
      shining, had never looked so charming, set off by this young figure, with
      the creamy, slightly frowning face. She remembered with sudden vividness
      how nice she herself had looked in those old days when her heart was set
      on Philip Bosinney, that dead lover, who had broken from her to destroy
      for ever Irene&rsquo;s allegiance to this girl&rsquo;s father. Did Fleur
      know of that, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what are you going to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some seconds before Fleur answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want Jon to suffer. I must see him once more to put
      an end to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to put an end to it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else is there to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl seemed to June, suddenly, intolerably spiritless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I know my
      father thinks so; but&mdash;I should never have done it myself. I can&rsquo;t
      take things lying down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How poised and watchful that girl looked; how unemotional her voice
      sounded!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People will assume that I&rsquo;m in love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur shrugged her shoulders. &lsquo;I might have known it,&rsquo; thought
      June; &lsquo;she&rsquo;s Soames&rsquo; daughter&mdash;fish! And yet&mdash;he!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to do then?&rdquo; she said with a sort of
      disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I see Jon here to-morrow on his way down to Holly&rsquo;s? He&rsquo;d
      come if you sent him a line to-night. And perhaps afterward you&rsquo;d
      let them know quietly at Robin Hill that it&rsquo;s all over, and that
      they needn&rsquo;t tell Jon about his mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said June abruptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write now,
      and you can post it. Half-past two tomorrow. I shan&rsquo;t be in, myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down at the tiny bureau which filled one corner. When she looked
      round with the finished note Fleur was still touching the poppies with her
      gloved finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      June licked a stamp. &ldquo;Well, here it is. If you&rsquo;re not in love,
      of course, there&rsquo;s no more to be said. Jon&rsquo;s lucky.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur took the note. &ldquo;Thanks awfully!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cold-blooded little baggage!&rsquo; thought June. Jon, son of her
      father, to love, and not to be loved by the daughter of&mdash;Soames! It
      was humiliating!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur nodded; her frills shook and trembled as she swayed toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye!... Little piece of fashion!&rdquo; muttered June, closing
      the door. &ldquo;That family!&rdquo; And she marched back toward her
      studio. Boris Strumolowski had regained his Christ-like silence and Jimmy
      Portugal was damning everybody, except the group in whose behalf he ran
      the Neo-Artist. Among the condemned were Eric Cobbley, and several other
      &ldquo;lame-duck&rdquo; genii who at one time or another had held first
      place in the repertoire of June&rsquo;s aid and adoration. She experienced
      a sense of futility and disgust, and went to the window to let the
      river-wind blow those squeaky words away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when at length Jimmy Portugal had finished, and gone with Hannah
      Hobdey, she sat down and mothered young Strumolowski for half an hour,
      promising him a month, at least, of the American stream; so that he went
      away with his halo in perfect order. &lsquo;In spite of all,&rsquo; June
      thought, &lsquo;Boris is wonderful.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      VIII.&mdash;THE BIT BETWEEN THE TEETH
    </h2>
    <p>
      To know that your hand is against every one&rsquo;s is&mdash;for some
      natures&mdash;to experience a sense of moral release. Fleur felt no
      remorse when she left June&rsquo;s house. Reading condemnatory resentment
      in her little kinswoman&rsquo;s blue eyes-she was glad that she had fooled
      her, despising June because that elderly idealist had not seen what she
      was after.
    </p>
    <p>
      End it, forsooth! She would soon show them all that she was only just
      beginning. And she smiled to herself on the top of the bus which carried
      her back to Mayfair. But the smile died, squeezed out by spasms of
      anticipation and anxiety. Would she be able to manage Jon? She had taken
      the bit between her teeth, but could she make him take it too? She knew
      the truth and the real danger of delay&mdash;he knew neither; therein lay
      all the difference in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose I tell him,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it
      really be safer?&rsquo; This hideous luck had no right to spoil their
      love; he must see that! They could not let it! People always accepted an
      accomplished fact in time! From that piece of philosophy&mdash;profound
      enough at her age&mdash;she passed to another consideration less
      philosophic. If she persuaded Jon to a quick and secret marriage, and he
      found out afterward that she had known the truth. What then? Jon hated
      subterfuge. Again, then, would it not be better to tell him? But the
      memory of his mother&rsquo;s face kept intruding on that impulse. Fleur
      was afraid. His mother had power over him; more power perhaps than she
      herself. Who could tell? It was too great a risk. Deep-sunk in these
      instinctive calculations she was carried on past Green Street as far as
      the Ritz Hotel. She got down there, and walked back on the Green Park
      side. The storm had washed every tree; they still dripped. Heavy drops
      fell on to her frills, and to avoid them she crossed over under the eyes
      of the Iseeum Club. Chancing to look up she saw Monsieur Profond with a
      tall stout man in the bay window. Turning into Green Street she heard her
      name called, and saw &ldquo;that prowler&rdquo; coming up. He took off his
      hat&mdash;a glossy &ldquo;bowler&rdquo; such as she particularly detested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo;. Miss Forsyde. Isn&rsquo;t there a small thing I
      can do for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, pass by on the other side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say! Why do you dislike me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, because you make me feel life isn&rsquo;t worth living.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Profond smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Miss Forsyde, don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;ll be all
      right. Nothing lasts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things do last,&rdquo; cried Fleur; &ldquo;with me anyhow&mdash;especially
      likes and dislikes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that makes me a bit un&rsquo;appy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought nothing could ever make you happy or unhappy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to annoy other people. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; on
      my yacht.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur looked at him, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small voyage to the South Seas or somewhere,&rdquo; said Monsieur
      Profond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur suffered relief and a sense of insult. Clearly he meant to convey
      that he was breaking with her mother. How dared he have anything to break,
      and yet how dared he break it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Miss Forsyde! Remember me to Mrs. Dartie. I&rsquo;m not
      so bad really. Good-night!&rdquo; Fleur left him standing there with his
      hat raised. Stealing a look round, she saw him stroll&mdash;immaculate and
      heavy&mdash;back toward his Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t even love with conviction,&rsquo; she thought.
      &lsquo;What will Mother do?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dreams that night were endless and uneasy; she rose heavy and
      unrested, and went at once to the study of Whitaker&rsquo;s Almanac. A
      Forsyte is instinctively aware that facts are the real crux of any
      situation. She might conquer Jon&rsquo;s prejudice, but without exact
      machinery to complete their desperate resolve, nothing would happen. From
      the invaluable tome she learned that they must each be twenty-one; or some
      one&rsquo;s consent would be necessary, which of course was unobtainable;
      then she became lost in directions concerning licenses, certificates,
      notices, districts, coming finally to the word &ldquo;perjury.&rdquo; But
      that was nonsense! Who would really mind their giving wrong ages in order
      to be married for love! She ate hardly any breakfast, and went back to
      Whitaker. The more she studied the less sure she became; till, idly
      turning the pages, she came to Scotland. People could be married there
      without any of this nonsense. She had only to go and stay there twenty-one
      days, then Jon could come, and in front of two people they could declare
      themselves married. And what was more&mdash;they would be! It was far the
      best way; and at once she ran over her schoolfellows. There was Mary Lambe
      who lived in Edinburgh and was &ldquo;quite a sport!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a brother too. She could stay with Mary Lambe, who with her
      brother would serve for witnesses. She well knew that some girls would
      think all this unnecessary, and that all she and Jon need do was to go
      away together for a weekend and then say to their people: &ldquo;We are
      married by Nature, we must now be married by Law.&rdquo; But Fleur was
      Forsyte enough to feel such a proceeding dubious, and to dread her father&rsquo;s
      face when he heard of it. Besides, she did not believe that Jon would do
      it; he had an opinion of her such as she could not bear to diminish. No!
      Mary Lambe was preferable, and it was just the time of year to go to
      Scotland. More at ease now she packed, avoided her aunt, and took a bus to
      Chiswick. She was too early, and went on to Kew Gardens. She found no
      peace among its flower-beds, labelled trees, and broad green spaces, and
      having lunched off anchovy-paste sandwiches and coffee, returned to
      Chiswick and rang June&rsquo;s bell. The Austrian admitted her to the
      &ldquo;little meal-room.&rdquo; Now that she knew what she and Jon were up
      against, her longing for him had increased tenfold, as if he were a toy
      with sharp edges or dangerous paint such as they had tried to take from
      her as a child. If she could not have her way, and get Jon for good and
      all, she felt like dying of privation. By hook or crook she must and would
      get him! A round dim mirror of very old glass hung over the pink brick
      hearth. She stood looking at herself reflected in it, pale, and rather
      dark under the eyes; little shudders kept passing through her nerves. Then
      she heard the bell ring, and, stealing to the window, saw him standing on
      the doorstep smoothing his hair and lips, as if he too were trying to
      subdue the fluttering of his nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting on one of the two rush-seated chairs, with her back to the
      door, when he came in, and she said at once&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Jon, I want to talk seriously.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon sat on the table by her side, and without looking at him she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to lose me, we must get married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Is there anything new?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I felt it at Robin Hill, and among my people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; stammered Jon, &ldquo;at Robin Hill&mdash;it was
      all smooth&mdash;and they&rsquo;ve said nothing to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they mean to stop us. Your mother&rsquo;s face was enough. And
      my father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen him since?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur nodded. What mattered a few supplementary lies?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Jon eagerly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see how they can
      feel like that after all these years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur looked up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t love me enough.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not love you
      enough! Why&mdash;!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then make sure of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without telling them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till after.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon was silent. How much older he looked than on that day, barely two
      months ago, when she first saw him&mdash;quite two years older!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would hurt Mother awfully,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur drew her hand away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to choose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon slid off the table on to his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not tell them? They can&rsquo;t really stop us, Fleur!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can! I tell you, they can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re utterly dependent&mdash;by putting money pressure, and
      all sorts of other pressure. I&rsquo;m not patient, Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s deceiving them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really love me, or you wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate.
      &lsquo;He either fears his fate too much!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lifting his hands to her waist, Jon forced her to sit down again. She
      hurried on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve planned it all out. We&rsquo;ve only to go to Scotland.
      When we&rsquo;re married they&rsquo;ll soon come round. People always come
      round to facts. Don&rsquo;t you see, Jon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to hurt them so awfully!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So he would rather hurt her than those people of his! &ldquo;All right,
      then; let me go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon got up and put his back against the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said slowly; &ldquo;but I
      want to think it over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She could see that he was seething with feelings he wanted to express; but
      she did not mean to help him. She hated herself at this moment and almost
      hated him. Why had she to do all the work to secure their love? It wasn&rsquo;t
      fair. And then she saw his eyes, adoring and distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look like that! I only don&rsquo;t want to lose you,
      Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t lose me so long as you want me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon put his hands on her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleur, do you know anything you haven&rsquo;t told me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the point-blank question she had dreaded. She looked straight at
      him, and answered: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; She had burnt her boats; but what did
      it matter, if she got him? He would forgive her. And throwing her arms
      round his neck, she kissed him on the lips. She was winning! She felt it
      in the beating of his heart against her, in the closing of his eyes.
      &ldquo;I want to make sure! I want to make sure!&rdquo; she whispered.
      &ldquo;Promise!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon did not answer. His face had the stillness of extreme trouble. At last
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like hitting them. I must think a little, Fleur. I
      really must.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur slipped out of his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Very well!&rdquo; And suddenly she burst into tears of
      disappointment, shame, and overstrain. Followed five minutes of acute
      misery. Jon&rsquo;s remorse and tenderness knew no bounds; but he did not
      promise. Despite her will to cry, &ldquo;Very well, then, if you don&rsquo;t
      love me enough-goodbye!&rdquo; she dared not. From birth accustomed to her
      own way, this check from one so young, so tender, so devoted, baffled and
      surprised her. She wanted to push him away from her, to try what anger and
      coldness would do, and again she dared not. The knowledge that she was
      scheming to rush him blindfold into the irrevocable weakened everything&mdash;weakened
      the sincerity of pique, and the sincerity of passion; even her kisses had
      not the lure she wished for them. That stormy little meeting ended
      inconclusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you some tea, gnadiges Fraulein?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pushing Jon from her, she cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-no, thank you! I&rsquo;m just going.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And before he could prevent her she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went stealthily, mopping her gushed, stained cheeks, frightened,
      angry, very miserable. She had stirred Jon up so fearfully, yet nothing
      definite was promised or arranged! But the more uncertain and hazardous
      the future, the more &ldquo;the will to have&rdquo; worked its tentacles
      into the flesh of her heart&mdash;like some burrowing tick!
    </p>
    <p>
      No one was at Green Street. Winifred had gone with Imogen to see a play
      which some said was allegorical, and others &ldquo;very exciting, don&rsquo;t
      you know.&rdquo; It was because of what others said that Winifred and
      Imogen had gone. Fleur went on to Paddington. Through the carriage the air
      from the brick-kilns of West Drayton and the late hayfields fanned her
      still gushed cheeks. Flowers had seemed to be had for the picking; now
      they were all thorned and prickled. But the golden flower within the crown
      of spikes seemed to her tenacious spirit all the fairer and more
      desirable.

    <h2>
      IX.&mdash;THE FAT IN THE FIRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On reaching home Fleur found an atmosphere so peculiar that it penetrated
      even the perplexed aura of her own private life. Her mother was
      inaccessibly entrenched in a brown study; her father contemplating fate in
      the vinery. Neither of them had a word to throw to a dog. &lsquo;Is it
      because of me?&rsquo; thought Fleur. &lsquo;Or because of Profond?&rsquo;
      To her mother she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother answered with a shrug of her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her father:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter? What should be the matter?&rdquo; and gave her a sharp
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; murmured Fleur, &ldquo;Monsieur Profond is going
      a &lsquo;small&rsquo; voyage on his yacht, to the South Seas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames examined a branch on which no grapes were growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This vine&rsquo;s a failure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
      young Mont here. He asked me something about you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! How do you like him, Father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s a product&mdash;like all these young people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you at his age, dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We went to work, and didn&rsquo;t play about&mdash;flying and
      motoring, and making love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ever make love?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She avoided looking at him while she said that, but she saw him well
      enough. His pale face had reddened, his eyebrows, where darkness was still
      mingled with the grey, had come close together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no time or inclination to philander.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you had a grand passion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames looked at her intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;if you want to know&mdash;and much good it did me.&rdquo;
      He moved away, along by the hot-water pipes. Fleur tiptoed silently after
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about it, Father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames became very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should you want to know about such things, at your age?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she alive?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And married?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jon Forsyte&rsquo;s mother, isn&rsquo;t it? And she was
      your wife first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said in a flash of intuition. Surely his opposition came from his
      anxiety that she should not know of that old wound to his pride. But she
      was startled. To see some one so old and calm wince as if struck, to hear
      so sharp a note of pain in his voice!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that? If your aunt! I can&rsquo;t bear the affair
      talked of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, darling,&rdquo; said Fleur, softly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so long
      ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long ago or not, I....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur stood stroking his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to forget,&rdquo; he said suddenly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      wish to be reminded.&rdquo; And then, as if venting some long and secret
      irritation, he added: &ldquo;In these days people don&rsquo;t understand.
      Grand passion, indeed! No one knows what it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Fleur, almost in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, who had turned his back on her, spun round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking of&mdash;a child like you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ve inherited it, Father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For her son, you see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pale as a sheet, and she knew that she was as bad. They stood
      staring at each other in the steamy heat, redolent of the mushy scent of
      earth, of potted geranium, and of vines coming along fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is crazy,&rdquo; said Soames at last, between dry lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely moving her own, she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, Father. I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But she could see he wasn&rsquo;t angry; only scared, deeply scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that foolishness,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;was all
      forgotten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! It&rsquo;s ten times what it was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames kicked at the hot-water pipe. The hapless movement touched her, who
      had no fear of her father&mdash;none.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What must be, must, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must!&rdquo; repeated Soames. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
      talking of. Has that boy been told?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood rushed into her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had turned from her again, and, with one shoulder a little raised,
      stood staring fixedly at a joint in the pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s most distasteful to me,&rdquo; he said suddenly; &ldquo;nothing
      could be more so. Son of that fellow! It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;perverse!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had noted, almost unconsciously, that he did not say &ldquo;son of
      that woman,&rdquo; and again her intuition began working.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did the ghost of that grand passion linger in some corner of his heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped her hand under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jon&rsquo;s father is quite ill and old; I saw him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I went there with Jon; I saw them both.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what did they say to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. They were very polite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would be.&rdquo; He resumed his contemplation of the
      pipe-joint, and then said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must think this over&mdash;I&rsquo;ll speak to you again
      to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew this was final for the moment, and stole away, leaving him still
      looking at the pipe-joint. She wandered into the fruit-garden, among the
      raspberry and currant bushes, without impetus to pick and eat. Two months
      ago&mdash;she was light-hearted! Even two days ago&mdash;light-hearted,
      before Prosper Profond told her. Now she felt tangled in a web-of
      passions, vested rights, oppressions and revolts, the ties of love and
      hate. At this dark moment of discouragement there seemed, even to her
      hold-fast nature, no way out. How deal with it&mdash;how sway and bend
      things to her will, and get her heart&rsquo;s desire? And, suddenly, round
      the corner of the high box hedge, she came plump on her mother, walking
      swiftly, with an open letter in her hand. Her bosom was heaving, her eyes
      dilated, her cheeks flushed. Instantly Fleur thought: &lsquo;The yacht!
      Poor Mother!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette gave her a wide startled look, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;J&rsquo;ai la migraine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! you and your father&mdash;sorry!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mother&mdash;I am. I know what it feels like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette&rsquo;s startled eyes grew wide, till the whites showed above
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor innocent!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother&mdash;so self-possessed, and commonsensical&mdash;to look and
      speak like this! It was all frightening! Her father, her mother, herself!
      And only two months back they had seemed to have everything they wanted in
      this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette crumpled the letter in her hand. Fleur knew that she must ignore
      the sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I do anything for your head, Mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette shook that head and walked on, swaying her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s cruel,&rsquo; thought Fleur, &lsquo;and I was glad! That
      man! What do men come prowling for, disturbing everything! I suppose he&rsquo;s
      tired of her. What business has he to be tired of my mother? What
      business!&rsquo; And at that thought, so natural and so peculiar, she
      uttered a little choked laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ought, of course, to be delighted, but what was there to be delighted
      at? Her father didn&rsquo;t really care! Her mother did, perhaps? She
      entered the orchard, and sat down under a cherry-tree. A breeze sighed in
      the higher boughs; the sky seen through their green was very blue and very
      white in cloud&mdash;those heavy white clouds almost always present in
      river landscape. Bees, sheltering out of the wind, hummed softly, and over
      the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruit-trees planted by her
      father five-and-twenty, years ago. Birds were almost silent, the cuckoos
      had ceased to sing, but wood-pigeons were cooing. The breath and drone and
      cooing of high summer were not for long a sedative to her excited nerves.
      Crouched over her knees she began to scheme. Her father must be made to
      back her up. Why should he mind so long as she was happy? She had not
      lived for nearly nineteen years without knowing that her future was all he
      really cared about. She had, then, only to convince him that her future
      could not be happy without Jon. He thought it a mad fancy. How foolish the
      old were, thinking they could tell what the young felt! Had not he
      confessed that he&mdash;when young&mdash;had loved with a grand passion?
      He ought to understand! &lsquo;He piles up his money for me,&rsquo; she
      thought; &lsquo;but what&rsquo;s the use, if I&rsquo;m not going to be
      happy?&rsquo; Money, and all it bought, did not bring happiness. Love only
      brought that. The ox-eyed daisies in this orchard, which gave it such a
      moony look sometimes, grew wild and happy, and had their hour. &lsquo;They
      oughtn&rsquo;t to have called me Fleur,&rsquo; she mused, &lsquo;if they
      didn&rsquo;t mean me to have my hour, and be happy while it lasts.&rsquo;
      Nothing real stood in the way, like poverty, or disease&mdash;sentiment
      only, a ghost from the unhappy past! Jon was right. They wouldn&rsquo;t
      let you live, these old people! They made mistakes, committed crimes, and
      wanted their children to go on paying! The breeze died away; midges began
      to bite. She got up, plucked a piece of honeysuckle, and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hot that night. Both she and her mother had put on thin, pale low
      frocks. The dinner flowers were pale. Fleur was struck with the pale look
      of everything; her father&rsquo;s face, her mother&rsquo;s shoulders; the
      pale panelled walls, the pale grey velvety carpet, the lamp-shade, even
      the soup was pale. There was not one spot of colour in the room, not even
      wine in the pale glasses, for no one drank it. What was not pale was black&mdash;her
      father&rsquo;s clothes, the butler&rsquo;s clothes, her retriever
      stretched out exhausted in the window, the curtains black with a cream
      pattern. A moth came in, and that was pale. And silent was that
      half-mourning dinner in the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father called her back as she was following her mother out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down beside him at the table, and, unpinning the pale honeysuckle,
      put it to her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely painful for me to talk, but there&rsquo;s no
      help for it. I don&rsquo;t know if you understand how much you are to me I&rsquo;ve
      never spoken of it, I didn&rsquo;t think it necessary; but&mdash;but you&rsquo;re
      everything. Your mother&mdash;&rdquo; he paused, staring at his
      finger-bowl of Venetian glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only you to look to. I&rsquo;ve never had&mdash;never
      wanted anything else, since you were born.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Fleur murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames moistened his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may think this a matter I can smooth over and arrange for you.
      You&rsquo;re mistaken. I&rsquo;m helpless.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite apart from my own feelings,&rdquo; went on Soames with more
      resolution, &ldquo;those two are not amenable to anything I can say. They&mdash;they
      hate me, as people always hate those whom they have injured.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;But he&mdash;Jon&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s their flesh and blood, her only child. Probably he means
      to her what you mean to me. It&rsquo;s a deadlock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Fleur, &ldquo;no, Father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames leaned back, the image of pale patience, as if resolved on the
      betrayal of no emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re putting the feelings of
      two months&mdash;two months&mdash;against the feelings of thirty-five
      years! What chance do you think you have? Two months&mdash;your very first
      love affair, a matter of half a dozen meetings, a few walks and talks, a
      few kisses&mdash;against, against what you can&rsquo;t imagine, what no
      one could who hasn&rsquo;t been through it. Come, be reasonable, Fleur! It&rsquo;s
      midsummer madness!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur tore the honeysuckle into little, slow bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The madness is in letting the past spoil it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we care about the past? It&rsquo;s our lives, not yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames raised his hand to his forehead, where suddenly she saw moisture
      shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose child are you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whose child is he? The
      present is linked with the past, the future with both. There&rsquo;s no
      getting away from that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never heard philosophy pass those lips before. Impressed even in
      her agitation, she leaned her elbows on the table, her chin on her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Father, consider it practically. We want each other. There&rsquo;s
      ever so much money, and nothing whatever in the way but sentiment. Let&rsquo;s
      bury the past, Father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His answer was a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Fleur gently, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t prevent
      us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;that if left to
      myself I should try to prevent you; I must put up with things, I know, to
      keep your affection. But it&rsquo;s not I who control this matter. That&rsquo;s
      what I want you to realise before it&rsquo;s too late. If you go on
      thinking you can get your way and encourage this feeling, the blow will be
      much heavier when you find you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Fleur, &ldquo;help me, Father; you can help me,
      you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames made a startled movement of negation. &ldquo;I?&rdquo; he said
      bitterly. &ldquo;Help? I am the impediment&mdash;the just cause and
      impediment&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that the jargon? You have my blood in your
      veins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the fat&rsquo;s in the fire. If you persist in your
      wilfulness you&rsquo;ll have yourself to blame. Come! Don&rsquo;t be
      foolish, my child&mdash;my only child!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur laid her forehead against his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was in such turmoil within her. But no good to show it! No good at
      all! She broke away from him, and went out into the twilight, distraught,
      but unconvinced. All was indeterminate and vague within her, like the
      shapes and shadows in the garden, except&mdash;her will to have. A poplar
      pierced up into the dark-blue sky and touched a white star there. The dew
      wetted her shoes, and chilled her bare shoulders. She went down to the
      river bank, and stood gazing at a moonstreak on the darkening water.
      Suddenly she smelled tobacco smoke, and a white figure emerged as if
      created by the moon. It was young Mont in flannels, standing in his boat.
      She heard the tiny hiss of his cigarette extinguished in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleur,&rdquo; came his voice, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be hard on a poor
      devil! I&rsquo;ve been waiting hours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in my boat!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a water-nymph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any romance in you? Don&rsquo;t be modern, Fleur!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared on the path within a yard of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleur, I love you. Fleur!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur uttered a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come again,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when I haven&rsquo;t got my
      wish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your wish?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleur,&rdquo; said Mont, and his voice sounded strange, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      mock me! Even vivisected dogs are worth decent treatment before they&rsquo;re
      cut up for good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur shook her head; but her lips were trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you shouldn&rsquo;t make me jump. Give me a cigarette.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mont gave her one, lighted it, and another for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk rot,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but please
      imagine all the rot that all the lovers that ever were have talked, and
      all my special rot thrown in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I have imagined it. Good-night!&rdquo; They stood for a
      moment facing each other in the shadow of an acacia-tree with very moonlit
      blossoms, and the smoke from their cigarettes mingled in the air between
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also ran: &lsquo;Michael Mont&rsquo;.&rdquo; he said. Fleur turned
      abruptly toward the house. On the lawn she stopped to look back. Michael
      Mont was whirling his arms above him; she could see them dashing at his
      head; then waving at the moonlit blossoms of the acacia. His voice just
      reached her. &ldquo;Jolly-jolly!&rdquo; Fleur shook herself. She couldn&rsquo;t
      help him, she had too much trouble of her own! On the verandah she stopped
      very suddenly again. Her mother was sitting in the drawing-room at her
      writing bureau, quite alone. There was nothing remarkable in the
      expression of her face except its utter immobility. But she looked
      desolate! Fleur went upstairs. At the door of her room she paused. She
      could hear her father walking up and down, up and down the
      picture-gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she thought, jolly! Oh, Jon!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      X.&mdash;DECISION
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Fleur left him Jon stared at the Austrian. She was a thin woman with
      a dark face and the concerned expression of one who has watched every
      little good that life once had slip from her, one by one. &ldquo;No tea?&rdquo;
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susceptible to the disappointment in her voice, Jon murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really; thanks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lil cup&mdash;it ready. A lil cup and cigarette.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur was gone! Hours of remorse and indecision lay before him! And with a
      heavy sense of disproportion he smiled, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;thank you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She brought in a little pot of tea with two little cups, and a silver box
      of cigarettes on a little tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sugar? Miss Forsyte has much sugar&mdash;she buy my sugar, my
      friend&rsquo;s sugar also. Miss Forsyte is a veree kind lady. I am happy
      to serve her. You her brother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jon, beginning to puff the second cigarette of his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very young brother,&rdquo; said the Austrian, with a little anxious
      smile, which reminded him of the wag of a dog&rsquo;s tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I give you some?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t you sit
      down, please?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Austrian shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father a very nice old man&mdash;the most nice old man I ever
      see. Miss Forsyte tell me all about him. Is he better?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her words fell on Jon like a reproach. &ldquo;Oh Yes, I think he&rsquo;s
      all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to see him again,&rdquo; said the Austrian, putting a hand
      on her heart; &ldquo;he have veree kind heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jon. And again her words seemed to him a reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never give no trouble to no one, and smile so gentle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He look at Miss Forsyte so funny sometimes. I tell him all my
      story; he so sympatisch. Your mother&mdash;she nice and well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He have her photograph on his dressing-table. Veree beautiful&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon gulped down his tea. This woman, with her concerned face and her
      reminding words, was like the first and second murderers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I must go now. May&mdash;may I
      leave this with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put a ten-shilling note on the tray with a doubting hand and gained the
      door. He heard the Austrian gasp, and hurried out. He had just time to
      catch his train, and all the way to Victoria looked at every face that
      passed, as lovers will, hoping against hope. On reaching Worthing he put
      his luggage into the local train, and set out across the Downs for
      Wansdon, trying to walk off his aching irresolution. So long as he went
      full bat, he could enjoy the beauty of those green slopes, stopping now
      and again to sprawl on the grass, admire the perfection of a wild rose or
      listen to a lark&rsquo;s song. But the war of motives within him was but
      postponed&mdash;the longing for Fleur, and the hatred of deception. He
      came to the old chalk-pit above Wansdon with his mind no more made up than
      when he started. To see both sides of a question vigorously was at once
      Jon&rsquo;s strength and weakness. He tramped in, just as the first
      dinner-bell rang. His things had already been brought up. He had a hurried
      bath and came down to find Holly alone&mdash;Val had gone to Town and
      would not be back till the last train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Val&rsquo;s advice to him to ask his sister what was the matter
      between the two families, so much had happened&mdash;Fleur&rsquo;s
      disclosure in the Green Park, her visit to Robin Hill, to-day&rsquo;s
      meeting&mdash;that there seemed nothing to ask. He talked of Spain, his
      sunstroke, Val&rsquo;s horses, their father&rsquo;s health. Holly startled
      him by saying that she thought their father not at all well. She had been
      twice to Robin Hill for the week-end. He had seemed fearfully languid,
      sometimes even in pain, but had always refused to talk about himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s awfully dear and unselfish&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think,
      Jon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling far from dear and unselfish himself, Jon answered: &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, he&rsquo;s been a simply perfect father, so long as I can
      remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jon, very subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never interfered, and he&rsquo;s always seemed to
      understand. I shall never forget his letting me go to South Africa in the
      Boer War when I was in love with Val.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was before he married Mother, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Jon
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nothing. Only, wasn&rsquo;t she engaged to Fleur&rsquo;s father
      first?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly put down the spoon she was using, and raised her eyes. Her stare was
      circumspect. What did the boy know? Enough to make it better to tell him?
      She could not decide. He looked strained and worried, altogether older,
      but that might be the sunstroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was something,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of course we were out
      there, and got no news of anything.&rdquo; She could not take the risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not her secret. Besides, she was in the dark about his feelings
      now. Before Spain she had made sure he was in love; but boys were boys;
      that was seven weeks ago, and all Spain between.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that he knew she was putting him off, and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard anything of Fleur?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His face told her, then, more than the most elaborate explanations. So he
      had not forgotten!
    </p>
    <p>
      She said very quietly: &ldquo;Fleur is awfully attractive, Jon, but you
      know&mdash;Val and I don&rsquo;t really like her very much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We think she&rsquo;s got rather a &lsquo;having&rsquo; nature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Having&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. She&mdash;she&mdash;&rdquo;
      he pushed his dessert plate away, got up, and went to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly, too, got up, and put her arm round his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, Jon dear. We can&rsquo;t all see people in
      the same light, can we? You know, I believe each of us only has about one
      or two people who can see the best that&rsquo;s in us, and bring it out.
      For you I think it&rsquo;s your mother. I once saw her looking at a letter
      of yours; it was wonderful to see her face. I think she&rsquo;s the most
      beautiful woman I ever saw&mdash;Age doesn&rsquo;t seem to touch her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon&rsquo;s face softened; then again became tense. Everybody&mdash;everybody
      was against him and Fleur! It all strengthened the appeal of her words:
      &ldquo;Make sure of me&mdash;marry me, Jon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, where he had passed that wonderful week with her&mdash;the tug of
      her enchantment, the ache in his heart increased with every minute that
      she was not there to make the room, the garden, the very air magical.
      Would he ever be able to live down here, not seeing her? And he closed up
      utterly, going early to bed. It would not make him healthy, wealthy, and
      wise, but it closeted him with memory of Fleur in her fancy frock. He
      heard Val&rsquo;s arrival&mdash;the Ford discharging cargo, then the
      stillness of the summer night stole back&mdash;with only the bleating of
      very distant sheep, and a night-Jar&rsquo;s harsh purring. He leaned far
      out. Cold moon&mdash;warm air&mdash;the Downs like silver! Small wings, a
      stream bubbling, the rambler roses! God&mdash;how empty all of it without
      her! In the Bible it was written: Thou shalt leave father and mother and
      cleave to&mdash;Fleur!
    </p>
    <p>
      Let him have pluck, and go and tell them! They couldn&rsquo;t stop him
      marrying her&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t want to stop him when they knew how
      he felt. Yes! He would go! Bold and open&mdash;Fleur was wrong!
    </p>
    <p>
      The night-jar ceased, the sheep were silent; the only sound in the
      darkness was the bubbling of the stream. And Jon in his bed slept, freed
      from the worst of life&rsquo;s evils&mdash;indecision.

    <h2>
      XI.&mdash;TIMOTHY PROPHESIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the day of the cancelled meeting at the National Gallery began the
      second anniversary of the resurrection of England&rsquo;s pride and glory&mdash;or,
      more shortly, the top hat. &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;that festival
      which the War had driven from the field&mdash;raised its light and dark
      blue flags for the second time, displaying almost every feature of a
      glorious past. Here, in the luncheon interval, were all species of female
      and one species of male hat, protecting the multiple types of face
      associated with &ldquo;the classes.&rdquo; The observing Forsyte might
      discern in the free or unconsidered seats a certain number of the
      squash-hatted, but they hardly ventured on the grass; the old school&mdash;or
      schools&mdash;could still rejoice that the proletariat was not yet paying
      the necessary half-crown. Here was still a close borough, the only one
      left on a large scale&mdash;for the papers were about to estimate the
      attendance at ten thousand. And the ten thousand, all animated by one
      hope, were asking each other one question: &ldquo;Where are you lunching?&rdquo;
      Something wonderfully uplifting and reassuring in that query and the sight
      of so many people like themselves voicing it! What reserve power in the
      British realm&mdash;enough pigeons, lobsters, lamb, salmon mayonnaise,
      strawberries, and bottles of champagne to feed the lot! No miracle in
      prospect&mdash;no case of seven loaves and a few fishes&mdash;faith rested
      on surer foundations. Six thousand top hats, four thousand parasols would
      be doffed and furled, ten thousand mouths all speaking the same English
      would be filled. There was life in the old dog yet! Tradition! And again
      Tradition! How strong and how elastic! Wars might rage, taxation prey,
      Trades Unions take toll, and Europe perish of starvation; but the ten
      thousand would be fed; and, within their ring fence, stroll upon green
      turf, wear their top hats, and meet&mdash;themselves. The heart was sound,
      the pulse still regular. E-ton! E-ton! Har-r-o-o-o-w!
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the many Forsytes, present on a hunting-ground theirs, by personal
      prescriptive right, or proxy, was Soames with his wife and daughter. He
      had not been at either school, he took no interest in cricket, but he
      wanted Fleur to show her frock, and he wanted to wear his top hat parade
      it again in peace and plenty among his peers. He walked sedately with
      Fleur between him and Annette. No women equalled them, so far as he could
      see. They could walk, and hold themselves up; there was substance in their
      good looks; the modern woman had no build, no chest, no anything! He
      remembered suddenly with what intoxication of pride he had walked round
      with Irene in the first years of his first marriage. And how they used to
      lunch on the drag which his mother would make his father have, because it
      was so &ldquo;chic&rdquo;&mdash;all drags and carriages in those days, not
      these lumbering great Stands! And how consistently Montague Dartie had
      drunk too much. He supposed that people drank too much still, but there
      was not the scope for it there used to be. He remembered George Forsyte&mdash;whose
      brothers Roger and Eustace had been at Harrow and Eton&mdash;towering up
      on the top of the drag waving a light-blue flag with one hand and a
      dark-blue flag with the other, and shouting &ldquo;Etroow-Harrton!&rdquo;
      Just when everybody was silent, like the buffoon he had always been; and
      Eustace got up to the nines below, too dandified to wear any colour or
      take any notice. H&rsquo;m! Old days, and Irene in grey silk shot with
      palest green. He looked, sideways, at Fleur&rsquo;s face. Rather
      colourless-no light, no eagerness! That love affair was preying on her&mdash;a
      bad business! He looked beyond, at his wife&rsquo;s face, rather more
      touched up than usual, a little disdainful&mdash;not that she had any
      business to disdain, so far as he could see. She was taking Profond&rsquo;s
      defection with curious quietude; or was his &ldquo;small&rdquo; voyage
      just a blind? If so, he should refuse to see it! Having promenaded round
      the pitch and in front of the pavilion, they sought Winifred&rsquo;s table
      in the Bedouin Club tent. This Club&mdash;a new &ldquo;cock and hen&rdquo;&mdash;had
      been founded in the interests of travel, and of a gentleman with an old
      Scottish name, whose father had somewhat strangely been called Levi.
      Winifred had joined, not because she had travelled, but because instinct
      told her that a Club with such a name and such a founder was bound to go
      far; if one didn&rsquo;t join at once one might never have the chance. Its
      tent, with a text from the Koran on an orange ground, and a small green
      camel embroidered over the entrance, was the most striking on the ground.
      Outside it they found Jack Cardigan in a dark blue tie (he had once played
      for Harrow), batting with a Malacca cane to show how that fellow ought to
      have hit that ball. He piloted them in. Assembled in Winifred&rsquo;s
      corner were Imogen, Benedict with his young wife, Val Dartie without
      Holly, Maud and her husband, and, after Soames and his two were seated,
      one empty place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting Prosper,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s
      so busy with his yacht.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stole a glance. No movement in his wife&rsquo;s face! Whether that
      fellow were coming or not, she evidently knew all about it. It did not
      escape him that Fleur, too, looked at her mother. If Annette didn&rsquo;t
      respect his feelings, she might think of Fleur&rsquo;s! The conversation,
      very desultory, was syncopated by Jack Cardigan talking about &ldquo;mid-off.&rdquo;
      He cited all the &ldquo;great mid-offs&rdquo; from the beginning of time,
      as if they had been a definite racial entity in the composition of the
      British people. Soames had finished his lobster, and was beginning on
      pigeon-pie, when he heard the words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a small bit late,
      Mrs. Dartie,&rdquo; and saw that there was no longer any empty place. That
      fellow was sitting between Annette and Imogen. Soames ate steadily on,
      with an occasional word to Maud and Winifred. Conversation buzzed around
      him. He heard the voice of Profond say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re mistaken, Mrs. Forsyde; I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      bet Miss Forsyde agrees with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what?&rdquo; came Fleur&rsquo;s clear voice across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sayin&rsquo;, young gurls are much the same as they always
      were&mdash;there&rsquo;s very small difference.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know so much about them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That sharp reply caught the ears of all, and Soames moved uneasily on his
      thin green chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know, I think they want their own small way,
      and I think they always did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but&mdash;Prosper,&rdquo; Winifred interjected comfortably,
      &ldquo;the girls in the streets&mdash;the girls who&rsquo;ve been in
      munitions, the little flappers in the shops; their manners now really
      quite hit you in the eye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word &ldquo;hit&rdquo; Jack Cardigan stopped his disquisition; and
      in the silence Monsieur Profond said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was inside before, now it&rsquo;s outside; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But their morals!&rdquo; cried Imogen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as moral as they ever were, Mrs. Cardigan, but they&rsquo;ve
      got more opportunity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The saying, so cryptically cynical, received a little laugh from Imogen, a
      slight opening of Jack Cardigan&rsquo;s mouth, and a creak from Soames&rsquo;
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad, Prosper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, Mrs. Forsyde; don&rsquo;t you think human nature&rsquo;s
      always the same?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames subdued a sudden longing to get up and kick the fellow. He heard
      his wife reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Human nature is not the same in England as anywhere else.&rdquo;
      That was her confounded mockery!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know much about this small country&rdquo;&mdash;&rsquo;No,
      thank God!&rsquo; thought Soames&mdash;&ldquo;but I should say the pot was
      boilin&rsquo; under the lid everywhere. We all want pleasure, and we
      always did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Damn the fellow! His cynicism was&mdash;was outrageous!
    </p>
    <p>
      When lunch was over they broke up into couples for the digestive
      promenade. Too proud to notice, Soames knew perfectly that Annette and
      that fellow had gone prowling round together. Fleur was with Val; she had
      chosen him, no doubt, because he knew that boy. He himself had Winifred
      for partner. They walked in the bright, circling stream, a little flushed
      and sated, for some minutes, till Winifred sighed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we were back forty years, old boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the eyes of her spirit an interminable procession of her own
      &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s&rdquo; frocks was passing, paid for with the money of
      her father, to save a recurrent crisis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been very
      amusing, after all. Sometimes I even wish Monty was back. What do you
      think of people nowadays, Soames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precious little style. The thing began to go to pieces with
      bicycles and motor-cars; the War has finished it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo; said Winifred in a voice
      dreamy from pigeon-pie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all sure we shan&rsquo;t
      go back to crinolines and pegtops. Look at that dress!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s money, but no faith in things. We don&rsquo;t lay by
      for the future. These youngsters&mdash;it&rsquo;s all a short life and a
      merry one with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a hat!&rdquo; said Winifred. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know&mdash;when you come to think of the people killed and all that in the
      War, it&rsquo;s rather wonderful, I think. There&rsquo;s no other country&mdash;Prosper
      says the rest are all bankrupt, except America; and of course her men
      always took their style in dress from us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that chap,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;really going to the South
      Seas?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! one never knows where Prosper&rsquo;s going!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a sign of the times,&rdquo; muttered Soames, &ldquo;if
      you like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred&rsquo;s hand gripped his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn your head,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, &ldquo;but
      look to your right in the front row of the Stand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames looked as best he could under that limitation. A man in a grey top
      hat, grey-bearded, with thin brown, folded cheeks, and a certain elegance
      of posture, sat there with a woman in a lawn-coloured frock, whose dark
      eyes were fixed on himself. Soames looked quickly at his feet. How funnily
      feet moved, one after the other like that! Winifred&rsquo;s voice said in
      his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jolyon looks very ill; but he always had style. She doesn&rsquo;t
      change&mdash;except her hair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you tell Fleur about that business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t; she picked it up. I always knew she would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a mess. She&rsquo;s set her heart upon their boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little wretch,&rdquo; murmured Winifred. &ldquo;She tried to
      take me in about that. What shall you do, Soames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be guided by events.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved on, silent, in the almost solid crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Winifred suddenly; &ldquo;it almost seems like
      Fate. Only that&rsquo;s so old-fashioned. Look! there are George and
      Eustace!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George Forsyte&rsquo;s lofty bulk had halted before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Soames!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just met Profond and your
      wife. You&rsquo;ll catch &lsquo;em if you put on pace. Did you ever go to
      see old Timothy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames nodded, and the streams forced them apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always liked old George,&rdquo; said Winifred. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      so droll.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did,&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your seat? I
      shall go to mine. Fleur may be back there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen Winifred to her seat, he regained his own, conscious of small,
      white, distant figures running, the click of the bat, the cheers and
      counter-cheers. No Fleur, and no Annette! You could expect nothing of
      women nowadays! They had the vote. They were &ldquo;emancipated,&rdquo;
      and much good it was doing them! So Winifred would go back, would she, and
      put up with Dartie all over again? To have the past once more&mdash;to be
      sitting here as he had sat in &lsquo;83 and &lsquo;84, before he was
      certain that his marriage with Irene had gone all wrong, before her
      antagonism had become so glaring that with the best will in the world he
      could not overlook it. The sight of her with that fellow had brought all
      memory back. Even now he could not understand why she had been so
      impracticable. She could love other men; she had it in her! To himself,
      the one person she ought to have loved, she had chosen to refuse her
      heart. It seemed to him, fantastically, as he looked back, that all this
      modern relaxation of marriage&mdash;though its forms and laws were the
      same as when he married her&mdash;that all this modern looseness had come
      out of her revolt; it seemed to him, fantastically, that she had started
      it, till all decent ownership of anything had gone, or was on the point of
      going. All came from her! And now&mdash;a pretty state of things! Homes!
      How could you have them without mutual ownership? Not that he had ever had
      a real home! But had that been his fault? He had done his best. And his
      rewards were&mdash;those two sitting in that Stand, and this affair of
      Fleur&rsquo;s!
    </p>
    <p>
      And overcome by loneliness he thought: &lsquo;Shan&rsquo;t wait any
      longer! They must find their own way back to the hotel&mdash;if they mean
      to come!&rsquo; Hailing a cab outside the ground, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive me to the Bayswater Road.&rdquo; His old aunts had never
      failed him. To them he had meant an ever-welcome visitor. Though they were
      gone, there, still, was Timothy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Smither was standing in the open doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Soames! I was just taking the air. Cook will be so pleased.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Mr. Timothy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not himself at all these last few days, sir; he&rsquo;s been
      talking a great deal. Only this morning he was saying: &lsquo;My brother
      James, he&rsquo;s getting old.&rsquo; His mind wanders, Mr. Soames, and
      then he will talk of them. He troubles about their investments. The other
      day he said: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s my brother Jolyon won&rsquo;t look at
      Consols&rsquo;&mdash;he seemed quite down about it. Come in, Mr. Soames,
      come in! It&rsquo;s such a pleasant change!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;just for a few minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; murmured Smither in the hall, where the air had the
      singular freshness of the outside day, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t been very
      satisfied with him, not all this week. He&rsquo;s always been one to leave
      a titbit to the end; but ever since Monday he&rsquo;s been eating it
      first. If you notice a dog, Mr. Soames, at its dinner, it eats the meat
      first. We&rsquo;ve always thought it such a good sign of Mr. Timothy at
      his age to leave it to the last, but now he seems to have lost all his
      self-control; and, of course, it makes him leave the rest. The doctor
      doesn&rsquo;t make anything of it, but&rdquo;&mdash;Smither shook her head&mdash;&ldquo;he
      seems to think he&rsquo;s got to eat it first, in case he shouldn&rsquo;t
      get to it. That and his talking makes us anxious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he said anything important?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to say that, Mr. Soames; but he&rsquo;s
      turned against his Will. He gets quite pettish&mdash;and after having had
      it out every morning for years, it does seem funny. He said the other day:
      &lsquo;They want my money.&rsquo; It gave me such a turn, because, as I
      said to him, nobody wants his money, I&rsquo;m sure. And it does seem a
      pity he should be thinking about money at his time of life. I took my
      courage in my &lsquo;ands. &lsquo;You know, Mr. Timothy,&rsquo; I said,
      &lsquo;my dear mistress&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s Miss Forsyte, Mr.
      Soames, Miss Ann that trained me&mdash;&rsquo;she never thought about
      money,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;it was all character with her.&rsquo; He
      looked at me, I can&rsquo;t tell you how funny, and he said quite dry:
      &lsquo;Nobody wants my character.&rsquo; Think of his saying a thing like
      that! But sometimes he&rsquo;ll say something as sharp and sensible as
      anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, who had been staring at an old print by the hat-rack, thinking,
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s got value!&rsquo; murmured: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up
      and see him, Smither.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cook&rsquo;s with him,&rdquo; answered Smither above her corsets;
      &ldquo;she will be pleased to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He mounted slowly, with the thought: &lsquo;Shan&rsquo;t care to live to
      be that age.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second floor, he paused, and tapped. The door was opened, and he
      saw the round homely face of a woman about sixty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Soames!&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;Why! Mr. Soames!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames nodded. &ldquo;All right, Cook!&rdquo; and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy was propped up in bed, with his hands joined before his chest, and
      his eyes fixed on the ceiling, where a fly was standing upside down.
      Soames stood at the foot of the bed, facing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Timothy,&rdquo; he said, raising his voice. &ldquo;Uncle
      Timothy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy&rsquo;s eyes left the fly, and levelled themselves on his visitor.
      Soames could see his pale tongue passing over his darkish lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Timothy,&rdquo; he said again, &ldquo;is there anything I can
      do for you? Is there anything you&rsquo;d like to say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to look you up and see that everything&rsquo;s all
      right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy nodded. He seemed trying to get used to the apparition before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got everything you want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I get you anything?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Soames, you know; your nephew, Soames Forsyte. Your
      brother James&rsquo; son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted to do anything I can for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy beckoned. Soames went close to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo; said Timothy in a voice which seemed to have
      outlived tone, &ldquo;you tell them all from me&mdash;you tell them all&mdash;&rdquo;
      and his finger tapped on Soames&rsquo; arm, &ldquo;to hold on&mdash;hold
      on&mdash;Consols are goin&rsquo; up,&rdquo; and he nodded thrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Timothy, and, fixing his eyes again on the
      ceiling, he added: &ldquo;That fly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely moved, Soames looked at the Cook&rsquo;s pleasant fattish face,
      all little puckers from staring at fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do him a world of good, sir,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mutter came from Timothy, but he was clearly speaking to himself, and
      Soames went out with the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could make you a pink cream, Mr. Soames, like in old days;
      you did so relish them. Good-bye, sir; it has been a pleasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care of him, Cook, he is old.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, shaking her crumpled hand, he went down-stairs. Smither was still
      taking the air in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of him, Mr. Soames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; Soames murmured: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lost touch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Smither, &ldquo;I was afraid you&rsquo;d think
      that coming fresh out of the world to see him like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smither,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all indebted to
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Mr. Soames, don&rsquo;t say that! It&rsquo;s a pleasure&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      such a wonderful man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye!&rdquo; said Soames, and got into his taxi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going up!&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;going up!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the hotel at Knightsbridge he went to their sitting-room, and
      rang for tea. Neither of them were in. And again that sense of loneliness
      came over him. These hotels. What monstrous great places they were now! He
      could remember when there was nothing bigger than Long&rsquo;s or Brown&rsquo;s,
      Morley&rsquo;s or the Tavistock, and the heads that were shaken over the
      Langham and the Grand. Hotels and Clubs&mdash;Clubs and Hotels; no end to
      them now! And Soames, who had just been watching at Lord&rsquo;s a miracle
      of tradition and continuity, fell into reverie over the changes in that
      London where he had been born five-and-sixty years before. Whether Consols
      were going up or not, London had become a terrific property. No such
      property in the world, unless it were New York! There was a lot of
      hysteria in the papers nowadays; but any one who, like himself, could
      remember London sixty years ago, and see it now, realised the fecundity
      and elasticity of wealth. They had only to keep their heads, and go at it
      steadily. Why! he remembered cobblestones, and stinking straw on the floor
      of your cab. And old Timothy&mdash;what could he not have told them, if he
      had kept his memory! Things were unsettled, people in a funk or in a
      hurry, but here were London and the Thames, and out there the British
      Empire, and the ends of the earth. &ldquo;Consols are goin&rsquo; up!&rdquo;
      He should n&rsquo;t be a bit surprised. It was the breed that counted. And
      all that was bull-dogged in Soames stared for a moment out of his grey
      eyes, till diverted by the print of a Victorian picture on the walls. The
      hotel had bought three dozen of that little lot! The old hunting or
      &ldquo;Rake&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; prints in the old inns were worth
      looking at&mdash;but this sentimental stuff&mdash;well, Victorianism had
      gone! &ldquo;Tell them to hold on!&rdquo; old Timothy had said. But to
      what were they to hold on in this modern welter of the &ldquo;democratic
      principle&rdquo;? Why, even privacy was threatened! And at the thought
      that privacy might perish, Soames pushed back his teacup and went to the
      window. Fancy owning no more of Nature than the crowd out there owned of
      the flowers and trees and waters of Hyde Park! No, no! Private possession
      underlay everything worth having. The world had slipped its sanity a bit,
      as dogs now and again at full moon slipped theirs and went off for a night&rsquo;s
      rabbiting; but the world, like the dog, knew where its bread was buttered
      and its bed warm, and would come back sure enough to the only home worth
      having&mdash;to private ownership. The world was in its second childhood
      for the moment, like old Timothy&mdash;eating its titbit first!
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard a sound behind him, and saw that his wife and daughter had come
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re back!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur did not answer; she stood for a moment looking at him and her
      mother, then passed into her bedroom. Annette poured herself out a cup of
      tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Paris, to my mother, Soames.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! To your mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when are you going?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Monday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she really going to her mother? Odd, how indifferent he felt! Odd, how
      clearly she had perceived the indifference he would feel so long as there
      was no scandal. And suddenly between her and himself he saw distinctly the
      face he had seen that afternoon&mdash;Irene&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you want money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; I have enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Let us know when you are coming back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette put down the cake she was fingering, and, looking up through
      darkened lashes, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I give Maman any message?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My regards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette stretched herself, her hands on her waist, and said in French:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What luck that you have never loved me, Soames!&rdquo; Then rising,
      she too left the room. Soames was glad she had spoken it in French&mdash;it
      seemed to require no dealing with. Again that other face&mdash;pale,
      dark-eyed, beautiful still! And there stirred far down within him the
      ghost of warmth, as from sparks lingering beneath a mound of flaky ash.
      And Fleur infatuated with her boy! Queer chance! Yet, was there such a
      thing as chance? A man went down a street, a brick fell on his head. Ah!
      that was chance, no doubt. But this! &ldquo;Inherited,&rdquo; his girl had
      said. She&mdash;she was &ldquo;holding on&rdquo;!

    <h2>
      I.&mdash;OLD JOLYON WALKS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Twofold impulse had made Jolyon say to his wife at breakfast &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
      go up to Lord&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanted&rdquo;&mdash;something to abate the anxiety in which those
      two had lived during the sixty hours since Jon had brought Fleur down.
      &ldquo;Wanted&rdquo;&mdash;too, that which might assuage the pangs of
      memory in one who knew he might lose them any day!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty-eight years ago Jolyon had become an Eton boy, for old Jolyon&rsquo;s
      whim had been that he should be canonised at the greatest possible
      expense. Year after year he had gone to Lord&rsquo;s from Stanhope Gate
      with a father whose youth in the eighteen-twenties had been passed without
      polish in the game of cricket. Old Jolyon would speak quite openly of
      swipes, full tosses, half and three-quarter balls; and young Jolyon with
      the guileless snobbery of youth had trembled lest his sire should be
      overheard. Only in this supreme matter of cricket he had been nervous, for
      his father&mdash;in Crimean whiskers then&mdash;had ever impressed him as
      the beau ideal. Though never canonised himself, Old Jolyon&rsquo;s natural
      fastidiousness and balance had saved him from the errors of the vulgar.
      How delicious, after bowling in a top hat and a sweltering heat, to go
      home with his father in a hansom cab, bathe, dress, and forth to the
      &ldquo;Disunion&rdquo; Club, to dine off white bait, cutlets, and a tart,
      and go&mdash;two &ldquo;swells,&rdquo; old and young, in lavender kid
      gloves&mdash;to the opera or play. And on Sunday, when the match was over,
      and his top hat duly broken, down with his father in a special hansom to
      the &ldquo;Crown and Sceptre,&rdquo; and the terrace above the river&mdash;the
      golden sixties when the world was simple, dandies glamorous, Democracy not
      born, and the books of Whyte Melville coming thick and fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      A generation later, with his own boy, Jolly, Harrow-buttonholed with
      corn-flowers&mdash;by old Jolyon&rsquo;s whim his grandson had been
      canonised at a trifle less expense&mdash;again Jolyon had experienced the
      heat and counter-passions of the day, and come back to the cool and the
      strawberry beds of Robin Hill, and billiards after dinner, his boy making
      the most heart-breaking flukes and trying to seem languid and grown-up.
      Those two days each year he and his son had been alone together in the
      world, one on each side&mdash;and Democracy just born!
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, he had unearthed a grey top hat, borrowed a tiny bit of light-blue
      ribbon from Irene, and gingerly, keeping cool, by car and train and taxi,
      had reached Lord&rsquo;s Ground. There, beside her in a lawn-coloured
      frock with narrow black edges, he had watched the game, and felt the old
      thrill stir within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Soames passed, the day was spoiled. Irene&rsquo;s face was distorted
      by compression of the lips. No good to go on sitting here with Soames or
      perhaps his daughter recurring in front of them, like decimals. And he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear, if you&rsquo;ve had enough&mdash;let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Jolyon felt exhausted. Not wanting her to see him thus, he
      waited till she had begun to play, and stole off to the little study. He
      opened the long window for air, and the door, that he might still hear her
      music drifting in; and, settled in his father&rsquo;s old armchair, closed
      his eyes, with his head against the worn brown leather. Like that passage
      of the Cesar Franck Sonata&mdash;so had been his life with her, a divine
      third movement. And now this business of Jon&rsquo;s&mdash;this bad
      business! Drifted to the edge of consciousness, he hardly knew if it were
      in sleep that he smelled the scent of a cigar, and seemed to see his
      father in the blackness before his closed eyes. That shape formed, went,
      and formed again; as if in the very chair where he himself was sitting, he
      saw his father, black-coated, with knees crossed, glasses balanced between
      thumb and finger; saw the big white moustaches, and the deep eyes looking
      up below a dome of forehead and seeming to search his own, seeming to
      speak. &ldquo;Are you facing it, Jo? It&rsquo;s for you to decide. She&rsquo;s
      only a woman!&rdquo; Ah! how well he knew his father in that phrase; how
      all the Victorian Age came up with it! And his answer &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve
      funked it&mdash;funked hurting her and Jon and myself. I&rsquo;ve got a
      heart; I&rsquo;ve funked it.&rdquo; But the old eyes, so much older, so
      much younger than his own, kept at it; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your wife, your
      son; your past. Tackle it, my boy!&rdquo; Was it a message from walking
      spirit; or but the instinct of his sire living on within him? And again
      came that scent of cigar smoke-from the old saturated leather. Well! he
      would tackle it, write to Jon, and put the whole thing down in black and
      white! And suddenly he breathed with difficulty, with a sense of
      suffocation, as if his heart were swollen. He got up and went out into the
      air. The stars were very bright. He passed along the terrace round the
      corner of the house, till, through the window of the music-room, he could
      see Irene at the piano, with lamp-light falling on her powdery hair;
      withdrawn into herself she seemed, her dark eyes staring straight before
      her, her hands idle. Jolyon saw her raise those hands and clasp them over
      her breast. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Jon, with her,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;all
      Jon! I&rsquo;m dying out of her&mdash;it&rsquo;s natural!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, careful not to be seen, he stole back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, after a bad night, he sat down to his task. He wrote with
      difficulty and many erasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAREST BOY,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are old enough to understand how very difficult it is for
      elders to give themselves away to their young. Especially when&mdash;like
      your mother and myself, though I shall never think of her as anything but
      young&mdash;their hearts are altogether set on him to whom they must
      confess. I cannot say we are conscious of having sinned exactly&mdash;people
      in real life very seldom are, I believe&mdash;but most persons would say
      we had, and at all events our conduct, righteous or not, has found us out.
      The truth is, my dear, we both have pasts, which it is now my task to make
      known to you, because they so grievously and deeply affect your future.
      Many, very many years ago, as far back indeed as 1883, when she was only
      twenty, your mother had the great and lasting misfortune to make an
      unhappy marriage&mdash;no, not with me, Jon. Without money of her own, and
      with only a stepmother&mdash;closely related to Jezebel&mdash;she was very
      unhappy in her home life. It was Fleur&rsquo;s father that she married, my
      cousin Soames Forsyte. He had pursued her very tenaciously and to do him
      justice was deeply in love with her. Within a week she knew the fearful
      mistake she had made. It was not his fault; it was her error of judgment&mdash;her
      misfortune.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So far Jolyon had kept some semblance of irony, but now his subject
      carried him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jon, I want to explain to you if I can&mdash;and it&rsquo;s very
      hard&mdash;how it is that an unhappy marriage such as this can so easily
      come about. You will of course say: &lsquo;If she didn&rsquo;t really love
      him how could she ever have married him?&rsquo; You would be right if it
      were not for one or two rather terrible considerations. From this initial
      mistake of hers all the subsequent trouble, sorrow, and tragedy have come,
      and so I must make it clear to you if I can. You see, Jon, in those days
      and even to this day&mdash;indeed, I don&rsquo;t see, for all the talk of
      enlightenment, how it can well be otherwise&mdash;most girls are married
      ignorant of the sexual side of life. Even if they know what it means they
      have not experienced it. That&rsquo;s the crux. It is this actual lack of
      experience, whatever verbal knowledge they have, which makes all the
      difference and all the trouble. In a vast number of marriages-and your
      mother&rsquo;s was one&mdash;girls are not and cannot be certain whether
      they love the man they marry or not; they do not know until after that act
      of union which makes the reality of marriage. Now, in many, perhaps in
      most doubtful cases, this act cements and strengthens the attachment, but
      in other cases, and your mother&rsquo;s was one, it is a revelation of
      mistake, a destruction of such attraction as there was. There is nothing
      more tragic in a woman&rsquo;s life than such a revelation, growing daily,
      nightly clearer. Coarse-grained and unthinking people are apt to laugh at
      such a mistake, and say, &lsquo;What a fuss about nothing!&rsquo; Narrow
      and self-righteous people, only capable of judging the lives of others by
      their own, are apt to condemn those who make this tragic error, to condemn
      them for life to the dungeons they have made for themselves. You know the
      expression: &lsquo;She has made her bed, she must lie on it!&rsquo; It is
      a hard-mouthed saying, quite unworthy of a gentleman or lady in the best
      sense of those words; and I can use no stronger condemnation. I have not
      been what is called a moral man, but I wish to use no words to you, my
      dear, which will make you think lightly of ties or contracts into which
      you enter. Heaven forbid! But with the experience of a life behind me I do
      say that those who condemn the victims of these tragic mistakes, condemn
      them and hold out no hands to help them, are inhuman, or rather they would
      be if they had the understanding to know what they are doing. But they
      haven&rsquo;t! Let them go! They are as much anathema to me as I, no
      doubt, am to them. I have had to say all this, because I am going to put
      you into a position to judge your mother, and you are very young, without
      experience of what life is. To go on with the story. After three years of
      effort to subdue her shrinking&mdash;I was going to say her loathing and
      it&rsquo;s not too strong a word, for shrinking soon becomes loathing
      under such circumstances&mdash;three years of what to a sensitive,
      beauty-loving nature like your mother&rsquo;s, Jon, was torment, she met a
      young man who fell in love with her. He was the architect of this very
      house that we live in now, he was building it for her and Fleur&rsquo;s
      father to live in, a new prison to hold her, in place of the one she
      inhabited with him in London. Perhaps that fact played some part in what
      came of it. But in any case she, too, fell in love with him. I know it&rsquo;s
      not necessary to explain to you that one does not precisely choose with
      whom one will fall in love. It comes. Very well! It came. I can imagine&mdash;though
      she never said much to me about it&mdash;the struggle that then took place
      in her, because, Jon, she was brought up strictly and was not light in her
      ideas&mdash;not at all. However, this was an overwhelming feeling, and it
      came to pass that they loved in deed as well as in thought. Then came a
      fearful tragedy. I must tell you of it because if I don&rsquo;t you will
      never understand the real situation that you have now to face. The man
      whom she had married&mdash;Soames Forsyte, the father of Fleur one night,
      at the height of her passion for this young man, forcibly reasserted his
      rights over her. The next day she met her lover and told him of it.
      Whether he committed suicide or whether he was accidentally run over in
      his distraction, we never knew; but so it was. Think of your mother as she
      was that evening when she heard of his death. I happened to see her. Your
      grandfather sent me to help her if I could. I only just saw her, before
      the door was shut against me by her husband. But I have never forgotten
      her face, I can see it now. I was not in love with her then, not for
      twelve years after, but I have never forgotten. My dear boy&mdash;it is
      not easy to write like this. But you see, I must. Your mother is wrapped
      up in you, utterly, devotedly. I don&rsquo;t wish to write harshly of
      Soames Forsyte. I don&rsquo;t think harshly of him. I have long been sorry
      for him; perhaps I was sorry even then. As the world judges she was in
      error, he within his rights. He loved her&mdash;in his way. She was his
      property. That is the view he holds of life&mdash;of human feelings and
      hearts&mdash;property. It&rsquo;s not his fault&mdash;so was he born. To
      me it is a view that has always been abhorrent&mdash;so was I born!
      Knowing you as I do, I feel it cannot be otherwise than abhorrent to you.
      Let me go on with the story. Your mother fled from his house that night;
      for twelve years she lived quietly alone without companionship of any
      sort, until in 1899 her husband&mdash;you see, he was still her husband,
      for he did not attempt to divorce her, and she of course had no right to
      divorce him&mdash;became conscious, it seems, of the want of children, and
      commenced a long attempt to induce her to go back to him and give him a
      child. I was her trustee then, under your Grandfather&rsquo;s Will, and I
      watched this going on. While watching, I became attached to her, devotedly
      attached. His pressure increased, till one day she came to me here and
      practically put herself under my protection. Her husband, who was kept
      informed of all her movements, attempted to force us apart by bringing a
      divorce suit, or possibly he really meant it, I don&rsquo;t know; but
      anyway our names were publicly joined. That decided us, and we became
      united in fact. She was divorced, married me, and you were born. We have
      lived in perfect happiness, at least I have, and I believe your mother
      also. Soames, soon after the divorce, married Fleur&rsquo;s mother, and
      she was born. That is the story, Jon. I have told it you, because by the
      affection which we see you have formed for this man&rsquo;s daughter you
      are blindly moving toward what must utterly destroy your mother&rsquo;s
      happiness, if not your own. I don&rsquo;t wish to speak of myself, because
      at my age there&rsquo;s no use supposing I shall cumber the ground much
      longer, besides, what I should suffer would be mainly on her account, and
      on yours. But what I want you to realise is that feelings of horror and
      aversion such as those can never be buried or forgotten. They are alive in
      her to-day. Only yesterday at Lord&rsquo;s we happened to see Soames
      Forsyte. Her face, if you had seen it, would have convinced you. The idea
      that you should marry his daughter is a nightmare to her, Jon. I have
      nothing to say against Fleur save that she is his daughter. But your
      children, if you married her, would be the grandchildren of Soames, as
      much as of your mother, of a man who once owned your mother as a man might
      own a slave. Think what that would mean. By such a marriage you enter the
      camp which held your mother prisoner and wherein she ate her heart out.
      You are just on the threshold of life, you have only known this girl two
      months, and however deeply you think you love her, I appeal to you to
      break it off at once. Don&rsquo;t give your mother this rankling pain and
      humiliation during the rest of her life. Young though she will always seem
      to me, she is fifty-seven. Except for us two she has no one in the world.
      She will soon have only you. Pluck up your spirit, Jon, and break away.
      Don&rsquo;t put this cloud and barrier between you. Don&rsquo;t break her
      heart! Bless you, my dear boy, and again forgive me for all the pain this
      letter must bring you&mdash;we tried to spare it you, but Spain&mdash;it
      seems&mdash;-was no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever your devoted father,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;JOLYON FORSYTE.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished his confession, Jolyon sat with a thin cheek on his hand,
      re-reading. There were things in it which hurt him so much, when he
      thought of Jon reading them, that he nearly tore the letter up. To speak
      of such things at all to a boy&mdash;his own boy&mdash;to speak of them in
      relation to his own wife and the boy&rsquo;s own mother, seemed dreadful
      to the reticence of his Forsyte soul. And yet without speaking of them how
      make Jon understand the reality, the deep cleavage, the ineffaceable scar?
      Without them, how justify this stiffing of the boy&rsquo;s love? He might
      just as well not write at all!
    </p>
    <p>
      He folded the confession, and put it in his pocket. It was&mdash;thank
      Heaven!&mdash;Saturday; he had till Sunday evening to think it over; for
      even if posted now it could not reach Jon till Monday. He felt a curious
      relief at this delay, and at the fact that, whether sent or not, it was
      written.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the rose garden, which had taken the place of the old fernery, he could
      see Irene snipping and pruning, with a little basket on her arm. She was
      never idle, it seemed to him, and he envied her now that he himself was
      idle nearly all his time. He went down to her. She held up a stained glove
      and smiled. A piece of lace tied under her chin concealed her hair, and
      her oval face with its still dark brows looked very young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The green-fly are awful this year, and yet it&rsquo;s cold. You
      look tired, Jolyon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon took the confession from his pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been writing
      this. I think you ought to see it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Jon?&rdquo; Her whole face had changed, in that instant,
      becoming almost haggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the murder&rsquo;s out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave it to her, and walked away among the roses. Presently, seeing that
      she had finished reading and was standing quite still with the sheets of
      the letter against her skirt, he came back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderfully put. I don&rsquo;t see how it could be put
      better. Thank you, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything you would like left out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he must know all, if he&rsquo;s to understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought, but&mdash;I hate it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the feeling that he hated it more than she&mdash;to him sex was so
      much easier to mention between man and woman than between man and man; and
      she had always been more natural and frank, not deeply secretive like his
      Forsyte self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if he will understand, even now, Jolyon? He&rsquo;s so
      young; and he shrinks from the physical.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gets that shrinking from my father, he was as fastidious as a
      girl in all such matters. Would it be better to rewrite the whole thing,
      and just say you hated Soames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hate&rsquo;s only a word. It conveys nothing. No, better as it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. It shall go to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her face to his, and in sight of the big house&rsquo;s many
      creepered windows, he kissed her.

    <h2>
      II.&mdash;CONFESSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Late that same afternoon, Jolyon had a nap in the old armchair. Face down
      on his knee was La Rotisserie de la Refine Pedauque, and just before he
      fell asleep he had been thinking: &lsquo;As a people shall we ever really
      like the French? Will they ever really like us!&rsquo; He himself had
      always liked the French, feeling at home with their wit, their taste,
      their cooking. Irene and he had paid many visits to France before the War,
      when Jon had been at his private school. His romance with her had begun in
      Paris&mdash;his last and most enduring romance. But the French&mdash;no
      Englishman could like them who could not see them in some sort with the
      detached aesthetic eye! And with that melancholy conclusion he had nodded
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he woke he saw Jon standing between him and the window. The boy had
      evidently come in from the garden and was waiting for him to wake. Jolyon
      smiled, still half asleep. How nice the chap looked&mdash;sensitive,
      affectionate, straight! Then his heart gave a nasty jump; and a quaking
      sensation overcame him. Jon! That confession! He controlled himself with
      an effort. &ldquo;Why, Jon, where did you spring from?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon bent over and kissed his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only then he noticed the look on the boy&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came home to tell you something, Dad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his might Jolyon tried to get the better of the jumping, gurgling
      sensations within his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sit down, old man. Have you seen your mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s flushed look gave place to pallor; he
      sat down on the arm of the old chair, as, in old days, Jolyon himself used
      to sit beside his own father, installed in its recesses. Right up to the
      time of the rupture in their relations he had been wont to perch there&mdash;had
      he now reached such a moment with his own son? All his life he had hated
      scenes like poison, avoided rows, gone on his own way quietly and let
      others go on theirs. But now&mdash;it seemed&mdash;at the very end of
      things, he had a scene before him more painful than any he had avoided. He
      drew a visor down over his emotion, and waited for his son to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Jon slowly, &ldquo;Fleur and I are engaged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly!&rsquo; thought Jolyon, breathing with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that you and Mother don&rsquo;t like the idea. Fleur says
      that Mother was engaged to her father before you married her. Of course I
      don&rsquo;t know what happened, but it must be ages ago. I&rsquo;m devoted
      to her, Dad, and she says she is to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon uttered a queer sound, half laugh, half groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are nineteen, Jon, and I am seventy-two. How are we to
      understand each other in a matter like this, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love Mother, Dad; you must know what we feel. It isn&rsquo;t
      fair to us to let old things spoil our happiness, is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Brought face to face with his confession, Jolyon resolved to do without it
      if by any means he could. He laid his hand on the boy&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Jon! I might put you off with talk about your both being too
      young and not knowing your own minds, and all that, but you wouldn&rsquo;t
      listen, besides, it doesn&rsquo;t meet the case&mdash;Youth,
      unfortunately, cures itself. You talk lightly about &lsquo;old things like
      that,&rsquo; knowing nothing&mdash;as you say truly&mdash;of what
      happened. Now, have I ever given you reason to doubt my love for you, or
      my word?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At a less anxious moment he might have been amused by the conflict his
      words aroused&mdash;the boy&rsquo;s eager clasp, to reassure him on these
      points, the dread on his face of what that reassurance would bring forth;
      but he could only feel grateful for the squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, you can believe what I tell you. If you don&rsquo;t give
      up this love affair, you will make Mother wretched to the end of her days.
      Believe me, my dear, the past, whatever it was, can&rsquo;t be buried&mdash;it
      can&rsquo;t indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon got off the arm of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The girl&rsquo;&mdash;thought Jolyon&mdash;&rsquo;there she goes&mdash;starting
      up before him&mdash;life itself&mdash;eager, pretty, loving!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Father; how can I&mdash;just because you say that?
      Of course, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jon, if you knew the story you would give this up without
      hesitation; you would have to! Can&rsquo;t you believe me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you tell what I should think? Father, I love her better
      than anything in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon&rsquo;s face twitched, and he said with painful slowness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than your mother, Jon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From the boy&rsquo;s face, and his clenched fists Jolyon realised the
      stress and struggle he was going through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he burst out, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!
      But to give Fleur up for nothing&mdash;for something I don&rsquo;t
      understand, for something that I don&rsquo;t believe can really matter
      half so much, will make me&mdash;make me....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make you feel us unjust, put a barrier&mdash;yes. But that&rsquo;s
      better than going on with this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. Fleur loves me, and I love her. You want me to trust
      you; why don&rsquo;t you trust me, Father? We wouldn&rsquo;t want to know
      anything&mdash;we wouldn&rsquo;t let it make any difference. It&rsquo;ll
      only make us both love you and Mother all the more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon put his hand into his breast pocket, but brought it out again
      empty, and sat, clucking his tongue against his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think what your mother&rsquo;s been to you, Jon! She has nothing
      but you; I shan&rsquo;t last much longer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? It isn&rsquo;t fair to&mdash;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jolyon, rather coldly, &ldquo;because the doctors
      tell me I shan&rsquo;t; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dad!&rdquo; cried Jon, and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      This downbreak of his son, whom he had not seen cry since he was ten,
      moved Jolyon terribly. He recognised to the full how fearfully soft the
      boy&rsquo;s heart was, how much he would suffer in this business, and in
      life generally. And he reached out his hand helplessly&mdash;not wishing,
      indeed not daring to get up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&mdash;or you&rsquo;ll
      make me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon smothered down his paroxysm, and stood with face averted, very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What now?&rsquo; thought Jolyon. &lsquo;What can I say to move him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, don&rsquo;t speak of that to Mother,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;she has enough to frighten her with this affair of yours. I know
      how you feel. But, Jon, you know her and me well enough to be sure we
      wouldn&rsquo;t wish to spoil your happiness lightly. Why, my dear boy, we
      don&rsquo;t care for anything but your happiness&mdash;at least, with me
      it&rsquo;s just yours and Mother&rsquo;s and with her just yours. It&rsquo;s
      all the future for you both that&rsquo;s at stake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon turned. His face was deadly pale; his eyes, deep in his head, seemed
      to burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? What is it? Don&rsquo;t keep me like this!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon, who knew that he was beaten, thrust his hand again into his breast
      pocket, and sat for a full minute, breathing with difficulty, his eyes
      closed. The thought passed through his mind: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had a good
      long innings&mdash;some pretty bitter moments&mdash;this is the worst!&rsquo;
      Then he brought his hand out with the letter, and said with a sort of
      fatigue: &ldquo;Well, Jon, if you hadn&rsquo;t come to-day, I was going to
      send you this. I wanted to spare you&mdash;I wanted to spare your mother
      and myself, but I see it&rsquo;s no good. Read it, and I think I&rsquo;ll
      go into the garden.&rdquo; He reached forward to get up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon, who had taken the letter, said quickly, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go&rdquo;;
      and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon sank back in his chair. A blue-bottle chose that moment to come
      buzzing round him with a sort of fury; the sound was homely, better than
      nothing.... Where had the boy gone to read his letter? The wretched letter&mdash;the
      wretched story! A cruel business&mdash;cruel to her&mdash;to Soames&mdash;to
      those two children&mdash;to himself!... His heart thumped and pained him.
      Life&mdash;its loves&mdash;its work&mdash;its beauty&mdash;its aching, and&mdash;its
      end! A good time; a fine time in spite of all; until&mdash;you regretted
      that you had ever been born. Life&mdash;it wore you down, yet did not make
      you want to die&mdash;that was the cunning evil! Mistake to have a heart!
      Again the blue-bottle came buzzing&mdash;bringing in all the heat and hum
      and scent of summer&mdash;yes, even the scent&mdash;as of ripe fruits,
      dried grasses, sappy shrubs, and the vanilla breath of cows. And out there
      somewhere in the fragrance Jon would be reading that letter, turning and
      twisting its pages in his trouble, his bewilderment and trouble&mdash;breaking
      his heart about it! The thought made Jolyon acutely miserable. Jon was
      such a tender-hearted chap, affectionate to his bones, and conscientious,
      too&mdash;it was so unfair, so damned unfair! He remembered Irene saying
      to him once: &ldquo;Never was any one born more loving and lovable than
      Jon.&rdquo; Poor little Jon! His world gone up the spout, all of a summer
      afternoon! Youth took things so hard! And stirred, tormented by that
      vision of Youth taking things hard, Jolyon got out of his chair, and went
      to the window. The boy was nowhere visible. And he passed out. If one
      could take any help to him now&mdash;one must!
    </p>
    <p>
      He traversed the shrubbery, glanced into the walled garden&mdash;no Jon!
      Nor where the peaches and the apricots were beginning to swell and colour.
      He passed the Cupressus trees, dark and spiral, into the meadow. Where had
      the boy got to? Had he rushed down to the coppice&mdash;his old
      hunting-ground? Jolyon crossed the rows of hay. They would cock it on
      Monday and be carrying the day after, if rain held off. Often they had
      crossed this field together&mdash;hand in hand, when Jon was a little
      chap. Dash it! The golden age was over by the time one was ten! He came to
      the pond, where flies and gnats were dancing over a bright reedy surface;
      and on into the coppice. It was cool there, fragrant of larches. Still no
      Jon! He called. No answer! On the log seat he sat down, nervous, anxious,
      forgetting his own physical sensations. He had been wrong to let the boy
      get away with that letter; he ought to have kept him under his eye from
      the start! Greatly troubled, he got up to retrace his steps. At the
      farm-buildings he called again, and looked into the dark cow-house. There
      in the cool, and the scent of vanilla and ammonia, away from flies, the
      three Alderneys were chewing the quiet cud; just milked, waiting for
      evening, to be turned out again into the lower field. One turned a lazy
      head, a lustrous eye; Jolyon could see the slobber on its grey lower lip.
      He saw everything with passionate clearness, in the agitation of his
      nerves&mdash;all that in his time he had adored and tried to paint&mdash;wonder
      of light and shade and colour. No wonder the legend put Christ into a
      manger&mdash;what more devotional than the eyes and moon-white horns of a
      chewing cow in the warm dusk! He called again. No answer! And he hurried
      away out of the coppice, past the pond, up the hill. Oddly ironical&mdash;now
      he came to think of it&mdash;if Jon had taken the gruel of his discovery
      down in the coppice where his mother and Bosinney in those old days had
      made the plunge of acknowledging their love. Where he himself, on the log
      seat the Sunday morning he came back from Paris, had realised to the full
      that Irene had become the world to him. That would have been the place for
      Irony to tear the veil from before the eyes of Irene&rsquo;s boy! But he
      was not here! Where had he got to? One must find the poor chap!
    </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of sun had come, sharpening to his hurrying senses all the beauty
      of the afternoon, of the tall trees and lengthening shadows, of the blue,
      and the white clouds, the scent of the hay, and the cooing of the pigeons;
      and the flower shapes standing tall. He came to the rosery, and the beauty
      of the roses in that sudden sunlight seemed to him unearthly. &ldquo;Rose,
      you Spaniard!&rdquo; Wonderful three words! There she had stood by that
      bush of dark red roses; had stood to read and decide that Jon must know it
      all! He knew all now! Had she chosen wrong? He bent and sniffed a rose,
      its petals brushed his nose and trembling lips; nothing so soft as a
      rose-leaf&rsquo;s velvet, except her neck&mdash;Irene! On across the lawn
      he went, up the slope, to the oak-tree. Its top alone was glistening, for
      the sudden sun was away over the house; the lower shade was thick,
      blessedly cool&mdash;he was greatly overheated. He paused a minute with
      his hand on the rope of the swing&mdash;Jolly, Holly&mdash;Jon! The old
      swing! And suddenly, he felt horribly&mdash;deadly ill. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      over done it!&rsquo; he thought: &lsquo;by Jove! I&rsquo;ve overdone it&mdash;after
      all!&rsquo; He staggered up toward the terrace, dragged himself up the
      steps, and fell against the wall of the house. He leaned there gasping,
      his face buried in the honey-suckle that he and she had taken such trouble
      with that it might sweeten the air which drifted in. Its fragrance mingled
      with awful pain. &lsquo;My love!&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;the boy!&rsquo;
      And with a great effort he tottered in through the long window, and sank
      into old Jolyon&rsquo;s chair. The book was there, a pencil in it; he
      caught it up, scribbled a word on the open page.... His hand dropped....
      So it was like this&mdash;was it?...
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great wrench; and darkness....

    <h2>
      III.&mdash;IRENE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Jon rushed away with the letter in his hand, he ran along the terrace
      and round the corner of the house, in fear and confusion. Leaning against
      the creepered wall he tore open the letter. It was long&mdash;very long!
      This added to his fear, and he began reading. When he came to the words:
      &ldquo;It was Fleur&rsquo;s father that she married,&rdquo; everything
      seemed to spin before him. He was close to a window, and entering by it,
      he passed, through music-room and hall, up to his bedroom. Dipping his
      face in cold water, he sat on his bed, and went on reading, dropping each
      finished page on the bed beside him. His father&rsquo;s writing was easy
      to read&mdash;he knew it so well, though he had never had a letter from
      him one quarter so long. He read with a dull feeling&mdash;imagination
      only half at work. He best grasped, on that first reading, the pain his
      father must have had in writing such a letter. He let the last sheet fall,
      and in a sort of mental, moral helplessness began to read the first again.
      It all seemed to him disgusting&mdash;dead and disgusting. Then, suddenly,
      a hot wave of horrified emotion tingled through him. He buried his face in
      his hands. His mother! Fleur&rsquo;s father! He took up the letter again,
      and read on mechanically. And again came the feeling that it was all dead
      and disgusting; his own love so different! This letter said his mother&mdash;and
      her father! An awful letter!
    </p>
    <p>
      Property! Could there be men who looked on women as their property? Faces
      seen in street and countryside came thronging up before him&mdash;red,
      stock-fish faces; hard, dull faces; prim, dry faces; violent faces;
      hundreds, thousands of them! How could he know what men who had such faces
      thought and did? He held his head in his hands and groaned. His mother! He
      caught up the letter and read on again: &ldquo;horror and aversion-alive
      in her to-day.... your children.... grandchildren.... of a man who once
      owned your mother as a man might own a slave....&rdquo; He got up from his
      bed. This cruel shadowy past, lurking there to murder his love and Fleur&rsquo;s,
      was true, or his father could never have written it. &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t
      they tell me the first thing,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;the day I first
      saw Fleur? They knew I&rsquo;d seen her. They were afraid, and&mdash;now&mdash;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;got
      it!&rsquo; Overcome by misery too acute for thought or reason, he crept
      into a dusky corner of the room and sat down on the floor. He sat there,
      like some unhappy little animal. There was comfort in dusk, and the floor&mdash;as
      if he were back in those days when he played his battles sprawling all
      over it. He sat there huddled, his hair ruffled, his hands clasped round
      his knees, for how long he did not know. He was wrenched from his blank
      wretchedness by the sound of the door opening from his mother&rsquo;s
      room. The blinds were down over the windows of his room, shut up in his
      absence, and from where he sat he could only hear a rustle, her footsteps
      crossing, till beyond the bed he saw her standing before his
      dressing-table. She had something in her hand. He hardly breathed, hoping
      she would not see him, and go away. He saw her touch things on the table
      as if they had some virtue in them, then face the window-grey from head to
      foot like a ghost. The least turn of her head, and she must see him! Her
      lips moved: &ldquo;Oh! Jon!&rdquo; She was speaking to herself; the tone
      of her voice troubled Jon&rsquo;s heart. He saw in her hand a little
      photograph. She held it toward the light, looking at it&mdash;very small.
      He knew it&mdash;one of himself as a tiny boy, which she always kept in
      her bag. His heart beat fast. And, suddenly as if she had heard it, she
      turned her eyes and saw him. At the gasp she gave, and the movement of her
      hands pressing the photograph against her breast, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved over to the bed, and sat down on it, quite close to him, her
      hands still clasping her breast, her feet among the sheets of the letter
      which had slipped to the floor. She saw them, and her hands grasped the
      edge of the bed. She sat very upright, her dark eyes fixed on him. At last
      she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jon, you know, I see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen Father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence, till she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my darling!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; The emotions in him were so, violent
      and so mixed that he dared not move&mdash;resentment, despair, and yet a
      strange yearning for the comfort of her hand on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another long silence, then she got up. She stood a moment, very
      still, made a little movement with her hand, and said: &ldquo;My darling
      boy, my most darling boy, don&rsquo;t think of me&mdash;think of yourself,&rdquo;
      and, passing round the foot of the bed, went back into her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon turned&mdash;curled into a sort of ball, as might a hedgehog&mdash;into
      the corner made by the two walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have been twenty minutes there before a cry roused him. It came
      from the terrace below. He got up, scared. Again came the cry: &ldquo;Jon!&rdquo;
      His mother was calling! He ran out and down the stairs, through the empty
      dining-room into the study. She was kneeling before the old armchair, and
      his father was lying back quite white, his head on his breast, one of his
      hands resting on an open book, with a pencil clutched in it&mdash;more
      strangely still than anything he had ever seen. She looked round wildly,
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Jon&mdash;he&rsquo;s dead&mdash;he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon flung himself down, and reaching over the arm of the chair, where he
      had lately been sitting, put his lips to the forehead. Icy cold! How could&mdash;how
      could Dad be dead, when only an hour ago&mdash;! His mother&rsquo;s arms
      were round the knees; pressing her breast against them. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why
      wasn&rsquo;t I with him?&rdquo; he heard her whisper. Then he saw the
      tottering word &ldquo;Irene&rdquo; pencilled on the open page, and broke
      down himself. It was his first sight of human death, and its unutterable
      stillness blotted from him all other emotion; all else, then, was but
      preliminary to this! All love and life, and joy, anxiety, and sorrow, all
      movement, light and beauty, but a beginning to this terrible white
      stillness. It made a dreadful mark on him; all seemed suddenly little,
      futile, short. He mastered himself at last, got up, and raised her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother! don&rsquo;t cry&mdash;Mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours later, when all was done that had to be, and his mother was
      lying down, he saw his father alone, on the bed, covered with a white
      sheet. He stood for a long time gazing at that face which had never looked
      angry&mdash;always whimsical, and kind. &ldquo;To be kind and keep your
      end up&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing else in it,&rdquo; he had once heard
      his father say. How wonderfully Dad had acted up to that philosophy! He
      understood now that his father had known for a long time past that this
      would come suddenly&mdash;known, and not said a word. He gazed with an
      awed and passionate reverence. The loneliness of it&mdash;just to spare
      his mother and himself! His own trouble seemed small while he was looking
      at that face. The word scribbled on the page! The farewell word! Now his
      mother had no one but himself! He went up close to the dead face&mdash;not
      changed at all, and yet completely changed. He had heard his father say
      once that he did not believe in consciousness surviving death, or that if
      it did it might be just survival till the natural age limit of the body
      had been reached&mdash;the natural term of its inherent vitality; so that
      if the body were broken by accident, excess, violent disease,
      consciousness might still persist till, in the course of Nature
      uninterfered with, it would naturally have faded out. It had struck him
      because he had never heard any one else suggest it. When the heart failed
      like this&mdash;surely it was not quite natural! Perhaps his father&rsquo;s
      consciousness was in the room with him. Above the bed hung a picture of
      his father&rsquo;s father. Perhaps his consciousness, too, was still
      alive; and his brother&rsquo;s&mdash;his half-brother, who had died in the
      Transvaal. Were they all gathered round this bed? Jon kissed the forehead,
      and stole back to his own room. The door between it and his mother&rsquo;s
      was ajar; she had evidently been in&mdash;everything was ready for him,
      even some biscuits and hot milk, and the letter no longer on the floor. He
      ate and drank, watching the last light fade. He did not try to see into
      the future&mdash;just stared at the dark branches of the oak-tree, level
      with his window, and felt as if life had stopped. Once in the night,
      turning in his heavy sleep, he was conscious of something white and still,
      beside his bed, and started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother&rsquo;s voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only I, Jon dear!&rdquo; Her hand pressed his forehead
      gently back; her white figure disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone! He fell heavily asleep again, and dreamed he saw his mother&rsquo;s
      name crawling on his bed.

    <h2>
      IV.&mdash;SOAMES COGITATES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The announcement in The Times of his cousin Jolyon&rsquo;s death affected
      Soames quite simply. So that chap was gone! There had never been a time in
      their two lives when love had not been lost between them. That
      quick-blooded sentiment hatred had run its course long since in Soames&rsquo;
      heart, and he had refused to allow any recrudescence, but he considered
      this early decease a piece of poetic justice. For twenty years the fellow
      had enjoyed the reversion of his wife and house, and&mdash;he was dead!
      The obituary notice, which appeared a little later, paid Jolyon&mdash;he
      thought&mdash;too much attention. It spoke of that &ldquo;diligent and
      agreeable painter whose work we have come to look on as typical of the
      best late-Victorian water-colour art.&rdquo; Soames, who had almost
      mechanically preferred Mole, Morpin, and Caswell Baye, and had always
      sniffed quite audibly when he came to one of his cousin&rsquo;s on the
      line, turned The Times with a crackle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to go up to Town that morning on Forsyte affairs, and was fully
      conscious of Gradman&rsquo;s glance sidelong over his spectacles. The old
      clerk had about him an aura of regretful congratulation. He smelled, as it
      were, of old days. One could almost hear him thinking: &ldquo;Mr. Jolyon,
      ye-es&mdash;just my age, and gone&mdash;dear, dear! I dare say she feels
      it. She was a nice-lookin&rsquo; woman. Flesh is flesh! They&rsquo;ve
      given &lsquo;im a notice in the papers. Fancy!&rdquo; His atmosphere in
      fact caused Soames to handle certain leases and conversions with
      exceptional swiftness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that settlement on Miss Fleur, Mr. Soames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought better of that,&rdquo; answered Soames shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;m glad of that. I thought you were a little hasty. The
      times do change.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How this death would affect Fleur had begun to trouble Soames. He was not
      certain that she knew of it&mdash;she seldom looked at the paper, never at
      the births, marriages, and deaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed matters on, and made his way to Green Street for lunch.
      Winifred was almost doleful. Jack Cardigan had broken a splashboard, so
      far as one could make out, and would not be &ldquo;fit&rdquo; for some
      time. She could not get used to the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Profond ever get off?&rdquo; he said suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got off,&rdquo; replied Winifred, &ldquo;but where&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there it was&mdash;impossible to tell anything! Not that he wanted to
      know. Letters from Annette were coming from Dieppe, where she and her
      mother were staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw that fellow&rsquo;s death, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Winifred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for&mdash;for his
      children. He was very amiable.&rdquo; Soames uttered a rather queer sound.
      A suspicion of the old deep truth&mdash;that men were judged in this world
      rather by what they were than by what they did&mdash;crept and knocked
      resentfully at the back doors of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know there was a superstition to that effect,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must do him justice now he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to have done him justice before,&rdquo; said Soames;
      &ldquo;but I never had the chance. Have you got a &lsquo;Baronetage&rsquo;
      here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; in that bottom row.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames took out a fat red book, and ran over the leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mont-Sir Lawrence, 9th Bt., cr. 1620, e. s. of Geoffrey, 8th Bt.,
      and Lavinia, daur. of Sir Charles Muskham, Bt., of Muskham Hall, Shrops:

      Bidicott.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you ever know a publisher?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Timothy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive, I mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monty knew one at his Club. He brought him here to dinner once.
      Monty was always thinking of writing a book, you know, about how to make
      money on the turf. He tried to interest that man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He put him on to a horse&mdash;for the Two Thousand. We didn&rsquo;t
      see him again. He was rather smart, if I remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it win?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it ran last, I think. You know Monty really was quite clever in
      his way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he?&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;Can you see any connection
      between a sucking baronet and publishing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People do all sorts of things nowadays,&rdquo; replied Winifred.
      &ldquo;The great stunt seems not to be idle&mdash;so different from our
      time. To do nothing was the thing then. But I suppose it&rsquo;ll come
      again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young Mont that I&rsquo;m speaking of is very sweet on Fleur.
      If it would put an end to that other affair I might encourage it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he got style?&rdquo; asked Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no beauty; pleasant enough, with some scattered brains.
      There&rsquo;s a good deal of land, I believe. He seems genuinely attached.
      But I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; murmured Winifred; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&mdash;very
      difficult. I always found it best to do nothing. It is such a bore about
      Jack; now we shan&rsquo;t get away till after Bank Holiday. Well, the
      people are always amusing, I shall go into the Park and watch them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;I should have a country
      cottage, and be out of the way of holidays and strikes when you want.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country bores me,&rdquo; answered Winifred, &ldquo;and I found
      the railway strike quite exciting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred had always been noted for sang-froid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames took his leave. All the way down to Reading he debated whether he
      should tell Fleur of that boy&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s death. It did not
      alter the situation except that he would be independent now, and only have
      his mother&rsquo;s opposition to encounter. He would come into a lot of
      money, no doubt, and perhaps the house&mdash;the house built for Irene and
      himself&mdash;the house whose architect had wrought his domestic ruin. His
      daughter&mdash;mistress of that house! That would be poetic justice!
      Soames uttered a little mirthless laugh. He had designed that house to
      re-establish his failing union, meant it for the seat of his descendants,
      if he could have induced Irene to give him one! Her son and Fleur! Their
      children would be, in some sort, offspring of the union between himself
      and her!
    </p>
    <p>
      The theatricality in that thought was repulsive to his sober sense. And
      yet&mdash;it would be the easiest and wealthiest way out of the impasse,
      now that Jolyon was gone. The juncture of two Forsyte fortunes had a kind
      of conservative charm. And she&mdash;Irene-would be linked to him once
      more. Nonsense! Absurd! He put the notion from his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving home he heard the click of billiard-balls, and through the
      window saw young Mont sprawling over the table. Fleur, with her cue
      akimbo, was watching with a smile. How pretty she looked! No wonder that
      young fellow was out of his mind about her. A title&mdash;land! There was
      little enough in land, these days; perhaps less in a title. The old
      Forsytes had always had a kind of contempt for titles, rather remote and
      artificial things&mdash;not worth the money they cost, and having to do
      with the Court. They had all had that feeling in differing measure&mdash;Soames
      remembered. Swithin, indeed, in his most expansive days had once attended
      a Levee. He had come away saying he shouldn&rsquo;t go again&mdash;&ldquo;all
      that small fry.&rdquo; It was suspected that he had looked too big in
      knee-breeches. Soames remembered how his own mother had wished to be
      presented because of the fashionable nature of the performance, and how
      his father had put his foot down with unwonted decision. What did she want
      with that peacocking&mdash;wasting time and money; there was nothing in
      it!
    </p>
    <p>
      The instinct which had made and kept the English Commons the chief power
      in the State, a feeling that their own world was good enough and a little
      better than any other because it was their world, had kept the old
      Forsytes singularly free of &ldquo;flummery,&rdquo; as Nicholas had been
      wont to call it when he had the gout. Soames&rsquo; generation, more
      self-conscious and ironical, had been saved by a sense of Swithin in
      knee-breeches. While the third and the fourth generation, as it seemed to
      him, laughed at everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was no harm in the young fellow&rsquo;s being heir to a
      title and estate&mdash;a thing one couldn&rsquo;t help. He entered
      quietly, as Mont missed his shot. He noted the young man&rsquo;s eyes,
      fixed on Fleur bending over in her turn; and the adoration in them almost
      touched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused with the cue poised on the bridge of her slim hand, and shook
      her crop of short dark chestnut hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing venture.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; The cue struck, the ball rolled. &ldquo;There!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad luck! Never mind!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they saw him, and Soames said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mark for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on the raised seat beneath the marker, trim and tired,
      furtively studying those two young faces. When the game was over Mont came
      up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve started in, sir. Rum game, business, isn&rsquo;t it? I
      suppose you saw a lot of human nature as a solicitor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you what I&rsquo;ve noticed: People are quite on the
      wrong tack in offering less than they can afford to give; they ought to
      offer more, and work backward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose the more is accepted?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter a little bit,&rdquo; said Mont; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      much more paying to abate a price than to increase it. For instance, say
      we offer an author good terms&mdash;he naturally takes them. Then we go
      into it, find we can&rsquo;t publish at a decent profit and tell him so.
      He&rsquo;s got confidence in us because we&rsquo;ve been generous to him,
      and he comes down like a lamb, and bears us no malice. But if we offer him
      poor terms at the start, he doesn&rsquo;t take them, so we have to advance
      them to get him, and he thinks us damned screws into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try buying pictures on that system,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;an
      offer accepted is a contract&mdash;haven&rsquo;t you learned that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mont turned his head to where Fleur was standing in the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wish I had. Then there&rsquo;s another
      thing. Always let a man off a bargain if he wants to be let off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As advertisement?&rdquo; said Soames dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is; but I meant on principle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your firm work on those lines?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Mont, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they will go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really, sir. I&rsquo;m making any number of observations, and
      they all confirm my theory. Human nature is consistently underrated in
      business, people do themselves out of an awful lot of pleasure and profit
      by that. Of course, you must be perfectly genuine and open, but that&rsquo;s
      easy if you feel it. The more human and generous you are the better chance
      you&rsquo;ve got in business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a partner?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for six months, yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest of the firm had better make haste and retire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mont laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be
      a big change. The possessive principle has got its shutters up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house is to let! Good-bye, sir; I&rsquo;m off now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames watched his daughter give her hand, saw her wince at the squeeze it
      received, and distinctly heard the young man&rsquo;s sigh as he passed
      out. Then she came from the window, trailing her finger along the mahogany
      edge of the billiard-table. Watching her, Soames knew that she was going
      to ask him something. Her finger felt round the last pocket, and she
      looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you done anything to stop Jon writing to me, Father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen, then?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;His father
      died just a week ago to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In her startled, frowning face he saw the instant struggle to apprehend
      what this would mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Jon! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me, Father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never know!&rdquo; said Soames slowly; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
      confide in me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, if you&rsquo;d help me, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I shall.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur clasped her hands. &ldquo;Oh! darling&mdash;when one wants a thing
      fearfully, one doesn&rsquo;t think of other people. Don&rsquo;t be angry
      with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames put out his hand, as if pushing away an aspersion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cogitating,&rdquo; he said. What on earth had made him
      use a word like that! &ldquo;Has young Mont been bothering you again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur smiled. &ldquo;Oh! Michael! He&rsquo;s always bothering; but he&rsquo;s
      such a good sort&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired; I shall go and
      have a nap before dinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up to his picture-gallery, lay down on the couch there, and closed
      his eyes. A terrible responsibility this girl of his&mdash;whose mother
      was&mdash;ah! what was she? A terrible responsibility! Help her&mdash;how
      could he help her? He could not alter the fact that he was her father. Or
      that Irene&mdash;! What was it young Mont had said&mdash;some nonsense
      about the possessive instinct&mdash;shutters up&mdash;To let? Silly!
    </p>
    <p>
      The sultry air, charged with a scent of meadow-sweet, of river and roses,
      closed on his senses, drowsing them.

    <h2>
      V.&mdash;THE FIXED IDEA
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fixed idea,&rdquo; which has outrun more constables than any
      other form of human disorder, has never more speed and stamina than when
      it takes the avid guise of love. To hedges and ditches, and doors, to
      humans without ideas fixed or otherwise, to perambulators and the contents
      sucking their fixed ideas, even to the other sufferers from this fast
      malady&mdash;the fixed idea of love pays no attention. It runs with eyes
      turned inward to its own light, oblivious of all other stars. Those with
      the fixed ideas that human happiness depends on their art, on vivisecting
      dogs, on hating foreigners, on paying supertax, on remaining Ministers, on
      making wheels go round, on preventing their neighbours from being
      divorced, on conscientious objection, Greek roots, Church dogma, paradox
      and superiority to everybody else, with other forms of ego-mania&mdash;all
      are unstable compared with him or her whose fixed idea is the possession
      of some her or him. And though Fleur, those chilly summer days, pursued
      the scattered life of a little Forsyte whose frocks are paid for, and
      whose business is pleasure, she was&mdash;as Winifred would have said in
      the latest fashion of speech&mdash;&ldquo;honest to God&rdquo; indifferent
      to it all. She wished and wished for the moon, which sailed in cold skies
      above the river or the Green Park when she went to Town. She even kept Jon&rsquo;s
      letters, covered with pink silk, on her heart, than which in days when
      corsets were so low, sentiment so despised, and chests so out of fashion,
      there could, perhaps, have been no greater proof of the fixity of her
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      After hearing of his father&rsquo;s death, she wrote to Jon, and received
      his answer three days later on her return from a river picnic. It was his
      first letter since their meeting at June&rsquo;s. She opened it with
      misgiving, and read it with dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I saw you I&rsquo;ve heard everything about the past. I won&rsquo;t
      tell it you&mdash;I think you knew when we met at June&rsquo;s. She says
      you did. If you did, Fleur, you ought to have told me. I expect you only
      heard your father&rsquo;s side of it. I have heard my mother&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s
      dreadful. Now that she&rsquo;s so sad I can&rsquo;t do anything to hurt
      her more. Of course, I long for you all day, but I don&rsquo;t believe now
      that we shall ever come together&mdash;there&rsquo;s something too strong
      pulling us apart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So! Her deception had found her out. But Jon&mdash;she felt&mdash;had
      forgiven that. It was what he said of his mother which caused the
      guttering in her heart and the weak sensation in her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first impulse was to reply&mdash;her second, not to reply. These
      impulses were constantly renewed in the days which followed, while
      desperation grew within her. She was not her father&rsquo;s child for
      nothing. The tenacity which had at once made and undone Soames was her
      backbone, too, frilled and embroidered by French grace and quickness.
      Instinctively she conjugated the verb &ldquo;to have&rdquo; always with
      the pronoun &ldquo;I.&rdquo; She concealed, however, all signs of her
      growing desperation, and pursued such river pleasures as the winds and
      rain of a disagreeable July permitted, as if she had no care in the world;
      nor did any &ldquo;sucking baronet&rdquo; ever neglect the business of a
      publisher more consistently than her attendant spirit, Michael Mont.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Soames she was a puzzle. He was almost deceived by this careless
      gaiety. Almost&mdash;because he did not fail to mark her eyes often fixed
      on nothing, and the film of light shining from her bedroom window late at
      night. What was she thinking and brooding over into small hours when she
      ought to have been asleep? But he dared not ask what was in her mind; and,
      since that one little talk in the billiard-room, she said nothing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this taciturn condition of affairs it chanced that Winifred invited
      them to lunch and to go afterward to &ldquo;a most amusing little play,
      &lsquo;The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera&rsquo;&rdquo; and would they bring a man
      to make four? Soames, whose attitude toward theatres was to go to nothing,
      accepted, because Fleur&rsquo;s attitude was to go to everything. They
      motored up, taking Michael Mont, who, being in his seventh heaven, was
      found by Winifred &ldquo;very amusing.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Beggar&rsquo;s
      Opera&rdquo; puzzled Soames. The people were very unpleasant, the whole
      thing very cynical. Winifred was &ldquo;intrigued&rdquo;&mdash;by the
      dresses. The music, too, did not displease her. At the Opera, the night
      before, she had arrived too early for the Russian Ballet, and found the
      stage occupied by singers, for a whole hour pale or apoplectic from terror
      lest by some dreadful inadvertence they might drop into a tune. Michael
      Mont was enraptured with the whole thing. And all three wondered what
      Fleur was thinking of it. But Fleur was not thinking of it. Her fixed idea
      stood on the stage and sang with Polly Peachum, mimed with Filch, danced
      with Jenny Diver, postured with Lucy Lockit, kissed, trolled, and cuddled
      with Macheath. Her lips might smile, her hands applaud, but the comic old
      masterpiece made no more impression on her than if it had been pathetic,
      like a modern &ldquo;Revue.&rdquo; When they embarked in the car to
      return, she ached because Jon was not sitting next her instead of Michael
      Mont. When, at some jolt, the young man&rsquo;s arm touched hers as if by
      accident, she only thought: &lsquo;If that were Jon&rsquo;s arm!&rsquo;
      When his cheerful voice, tempered by her proximity, murmured above the
      sound of the car&rsquo;s progress, she smiled and answered, thinking:
      &lsquo;If that were Jon&rsquo;s voice!&rsquo; and when once he said,
      &ldquo;Fleur, you look a perfect angel in that dress!&rdquo; she answered,
      &ldquo;Oh, do you like it?&rdquo; thinking, &lsquo;If only Jon could see
      it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During this drive she took a resolution. She would go to Robin Hill and
      see him&mdash;alone; she would take the car, without word beforehand to
      him or to her father. It was nine days since his letter, and she could
      wait no longer. On Monday she would go! The decision made her well
      disposed toward young Mont. With something to look forward to she could
      afford to tolerate and respond. He might stay to dinner; propose to her as
      usual; dance with her, press her hand, sigh&mdash;do what he liked. He was
      only a nuisance when he interfered with her fixed idea. She was even sorry
      for him so far as it was possible to be sorry for anybody but herself just
      now. At dinner he seemed to talk more wildly than usual about what he
      called &ldquo;the death of the close borough&rdquo;&mdash;she paid little
      attention, but her father seemed paying a good deal, with the smile on his
      face which meant opposition, if not anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The younger generation doesn&rsquo;t think as you do, sir; does it,
      Fleur?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur shrugged her shoulders&mdash;the younger generation was just Jon,
      and she did not know what he was thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young people will think as I do when they&rsquo;re my age, Mr.
      Mont. Human nature doesn&rsquo;t change.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit that, sir; but the forms of thought change with the times.
      The pursuit of self-interest is a form of thought that&rsquo;s going out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! To mind one&rsquo;s own business is not a form of thought,
      Mr. Mont, it&rsquo;s an instinct.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, when Jon was the business!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is one&rsquo;s business, sir? That&rsquo;s the point.
      Everybody&rsquo;s business is going to be one&rsquo;s business. Isn&rsquo;t
      it, Fleur?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur only smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not,&rdquo; added young Mont, &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be blood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People have talked like that from time immemorial&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll admit, sir, that the sense of property is dying
      out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say increasing among those who have none.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, look at me! I&rsquo;m heir to an entailed estate. I don&rsquo;t
      want the thing; I&rsquo;d cut the entail to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not married, and you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
      talking about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur saw the young man&rsquo;s eyes turn rather piteously upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really mean that marriage&mdash;?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Society is built on marriage,&rdquo; came from between her father&rsquo;s
      close lips; &ldquo;marriage and its consequences. Do you want to do away
      with it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mont made a distracted gesture. Silence brooded over the dinner
      table, covered with spoons bearing the Forsyte crest&mdash;a pheasant
      proper&mdash;under the electric light in an alabaster globe. And outside,
      the river evening darkened, charged with heavy moisture and sweet scents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monday,&rsquo; thought Fleur; &lsquo;Monday!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      VI.&mdash;DESPERATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The weeks which followed the death of his father were sad and empty to the
      only Jolyon Forsyte left. The necessary forms and ceremonies&mdash;the
      reading of the Will, valuation of the estate, distribution of the legacies&mdash;were
      enacted over the head, as it were, of one not yet of age. Jolyon was
      cremated. By his special wish no one attended that ceremony, or wore black
      for him. The succession of his property, controlled to some extent by old
      Jolyon&rsquo;s Will, left his widow in possession of Robin Hill, with two
      thousand five hundred pounds a year for life. Apart from this the two
      Wills worked together in some complicated way to insure that each of
      Jolyon&rsquo;s three children should have an equal share in their
      grandfather&rsquo;s and father&rsquo;s property in the future as in the
      present, save only that Jon, by virtue of his sex, would have control of
      his capital when he was twenty-one, while June and Holly would only have
      the spirit of theirs, in order that their children might have the body
      after them. If they had no children, it would all come to Jon if he
      outlived them; and since June was fifty, and Holly nearly forty, it was
      considered in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields that but for the cruelty of
      income tax, young Jon would be as warm a man as his grandfather when he
      died. All this was nothing to Jon, and little enough to his mother. It was
      June who did everything needful for one who had left his affairs in
      perfect order. When she had gone, and those two were alone again in the
      great house, alone with death drawing them together, and love driving them
      apart, Jon passed very painful days secretly disgusted and disappointed
      with himself. His mother would look at him with such a patient sadness
      which yet had in it an instinctive pride, as if she were reserving her
      defence. If she smiled he was angry that his answering smile should be so
      grudging and unnatural. He did not judge or condemn her; that was all too
      remote&mdash;indeed, the idea of doing so had never come to him. No! he
      was grudging and unnatural because he couldn&rsquo;t have what he wanted
      because of her. There was one alleviation&mdash;much to do in connection
      with his father&rsquo;s career, which could not be safely entrusted to
      June, though she had offered to undertake it. Both Jon and his mother had
      felt that if she took his portfolios, unexhibited drawings and unfinished
      matter, away with her, the work would encounter such icy blasts from Paul
      Post and other frequenters of her studio, that it would soon be frozen out
      even of her warm heart. On its old-fashioned plane and of its kind the
      work was good, and they could not bear the thought of its subjection to
      ridicule. A one-man exhibition of his work was the least testimony they
      could pay to one they had loved; and on preparation for this they spent
      many hours together. Jon came to have a curiously increased respect for
      his father. The quiet tenacity with which he had converted a mediocre
      talent into something really individual was disclosed by these researches.
      There was a great mass of work with a rare continuity of growth in depth
      and reach of vision. Nothing certainly went very deep, or reached very
      high&mdash;but such as the work was, it was thorough, conscientious, and
      complete. And, remembering his father&rsquo;s utter absence of &ldquo;side&rdquo;
      or self-assertion, the chaffing humility with which he had always spoken
      of his own efforts, ever calling himself &ldquo;an amateur,&rdquo; Jon
      could not help feeling that he had never really known his father. To take
      himself seriously, yet never that he did so, seemed to have been his
      ruling principle. There was something in this which appealed to the boy,
      and made him heartily endorse his mother&rsquo;s comment: &ldquo;He had
      true refinement; he couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of others, whatever he
      did. And when he took a resolution which went counter, he did it with the
      minimum of defiance&mdash;not like the Age, is it? Twice in his life he
      had to go against everything; and yet it never made him bitter.&rdquo; Jon
      saw tears running down her face, which she at once turned away from him.
      She was so quiet about her loss that sometimes he had thought she didn&rsquo;t
      feel it much. Now, as he looked at her, he felt how far he fell short of
      the reserve power and dignity in both his father and his mother. And,
      stealing up to her, he put his arm round her waist. She kissed him
      swiftly, but with a sort of passion, and went out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The studio, where they had been sorting and labelling, had once been Holly&rsquo;s
      schoolroom, devoted to her silkworms, dried lavender, music, and other
      forms of instruction. Now, at the end of July, despite its northern and
      eastern aspects, a warm and slumberous air came in between the long-faded
      lilac linen curtains. To redeem a little the departed glory, as of a field
      that is golden and gone, clinging to a room which its master has left,
      Irene had placed on the paint-stained table a bowl of red roses. This, and
      Jolyon&rsquo;s favourite cat, who still clung to the deserted habitat,
      were the pleasant spots in that dishevelled, sad workroom. Jon, at the
      north window, sniffing air mysteriously scented with warm strawberries,
      heard a car drive up. The lawyers again about some nonsense! Why did that
      scent so make one ache? And where did it come from&mdash;there were no
      strawberry beds on this side of the house. Instinctively he took a
      crumpled sheet of paper from his pocket, and wrote down some broken words.
      A warmth began spreading in his chest; he rubbed the palms of his hands
      together. Presently he had jotted this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could make a little song A little song to soothe my heart! I&rsquo;d
      make it all of little things The plash of water, rub of wings, The
      puffing-off of dandies crown, The hiss of raindrop spilling down, The purr
      of cat, the trill of bird, And ev&rsquo;ry whispering I&rsquo;ve heard
      From willy wind in leaves and grass, And all the distant drones that pass.
      A song as tender and as light As flower, or butterfly in flight; And when
      I saw it opening, I&rsquo;d let it fly and sing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still muttering it over to himself at the window, when he heard his
      name called, and, turning round, saw Fleur. At that amazing apparition, he
      made at first no movement and no sound, while her clear vivid glance
      ravished his heart. Then he went forward to the table, saying, &ldquo;How
      nice of you to come!&rdquo; and saw her flinch as if he had thrown
      something at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked for you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and they showed me up
      here. But I can go away again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon clutched the paint-stained table. Her face and figure in its frilly
      frock photographed itself with such startling vividness upon his eyes,
      that if she had sunk through the floor he must still have seen her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I told you a lie, Jon. But I told it out of love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, oh! yes! That&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t answer your letter. What was the use&mdash;there
      wasn&rsquo;t anything to answer. I wanted to see you instead.&rdquo; She
      held out both her hands, and Jon grasped them across the table. He tried
      to say something, but all his attention was given to trying not to hurt
      her hands. His own felt so hard and hers so soft. She said almost
      defiantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That old story&mdash;was it so very dreadful?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; In his voice, too, there was a note of defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dragged her hands away. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think in these days boys
      were tied to their mothers&rsquo; apron-strings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon&rsquo;s chin went up as if he had been struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I didn&rsquo;t mean it, Jon. What a horrible thing to say!&rdquo;
      Swiftly she came close to him. &ldquo;Jon, dear; I didn&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had put her two hands on his shoulder, and her forehead down on them;
      the brim of her hat touched his neck, and he felt it quivering. But, in a
      sort of paralysis, he made no response. She let go of his shoulder and
      drew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go, if you don&rsquo;t want me. But I never
      thought you&rsquo;d have given me up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Jon, coming suddenly to life. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll try again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes gleamed, she swayed toward him. &ldquo;Jon&mdash;I love you! Don&rsquo;t
      give me up! If you do, I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;I feel so desperate.
      What does it matter&mdash;all that past-compared with this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She clung to him. He kissed her eyes, her cheeks, her lips. But while he
      kissed her he saw, the sheets of that letter fallen down on the floor of
      his bedroom&mdash;his father&rsquo;s white dead face&mdash;his mother
      kneeling before it. Fleur&rsquo;s whispered, &ldquo;Make her! Promise! Oh!
      Jon, try!&rdquo; seemed childish in his ear. He felt curiously old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Only, you don&rsquo;t
      understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants to spoil our lives, just because&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again that challenge in his voice, and she did not answer. Her arms
      tightened round him, and he returned her kisses; but even while he
      yielded, the poison worked in him, the poison of the letter. Fleur did not
      know, she did not understand&mdash;she misjudged his mother; she came from
      the enemy&rsquo;s camp! So lovely, and he loved her so&mdash;yet, even in
      her embrace, he could not help the memory of Holly&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;I
      think she has a &lsquo;having&rsquo; nature,&rdquo; and his mother&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;My darling boy, don&rsquo;t think of me&mdash;think of yourself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone like a passionate dream, leaving her image on his eyes,
      her kisses on his lips, such an ache in his heart, Jon leaned in the
      window, listening to the car bearing her away. Still the scent as of warm
      strawberries, still the little summer sounds that should make his song;
      still all the promise of youth and happiness in sighing, floating,
      fluttering July&mdash;and his heart torn; yearning strong in him; hope
      high in him yet with its eyes cast down, as if ashamed. The miserable task
      before him! If Fleur was desperate, so was he&mdash;watching the poplars
      swaying, the white clouds passing, the sunlight on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited till evening, till after their almost silent dinner, till his
      mother had played to him and still he waited, feeling that she knew what
      he was waiting to say. She kissed him and went up-stairs, and still he
      lingered, watching the moonlight and the moths, and that unreality of
      colouring which steals along and stains a summer night. And he would have
      given anything to be back again in the past&mdash;barely three months
      back; or away forward, years, in the future. The present with this dark
      cruelty of a decision, one way or the other, seemed impossible. He
      realised now so much more keenly what his mother felt than he had at
      first; as if the story in that letter had been a poisonous germ producing
      a kind of fever of partisanship, so that he really felt there were two
      camps, his mother&rsquo;s and his&mdash;Fleur&rsquo;s and her father&rsquo;s.
      It might be a dead thing, that old tragic ownership and enmity, but dead
      things were poisonous till time had cleaned them away. Even his love felt
      tainted, less illusioned, more of the earth, and with a treacherous
      lurking doubt lest Fleur, like her father, might want to own; not
      articulate, just a stealing haunt, horribly unworthy, which crept in and
      about the ardour of his memories, touched with its tarnishing breath the
      vividness and grace of that charmed face and figure&mdash;a doubt, not
      real enough to convince him of its presence, just real enough to deflower
      a perfect faith. And perfect faith, to Jon, not yet twenty, was essential.
      He still had Youth&rsquo;s eagerness to give with both hands, to take with
      neither&mdash;to give lovingly to one who had his own impulsive
      generosity. Surely she had! He got up from the window-seat and roamed in
      the big grey ghostly room, whose walls were hung with silvered canvas.
      This house his father said in that death-bed letter&mdash;had been built
      for his mother to live in&mdash;with Fleur&rsquo;s father! He put out his
      hand in the half-dark, as if to grasp the shadowy hand of the dead. He
      clenched, trying to feel the thin vanished fingers of his father; to
      squeeze them, and reassure him that he&mdash;he was on his father&rsquo;s
      side. Tears, prisoned within him, made his eyes feel dry and hot. He went
      back to the window. It was warmer, not so eerie, more comforting outside,
      where the moon hung golden, three days off full; the freedom of the night
      was comforting. If only Fleur and he had met on some desert island without
      a past&mdash;and Nature for their house! Jon had still his high regard for
      desert islands, where breadfruit grew, and the water was blue above the
      coral. The night was deep, was free&mdash;there was enticement in it; a
      lure, a promise, a refuge from entanglement, and love! Milksop tied to his
      mother&rsquo;s...! His cheeks burned. He shut the window, drew curtains
      over it, switched off the lighted sconce, and went up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of his room was open, the light turned up; his mother, still in
      her evening gown, was standing at the window. She turned and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Jon; let&rsquo;s talk.&rdquo; She sat down on the
      window-seat, Jon on his bed. She had her profile turned to him, and the
      beauty and grace of her figure, the delicate line of the brow, the nose,
      the neck, the strange and as it were remote refinement of her, moved him.
      His mother never belonged to her surroundings. She came into them from
      somewhere&mdash;as it were! What was she going to say to him, who had in
      his heart such things to say to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know Fleur came to-day. I&rsquo;m not surprised.&rdquo; It was as
      though she had added: &ldquo;She is her father&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo;
      And Jon&rsquo;s heart hardened. Irene went on quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have Father&rsquo;s letter. I picked it up that night and kept
      it. Would you like it back, dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had read it, of course, before he gave it to you. It didn&rsquo;t
      quite do justice to my criminality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; burst from Jon&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He put it very sweetly, but I know that in marrying Fleur&rsquo;s
      father without love I did a dreadful thing. An unhappy marriage, Jon, can
      play such havoc with other lives besides one&rsquo;s own. You are
      fearfully young, my darling, and fearfully loving. Do you think you can
      possibly be happy with this girl?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Staring at her dark eyes, darker now from pain, Jon answered
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; oh! yes&mdash;if you could be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admiration of beauty and longing for possession are not love. If
      yours were another case like mine, Jon&mdash;where the deepest things are
      stifled; the flesh joined, and the spirit at war!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it, Mother? You think she must be like her father, but
      she&rsquo;s not. I&rsquo;ve seen him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the smile came on Irene&rsquo;s lips, and in Jon something wavered;
      there was such irony and experience in that smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a giver, Jon; she is a taker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That unworthy doubt, that haunting uncertainty again! He said with
      vehemence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t&mdash;she isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s only because I
      can&rsquo;t bear to make you unhappy, Mother, now that Father&mdash;&rdquo;
      He thrust his fists against his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you that night, dear, not to mind me. I meant it. Think of
      yourself and your own happiness! I can stand what&rsquo;s left&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      brought it on myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the word &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; burst from Jon&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came over to him and put her hands over his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel your head, darling?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon shook it. What he felt was in his chest&mdash;a sort of tearing
      asunder of the tissue there, by the two loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall always love you the same, Jon, whatever you do. You won&rsquo;t
      lose anything.&rdquo; She smoothed his hair gently, and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the door shut; and, rolling over on the bed, lay, stifling his
      breath, with an awful held-up feeling within him.

    <h2>
      VII.&mdash;EMBASSY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Enquiring for her at tea time Soames learned that Fleur had been out in
      the car since two. Three hours! Where had she gone? Up to London without a
      word to him? He had never become quite reconciled with cars. He had
      embraced them in principle&mdash;like the born empiricist, or Forsyte,
      that he was&mdash;adopting each symptom of progress as it came along with:
      &ldquo;Well, we couldn&rsquo;t do without them now.&rdquo; But in fact he
      found them tearing, great, smelly things. Obliged by Annette to have one&mdash;a
      Rollhard with pearl-grey cushions, electric light, little mirrors, trays
      for the ashes of cigarettes, flower vases&mdash;all smelling of petrol and
      stephanotis&mdash;he regarded it much as he used to regard his
      brother-in-law, Montague Dartie. The thing typified all that was fast,
      insecure, and subcutaneously oily in modern life. As modern life became
      faster, looser, younger, Soames was becoming older, slower, tighter, more
      and more in thought and language like his father James before him. He was
      almost aware of it himself. Pace and progress pleased him less and less;
      there was an ostentation, too, about a car which he considered provocative
      in the prevailing mood of Labour. On one occasion that fellow Sims had
      driven over the only vested interest of a working man. Soames had not
      forgotten the behaviour of its master, when not many people would have
      stopped to put up with it. He had been sorry for the dog, and quite
      prepared to take its part against the car, if that ruffian hadn&rsquo;t
      been so outrageous. With four hours fast becoming five, and still no
      Fleur, all the old car-wise feelings he had experienced in person and by
      proxy balled within him, and sinking sensations troubled the pit of his
      stomach. At seven he telephoned to Winifred by trunk call. No! Fleur had
      not been to Green Street. Then where was she? Visions of his beloved
      daughter rolled up in her pretty frills, all blood and dust-stained, in
      some hideous catastrophe, began to haunt him. He went to her room and
      spied among her things. She had taken nothing&mdash;no dressing-case, no
      Jewellery. And this, a relief in one sense, increased his fears of an
      accident. Terrible to be helpless when his loved one was missing,
      especially when he couldn&rsquo;t bear fuss or publicity of any kind! What
      should he do if she were not back by nightfall?
    </p>
    <p>
      At a quarter to eight he heard the car. A great weight lifted from off his
      heart; he hurried down. She was getting out&mdash;pale and tired-looking,
      but nothing wrong. He met her in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve frightened me. Where have you been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Robin Hill. I&rsquo;m sorry, dear. I had to go; I&rsquo;ll tell
      you afterward.&rdquo; And, with a flying kiss, she ran up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames waited in the drawing-room. To Robin Hill! What did that portend?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a subject they could discuss at dinner&mdash;consecrated to the
      susceptibilities of the butler. The agony of nerves Soames had been
      through, the relief he felt at her safety, softened his power to condemn
      what she had done, or resist what she was going to do; he waited in a
      relaxed stupor for her revelation. Life was a queer business. There he was
      at sixty-five and no more in command of things than if he had not spent
      forty years in building up security-always something one couldn&rsquo;t
      get on terms with! In the pocket of his dinner-jacket was a letter from
      Annette. She was coming back in a fortnight. He knew nothing of what she
      had been doing out there. And he was glad that he did not. Her absence had
      been a relief. Out of sight was out of mind! And now she was coming back.
      Another worry! And the Bolderby Old Crome was gone&mdash;Dumetrius had got
      it&mdash;all because that anonymous letter had put it out of his thoughts.
      He furtively remarked the strained look on his daughter&rsquo;s face, as
      if she too were gazing at a picture that she couldn&rsquo;t buy. He almost
      wished the War back. Worries didn&rsquo;t seem, then, quite so worrying.
      From the caress in her voice, the look on her face, he became certain that
      she wanted something from him, uncertain whether it would be wise of him
      to give it her. He pushed his savoury away uneaten, and even joined her in
      a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner she set the electric piano-player going. And he augured the
      worst when she sat down on a cushion footstool at his knee, and put her
      hand on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling, be nice to me. I had to see Jon&mdash;he wrote to me. He&rsquo;s
      going to try what he can do with his mother. But I&rsquo;ve been thinking.
      It&rsquo;s really in your hands, Father. If you&rsquo;d persuade her that
      it doesn&rsquo;t mean renewing the past in any way! That I shall stay
      yours, and Jon will stay hers; that you need never see him or her, and she
      need never see you or me! Only you could persuade her, dear, because only
      you could promise. One can&rsquo;t promise for other people. Surely it
      wouldn&rsquo;t be too awkward for you to see her just this once now that
      Jon&rsquo;s father is dead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too awkward?&rdquo; Soames repeated. &ldquo;The whole thing&rsquo;s
      preposterous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Fleur, without looking up, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t
      mind seeing her, really.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames was silent. Her words had expressed a truth too deep for him to
      admit. She slipped her fingers between his own&mdash;hot, slim, eager,
      they clung there. This child of his would corkscrew her way into a brick
      wall!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do if you won&rsquo;t, Father?&rdquo; she said very
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything for your happiness,&rdquo; said Soanies;
      &ldquo;but this isn&rsquo;t for your happiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is; it is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only stir things up,&rdquo; he said grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are stirred up. The thing is to quiet them. To make her
      feel that this is just our lives, and has nothing to do with yours or
      hers. You can do it, Father, I know you can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know a great deal, then,&rdquo; was Soames&rsquo; glum answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will, Jon and I will wait a year&mdash;two years if you
      like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; murmured Soames, &ldquo;that you care
      nothing about what I feel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur pressed his hand against her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, darling. But you wouldn&rsquo;t like me to be awfully
      miserable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How she wheedled to get her ends! And trying with all his might to think
      she really cared for him&mdash;he was not sure&mdash;not sure. All she
      cared for was this boy! Why should he help her to get this boy, who was
      killing her affection for himself? Why should he? By the laws of the
      Forsytes it was foolish! There was nothing to be had out of it&mdash;nothing!
      To give her to that boy! To pass her into the enemy&rsquo;s camp, under
      the influence of the woman who had injured him so deeply! Slowly&mdash;inevitably&mdash;he
      would lose this flower of his life! And suddenly he was conscious that his
      hand was wet. His heart gave a little painful jump. He couldn&rsquo;t bear
      her to cry. He put his other hand quickly over hers, and a tear dropped on
      that, too. He couldn&rsquo;t go on like this! &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over, and do what I can. Come, come!&rdquo;
      If she must have it for her happiness&mdash;she must; he couldn&rsquo;t
      refuse to help her. And lest she should begin to thank him he got out of
      his chair and went up to the piano-player&mdash;making that noise! It ran
      down, as he reached it, with a faint buzz. That musical box of his nursery
      days: &ldquo;The Harmonious Blacksmith,&rdquo; &ldquo;Glorious Port&rdquo;&mdash;the
      thing had always made him miserable when his mother set it going on Sunday
      afternoons. Here it was again&mdash;the same thing, only larger, more
      expensive, and now it played &ldquo;The Wild, Wild Women,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;The Policeman&rsquo;s Holiday,&rdquo; and he was no longer in black
      velvet with a sky blue collar. &lsquo;Profond&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; he
      thought, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nothing in it! We&rsquo;re all progressing
      to the grave!&rsquo; And with that surprising mental comment he walked
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not see Fleur again that night. But, at breakfast, her eyes
      followed him about with an appeal he could not escape&mdash;not that he
      intended to try. No! He had made up his mind to the nerve-racking
      business. He would go to Robin Hill&mdash;to that house of memories.
      Pleasant memory&mdash;the last! Of going down to keep that boy&rsquo;s
      father and Irene apart by threatening divorce. He had often thought,
      since, that it had clinched their union. And, now, he was going to clinch
      the union of that boy with his girl. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve
      done,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;to have such things thrust on me!&rsquo;
      He went up by train and down by train, and from the station walked by the
      long rising lane, still very much as he remembered it over thirty years
      ago. Funny&mdash;so near London! Some one evidently was holding on to the
      land there. This speculation soothed him, moving between the high hedges
      slowly, so as not to get overheated, though the day was chill enough.
      After all was said and done there was something real about land, it didn&rsquo;t
      shift. Land, and good pictures! The values might fluctuate a bit, but on
      the whole they were always going up&mdash;worth holding on to, in a world
      where there was such a lot of unreality, cheap building, changing
      fashions, such a &ldquo;Here to-day and gone to-morrow&rdquo; spirit. The
      French were right, perhaps, with their peasant proprietorship, though he
      had no opinion of the French. One&rsquo;s bit of land! Something solid in
      it! He had heard peasant proprietors described as a pig-headed lot; had
      heard young Mont call his father a pigheaded Morning Poster&mdash;disrespectful
      young devil. Well, there were worse things than being pig-headed or
      reading the Morning Post. There was Profond and his tribe, and all these
      Labour chaps, and loud-mouthed politicians and &lsquo;wild, wild women&rsquo;.
      A lot of worse things! And suddenly Soames became conscious of feeling
      weak, and hot, and shaky. Sheer nerves at the meeting before him! As Aunt
      Juley might have said&mdash;quoting &ldquo;Superior Dosset&rdquo;&mdash;his
      nerves were &ldquo;in a proper fautigue.&rdquo; He could see the house now
      among its trees, the house he had watched being built, intending it for
      himself and this woman, who, by such strange fate, had lived in it with
      another after all! He began to think of Dumetrius, Local Loans, and other
      forms of investment. He could not afford to meet her with his nerves all
      shaking; he who represented the Day of Judgment for her on earth as it was
      in heaven; he, legal ownership, personified, meeting lawless beauty,
      incarnate. His dignity demanded impassivity during this embassy designed
      to link their offspring, who, if she had behaved herself, would have been
      brother and sister. That wretched tune, &ldquo;The Wild, Wild Women,&rdquo;
      kept running in his head, perversely, for tunes did not run there as a
      rule. Passing the poplars in front of the house, he thought: &lsquo;How
      they&rsquo;ve grown; I had them planted!&rsquo; A maid answered his ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you say&mdash;Mr. Forsyte, on a very special matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If she realised who he was, quite probably she would not see him. &lsquo;By
      George!&rsquo; he thought, hardening as the tug came. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a
      topsy-turvy affair!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid came back. &ldquo;Would the gentleman state his business, please?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it concerns Mr. Jon,&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      And once more he was alone in that hall with the pool of grey-white marble
      designed by her first lover. Ah! she had been a bad lot&mdash;had loved
      two men, and not himself! He must remember that when he came face to face
      with her once more. And suddenly he saw her in the opening chink between
      the long heavy purple curtains, swaying, as if in hesitation; the old
      perfect poise and line, the old startled dark-eyed gravity, the old calm
      defensive voice: &ldquo;Will you come in, please?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed through that opening. As in the picture-gallery and the
      confectioner&rsquo;s shop, she seemed to him still beautiful. And this was
      the first time&mdash;the very first&mdash;since he married her
      seven-and-thirty years ago, that he was speaking to her without the legal
      right to call her his. She was not wearing black&mdash;one of that fellow&rsquo;s
      radical notions, he supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I apologise for coming,&rdquo; he said glumly; &ldquo;but this
      business must be settled one way or the other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Anger at his false position, impatience of ceremony between them, mastered
      him, and words came tumbling out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an infernal mischance; I&rsquo;ve done my best to
      discourage it. I consider my daughter crazy, but I&rsquo;ve got into the
      habit of indulging her; that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here. I suppose you&rsquo;re
      fond of your son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devotedly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It rests with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a sense of being met and baffled. Always&mdash;always she had
      baffled him, even in those old first married days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mad notion,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had only&mdash;! Well&mdash;they might have been&mdash;&rdquo;
      he did not finish that sentence &ldquo;brother and sister and all this
      saved,&rdquo; but he saw her shudder as if he had, and stung by the sight
      he crossed over to the window. Out there the trees had not grown&mdash;they
      couldn&rsquo;t, they were old!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you may make
      your mind easy. I desire to see neither you nor your son if this marriage
      comes about. Young people in these days are&mdash;are unaccountable. But I
      can&rsquo;t bear to see my daughter unhappy. What am I to say to her when
      I go back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please say to her as I said to you, that it rests with Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t oppose it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart; not with my lips.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stood, biting his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember an evening&mdash;&rdquo; he said suddenly; and was
      silent. What was there&mdash;what was there in this woman that would not
      fit into the four corners of his hate or condemnation? &ldquo;Where is he&mdash;your
      son?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up in his father&rsquo;s studio, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d have him down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her ring the bell, he watched the maid come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please tell Mr. Jon that I want him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it rests with him,&rdquo; said Soames hurriedly, when the maid
      was gone, &ldquo;I suppose I may take it for granted that this unnatural
      marriage will take place; in that case there&rsquo;ll be formalities. Whom
      do I deal with&mdash;Herring&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t propose to live with them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happens to this house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be as Jon wishes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This house,&rdquo; said Soames suddenly: &ldquo;I had hopes when I
      began it. If they live in it&mdash;their children! They say there&rsquo;s
      such a thing as Nemesis. Do you believe in it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! You do!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come back from the window, and was standing close to her, who, in
      the curve of her grand piano, was, as it were, embayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not likely to see you again,&rdquo; he said slowly.
      &ldquo;Will you shake hands&rdquo;&mdash;his lip quivered, the words came
      out jerkily&mdash;&ldquo;and let the past die.&rdquo; He held out his
      hand. Her pale face grew paler, her eyes so dark, rested immovably on his,
      her hands remained clasped in front of her. He heard a sound and turned.
      That boy was standing in the opening of the curtains. Very queer he
      looked, hardly recognisable as the young fellow he had seen in the Gallery
      off Cork Street&mdash;very queer; much older, no youth in the face at all&mdash;haggard,
      rigid, his hair ruffled, his eyes deep in his head. Soames made an effort,
      and said with a lift of his lip, not quite a smile nor quite a sneer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, young man! I&rsquo;m here for my daughter; it rests with you,
      it seems&mdash;this matter. Your mother leaves it in your hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy continued staring at his mother&rsquo;s face, and made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my daughter&rsquo;s sake I&rsquo;ve brought myself to come,&rdquo;
      said Soames. &ldquo;What am I to say to her when I go back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still looking at his mother, the boy said, quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Fleur that it&rsquo;s no good, please; I must do as my father
      wished before he died.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a kind of stupefaction Soames looked from one to the other; then,
      taking up hat and umbrella which he had put down on a chair, he walked
      toward the curtains. The boy stood aside for him to go by. He passed
      through and heard the grate of the rings as the curtains were drawn behind
      him. The sound liberated something in his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So that&rsquo;s that!&rsquo; he thought, and passed out of the
      front door.
    </p>

    <h2>
      VIII.&mdash;THE DARK TUNE
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Soames walked away from the house at Robin Hill the sun broke through
      the grey of that chill afternoon, in smoky radiance. So absorbed in
      landscape painting that he seldom looked seriously for effects of Nature
      out of doors&mdash;he was struck by that moody effulgence&mdash;it mourned
      with a triumph suited to his own feeling. Victory in defeat. His embassy
      had come to naught. But he was rid of those people, had regained his
      daughter at the expense of&mdash;her happiness. What would Fleur say to
      him? Would she believe he had done his best? And under that sunlight
      faring on the elms, hazels, hollies of the lane and those unexploited
      fields, Soames felt dread. She would be terribly upset! He must appeal to
      her pride. That boy had given her up, declared part and lot with the woman
      who so long ago had given her father up! Soames clenched his hands. Given
      him up, and why? What had been wrong with him? And once more he felt the
      malaise of one who contemplates himself as seen by another&mdash;like a
      dog who chances on his refection in a mirror and is intrigued and anxious
      at the unseizable thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not in a hurry to get home, he dined in town at the Connoisseurs. While
      eating a pear it suddenly occurred to him that, if he had not gone down to
      Robin Hill, the boy might not have so decided. He remembered the
      expression on his face while his mother was refusing the hand he had held
      out. A strange, an awkward thought! Had Fleur cooked her own goose by
      trying to make too sure?
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached home at half-past nine. While the car was passing in at one
      drive gate he heard the grinding sputter of a motor-cycle passing out by
      the other. Young Mont, no doubt, so Fleur had not been lonely. But he went
      in with a sinking heart. In the cream-panelled drawing-room she was
      sitting with her elbows on her knees, and her chin on her clasped hands,
      in front of a white camellia plant which filled the fireplace. That glance
      at her before she saw him renewed his dread. What was she seeing among
      those white camellias?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shook his head. His tongue failed him. This was murderous work! He
      saw her eyes dilate, her lips quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What? Quick, Father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;I&mdash;I did my best, but&mdash;&rdquo;
      And again he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur ran to him, and put a hand on each of his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; muttered Soames; &ldquo;he. I was to tell you that it
      was no use; he must do what his father wished before he died.&rdquo; He
      caught her by the waist. &ldquo;Come, child, don&rsquo;t let them hurt
      you. They&rsquo;re not worth your little finger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur tore herself from his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t you&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t have tried. You&mdash;you
      betrayed me, Father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitterly wounded, Soames gazed at her passionate figure writhing there in
      front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t try&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t&mdash;I was a fool! I
      won&rsquo;t believe he could&mdash;he ever could! Only yesterday he&mdash;!
      Oh! why did I ask you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Soames, quietly, &ldquo;why did you? I swallowed
      my feelings; I did my best for you, against my judgment&mdash;and this is
      my reward. Good-night!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With every nerve in his body twitching he went toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur darted after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gives me up? You mean that? Father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames turned and forced himself to answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Fleur. &ldquo;What did you&mdash;what could you
      have done in those old days?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The breathless sense of really monstrous injustice cut the power of speech
      in Soames&rsquo; throat. What had he done! What had they done to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      And with quite unconscious dignity he put his hand on his breast, and
      looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo; cried Fleur passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames went out. He mounted, slow and icy, to his picture gallery, and
      paced among his treasures. Outrageous! Oh! Outrageous! She was spoiled!
      Ah! and who had spoiled her? He stood still before the Goya copy.
      Accustomed to her own way in everything. Flower of his life! And now that
      she couldn&rsquo;t have it! He turned to the window for some air. Daylight
      was dying, the moon rising, gold behind the poplars! What sound was that?
      Why! That piano thing! A dark tune, with a thrum and a throb! She had set
      it going&mdash;what comfort could she get from that? His eyes caught
      movement down there beyond the lawn, under the trellis of rambler roses
      and young acacia-trees, where the moonlight fell. There she was, roaming
      up and down. His heart gave a little sickening jump. What would she do
      under this blow? How could he tell? What did he know of her&mdash;he had
      only loved her all his life&mdash;looked on her as the apple of his eye!
      He knew nothing&mdash;had no notion. There she was&mdash;and that dark
      tune&mdash;and the river gleaming in the moonlight!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must go out,&rsquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastened down to the drawing-room, lighted just as he had left it, with
      the piano thrumming out that waltz, or fox-trot, or whatever they called
      it in these days, and passed through on to the verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where could he watch, without her seeing him? And he stole down through
      the fruit garden to the boat-house. He was between her and the river now,
      and his heart felt lighter. She was his daughter, and Annette&rsquo;s&mdash;she
      wouldn&rsquo;t do anything foolish; but there it was&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t
      know! From the boat house window he could see the last acacia and the spin
      of her skirt when she turned in her restless march. That tune had run down
      at last&mdash;thank goodness! He crossed the floor and looked through the
      farther window at the water slow-flowing past the lilies. It made little
      bubbles against them, bright where a moon-streak fell. He remembered
      suddenly that early morning when he had slept on the house-boat after his
      father died, and she had just been born&mdash;nearly nineteen years ago!
      Even now he recalled the unaccustomed world when he woke up, the strange
      feeling it had given him. That day the second passion of his life began&mdash;for
      this girl of his, roaming under the acacias. What a comfort she had been
      to him! And all the soreness and sense of outrage left him. If he could
      make her happy again, he didn&rsquo;t care! An owl flew, queeking,
      queeking; a bat flitted by; the moonlight brightened and broadened on the
      water. How long was she going to roam about like this! He went back to the
      window, and suddenly saw her coming down to the bank. She stood quite
      close, on the landing-stage. And Soames watched, clenching his hands.
      Should he speak to her? His excitement was intense. The stillness of her
      figure, its youth, its absorption in despair, in longing, in&mdash;itself.
      He would always remember it, moonlit like that; and the faint sweet reek
      of the river and the shivering of the willow leaves. She had everything in
      the world that he could give her, except the one thing that she could not
      have because of him! The perversity of things hurt him at that moment, as
      might a fish-bone in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with an infinite relief, he saw her turn back toward the house. What
      could he give her to make amends? Pearls, travel, horses, other young men&mdash;anything
      she wanted&mdash;that he might lose the memory of her young figure lonely
      by the water! There! She had set that tune going again! Why&mdash;it was a
      mania! Dark, thrumming, faint, travelling from the house. It was as though
      she had said: &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t have something to keep me going, I
      shall die of this!&rdquo; Soames dimly understood. Well, if it helped her,
      let her keep it thrumming on all night! And, mousing back through the
      fruit garden, he regained the verandah. Though he meant to go in and speak
      to her now, he still hesitated, not knowing what to say, trying hard to
      recall how it felt to be thwarted in love. He ought to know, ought to
      remember&mdash;and he could not! Gone&mdash;all real recollection; except
      that it had hurt him horribly. In this blankness he stood passing his
      handkerchief over hands and lips, which were very dry. By craning his head
      he could just see Fleur, standing with her back to that piano still
      grinding out its tune, her arms tight crossed on her breast, a lighted
      cigarette between her lips, whose smoke half veiled her face. The
      expression on it was strange to Soames, the eyes shone and stared, and
      every feature was alive with a sort of wretched scorn and anger. Once or
      twice he had seen Annette look like that&mdash;the face was too vivid, too
      naked, not his daughter&rsquo;s at that moment. And he dared not go in,
      realising the futility of any attempt at consolation. He sat down in the
      shadow of the ingle-nook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monstrous trick, that Fate had played him! Nemesis! That old unhappy
      marriage! And in God&rsquo;s name-why? How was he to know, when he wanted
      Irene so violently, and she consented to be his, that she would never love
      him? The tune died and was renewed, and died again, and still Soames sat
      in the shadow, waiting for he knew not what. The fag of Fleur&rsquo;s
      cigarette, flung through the window, fell on the grass; he watched it
      glowing, burning itself out. The moon had freed herself above the poplars,
      and poured her unreality on the garden. Comfortless light, mysterious,
      withdrawn&mdash;like the beauty of that woman who had never loved him&mdash;dappling
      the nemesias and the stocks with a vesture not of earth. Flowers! And his
      flower so unhappy! Ah! Why could one not put happiness into Local Loans,
      gild its edges, insure it against going down?
    </p>
    <p>
      Light had ceased to flow out now from the drawing-room window. All was
      silent and dark in there. Had she gone up? He rose, and, tiptoeing, peered
      in. It seemed so! He entered. The verandah kept the moonlight out; and at
      first he could see nothing but the outlines of furniture blacker than the
      darkness. He groped toward the farther window to shut it. His foot struck
      a chair, and he heard a gasp. There she was, curled and crushed into the
      corner of the sofa! His hand hovered. Did she want his consolation? He
      stood, gazing at that ball of crushed frills and hair and graceful youth,
      trying to burrow its way out of sorrow. How leave her there? At last he
      touched her hair, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, darling, better go to bed. I&rsquo;ll make it up to you,
      somehow.&rdquo; How fatuous! But what could he have said?

    <h2>
      IX.&mdash;UNDER THE OAK-TREE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When their visitor had disappeared Jon and his mother stood without
      speaking, till he said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have seen him out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Soames was already walking down the drive, and Jon went upstairs to
      his father&rsquo;s studio, not trusting himself to go back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression on his mother&rsquo;s face confronting the man she had once
      been married to, had sealed a resolution growing within him ever since she
      left him the night before. It had put the finishing touch of reality. To
      marry Fleur would be to hit his mother in the face; to betray his dead
      father! It was no good! Jon had the least resentful of natures. He bore
      his parents no grudge in this hour of his distress. For one so young there
      was a rather strange power in him of seeing things in some sort of
      proportion. It was worse for Fleur, worse for his mother even, than it was
      for him. Harder than to give up was to be given up, or to be the cause of
      some one you loved giving up for you. He must not, would not behave
      grudgingly! While he stood watching the tardy sunlight, he had again that
      sudden vision of the world which had come to him the night before. Sea on
      sea, country on country, millions on millions of people, all with their
      own lives, energies, joys, griefs, and suffering&mdash;all with things
      they had to give up, and separate struggles for existence. Even though he
      might be willing to give up all else for the one thing he couldn&rsquo;t
      have, he would be a fool to think his feelings mattered much in so vast a
      world, and to behave like a cry-baby or a cad. He pictured the people who
      had nothing&mdash;the millions who had given up life in the War, the
      millions whom the War had left with life and little else; the hungry
      children he had read of, the shattered men; people in prison, every kind
      of unfortunate. And&mdash;they did not help him much. If one had to miss a
      meal, what comfort in the knowledge that many others had to miss it too?
      There was more distraction in the thought of getting away out into this
      vast world of which he knew nothing yet. He could not go on staying here,
      walled in and sheltered, with everything so slick and comfortable, and
      nothing to do but brood and think what might have been. He could not go
      back to Wansdon, and the memories of Fleur. If he saw her again he could
      not trust himself; and if he stayed here or went back there, he would
      surely see her. While they were within reach of each other that must
      happen. To go far away and quickly was the only thing to do. But, however
      much he loved his mother, he did not want to go away with her. Then
      feeling that was brutal, he made up his mind desperately to propose that
      they should go to Italy. For two hours in that melancholy room he tried to
      master himself, then dressed solemnly for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother had done the same. They ate little, at some length, and talked
      of his father&rsquo;s catalogue. The show was arranged for October, and
      beyond clerical detail there was nothing more to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner she put on a cloak and they went out; walked a little, talked
      a little, till they were standing silent at last beneath the oak-tree.
      Ruled by the thought: &lsquo;If I show anything, I show all,&rsquo; Jon
      put his arm through hers and said quite casually:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, let&rsquo;s go to Italy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene pressed his arm, and said as casually:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be very nice; but I&rsquo;ve been thinking you ought to
      see and do more than you would if I were with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then you&rsquo;d be alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was once alone for more than twelve years. Besides, I should like
      to be here for the opening of Father&rsquo;s show.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon&rsquo;s grip tightened round her arm; he was not deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t stay here all by yourself; it&rsquo;s too big.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here, perhaps. In London, and I might go to Paris, after the
      show opens. You ought to have a year at least, Jon, and see the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d like to see the world and rough it. But I don&rsquo;t
      want to leave you all alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I owe you that at least. If it&rsquo;s for your good, it&rsquo;ll
      be for mine. Why not start tomorrow? You&rsquo;ve got your passport.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; if I&rsquo;m going it had better be at once. Only&mdash;Mother&mdash;if&mdash;if
      I wanted to stay out somewhere&mdash;America or anywhere, would you mind
      coming presently?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever and whenever you send for me. But don&rsquo;t send until
      you really want me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jon drew a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel England&rsquo;s choky.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood a few minutes longer under the oak-tree&mdash;looking out to
      where the grand stand at Epsom was veiled in evening. The branches kept
      the moonlight from them, so that it only fell everywhere else&mdash;over
      the fields and far away, and on the windows of the creepered house behind,
      which soon would be to let.

    <h2>
      X.&mdash;FLEUR&rsquo;S WEDDING
    </h2>
    <p>
      The October paragraphs describing the wedding of Fleur Forsyte to Michael
      Mont hardly conveyed the symbolic significance of this event. In the union
      of the great-granddaughter of &ldquo;Superior Dosset&rdquo; with the heir
      of a ninth baronet was the outward and visible sign of that merger of
      class in class which buttresses the political stability of a realm. The
      time had come when the Forsytes might resign their natural resentment
      against a &ldquo;flummery&rdquo; not theirs by birth, and accept it as the
      still more natural due of their possessive instincts. Besides, they had to
      mount to make room for all those so much more newly rich. In that quiet
      but tasteful ceremony in Hanover Square, and afterward among the furniture
      in Green Street, it had been impossible for those not in the know to
      distinguish the Forsyte troop from the Mont contingent&mdash;so far away
      was &ldquo;Superior Dosset&rdquo; now. Was there, in the crease of his
      trousers, the expression of his moustache, his accent, or the shine on his
      top-hat, a pin to choose between Soames and the ninth baronet himself? Was
      not Fleur as self-possessed, quick, glancing, pretty, and hard as the
      likeliest Muskham, Mont, or Charwell filly present? If anything, the
      Forsytes had it in dress and looks and manners. They had become &ldquo;upper
      class&rdquo; and now their name would be formally recorded in the Stud
      Book, their money joined to land. Whether this was a little late in the
      day, and those rewards of the possessive instinct, lands and money,
      destined for the melting-pot&mdash;was still a question so moot that it
      was not mooted. After all, Timothy had said Consols were goin&rsquo; up.
      Timothy, the last, the missing link; Timothy, in extremis on the Bayswater
      Road&mdash;so Francie had reported. It was whispered, too, that this young
      Mont was a sort of socialist&mdash;strangely wise of him, and in the
      nature of insurance, considering the days they lived in. There was no
      uneasiness on that score. The landed classes produced that sort of amiable
      foolishness at times, turned to safe uses and confined to theory. As
      George remarked to his sister Francie: &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll soon be having
      puppies&mdash;that&rsquo;ll give him pause.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The church with white flowers and something blue in the middle of the East
      window looked extremely chaste, as though endeavouring to counteract the
      somewhat lurid phraseology of a Service calculated to keep the thoughts of
      all on puppies. Forsytes, Haymans, Tweetymans, sat in the left aisle;
      Monts, Charwells; Muskhams in the right; while a sprinkling of Fleur&rsquo;s
      fellow-sufferers at school, and of Mont&rsquo;s fellow-sufferers in, the
      War, gaped indiscriminately from either side, and three maiden ladies, who
      had dropped in on their way from Skyward&rsquo;s brought up the rear,
      together with two Mont retainers and Fleur&rsquo;s old nurse. In the
      unsettled state of the country as full a house as could be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Val Dartie, who sat with her husband in the third row, squeezed his
      hand more than once during the performance. To her, who knew the plot of
      this tragi-comedy, its most dramatic moment was well-nigh painful. &lsquo;I
      wonder if Jon knows by instinct,&rsquo; she thought&mdash;Jon, out in
      British Columbia. She had received a letter from him only that morning
      which had made her smile and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jon&rsquo;s in British Columbia, Val, because he wants to be in
      California. He thinks it&rsquo;s too nice there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Val, &ldquo;so he&rsquo;s beginning to see a joke
      again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s bought some land and sent for his mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth will she do out there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All she cares about is Jon. Do you still think it a happy release?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val&rsquo;s shrewd eyes narrowed to grey pin-points between their dark
      lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleur wouldn&rsquo;t have suited him a bit. She&rsquo;s not bred
      right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little Fleur!&rdquo; sighed Holly. Ah! it was strange&mdash;this
      marriage. The young man, Mont, had caught her on the rebound, of course,
      in the reckless mood of one whose ship has just gone down. Such a plunge
      could not but be&mdash;as Val put it&mdash;an outside chance. There was
      little to be told from the back view of her young cousin&rsquo;s veil, and
      Holly&rsquo;s eyes reviewed the general aspect of this Christian wedding.
      She, who had made a love-match which had been successful, had a horror of
      unhappy marriages. This might not be one in the end&mdash;but it was
      clearly a toss-up; and to consecrate a toss-up in this fashion with
      manufactured unction before a crowd of fashionable free-thinkers&mdash;for
      who thought otherwise than freely, or not at all, when they were &ldquo;dolled&rdquo;
      up&mdash;seemed to her as near a sin as one could find in an age which had
      abolished them. Her eyes wandered from the prelate in his robes (a
      Charwell-the Forsytes had not as yet produced a prelate) to Val, beside
      her, thinking&mdash;she was certain&mdash;of the Mayfly filly at fifteen
      to one for the Cambridgeshire. They passed on and caught the profile of
      the ninth baronet, in counterfeitment of the kneeling process. She could
      just see the neat ruck above his knees where he had pulled his trousers
      up, and thought: &lsquo;Val&rsquo;s forgotten to pull up his!&rsquo; Her
      eyes passed to the pew in front of her, where Winifred&rsquo;s substantial
      form was gowned with passion, and on again to Soames and Annette kneeling
      side by side. A little smile came on her lips&mdash;Prosper Profond, back
      from the South Seas of the Channel, would be kneeling too, about six rows
      behind. Yes! This was a funny &ldquo;small&rdquo; business, however it
      turned out; still it was in a proper church and would be in the proper
      papers to-morrow morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had begun a hymn; she could hear the ninth baronet across the aisle,
      singing of the hosts of Midian. Her little finger touched Val&rsquo;s
      thumb&mdash;they were holding the same hymn-book&mdash;and a tiny thrill
      passed through her, preserved&mdash;from twenty years ago. He stooped and
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, d&rsquo;you remember the rat?&rdquo; The rat at their
      wedding in Cape Colony, which had cleaned its whiskers behind the table at
      the Registrar&rsquo;s! And between her little and third forgers she
      squeezed his thumb hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hymn was over, the prelate had begun to deliver his discourse. He told
      them of the dangerous times they lived in, and the awful conduct of the
      House of Lords in connection with divorce. They were all soldiers&mdash;he
      said&mdash;in the trenches under the poisonous gas of the Prince of
      Darkness, and must be manful. The purpose of marriage was children, not
      mere sinful happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      An imp danced in Holly&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;Val&rsquo;s eyelashes were
      meeting. Whatever happened; he must not snore. Her finger and thumb closed
      on his thigh till he stirred uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discourse was over, the danger past. They were signing in the vestry;
      and general relaxation had set in.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice behind her said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she stay the course?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old George Forsyte!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly demurely scrutinized one of whom she had often heard. Fresh from
      South Africa, and ignorant of her kith and kin, she never saw one without
      an almost childish curiosity. He was very big, and very dapper; his eyes
      gave her a funny feeling of having no particular clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; she heard him say.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came, stepping from the chancel. Holly looked first in young Mont&rsquo;s
      face. His lips and ears were twitching, his eyes, shifting from his feet
      to the hand within his arm, stared suddenly before them as if to face a
      firing party. He gave Holly the feeling that he was spiritually
      intoxicated. But Fleur! Ah! That was different. The girl was perfectly
      composed, prettier than ever, in her white robes and veil over her banged
      dark chestnut hair; her eyelids hovered demure over her dark hazel eyes.
      Outwardly, she seemed all there. But inwardly, where was she? As those two
      passed, Fleur raised her eyelids&mdash;the restless glint of those clear
      whites remained on Holly&rsquo;s vision as might the flutter of caged bird&rsquo;s
      wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Green Street Winifred stood to receive, just a little less composed
      than usual. Soames&rsquo; request for the use of her house had come on her
      at a deeply psychological moment. Under the influence of a remark of
      Prosper Profond, she had begun to exchange her Empire for Expressionistic
      furniture. There were the most amusing arrangements, with violet, green,
      and orange blobs and scriggles, to be had at Mealard&rsquo;s. Another
      month and the change would have been complete. Just now, the very &ldquo;intriguing&rdquo;
      recruits she had enlisted, did not march too well with the old guard. It
      was as if her regiment were half in khaki, half in scarlet and bearskins.
      But her strong and comfortable character made the best of it in a
      drawing-room which typified, perhaps, more perfectly than she imagined,
      the semi-bolshevized imperialism of her country. After all, this was a day
      of merger, and you couldn&rsquo;t have too much of it! Her eyes travelled
      indulgently among her guests. Soames had gripped the back of a buhl chair;
      young Mont was behind that &ldquo;awfully amusing&rdquo; screen, which no
      one as yet had been able to explain to her. The ninth baronet had shied
      violently at a round scarlet table, inlaid under glass with blue
      Australian butteries&rsquo; wings, and was clinging to her Louis-Quinze
      cabinet; Francie Forsyte had seized the new mantel-board, finely carved
      with little purple grotesques on an ebony ground; George, over by the old
      spinet, was holding a little sky-blue book as if about to enter bets;
      Prosper Profond was twiddling the knob of the open door, black with
      peacock-blue panels; and Annette&rsquo;s hands, close by, were grasping
      her own waist; two Muskhams clung to the balcony among the plants, as if
      feeling ill; Lady Mont, thin and brave-looking, had taken up her
      long-handled glasses and was gazing at the central light shade, of ivory
      and orange dashed with deep magenta, as if the heavens had opened.
      Everybody, in fact, seemed holding on to something. Only Fleur, still in
      her bridal dress, was detached from all support, flinging her words and
      glances to left and right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was full of the bubble and the squeak of conversation. Nobody
      could hear anything that anybody said; which seemed of little consequence,
      since no one waited for anything so slow as an answer. Modern conversation
      seemed to Winifred so different from the days of her prime, when a drawl
      was all the vogue. Still it was &ldquo;amusing,&rdquo; which, of course,
      was all that mattered. Even the Forsytes were talking with extreme
      rapidity&mdash;Fleur and Christopher, and Imogen, and young Nicholas&rsquo;s
      youngest, Patrick. Soames, of course, was silent; but George, by the
      spinet, kept up a running commentary, and Francie, by her mantel-shelf.
      Winifred drew nearer to the ninth baronet. He seemed to promise a certain
      repose; his nose was fine and drooped a little, his grey moustaches too;
      and she said, drawling through her smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather nice, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His reply shot out of his smile like a snipped bread pellet
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;you remember, in Frazer, the tribe that buries the bride up
      to the waist?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke as fast as anybody! He had dark lively little eyes, too, all
      crinkled round like a Catholic priest&rsquo;s. Winifred felt suddenly he
      might say things she would regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re always so amusing&mdash;weddings,&rdquo; she
      murmured, and moved on to Soames. He was curiously still, and Winifred saw
      at once what was dictating his immobility. To his right was George
      Forsyte, to his left Annette and Prosper Profond. He could not move
      without either seeing those two together, or the reflection of them in
      George Forsyte&rsquo;s japing eyes. He was quite right not to be taking
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say Timothy&rsquo;s sinking;&rdquo; he said glumly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where will you put him, Soames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Highgate.&rdquo; He counted on his fingers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll make
      twelve of them there, including wives. How do you think Fleur looks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remarkably well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames nodded. He had never seen her look prettier, yet he could not rid
      himself of the impression that this business was unnatural&mdash;remembering
      still that crushed figure burrowing into the corner of the sofa. From that
      night to this day he had received from her no confidences. He knew from
      his chauffeur that she had made one more attempt on Robin Hill and drawn
      blank&mdash;an empty house, no one at home. He knew that she had received
      a letter, but not what was in it, except that it had made her hide herself
      and cry. He had remarked that she looked at him sometimes when she thought
      he wasn&rsquo;t noticing, as if she were wondering still what he had done&mdash;forsooth&mdash;to
      make those people hate him so. Well, there it was! Annette had come back,
      and things had worn on through the summer&mdash;very miserable, till
      suddenly Fleur had said she was going to marry young Mont. She had shown
      him a little more affection when she told him that. And he had yielded&mdash;what
      was the good of opposing it? God knew that he had never wished to thwart
      her in anything! And the young man seemed quite delirious about her. No
      doubt she was in a reckless mood, and she was young, absurdly young. But
      if he opposed her, he didn&rsquo;t know what she would do; for all he
      could tell she might want to take up a profession, become a doctor or
      solicitor, some nonsense. She had no aptitude for painting, writing,
      music, in his view the legitimate occupations of unmarried women, if they
      must do something in these days. On the whole, she was safer married, for
      he could see too well how feverish and restless she was at home. Annette,
      too, had been in favour of it&mdash;Annette, from behind the veil of his
      refusal to know what she was about, if she was about anything. Annette had
      said: &ldquo;Let her marry this young man. He is a nice boy&mdash;not so
      highty-flighty as he seems.&rdquo; Where she got her expressions, he didn&rsquo;t
      know&mdash;but her opinion soothed his doubts. His wife, whatever her
      conduct, had clear eyes and an almost depressing amount of common sense.
      He had settled fifty thousand on Fleur, taking care that there was no
      cross settlement in case it didn&rsquo;t turn out well. Could it turn out
      well? She had not got over that other boy&mdash;he knew. They were to go
      to Spain for the honeymoon. He would be even lonelier when she was gone.
      But later, perhaps, she would forget, and turn to him again! Winifred&rsquo;s
      voice broke on his reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! Of all wonders-June!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There, in a djibbah&mdash;what things she wore!&mdash;with her hair
      straying from under a fillet, Soames saw his cousin, and Fleur going
      forward to greet her. The two passed from their view out on to the
      stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;she does the most impossible
      things! Fancy her coming!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you ask her?&rdquo; muttered Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I thought she wouldn&rsquo;t accept, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred had forgotten that behind conduct lies the main trend of
      character; or, in other words, omitted to remember that Fleur was now a
      &ldquo;lame duck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On receiving her invitation, June had first thought, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
      go near them for the world!&rsquo; and then, one morning, had awakened
      from a dream of Fleur waving to her from a boat with a wild unhappy
      gesture. And she had changed her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Fleur came forward and said to her, &ldquo;Do come up while I&rsquo;m
      changing my dress,&rdquo; she had followed up the stairs. The girl led the
      way into Imogen&rsquo;s old bedroom, set ready for her toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      June sat down on the bed, thin and upright, like a little spirit in the
      sear and yellow. Fleur locked the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood before her divested of her wedding dress. What a pretty
      thing she was!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you think me a fool,&rdquo; she said, with quivering
      lips, &ldquo;when it was to have been Jon. But what does it matter?
      Michael wants me, and I don&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;ll get me away from
      home.&rdquo; Diving her hand into the frills on her breast, she brought
      out a letter. &ldquo;Jon wrote me this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June read: &ldquo;Lake Okanagen, British Columbia. I&rsquo;m not coming
      back to England. Bless you always. Jon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s made safe, you see,&rdquo; said Fleur.
    </p>
    <p>
      June handed back the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair to Irene,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;she always
      told Jon he could do as he wished.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur smiled bitterly. &ldquo;Tell me, didn&rsquo;t she spoil your life
      too?&rdquo; June looked up. &ldquo;Nobody can spoil a life, my dear. That&rsquo;s
      nonsense. Things happen, but we bob up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sort of terror she saw the girl sink on her knees and bury her face
      in the djibbah. A strangled sob mounted to June&rsquo;s ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right&mdash;all right,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!
      There, there!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the point of the girl&rsquo;s chin was pressed ever closer into her
      thigh, and the sound was dreadful of her sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, well! It had to come. She would feel better afterward! June stroked
      the short hair of that shapely head; and all the scattered mother-sense in
      her focussed itself and passed through the tips of her fingers into the
      girl&rsquo;s brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sit down under it, my dear,&rdquo; she said at last.
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t control life, but we can fight it. Make the best of
      things. I&rsquo;ve had to. I held on, like you; and I cried, as you&rsquo;re
      crying now. And look at me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleur raised her head; a sob merged suddenly into a little choked laugh.
      In truth it was a thin and rather wild and wasted spirit she was looking
      at, but it had brave eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I shall forget
      him, I suppose, if I fly fast and far enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, scrambling to her feet, she went over to the wash-stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      June watched her removing with cold water the traces of emotion. Save for
      a little becoming pinkness there was nothing left when she stood before
      the mirror. June got off the bed and took a pin-cushion in her hand. To
      put two pins into the wrong places was all the vent she found for
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a kiss,&rdquo; she said when Fleur was ready, and dug her
      chin into the girl&rsquo;s warm cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a whiff,&rdquo; said Fleur; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June left her, sitting on the bed with a cigarette between her lips and
      her eyes half closed, and went down-stairs. In the doorway of the
      drawing-room stood Soames as if unquiet at his daughter&rsquo;s tardiness.
      June tossed her head and passed down on to the half-landing. Her cousin
      Francie was standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said June, pointing with her chin at Soames. &ldquo;That
      man&rsquo;s fatal!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean,&rdquo; said Francie, &ldquo;fatal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June did not answer her. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t wait to see them off,&rdquo;
      she said. &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; said Francie, and her eyes, of a Celtic grey,
      goggled. That old feud! Really, it was quite romantic!
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, moving to the well of the staircase, saw June go, and drew a
      breath of satisfaction. Why didn&rsquo;t Fleur come? They would miss their
      train. That train would bear her away from him, yet he could not help
      fidgeting at the thought that they would lose it. And then she did come,
      running down in her tan-coloured frock and black velvet cap, and passed
      him into the drawing-room. He saw her kiss her mother, her aunt, Val&rsquo;s
      wife, Imogen, and then come forth, quick and pretty as ever. How would she
      treat him at this last moment of her girlhood? He couldn&rsquo;t hope for
      much!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips pressed the middle of his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; she said, and was past and gone! Daddy! She hadn&rsquo;t
      called him that for years. He drew a long breath and followed slowly down.
      There was all the folly with that confetti stuff and the rest of it to go
      through with yet. But he would like just to catch her smile, if she leaned
      out, though they would hit her in the eye with the shoe, if they didn&rsquo;t
      take care. Young Mont&rsquo;s voice said fervently in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, sir; and thank you! I&rsquo;m so fearfully bucked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t miss your train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood on the bottom step but three, whence he could see above the heads&mdash;the
      silly hats and heads. They were in the car now; and there was that stuff,
      showering, and there went the shoe. A flood of something welled up in
      Soames, and&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t see!

    <h2>
      XI.&mdash;THE LAST OF THE OLD FORSYTES
    </h2>
    <p>
      When they came to prepare that terrific symbol Timothy Forsyte&mdash;the
      one pure individualist left, the only man who hadn&rsquo;t heard of the
      Great War&mdash;they found him wonderful&mdash;not even death had
      undermined his soundness.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Smither and Cook that preparation came like final evidence of what they
      had never believed possible&mdash;the end of the old Forsyte family on
      earth. Poor Mr. Timothy must now take a harp and sing in the company of
      Miss Forsyte, Mrs. Julia, Miss Hester; with Mr. Jolyon, Mr. Swithin, Mr.
      James, Mr. Roger, and Mr. Nicholas of the party. Whether Mrs. Hayman would
      be there was more doubtful, seeing that she had been cremated. Secretly
      Cook thought that Mr. Timothy would be upset&mdash;he had always been so
      set against barrel organs. How many times had she not said: &ldquo;Drat
      the thing! There it is again! Smither, you&rsquo;d better run up and see
      what you can do.&rdquo; And in her heart she would so have enjoyed the
      tunes, if she hadn&rsquo;t known that Mr. Timothy would ring the bell in a
      minute and say: &ldquo;Here, take him a halfpenny and tell him to move on.&rdquo;
      Often they had been obliged to add threepence of their own before the man
      would go&mdash;Timothy had ever underrated the value of emotion. Luckily
      he had taken the organs for blue-bottles in his last years, which had been
      a comfort, and they had been able to enjoy the tunes. But a harp! Cook
      wondered. It was a change! And Mr. Timothy had never liked change. But she
      did not speak of this to Smither, who did so take a line of her own in
      regard to heaven that it quite put one about sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She cried while Timothy was being prepared, and they all had sherry
      afterward out of the yearly Christmas bottle, which would not be needed
      now. Ah! dear! She had been there five-and-forty years and Smither
      three-and-forty! And now they would be going to a tiny house in Tooting,
      to live on their savings and what Miss Hester had so kindly left them&mdash;for
      to take fresh service after the glorious past&mdash;No! But they would
      like just to see Mr. Soames again, and Mrs. Dartie, and Miss Francie, and
      Miss Euphemia. And even if they had to take their own cab, they felt they
      must go to the funeral. For six years Mr. Timothy had been their baby,
      getting younger and younger every day, till at last he had been too young
      to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent the regulation hours of waiting in polishing and dusting, in
      catching the one mouse left, and asphyxiating the last beetle so as to
      leave it nice, discussing with each other what they would buy at the sale.
      Miss Ann&rsquo;s workbox; Miss Juley&rsquo;s (that is Mrs. Julia&rsquo;s)
      seaweed album; the fire-screen Miss Hester had crewelled; and Mr. Timothy&rsquo;s
      hair&mdash;little golden curls, glued into a black frame. Oh! they must
      have those&mdash;only the price of things had gone up so!
    </p>
    <p>
      It fell to Soames to issue invitations for the funeral. He had them drawn
      up by Gradman in his office&mdash;only blood relations, and no flowers.
      Six carriages were ordered. The Will would be read afterward at the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived at eleven o&rsquo;clock to see that all was ready. At a quarter
      past old Gradman came in black gloves and crape on his hat. He and Soames
      stood in the drawing-room waiting. At half-past eleven the carriages drew
      up in a long row. But no one else appeared. Gradman said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It surprises me, Mr. Soames. I posted them myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;he&rsquo;d lost
      touch with the family.&rdquo; Soames had often noticed in old days how
      much more neighbourly his family were to the dead than to the living. But,
      now, the way they had flocked to Fleur&rsquo;s wedding and abstained from
      Timothy&rsquo;s funeral, seemed to show some vital change. There might, of
      course, be another reason; for Soames felt that if he had not known the
      contents of Timothy&rsquo;s Will, he might have stayed away himself
      through delicacy. Timothy had left a lot of money, with nobody in
      particular to leave it to. They mightn&rsquo;t like to seem to expect
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twelve o&rsquo;clock the procession left the door; Timothy alone in the
      first carriage under glass. Then Soames alone; then Gradman alone; then
      Cook and Smither together. They started at a walk, but were soon trotting
      under a bright sky. At the entrance to Highgate Cemetery they were delayed
      by service in the Chapel. Soames would have liked to stay outside in the
      sunshine. He didn&rsquo;t believe a word of it; on the other hand, it was
      a form of insurance which could not safely be neglected, in case there
      might be something in it after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked up two and two&mdash;he and Gradman, Cook and Smither&mdash;to
      the family vault. It was not very distinguished for the funeral of the
      last old Forsyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took Gradman into his carriage on the way back to the Bayswater Road
      with a certain glow in his heart. He had a surprise in pickle for the old
      chap who had served the Forsytes four-and-fifty years-a treat that was
      entirely his doing. How well he remembered saying to Timothy the day&mdash;after
      Aunt Hester&rsquo;s funeral: &ldquo;Well; Uncle Timothy, there&rsquo;s
      Gradman. He&rsquo;s taken a lot of trouble for the family. What do you say
      to leaving him five thousand?&rdquo; and his surprise, seeing the
      difficulty there had been in getting Timothy to leave anything, when
      Timothy had nodded. And now the old chap would be as pleased as Punch, for
      Mrs. Gradman, he knew, had a weak heart, and their son had lost a leg in
      the War. It was extraordinarily gratifying to Soames to have left him five
      thousand pounds of Timothy&rsquo;s money. They sat down together in the
      little drawing-room, whose walls&mdash;like a vision of heaven&mdash;were
      sky-blue and gold with every picture-frame unnaturally bright, and every
      speck of dust removed from every piece of furniture, to read that little
      masterpiece&mdash;the Will of Timothy. With his back to the light in Aunt
      Hester&rsquo;s chair, Soames faced Gradman with his face to the light, on
      Aunt Ann&rsquo;s sofa; and, crossing his legs, began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the last Will and Testament of me Timothy Forsyte of The
      Bower Bayswater Road, London I appoint my nephew Soames Forsyte of The
      Shelter Mapleduram and Thomas Gradman of 159 Folly Road Highgate
      (hereinafter called my Trustees) to be the trustees and executors of this
      my Will To the said Soames Forsyte I leave the sum of one thousand pounds
      free of legacy duty and to the said Thomas Gradman I leave the sum of five
      thousand pounds free of legacy duty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames paused. Old Gradman was leaning forward, convulsively gripping a
      stout black knee with each of his thick hands; his mouth had fallen open
      so that the gold fillings of three teeth gleamed; his eyes were blinking,
      two tears rolled slowly out of them. Soames read hastily on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the rest of my property of whatsoever description I bequeath to
      my Trustees upon Trust to convert and hold the same upon the following
      trusts namely To pay thereout all my debts funeral expenses and outgoings
      of any kind in connection with my Will and to hold the residue thereof in
      trust for that male lineal descendant of my father Jolyon Forsyte by his
      marriage with Ann Pierce who after the decease of all lineal descendants
      whether male or female of my said father by his said marriage in being at
      the time of my death shall last attain the age of twenty-one years
      absolutely it being my desire that my property shall be nursed to the
      extreme limit permitted by the laws of England for the benefit of such
      male lineal descendant as aforesaid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames read the investment and attestation clauses, and, ceasing, looked
      at Gradman. The old fellow was wiping his brow with a large handkerchief,
      whose brilliant colour supplied a sudden festive tinge to the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, Mr. Soames!&rdquo; he said, and it was clear that the
      lawyer in him had utterly wiped out the man: &ldquo;My word! Why, there
      are two babies now, and some quite young children&mdash;if one of them
      lives to be eighty&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a great age&mdash;and add
      twenty-one&mdash;that&rsquo;s a hundred years; and Mr. Timothy worth a
      hundred and fifty thousand pound net if he&rsquo;s worth a penny. Compound
      interest at five per cent. doubles you in fourteen years. In fourteen
      years three hundred thousand-six hundred thousand in twenty-eight&mdash;twelve
      hundred thousand in forty-two&mdash;twenty-four hundred thousand in
      fifty-six&mdash;four million eight hundred thousand in seventy&mdash;nine
      million six hundred thousand in eighty-four&mdash;Why, in a hundred years
      it&rsquo;ll be twenty million! And we shan&rsquo;t live to use it! It is a
      Will!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames said dryly: &ldquo;Anything may happen. The State might take the
      lot; they&rsquo;re capable of anything in these days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And carry five,&rdquo; said Gradman to himself. &ldquo;I forgot&mdash;Mr.
      Timothy&rsquo;s in Consols; we shan&rsquo;t get more than two per cent.
      with this income tax. To be on the safe side, say eight millions. Still,
      that&rsquo;s a pretty penny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames rose and handed him the Will. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going into the
      City. Take care of that, and do what&rsquo;s necessary. Advertise; but
      there are no debts. When&rsquo;s the sale?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tuesday week,&rdquo; said Gradman. &ldquo;Life or lives in bein&rsquo;
      and twenty-one years afterward&mdash;it&rsquo;s a long way off. But I&rsquo;m
      glad he&rsquo;s left it in the family....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sale&mdash;not at Jobson&rsquo;s, in view of the Victorian nature of
      the effects&mdash;was far more freely attended than the funeral, though
      not by Cook and Smither, for Soames had taken it on himself to give them
      their heart&rsquo;s desires. Winifred was present, Euphemia, and Francie,
      and Eustace had come in his car. The miniatures, Barbizons, and J. R.
      drawings had been bought in by Soames; and relics of no marketable value
      were set aside in an off-room for members of the family who cared to have
      mementoes. These were the only restrictions upon bidding characterised by
      an almost tragic languor. Not one piece of furniture, no picture or
      porcelain figure appealed to modern taste. The humming birds had fallen
      like autumn leaves when taken from where they had not hummed for sixty
      years. It was painful to Soames to see the chairs his aunts had sat on,
      the little grand piano they had practically never played, the books whose
      outsides they had gazed at, the china they had dusted, the curtains they
      had drawn, the hearth-rug which had warmed their feet; above all, the beds
      they had lain and died in&mdash;sold to little dealers, and the housewives
      of Fulham. And yet&mdash;what could one do? Buy them and stick them in a
      lumber-room? No; they had to go the way of all flesh and furniture, and be
      worn out. But when they put up Aunt Ann&rsquo;s sofa and were going to
      knock it down for thirty shillings, he cried out, suddenly: &ldquo;Five
      pounds!&rdquo; The sensation was considerable, and the sofa his.
    </p>
    <p>
      When that little sale was over in the fusty saleroom, and those Victorian
      ashes scattered, he went out into the misty October sunshine feeling as if
      cosiness had died out of the world, and the board &ldquo;To Let&rdquo; was
      up, indeed. Revolutions on the horizon; Fleur in Spain; no comfort in
      Annette; no Timothy&rsquo;s on the Bayswater Road. In the irritable
      desolation of his soul he went into the Goupenor Gallery. That chap Jolyon&rsquo;s
      watercolours were on view there. He went in to look down his nose at them&mdash;it
      might give him some faint satisfaction. The news had trickled through from
      June to Val&rsquo;s wife, from her to Val, from Val to his mother, from
      her to Soames, that the house&mdash;the fatal house at Robin Hill&mdash;was
      for sale, and Irene going to join her boy out in British Columbia, or some
      such place. For one wild moment the thought had come to Soames: &lsquo;Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t I buy it back? I meant it for my!&rsquo; No sooner come
      than gone. Too lugubrious a triumph; with too many humiliating memories
      for himself and Fleur. She would never live there after what had happened.
      No, the place must go its way to some peer or profiteer. It had been a
      bone of contention from the first, the shell of the feud; and with the
      woman gone, it was an empty shell. &ldquo;For Sale or To Let.&rdquo; With
      his mind&rsquo;s eye he could see that board raised high above the ivied
      wall which he had built.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed through the first of the two rooms in the Gallery. There was
      certainly a body of work! And now that the fellow was dead it did not seem
      so trivial. The drawings were pleasing enough, with quite a sense of
      atmosphere, and something individual in the brush work. &lsquo;His father
      and my father; he and I; his child and mine!&rsquo; thought Soames. So it
      had gone on! And all about that woman! Softened by the events of the past
      week, affected by the melancholy beauty of the autumn day, Soames came
      nearer than he had ever been to realisation of that truth&mdash;passing
      the understanding of a Forsyte pure&mdash;that the body of Beauty has a
      spiritual essence, uncapturable save by a devotion which thinks not of
      self. After all, he was near that truth in his devotion to his daughter;
      perhaps that made him understand a little how he had missed the prize. And
      there, among the drawings of his kinsman, who had attained to that which
      he had found beyond his reach, he thought of him and her with a tolerance
      which surprised him. But he did not buy a drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he passed the seat of custom on his return to the outer air he met
      with a contingency which had not been entirely absent from his mind when
      he went into the Gallery&mdash;Irene, herself, coming in. So she had not
      gone yet, and was still paying farewell visits to that fellow&rsquo;s
      remains! He subdued the little involuntary leap of his subconsciousness,
      the mechanical reaction of his senses to the charm of this once-owned
      woman, and passed her with averted eyes. But when he had gone by he could
      not for the life of him help looking back. This, then, was finality&mdash;the
      heat and stress of his life, the madness and the longing thereof, the only
      defeat he had known, would be over when she faded from his view this time;
      even such memories had their own queer aching value.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, too, was looking back. Suddenly she lifted her gloved hand, her lips
      smiled faintly, her dark eyes seemed to speak. It was the turn of Soames
      to make no answer to that smile and that little farewell wave; he went out
      into the fashionable street quivering from head to foot. He knew what she
      had meant to say: &ldquo;Now that I am going for ever out of the reach of
      you and yours&mdash;forgive me; I wish you well.&rdquo; That was the
      meaning; last sign of that terrible reality&mdash;passing morality, duty,
      common sense&mdash;her aversion from him who had owned her body, but had
      never touched her spirit or her heart. It hurt; yes&mdash;more than if she
      had kept her mask unmoved, her hand unlifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later, in that fast-yellowing October, Soames took a taxi-cab
      to Highgate Cemetery and mounted through its white forest to the Forsyte
      vault. Close to the cedar, above catacombs and columbaria, tall, ugly, and
      individual, it looked like an apex of the competitive system. He could
      remember a discussion wherein Swithin had advocated the addition to its
      face of the pheasant proper. The proposal had been rejected in favour of a
      wreath in stone, above the stark words: &ldquo;The family vault of Jolyon
      Forsyte: 1850.&rdquo; It was in good order. All trace of the recent
      interment had been removed, and its sober grey gloomed reposefully in the
      sunshine. The whole family lay there now, except old Jolyon&rsquo;s wife,
      who had gone back under a contract to her own family vault in Suffolk; old
      Jolyon himself lying at Robin Hill; and Susan Hayman, cremated so that
      none knew where she might be. Soames gazed at it with satisfaction&mdash;massive,
      needing little attention; and this was important, for he was well aware
      that no one would attend to it when he himself was gone, and he would have
      to be looking out for lodgings soon. He might have twenty years before
      him, but one never knew. Twenty years without an aunt or uncle, with a
      wife of whom one had better not know anything, with a daughter gone from
      home. His mood inclined to melancholy and retrospection.
    </p>
    <p>
      This cemetery was full, they said&mdash;of people with extraordinary
      names, buried in extraordinary taste. Still, they had a fine view up here,
      right over London. Annette had once given him a story to read by that
      Frenchman, Maupassant, most lugubrious concern, where all the skeletons
      emerged from their graves one night, and all the pious inscriptions on the
      stones were altered to descriptions of their sins. Not a true story at
      all. He didn&rsquo;t know about the French, but there was not much real
      harm in English people except their teeth and their taste, which was
      certainly deplorable. &ldquo;The family vault of Jolyon Forsyte: 1850.&rdquo;
      A lot of people had been buried here since then&mdash;a lot of English
      life crumbled to mould and dust! The boom of an airplane passing under the
      gold-tinted clouds caused him to lift his eyes. The deuce of a lot of
      expansion had gone on. But it all came back to a cemetery&mdash;to a name
      and a date on a tomb. And he thought with a curious pride that he and his
      family had done little or nothing to help this feverish expansion. Good
      solid middlemen, they had gone to work with dignity to manage and possess.
      &ldquo;Superior Dosset,&rdquo; indeed, had built in a dreadful, and Jolyon
      painted in a doubtful, period, but so far as he remembered not another of
      them all had soiled his hands by creating anything&mdash;unless you
      counted Val Dartie and his horse-breeding. Collectors, solicitors,
      barristers, merchants, publishers, accountants, directors, land agents,
      even soldiers&mdash;there they had been! The country had expanded, as it
      were, in spite of them. They had checked, controlled, defended, and taken
      advantage of the process and when you considered how &ldquo;Superior
      Dosset&rdquo; had begun life with next to nothing, and his lineal
      descendants already owned what old Gradman estimated at between a million
      and a million and a half, it was not so bad! And yet he sometimes felt as
      if the family bolt was shot, their possessive instinct dying out. They
      seemed unable to make money&mdash;this fourth generation; they were going
      into art, literature, farming, or the army; or just living on what was
      left them&mdash;they had no push and no tenacity. They would die out if
      they didn&rsquo;t take care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames turned from the vault and faced toward the breeze. The air up here
      would be delicious if only he could rid his nerves of the feeling that
      mortality was in it. He gazed restlessly at the crosses and the urns, the
      angels, the &ldquo;immortelles,&rdquo; the flowers, gaudy or withering;
      and suddenly he noticed a spot which seemed so different from anything
      else up there that he was obliged to walk the few necessary yards and look
      at it. A sober corner, with a massive queer-shaped cross of grey
      rough-hewn granite, guarded by four dark yew-trees. The spot was free from
      the pressure of the other graves, having a little box-hedged garden on the
      far side, and in front a goldening birch-tree. This oasis in the desert of
      conventional graves appealed to the aesthetic sense of Soames, and he sat
      down there in the sunshine. Through those trembling gold birch leaves he
      gazed out at London, and yielded to the waves of memory. He thought of
      Irene in Montpellier Square, when her hair was rusty-golden and her white
      shoulders his&mdash;Irene, the prize of his love-passion, resistant to his
      ownership. He saw Bosinney&rsquo;s body lying in that white mortuary, and
      Irene sitting on the sofa looking at space with the eyes of a dying bird.
      Again he thought of her by the little green Niobe in the Bois de Boulogne,
      once more rejecting him. His fancy took him on beside his drifting river
      on the November day when Fleur was to be born, took him to the dead leaves
      floating on the green-tinged water and the snake-headed weed for ever
      swaying and nosing, sinuous, blind, tethered. And on again to the window
      opened to the cold starry night above Hyde Park, with his father lying
      dead. His fancy darted to that picture of &ldquo;the future town,&rdquo;
      to that boy&rsquo;s and Fleur&rsquo;s first meeting; to the bluish trail
      of Prosper Profond&rsquo;s cigar, and Fleur in the window pointing down to
      where the fellow prowled. To the sight of Irene and that dead fellow
      sitting side by side in the stand at Lord&rsquo;s. To her and that boy at
      Robin Hill. To the sofa, where Fleur lay crushed up in the corner; to her
      lips pressed into his cheek, and her farewell &ldquo;Daddy.&rdquo; And
      suddenly he saw again Irene&rsquo;s grey-gloved hand waving its last
      gesture of release.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat there a long time dreaming his career, faithful to the scut of his
      possessive instinct, warming himself even with its failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Let&rdquo;&mdash;the Forsyte age and way of life, when a man
      owned his soul, his investments, and his woman, without check or question.
      And now the State had, or would have, his investments, his woman had
      herself, and God knew who had his soul. &ldquo;To Let&rdquo;&mdash;that
      sane and simple creed!
    </p>
    <p>
      The waters of change were foaming in, carrying the promise of new forms
      only when their destructive flood should have passed its full. He sat
      there, subconscious of them, but with his thoughts resolutely set on the
      past&mdash;as a man might ride into a wild night with his face to the tail
      of his galloping horse. Athwart the Victorian dykes the waters were
      rolling on property, manners, and morals, on melody and the old forms of
      art&mdash;waters bringing to his mouth a salt taste as of blood, lapping
      to the foot of this Highgate Hill where Victorianism lay buried. And
      sitting there, high up on its most individual spot, Soames&mdash;like a
      figure of Investment&mdash;refused their restless sounds. Instinctively he
      would not fight them&mdash;there was in him too much primeval wisdom, of
      Man the possessive animal. They would quiet down when they had fulfilled
      their tidal fever of dispossessing and destroying; when the creations and
      the properties of others were sufficiently broken and defected&mdash;they
      would lapse and ebb, and fresh forms would rise based on an instinct older
      than the fever of change&mdash;the instinct of Home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Je m&rsquo;en fiche,&rdquo; said Prosper Profond. Soames did not
      say &ldquo;Je m&rsquo;en fiche&rdquo;&mdash;it was French, and the fellow
      was a thorn in his side&mdash;but deep down he knew that change was only
      the interval of death between two forms of life, destruction necessary to
      make room for fresher property. What though the board was up, and cosiness
      to let?&mdash;some one would come along and take it again some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      And only one thing really troubled him, sitting there&mdash;the melancholy
      craving in his heart&mdash;because the sun was like enchantment on his
      face and on the clouds and on the golden birch leaves, and the wind&rsquo;s
      rustle was so gentle, and the yewtree green so dark, and the sickle of a
      moon pale in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might wish and wish and never get it&mdash;the beauty and the loving in
      the world!

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
