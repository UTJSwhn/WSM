    <h2>
      ACT I
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The SCENE is the pretty drawing-room of a flat. There are two doors, one
        open into the hall, the other shut and curtained. Through a large bay
        window, the curtains of which are not yet drawn, the towers of
        Westminster can be seen darkening in a summer sunset; a grand piano
        stands across one corner. The man-servant PAYNTER, clean-shaven and
        discreet, is arranging two tables for Bridge. BURNEY, the maid, a girl
        with one of those flowery Botticellian faces only met with in England,
        comes in through the curtained door, which she leaves open, disclosing
        the glimpse of a white wall. PAYNTER looks up at her; she shakes her
        head, with an expression of concern.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. Where's she gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      BURNEY. Just walks about, I fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. She and the Governor don't hit it! One of these days she'll flit&mdash;you'll
      see. I like her&mdash;she's a lady; but these thoroughbred 'uns&mdash;it's
      their skin and their mouths. They'll go till they drop if they like the
      job, and if they don't, it's nothing but jib&mdash;jib&mdash;jib. How was
      it down there before she married him?
    </p>
    <p>
      BURNEY. Oh! Quiet, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. Country homes&mdash;I know 'em. What's her father, the old
      Rector, like?
    </p>
    <p>
      BURNEY. Oh! very steady old man. The mother dead long before I took the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. Not a penny, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      BURNEY. [Shaking her head] No; and seven of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. [At sound of the hall door] The Governor!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        BURNEY withdraws through the curtained door. GEORGE DEDMOND enters from
        the hall. He is in evening dress, opera hat, and overcoat; his face is
        broad, comely, glossily shaved, but with neat moustaches. His eyes,
        clear, small, and blue-grey, have little speculation. His hair is well
        brushed.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      GEORGE. [Handing PAYNTER his coat and hat] Look here, Paynter! When I send
      up from the Club for my dress things, always put in a black waistcoat as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. I asked the mistress, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. In future&mdash;see?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. Yes, sir. [Signing towards the window] Shall I leave the sunset,
      sir?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        But GEORGE has crossed to the curtained door; he opens it and says:
        "Clare!" Receiving no answer, he goes in. PAYNTER switches up the
        electric light. His face, turned towards the curtained door, is
        apprehensive.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      GEORGE. [Re-entering] Where's Mrs. Dedmond?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. I hardly know, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Dined in?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. She had a mere nothing at seven, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Has she gone out, since?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. Yes, sir&mdash;that is, yes. The&mdash;er&mdash;mistress was not
      dressed at all. A little matter of fresh air, I think; sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. What time did my mother say they'd be here for Bridge?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. Sir Charles and Lady Dedmond were coming at half-past nine; and
      Captain Huntingdon, too&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Fullarton might be a bit late,
      sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. It's that now. Your mistress said nothing?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. Not to me, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Send Burney.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. Very good, sir. [He withdraws.]
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        GEORGE stares gloomily at the card tables. BURNEY comes in front the
        hall.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Did your mistress say anything before she went out?
    </p>
    <p>
      BURNEY. Yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      BURNEY. I don't think she meant it, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. I don't want to know what you don't think, I want the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      BURNEY. Yes, sir. The mistress said: "I hope it'll be a pleasant evening,
      Burney!"
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Oh!&mdash;Thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      BURNEY. I've put out the mistress's things, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      BURNEY. Thank you, sir. [She withdraws.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Damn!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He again goes to the curtained door, and passes through. PAYNTER, coming
        in from the hall, announces: "General Sir Charles and Lady Dedmond." SIR
        CHARLES is an upright, well-groomed, grey-moustached, red-faced man of
        sixty-seven, with a keen eye for molehills, and none at all for
        mountains. LADY DEDMOND has a firm, thin face, full of capability and
        decision, not without kindliness; and faintly weathered, as if she had
        faced many situations in many parts of the world. She is fifty five.
        PAYNTER withdraws.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Hullo! Where are they? H'm!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As he speaks, GEORGE re-enters.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. [Kissing her son] Well, George. Where's Clare?
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Afraid she's late.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Are we early?
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. As a matter of fact, she's not in.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Oh?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. H'm! Not&mdash;not had a rumpus?
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Not particularly. [With the first real sign of feeling] What I
      can't stand is being made a fool of before other people. Ordinary friction
      one can put up with. But that&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Gone out on purpose? What!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. What was the trouble?
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. I told her this morning you were coming in to Bridge. Appears
      she'd asked that fellow Malise, for music.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Without letting you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. I believe she did tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. But surely&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. I don't want to discuss it. There's never anything in particular.
      We're all anyhow, as you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. I see. [She looks shrewdly at her son] My dear, I should be
      rather careful about him, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Who's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. That Mr. Malise.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Oh! That chap!
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Clare isn't that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. I know. But she catches up notions very easily. I think it's
      a great pity you ever came across him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Where did you pick him up?
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Italy&mdash;this Spring&mdash;some place or other where they
      couldn't speak English.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Um! That's the worst of travellin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. I think you ought to have dropped him. These literary people&mdash;-[Quietly]
      From exchanging ideas to something else, isn't very far, George.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. We'll make him play Bridge. Do him good, if he's that sort of
      fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Is anyone else coming?
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Reggie Huntingdon, and the Fullartons.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. [Softly] You know, my dear boy, I've been meaning to speak
      to you for a long time. It is such a pity you and Clare&mdash;What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. God knows! I try, and I believe she does.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. It's distressin'&mdash;for us, you know, my dear fellow&mdash;
      distressin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. I know it's been going on for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Oh! leave it alone, mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. But, George, I'm afraid this man has brought it to a point&mdash;put
      ideas into her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. You can't dislike him more than I do. But there's nothing one can
      object to.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Could Reggie Huntingdon do anything, now he's home? Brothers
      sometimes&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. I can't bear my affairs being messed about&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Well! it would be better for you and Clare to be supposed to
      be out together, than for her to be out alone. Go quietly into the
      dining-room and wait for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Good! Leave your mother to make up something. She'll do it!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. That may be he. Quick!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [A bell sounds.] GEORGE goes out into the hall, leaving the door open in
        his haste. LADY DEDMOND, following, calls "Paynter!" PAYNTER enters.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Don't say anything about your master and mistress being out.
      I'll explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. The master, my lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Yes, I know. But you needn't say so. Do you understand?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAYNTER. [In polite dudgeon] Just so, my lady.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. By Jove! That fellow smells a rat!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Be careful, Charles!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. I should think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. I shall simply say they're dining out, and that we're not to
      wait Bridge for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. [Listening] He's having a palaver with that man of George's.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        PAYNTER, reappearing, announces: "Captain Huntingdon." SIR CHARLES and
        LADY DEDMOND turn to him with relief.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Ah! It's you, Reginald!
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. [A tall, fair soldier, of thirty] How d'you do? How are you,
      sir? What's the matter with their man?
    </p>
    <p>
      SHE CHARLES. What!
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. I was going into the dining-room to get rid of my cigar; and
      he said: "Not in there, sir. The master's there, but my instructions are
      to the effect that he's not."
    </p>
    <p>
      SHE CHARLES. I knew that fellow&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. The fact is, Reginald, Clare's out, and George is waiting
      for her. It's so important people shouldn't&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Rather!
    </p>

    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. It's getting serious, Reginald. I don't know what's to
      become of them. You don't think the Rector&mdash;you don't think your
      father would speak to Clare?
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Afraid the Governor's hardly well enough. He takes anything of
      that sort to heart so&mdash;especially Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Can't you put in a word yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Don't know where the mischief lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. I'm sure George doesn't gallop her on the road. Very
      steady-goin' fellow, old George.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Oh, yes; George is all right, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. They ought to have had children.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Expect they're pretty glad now they haven't. I really don't
      know what to say, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Saving your presence, you know, Reginald, I've often noticed
      parsons' daughters grow up queer. Get too much morality and rice puddin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. [With a clear look] Charles!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. What was she like when you were kids?
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Oh, all right. Could be rather a little devil, of course, when
      her monkey was up.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. I'm fond of her. Nothing she wants that she hasn't got, is
      there?
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Never heard her say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. [Dimly] I don't know whether old George is a bit too matter
      of fact for her. H'm?
    </p>

      <p>
        [A short silence.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. There's a Mr. Malise coming here to-night. I forget if you
      know him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Yes. Rather a thorough-bred mongrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. He's literary. [With hesitation] You&mdash;you don't think
      he&mdash;puts&mdash;er&mdash;ideas into her head?
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. I asked Greyman, the novelist, about him; seems he's a bit of
      an Ishmaelite, even among those fellows. Can't see Clare&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. No. Only, the great thing is that she shouldn't be
      encouraged. Listen!&mdash;It is her-coming in. I can hear their voices.
      Gone to her room. What a blessing that man isn't here yet! [The door bell
      rings] Tt! There he is, I expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. What are we goin' to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Say they're dining out, and we're not to wait Bridge for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Good!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The door is opened, and PAYNTER announces "Mr. Kenneth Malise." MALISE
        enters. He is a tall man, about thirty-five, with a strongly marked,
        dark, irregular, ironic face, and eyes which seem to have needles in
        their pupils. His thick hair is rather untidy, and his dress clothes not
        too new.

      They'll be here directly.

    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. We've met, I think.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He gives MALISE that peculiar smiling stare, which seems to warn the
        person bowed to of the sort of person he is. MALISE'S eyes sparkle.

    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Clare will be so grieved. One of those invitations
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. On the spur of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. You play Bridge, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Afraid not!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Don't mean that? Then we shall have to wait for 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. I forget, Mr. Malise&mdash;you write, don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Such is my weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Delightful profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Doesn't tie you! What!
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Only by the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. I'm always thinkin' of writin' my experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Indeed!

      [There is the sound of a door banged.]
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. [Hastily] You smoke, Mr. MALISE?
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Ah! Must smoke when you think a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Or think when you smoke a lot.

    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. [Genially] Don't know that I find that.

        lips, and large grey mesmeric eyes, one of those women all vibration,
        iced over with a trained stoicism of voice and manner.

      SIR CHARLES. Deuce you did! [An awkward pause.]
    </p>

      LADY DEDMOND. [Acidly] Mr. Malise doesn't play Bridge, it appears. Afraid
      we shall be rather in the way of music.

    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. What! Aren't we goin' to get a game? [PAYNTER has entered
      with a tray.]

    <p>
      MALISE. Never apologize for being fey. It's much too rare.

    <p>
      CLARE. On the door-mat! And they'd whitewashed me so beautifully! Poor
      dears! I wonder if I ought&mdash;&mdash;[She looks towards the door.]

      MALISE. Don't spoil it!

      CLARE. I'd been walking up and down the Embankment for about three hours.
      One does get desperate sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Thank God for that!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Only makes it worse afterwards. It seems so frightful to them, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. [Softly and suddenly, but with a difficulty in finding the right
      words] Blessed be the respectable! May they dream of&mdash;me! And blessed
      be all men of the world! May they perish of a surfeit of&mdash;good form!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I like that. Oh, won't there be a row! [With a faint movement of
      her shoulders] And the usual reconciliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Mrs. Dedmond, there's a whole world outside yours. Why don't you
      spread your wings?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. My dear father's a saint, and he's getting old and frail; and I've
      got a sister engaged; and three little sisters to whom I'm supposed to set
      a good example. Then, I've no money, and I can't do anything for a living,
      except serve in a shop. I shouldn't be free, either; so what's the good?
      Besides, I oughtn't to have married if I wasn't going to be happy. You
      see, I'm not a bit misunderstood or ill-treated. It's only&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      CLARE. [Going to the piano] I'm awfully grateful to you. You don't make me
      feel just an attractive female. I wanted somebody like that. [Letting her
      hands rest on the notes] All the same, I'm glad not to be ugly.

      so wrong that you can't exchange a single real thought; that your blood
      runs cold when she kisses you&mdash;then you'll know.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. My dear old girl, I don't want to be a brute; but it's a bit
      difficult to believe in that, except in novels.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Yes, incredible, when you haven't tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. I mean, you&mdash;you chose him yourself. No one forced you to
      marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. It does seem monstrous, doesn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. My dear child, do give us a reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Look! [She points out at the night and the darkening towers] If
      George saw that for the first time he'd just say, "Ah, Westminster! Clock
      Tower! Can you see the time by it?" As if one cared where or what it was&mdash;beautiful
      like that! Apply that to every &mdash;every&mdash;everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. [Staring] George may be a bit prosaic. But, my dear old girl,
      if that's all&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. It's not all&mdash;it's nothing. I can't explain, Reggie&mdash;it's
      not reason, at all; it's&mdash;it's like being underground in a damp cell;
      it's like knowing you'll never get out. Nothing coming&mdash;never
      anything coming again-never anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. [Moved and puzzled] My dear old thing; you mustn't get into
      fantods like this. If it's like that, don't think about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. When every day and every night!&mdash;Oh! I know it's my fault for
      having married him, but that doesn't help.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Look here! It's not as if George wasn't quite a decent chap.
      And it's no use blinking things; you are absolutely dependent on him. At
      home they've got every bit as much as they can do to keep going.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. And you've got to think of the girls. Any trouble would be
      very beastly for them. And the poor old Governor would feel it awfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. If I didn't know all that, Reggie, I should have gone home long
      ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Well, what's to be done? If my pay would run to it&mdash;but
      it simply won't.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Thanks, old boy, of course not.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Can't you try to see George's side of it a bit?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I do. Oh! don't let's talk about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Well, my child, there's just one thing you won't go sailing
      near the wind, will you? I mean, there are fellows always on the lookout.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. "That chap, Malise, you'd better avoid him!" Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Well! I don't know him. He may be all right, but he's not our
      sort. And you're too pretty to go on the tack of the New Woman and that
      kind of thing&mdash;haven't been brought up to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. British home-made summer goods, light and attractive&mdash;don't
      wear long. [At the sound of voices in the hall] They seem 'to be going,
      Reggie.

      weren't enough!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Is it worth while to rag me? I know I've behaved badly, but I
      couldn't help it, really!
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Couldn't help behaving like a shop-girl? My God! You were brought
      up as well as I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Alas!
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. To let everybody see that we don't get on&mdash;there's only one
      word for it&mdash;Disgusting!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I know.
    </p>
    <p>

      name do you behave in this crazy way?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I'm sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. [With intense feeling] You like making a fool of me!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. No&mdash;Really! Only&mdash;I must break out sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. There are things one does not do.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I came in because I was sorry.
    </p>

      rows.
    </p>

      GEORGE. Pish!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Five years, and four of them like this! I'm sure we've served our
      time. Don't you really think we might get on better together&mdash;if I
      went away?
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. I've told you I won't stand a separation for no real reason, and
      have your name bandied about all over London. I have some primitive sense
      of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. You mean your name, don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Look here. Did that fellow Malise put all this into your head?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. No; my own evil nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. I wish the deuce we'd never met him. Comes of picking up people
      you know nothing of. I distrust him&mdash;and his looks&mdash;and his
      infernal satiric way. He can't even 'dress decently. He's not&mdash;good
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [With a touch of rapture] Ah-h!
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Why do you let him come? What d'you find interesting in him?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. A mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Deuced funny one! To have a mind&mdash;as you call it&mdash;it's
      not necessary to talk about Art and Literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. We don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Then what do you talk about&mdash;your minds? [CLARE looks at him]
      Will you answer a straight question? Is he falling in love with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. You had better ask him.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. I tell you plainly, as a man of the world, I don't believe in the
      guide, philosopher and friend business.

    <p>

    <p>
      GEORGE. It will never be done by you&mdash;understand that!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. It really is time we parted. I'd go clean out of your life. I don't
      want your support unless I'm giving you something for your money.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Once for all, I don't mean to allow you to make fools of us both.

    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I thought I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. The facts are that we're married&mdash;for better or worse, and
      certain things are expected of us. It's suicide for you, and folly for me,
      in my position, to ignore that. You have all you can reasonably want; and
      I don't&mdash;don't wish for any change. If you could bring anything
      against me&mdash;if I drank, or knocked about town, or expected too much
      of you. I'm not unreasonable in any way, that I can see.

    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Don't go like that! Do you suppose we're the only couple who've
      found things aren't what they thought, and have to put up with each other
      and make the best of it.

        contemplates the door. Moving forward, he rests his hand on the deserted
        card table, clutching its edge, and muttering. Then he crosses to the
        door into the hall and switches off the light. He opens the door to go
        out, then stands again irresolute in the darkness and heaves a heavy
        sigh. Suddenly he mutters: "No!" Crosses resolutely back to the
        curtained door, and opens it. In the gleam of light CLARE is standing,

      ACT II

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The scene is a large, whitewashed, disordered room, whose outer door
        opens on to a corridor and stairway. Doors on either side lead to other
        rooms. On the walls are unframed reproductions of fine pictures, secured
        with tintacks. An old wine-coloured armchair of low and comfortable
        appearance, near the centre of the room, is surrounded by a litter of
        manuscripts, books, ink, pens and newspapers, as though some one had
        already been up to his neck in labour, though by a grandfather's clock
        it is only eleven. On a smallish table close by, are sheets of paper,
        cigarette ends, and two claret bottles. There are many books on shelves,
        and on the floor, an overflowing pile, whereon rests a soft hat, and a
        black knobby stick. MALISE sits in his armchair, garbed in trousers,
        dressing-gown, and slippers, unshaved and uncollared, writing. He
        pauses, smiles, lights a cigarette, and tries the rhythm of the last
        sentence, holding up a sheet of quarto MS.

      MALISE. "Not a word, not a whisper of Liberty from all those excellent

      monumental silence of their profound deference before triumphant Tyranny."

      <p>
        While he speaks, a substantial woman, a little over middle-age, in old
        dark clothes and a black straw hat, enters from the corridor. She goes
        to a cupboard, brings out from it an apron and a Bissell broom. Her
        movements are slow and imperturbable, as if she had much time before
        her. Her face is broad and dark, with Chinese eyebrows.

      MRS. MILER. I see him first yesterday afternoon. I'd just been out to get
      meself a pennyworth o' soda, an' as I come in I passed 'im on the second
      floor, lookin' at me with an air of suspicion. I thought to meself at the
      time, I thought: You're a'andy sort of 'ang-dog man.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. Well-peekin' down through the balusters, I see 'im lookin' at
      a photograft. That's a funny place, I thinks, to look at pictures&mdash;it's
      so dark there, ye 'ave to use yer eyesight. So I giv' a scrape with me
      'eel [She illustrates] an' he pops it in his pocket, and puts up 'is 'and
      to knock at number three. I goes down an' I says: "You know there's no one
      lives there, don't yer?" "Ah!" 'e says with an air of innercence, "I wants
      the name of Smithers." "Oh!" I says, "try round the corner, number ten."
      "Ah!" 'e says tactful, "much obliged." "Yes," I says, "you'll find 'im in
      at this time o' day. Good evenin'!" And I thinks to meself [She closes one
      eye] Rats! There's a good many corners hereabouts.

    <p>
      MALISE. [With detached appreciation] Very good, Mrs. Miler.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. So this mornin', there e' was again on the first floor with
      'is 'and raised, pretendin' to knock at number two. "Oh! you're still
      lookin' for 'im?" I says, lettin' him see I was 'is grandmother. "Ah!" 'e
      says, affable, "you misdirected me; it's here I've got my business."
      "That's lucky," I says, "cos nobody lives there neither. Good mornin'!"
      And I come straight up. If you want to see 'im at work you've only to go
      downstairs, 'e'll be on the ground floor by now, pretendin' to knock at
      number one. Wonderful resource!
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. What's he like, this gentleman?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. Just like the men you see on the front page o' the daily
      papers. Nasty, smooth-lookin' feller, with one o' them billycock hats you
      can't abide.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Isn't he a dun?

      MRS. MILER. They don't be'ave like that; you ought to know, sir. He's
      after no good. [Then, after a little pause] Ain't he to be put a stop to?
      If I took me time I could get 'im, innercent-like, with a jug o' water.

        gazes round her, pins up her skirt, sits down in the armchair, takes off
        her hat and puts it on the table, and slowly rolls up her sleeves; then
        with her hands on her knees she rests. There is a soft knock on the
        door. She gets up leisurely and moves flat-footed towards it. The door
        being opened CLARE is revealed.

    <p>
      CLARE. Is Mr. Malise in?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. Yes. But 'e's dressin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Oh.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. Won't take 'im long. What name?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Would you say&mdash;a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. It's against the rules. But if you'll sit down a moment I'll
      see what I can do. [She brings forward a chair and rubs it with her apron.
      Then goes to the door of the inner room and speaks through it] A lady to
      see you. [Returning she removes some cigarette ends] This is my hour. I
      shan't make much dust. [Noting CLARE's eyebrows raised at the debris round
      the armchair] I'm particular about not disturbin' things.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I'm sure you are.

        light; finding it empty, she turns it upside down and drops it into the
        wastepaper basket; then, holding up the other bottle, and finding it not
        empty, she corks it and drops it into the fold of her skirt.

      MALISE. Jolly of you to come. Can I do anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I want advice-badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. What! Spreading your wings?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Ah! Proud to have given you that advice. When?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. The morning after you gave it me...
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I went down to my people. I knew it would hurt my Dad frightfully,
      but somehow I thought I could make him see. No good. He was awfully sweet,
      only&mdash;he couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. [Softly] We English love liberty in those who don't belong to us.
      Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. It was horrible. There were the children&mdash;and my old nurse. I
      could never live at home now. They'd think I was&mdash;&mdash;. Impossible
      &mdash;utterly! I'd made up my mind to go back to my owner&mdash;And then&mdash;
      he came down himself. I couldn't d it. To be hauled back and begin all
      over again; I simply couldn't. I watched for a chance; and ran to the
      station, and came up to an hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Bravo!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I don't know&mdash;no pluck this morning! You see, I've got to earn
      my living&mdash;no money; only a few things I can sell. All yesterday I
      was walking about, looking at the women. How does anyone ever get a
      chance?
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Sooner than you should hurt his dignity by working, your husband
      would pension you off.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. If I don't go back to him I couldn't take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Good!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I've thought of nursing, but it's a long training, and I do so hate
      watching pain. The fact is, I'm pretty hopeless; can't even do art work. I
      came to ask you about the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Have you ever acted? [CLARE shakes her head] You mightn't think
      so, but I've heard there's a prejudice in favour of training. There's
      Chorus&mdash;I don't recommend it. How about your brother?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. My brother's got nothing to spare, and he wants to get married; and
      he's going back to India in September. The only friend I should care to
      bother is Mrs. Fullarton, and she's&mdash;got a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. I remember the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Besides, I should be besieged day and night to go back. I must lie
      doggo somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. It makes my blood boil to think of women like you. God help all
      ladies without money.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I expect I shall have to go back.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. No, no! We shall find something. Keep your soul alive at all
      costs. What! let him hang on to you till you're nothing but&mdash;
      emptiness and ache, till you lose even the power to ache. Sit in his
      drawing-room, pay calls, play Bridge, go out with him to dinners, return
      to&mdash;duty; and feel less and less, and be less and less, and so grow
      old and&mdash;die!

      CLARE. Yes. Why?

    <p>
      MALISE. He's begun to haunt them, I'm told.

    <p>
      CLARE. Oh! But that would mean they thought I&mdash;oh! no!

    <p>
      CLARE. Spying!

      TWISDEN. Mr. Malise? How do you do, Mrs. Dedmond? Had the pleasure of

    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. [Suddenly] What!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Mr. Twisden, will you&mdash;&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. [Uneasy] Mrs. Dedmond I must apologize, but you&mdash;you hardly
      gave us an alternative, did you? [He pauses for an answer, and, not
      getting one, goes on] Your disappearance has given your husband great
      anxiety. Really, my dear madam, you must forgive us for this&mdash;attempt
      to get into communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Why did you spy, HERE?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. No, no! Nobody's spied on you. What!
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. I'm afraid the answer is that we appear to have been justified.
      [At the expression on CLARE'S face he goes on hastily] Now, Mrs. Dedmond,
      I'm a lawyer and I know that appearances are misleading. Don't think I'm
      unfriendly; I wish you well. [CLARE raises her eyes. Moved by that look,
      which is exactly as if she had said: "I have no friends," he hurries on]
      What we want to say to you is this: Don't let this split go on! Don't
      commit yourself to what you'll bitterly regret. Just tell us what's the
      matter. I'm sure it can be put straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I have nothing against my husband&mdash;it was quite unreasonable
      to leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. Come, that's good.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Unfortunately, there's something stronger than reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. I don't know it, Mrs. Dedmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. No?
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. [Disconcerted] Are you&mdash;you oughtn't to take a step without
      advice, in your position.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Nor with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. [Approaching her] Come, now; isn't there anything you feel you'd
      like to say&mdash;that might help to put matters straight?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I don't think so, thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. You must see, Clare, that&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. In your position, Mrs. Dedmond&mdash;a beautiful young woman
      without money. I'm quite blunt. This is a hard world. Should be awfully
      sorry if anything goes wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. And if I go back?
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. Of two evils, if it be so&mdash;choose the least!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I am twenty-six; he is thirty-two. We can't reasonably expect to
      die for fifty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DESMOND. That's morbid, Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. What's open to you if you don't go back? Come, what's your
      position? Neither fish, flesh, nor fowl; fair game for everybody. Believe
      me, Mrs. Dedmond, for a pretty woman to strike, as it appears you're
      doing, simply because the spirit of her marriage has taken flight, is
      madness. You must know that no one pays attention to anything but facts.
      If now&mdash;excuse me&mdash;you&mdash;you had a lover, [His eyes travel
      round the room and again rest on her] you would, at all events, have some
      ground under your feet, some sort of protection, but [He pauses] as you
      have not&mdash;you've none.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Except what I make myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. Good God!
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. Yes! Mrs. Dedmond! There's the bedrock difficulty. As you haven't
      money, you should never have been pretty. You're up against the world, and
      you'll get no mercy from it. We lawyers see too much of that. I'm putting
      it brutally, as a man of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Thank you. Do you think you quite grasp the alternative?
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. [Taken aback] But, my dear young lady, there are two sides to
      every contract. After all, your husband's fulfilled his.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. So have I up till now. I shan't ask anything from him&mdash;
      nothing&mdash;do you understand?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. But, my dear, you must live.
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. Have you ever done any sort of work?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. Any conception of the competition nowadays?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I can try.
    </p>

      see!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. But, my dear girl, what the devil's to become of George?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. He can do what he likes&mdash;it's nothing to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. Mrs. Dedmond, I say without hesitation you've no notion of what
      you're faced with, brought up to a sheltered life as you've been. Do
      realize that you stand at the parting of the ways, and one leads into the
      wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Which?
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. [Glancing at the door through which MALISE has gone] Of course,
      if you want to play at wild asses there are plenty who will help you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. By Gad! Yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I only want to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. Mrs. Dedmond, go back! You can now. It will be too late soon.
      There are lots of wolves about. [Again he looks at the door]
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. But not where you think. You say I need advice. I came here for it.
    </p>

      TWISDEN. [With a curiously expressive shrug] In that case I don't know
      that I can usefully stay.

      CLARE. I came to Mr. Malise because he's the only person I know with
      imagination enough to see what my position is; I came to him a quarter of
      an hour ago, for the first time, for definite advice, and you instantly
      suspect him. That is disgusting.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. [Frigidly] Is this the natural place for me to find my son's
      wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. His woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Will you listen to Reginald?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I have.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Haven't you any religious sense at all, Clare?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. None, if it's religion to live as we do.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. It's terrible&mdash;this state of mind! It's really
      terrible!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        CLARE breaks into the soft laugh of the other evening. As if galvanized
        by the sound, SIR CHARLES comes to life out of the transfixed
        bewilderment with which he has been listening.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. For God's sake don't laugh like that!

    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. [With real feeling] For the sake of the simple right, Clare!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Right? Whatever else is right&mdash;our life is not. [She puts her
      hand on her heart] I swear before God that I've tried and tried. I swear
      before God, that if I believed we could ever again love each other only a
      little tiny bit, I'd go back. I swear before God that I don't want to hurt
      anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. But you are hurting everybody. Do&mdash;do be reasonable!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Losing control] Can't you see that I'm fighting for all my life to
      come&mdash;not to be buried alive&mdash;not to be slowly smothered. Look
      at me! I'm not wax&mdash;I'm flesh and blood. And you want to prison me
      for ever&mdash;body and soul.

      SIR CHARLES. [Suddenly] By Jove! I don't know, I don't know! What!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. [To MALISE] If you have any decency left, sir, you will
      allow my son, at all events, to speak to his wife alone. [Beckoning to her
      husband] We'll wait below.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR CHARLES. I&mdash;I want to speak. [To CLARE] My dear, if you feel like
      this, I can only say&mdash;as a&mdash;as a gentleman&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY DEDMOND. Charles!
    </p>

      that I can say anything!

    <p>
      GEORGE. [Going up to CLARE, who has recovered all her self-control] Will
      you come outside and speak to me?

    <p>
      CLARE. No.
    </p>

      GEORGE. [In a low voice] Clare!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Well!
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. You try me pretty high, don't you, forcing me to come here, and
      speak before this fellow? Most men would think the worst, finding you like
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. You need not have come&mdash;or thought at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Did you imagine I was going to let you vanish without an effort&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. To save me?
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. For God's sake be just! I've come here to say certain things. If
      you force me to say them before him&mdash;on your head be it! Will you
      appoint somewhere else?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I know all those "certain things." "You must come back. It is your
      duty. You have no money. Your friends won't help you. You can't earn your
      living. You are making a scandal." You might even say for the moment:
      "Your room shall be respected."
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Well, it's true and you've no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Oh! [Suddenly] Our life's a lie. It's stupid; it's disgusting. I'm
      tired of it! Please leave me alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. You rather miss the point, I'm afraid. I didn't come here to tell
      you what you know perfectly well when you're sane. I came here to say
      this: Anyone in her senses could see the game your friend here is playing.
      It wouldn't take a baby in. If you think that a gentleman like that [His
      stare travels round the dishevelled room till it rests on MALISE]
      champions a pretty woman for nothing, you make a fairly bad mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Take care.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

        rigid.

    <p>
      GEORGE. I don't pretend to be subtle or that kind of thing; but I have
      ordinary common sense. I don't attempt to be superior to plain facts&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Under her breath] Facts!
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Oh! for goodness' sake drop that hifalutin' tone. It doesn't suit
      you. Look here! If you like to go abroad with one of your young sisters
      until the autumn, I'll let the flat and go to the Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Put the fire out with a penny hose. [Slowly] I am not coming back
      to you, George. The farce is over.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. [Taken aback for a moment by the finality of her tone, suddenly
      fronts MALISE] Then there is something between you and this fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. [Dangerously, but without moving] I beg your pardon!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. There&mdash;is&mdash;nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. [Looking from one to the other] At all events, I won't&mdash;I
      won't see a woman who once&mdash;[CLARE makes a sudden effacing movement
      with her hands] I won't see her go to certain ruin without lifting a
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. That is noble.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. [With intensity] I don't know that you deserve anything of me. But
      on my honour, as a gentleman, I came here this morning for your sake, to
      warn you of what you're doing. [He turns suddenly on MALISE] And I tell
      this precious friend of yours plainly what I think of him, and that I'm
      not going to play into his hands.

    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. I will go when you do.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. A man of the world should know better than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Are you coming?
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. That is inconceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. I'm not speaking to you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. You are right. Your words and mine will never kiss each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. Will you come? [CLARE shakes her head]
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. [With fury] D'you mean to stay in this pigsty with that
      rhapsodical swine?
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. [Transformed] By God, if you don't go, I'll kill you.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE. [As suddenly calm] That remains to be seen.

    <p>

      you've not returned home by three o'clock I'll divorce you, and you may
      roll in the gutter with this high-souled friend of yours. And mind this,
      you sir&mdash;I won't spare you&mdash;by God! Your pocket shall suffer.
      That's the only thing that touches fellows like you.

        She turns away, shuddering, and sits down on the edge of the armchair,
        covering her eyes with the backs of her hands. MALISE picks up the
        stick, and fingers it lovingly. Then putting it down, he moves so that
        he can see her face. She is sitting quite still, staring straight before
        her.

      stillness] Into that! alone&mdash;helpless&mdash;without money. The men
      who work with you; the men you make friends of&mdash;d'you think they'll
      let you be? The men in the streets, staring at you, stopping you&mdash;pudgy,
      bull-necked brutes; devils with hard eyes; senile swine; and the
      "chivalrous" men, like me, who don't mean you harm, but can't help seeing
      you're made for love! Or suppose you don't take covert but struggle on in
      the open. Society! The respectable! The pious! Even those who love you!
      Will they let you be? Hue and cry! The hunt was joined the moment you
      broke away! It will never let up! Covert to covert&mdash;till they've run
      you down, and you're back in the cart, and God pity you!

        MALISE'S sitting-room. An afternoon, three months later. On the table
        are an open bottle of claret, his hat, and some tea-things. Down in the
        hearth is a kettle on a lighted spirit-stand. Near the door stands
        HAYWOOD, a short, round-faced man, with a tobacco-coloured moustache;
        MALISE, by the table, is contemplating a piece of blue paper.

      without any return on your money&mdash;&mdash;

      MALISE. Your tobacco is too good, Mr. Haywood. I wish I could see my way
      to smoking another.

    <p>
      MALISE. This is a very fine unexpurgated translation of Boccaccio's
      "Decameron," Mr. Haywood illustrated. I should say you would get more than
      the amount of your bill for them.

    <p>
      HAYWOOD. [Shaking his head] Them books worth three pound seven!

      No, Sir, I don't think I'd like to 'ave to do with that.

      HAYWOOD. [Brought to his bearings] No, Sir, I couldn't.

    <p>
      MALISE. On the contrary.

        Doubtfully HAYWOOD goes. And MALISE stands scratching his head; then

    <p>
      MALISE. Yes, Mr. Haywood?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAYWOOD. About that little matter, sir. If&mdash;if it's any convenience
      to you&mdash;I've&mdash;thought of a place where I could&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Read them? You'll enjoy them thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAYWOOD. No, sir, no! Where I can dispose of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. [Holding out the volumes] It might be as well. [HAYWOOD takes the
      books gingerly] I congratulate you, Mr. Haywood; it's a classic.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAYWOOD. Oh, indeed&mdash;yes, sir. In the event of there being any&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Anything over? Carry it to my credit. Your bill&mdash;[He hands
      over the blue paper] Send me the receipt. Good evening!

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        HAYWOOD, nonplussed, and trying to hide the books in an evening paper,
        fumbles out. "Good evenin', sir!" and departs. MALISE again takes up the
        sheets of MS. and cons a sentence over to himself, gazing blankly at the
        stolid BOY.

    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Some mistake. There is one, I believe, on the first floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. It's about my sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. D&mdash;n you! Don't you know that I've been shadowed these last
      three months? Ask your detectives for any information you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. We know that you haven't seen her, or even known where she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Indeed! You've found that out? Brilliant!
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. We know it from my sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Oh! So you've tracked her down?
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Mrs. Fullarton came across her yesterday in one of those big
      shops&mdash;selling gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Mrs. Fullarton the lady with the husband. Well! you've got her.
      Clap her back into prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. We have not got her. She left at once, and we don't know where
      she's gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Bravo!
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. [Taking hold of his bit] Look here, Mr. Malise, in a way I
      share your feeling, but I'm fond of my sister, and it's damnable to have
      to go back to India knowing she must be all adrift, without protection,
      going through God knows what! Mrs. Fullarton says she's looking awfully
      pale and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. [Struggling between resentment and sympathy] Why do you come to
      me?
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. We thought&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Who?
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. My&mdash;my father and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. We thought there was just a chance that, having lost that job,
      she might come to you again for advice. If she does, it would be really
      generous of you if you'd put my father in touch with her. He's getting
      old, and he feels this very much. [He hands MALISE a card] This is his
      address.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. [Twisting the card] Let there be no mistake, sir; I do nothing
      that will help give her back to her husband. She's out to save her soul
      alive, and I don't join the hue and cry that's after her. On the contrary&mdash;if
      I had the power. If your father wants to shelter her, that's another
      matter. But she'd her own ideas about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Perhaps you don't realize how unfit my sister is for rough and
      tumble. She's not one of this new sort of woman. She's always been looked
      after, and had things done for her. Pluck she's got, but that's all, and
      she's bound to come to grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Very likely&mdash;the first birds do. But if she drops half-way
      it's better than if she'd never flown. Your sister, sir, is trying the
      wings of her spirit, out of the old slave market. For women as for men,
      there's more than one kind of dishonour, Captain Huntingdon, and worse
      things than being dead, as you may know in your profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. Admitted&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. We each have our own views as to what they are. But they all come
      to&mdash;death of our spirits, for the sake of our carcases. Anything
      more?
    </p>
    <p>
      HUNTINGDON. My leave's up. I sail to-morrow. If you do see my sister I
      trust you to give her my love and say I begged she would see my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. If I have the chance&mdash;yes.

        doorway he shies violently at the figure of CLARE, standing there in a
        dark-coloured dress, skids past her and goes. CLARE comes into the gleam
        of sunlight, her white face alive with emotion or excitement. She looks
        round her, smiles, sighs; goes swiftly to the door, closes it, and comes
        back to the table. There she stands, fingering the papers on the table,
        smoothing MALISE's hat wistfully, eagerly, waiting.

    <p>
      MALISE. Your brother. You only just missed him. [CLARE starts up] They had
      an idea you'd come. He's sailing to-morrow&mdash;he wants you to see your
      father.

    <p>
      MALI$E. Anxious about you.

    <p>
      CLARE. My nerves have gone funny lately. It's being always on one's guard,
      and stuffy air, and feeling people look and talk about you, and dislike
      your being there.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Yes; that wants pluck.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Shaking her head] I curl up all the time. The only thing I know
      for certain is, that I shall never go back to him. The more I've hated
      what I've been doing, the more sure I've been. I might come to anything&mdash;but
      not that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Had a very bad time?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Nodding] I'm spoilt. It's a curse to be a lady when you have to
      earn your living. It's not really been so hard, I suppose; I've been
      selling things, and living about twice as well as most shop girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Were they decent to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Lots of the girls are really nice. But somehow they don't want me,
      can't help thinking I've got airs or something; and in here [She touches
      her breast] I don't want them!
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Mrs. Fullarton and I used to belong to a society for helping
      reduced gentlewomen to get work. I know now what they want: enough money
      not to work&mdash;that's all! [Suddenly looking up at him] Don't think me
      worse than I am-please! It's working under people; it's having to do it,
      being driven. I have tried, I've not been altogether a coward, really! But
      every morning getting there the same time; every day the same stale
      "dinner," as they call it; every evening the same "Good evening, Miss
      Clare," "Good evening, Miss Simpson," "Good evening, Miss Hart," "Good
      evening, Miss Clare." And the same walk home, or the same 'bus; and the
      same men that you mustn't look at, for fear they'll follow you. [She
      rises] Oh! and the feeling-always, always&mdash;that there's no sun, or
      life, or hope, or anything. It was just like being ill, the way I've
      wanted to ride and dance and get out into the country. [Her excitement
      dies away into the old clipped composure, and she sits down again] Don't
      think too badly of me&mdash;it really is pretty ghastly!
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. [Gruffly] H'm! Why a shop?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. References. I didn't want to tell more lies than I could help; a
      married woman on strike can't tell the truth, you know. And I can't
      typewrite or do shorthand yet. And chorus&mdash;I thought&mdash;you
      wouldn't like.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. I? What have I&mdash;&mdash;? [He checks himself ] Have men been
      brutes?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Stealing a look at him] One followed me a lot. He caught hold of
      my arm one evening. I just took this out [She draws out her hatpin and
      holds it like a dagger, her lip drawn back as the lips of a dog going to
      bite] and said: "Will you leave me alone, please?" And he did. It was
      rather nice. And there was one quite decent little man in the shop&mdash;I
      was sorry for him&mdash;such a humble little man!
    </p>

      MALISE. Poor devil&mdash;it's hard not to wish for the moon.

      CLARE. [Softly] How have you been? Working very hard?

    <p>
      MALISE. As hard as God will let me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Stealing another look] Have you any typewriting I could do? I
      could learn, and I've still got a brooch I could sell. Which is the best
      kind?

      suppose.

    <p>
      SCENE II&mdash;The same, early on a winter afternoon, three months later.
      The room has now a certain daintiness. There are curtains over the doors,
      a couch, under the window, all the books are arranged on shelves. In small
      vases, over the fireplace, are a few violets and chrysanthemums. MALISE
      sits huddled in his armchair drawn close to the fore, paper on knee, pen
      in hand. He looks rather grey and drawn, and round his chair is the usual
      litter. At the table, now nearer to the window, CLARE sits working a
      typewriter. She finishes a line, puts sheets of paper together, makes a
      note on a card&mdash;adds some figures, and marks the total.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Kenneth, when this is paid, I shall have made two pound seventeen
      in the three months, and saved you about three pounds. One hundred and
      seventeen shillings at tenpence a thousand is one hundred and forty
      thousand words at fourteen hundred words an hour. It's only just over an
      hour a day. Can't you get me more?
    </p>

      my poor old Dad, I don't care a bit.

      CLARE. But you told me yourself
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. I lied.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. [Shrugging] No use lying any longer&mdash;you'd know it tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. How much am I valued at?
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Two thousand. [Grimly] He'll settle it on you. [He laughs]
      Masterly! By one stroke, destroys his enemy, avenges his "honour," and
      gilds his name with generosity!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Will you have to pay?
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Stones yield no blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Can't you borrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. I couldn't even get the costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Will they make you bankrupt, then? [MALISE nods] But that doesn't
      mean that you won't have your income, does it? [MALISE laughs] What is
      your income, Kenneth? [He is silent] A hundred and fifty from "The
      Watchfire," I know. What else?
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Out of five books I have made the sum of forty pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. What else? Tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALISE. Fifty to a hundred pounds a year. Leave me to gnaw my way out,
      child.

    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. [Her hands twisting very fast] Well, it's to do with this 'ere
      "Watchfire." One of the men that sees to the writin' of it 'e's an old
      friend of Mr. Malise, 'e come 'ere this mornin' when you was out. I was
      doin' my work in there [She points to the room on the right] an' the door
      open, so I 'earl 'em. Now you've 'ung them curtains, you can't 'elp it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. It's about your divorce case. This 'ere "Watchfire," ye see,
      belongs to some fellers that won't 'ave their men gettin' into the papers.
      So this 'ere friend of Mr. Malise&mdash;very nice 'e spoke about it: "If
      it comes into Court," 'e says, "you'll 'ave to go," 'e says. "These
      beggars, these dogs, these dogs," 'e says, "they'll 'oof you out," 'e
      says. An' I could tell by the sound of his voice, 'e meant it&mdash;proper
      upset 'e was. So that's that!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. It's inhuman!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. That's what I thinks; but it don't 'elp, do it? "'Tain't the
      circulation," 'e says, "it's the principle," 'e says; and then 'e starts
      in swearin' horrible. 'E's a very nice man. And Mr. Malise, 'e says:
      "Well, that about does for me!" 'e says.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Thank you, Mrs. Miler&mdash;I'm glad to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. Yes; I don't know as I ought to 'ave told you. [Desperately
      uncomfortable] You see, I don't take notice of Mr. MALISE, but I know 'im
      very well. 'E's a good 'arted gentleman, very funny, that'll do things to
      help others, and what's more, keep on doin' 'em, when they hurt 'im; very
      obstinate 'e is. Now, when you first come 'ere, three months ago, I says
      to meself: "He'll enjoy this 'ere for a bit, but she's too much of a lady
      for 'im." What 'e wants about 'im permanent is a woman that thinks an'
      talks about all them things he talks about. And sometimes I fancy 'e don't
      want nothin' permanent about 'im at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Don't!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. [With another sudden sniff] Gawd knows I don't want to upset
      ye. You're situated very hard; an' women's got no business to 'urt one
      another&mdash;that's what I thinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Will you go out and do something for me? [MRS. MILER nods]
    </p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      Take this with the note to that address&mdash;it's quite close. He'll give
      you thirty pounds for it. Please pay these bills and bring me back the
      receipts, and what's over.

    <p>
      MRS. MILER. [Taking the pendant and note] It's a pretty thing.

      CLARE. Yes. It was my mother's.

      MRS. MILER. It's a pity to part with it; ain't you got another?

      CLARE. [Her eyes fixed on TWISDEN] Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FULLARTON. [Disconcerted by the strange greeting] I brought Mr.
      Twisden to tell you something. May I stay?

    <p>
      CLARE. Yes. [She points to the chair at the same table: MRS. FULLARTON
      sits down] Now!

    <p>
      TWISDEN. As you're not defending this case, Mrs. Dedmond, there is nobody
      but yourself for me to apply to.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Please tell me quickly, what you've come for.
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. [Bowing slightly] I am instructed by Mr. Dedmond to say that if
      you will leave your present companion and undertake not to see him again,
      he will withdraw the suit and settle three hundred a year on you. [At
      CLARE's movement of abhorrence] Don't misunderstand me, please&mdash;it is
      not&mdash;it could hardly be, a request that you should go back. Mr.
      Dedmond is not prepared to receive you again. The proposal&mdash;forgive
      my saying so&mdash;remarkably Quixotic&mdash;is made to save the scandal
      to his family and your own. It binds you to nothing but the abandonment of
      your present companion, with certain conditions of the same nature as to
      the future. In other words, it assures you a position&mdash;so long as you
      live quietly by yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I see. Will you please thank Mr. Dedmond, and say that I refuse?
    </p>

    <p>
      TWISDEN. Mrs. Dedmond, I am bound to put the position to you in its naked
      brutality. You know there's a claim for damages?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I have just learnt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. You realize what the result of this suit must be: You will be
      left dependent on an undischarged bankrupt. To put it another way, you'll
      be a stone round the neck of a drowning man.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. You are cowards.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FULLARTON. Clare, Clare! [To TWISDEN] She doesn't mean it; please be
      patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I do mean it. You ruin him because of me. You get him down, and
      kick him to intimidate me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FULLARTON. My dear girl! Mr. Twisden is not personally concerned. How
      can you?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. If I were dying, and it would save me, I wouldn't take a penny from
      my husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. Nothing could be more bitter than those words. Do you really wish
      me to take them back to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Yes. [She turns from them to the fire]
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FULLARTON. [In a low voice to TWISDEN] Please leave me alone with
      her, don't say anything to Mr. Dedmond yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      TWISDEN. Mrs. Dedmond, I told you once that I wished you well. Though you
      have called me a coward, I still do that. For God's sake, think&mdash;before
      it's too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Putting out her hand blindly] I'm sorry I called you a coward.
      It's the whole thing, I meant.

      CLARE. Please don't, Dolly! Let me be!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FULLARTON. I must speak, Clare! I do think you're hard on George.
      It's generous of him to offer to withdraw the suit&mdash; considering. You
      do owe it to us to try and spare your father and your sisters and&mdash;and
      all of us who care for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Facing her] You say George is generous! If he wanted to be that
      he'd never have claimed these damages. It's revenge he wants&mdash;I heard
      him here. You think I've done him an injury. So I did&mdash;when I married
      him. I don't know what I shall come to, Dolly, but I shan't fall so low as
      to take money from him. That's as certain as that I shall die.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FULLARTON. Do you know, Clare, I think it's awful about you! You're
      too fine, and not fine enough, to put up with things; you're too sensitive
      to take help, and you're not strong enough to do without it. It's simply
      tragic. At any rate, you might go home to your people.

        the door. MALISE enters. For a moment he does not see her standing there
        against the curtain that is much the same colour as her dress. His face
        is that of a man in the grip of a rage that he feels to be impotent.

      against his hand, that still rests on her shoulder] Life on sufferance,
      breath at the pleasure of the enemy! And some day in the fullness of his
      mercy to be made a present of the right to eat and drink and breathe
      again. [His gesture sums up the rage within him] Fine! [He puts his hat on
      and rises] That's the last groan they get from me.

        buttonhole, and sinks down into the armchair, which he must pass. There
        she sits, the violets in her hand. MALISE comes out and crosses towards
        the outer door. She puts the violets up to him. He stares at them,

        her throat working. Then, feverishly, she goes to the little table,
        seizes a sheet of paper, and writes. Looking up suddenly she sees that
        MRS. MILER has let herself in with her latchkey.

      MRS. MILER. I've settled the baker, the milk, the washin' an' the
      groceries&mdash;this 'ere's what's left.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She counts down a five-pound note, four sovereigns, and two shillings on
        to the little table. CLARE folds the letter into an envelope, then takes
        up the five-pound note and puts it into her dress.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Pointing to the money on the table] Take your wages; and give him
      this when he comes in. I'm going away.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. Without him? When'll you be comin' back?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Rising] I shan't be coming back. [Gazing at MRS. MILER'S hands,
      which are plaiting at her dress] I'm leaving Mr. Malise, and shan't see
      him again. And the suit against us will be withdrawn&mdash;the divorce
      suit&mdash;you understand?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. [Her face all broken up] I never meant to say anything to yer.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. It's not you. I can see for myself. Don't make it harder; help me.
      Get a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. [Disturbed to the heart] The porter's outside, cleanin' the
      landin' winder.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Tell him to come for my trunk. It is packed. [She goes into the
      bedroom]
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILER. [Opening the door-desolately] Come 'ere!

    <p>
      MRS. MILER. The lady wants a cab. Wait and carry 'er trunk down.

      <p>
        CLARE comes from the bedroom in her hat and coat.

    <p>
      MRS. MILER. [TO the PORTER] Now.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        They go into the bedroom to get the trunk. CLARE picks up from the floor
        the bunch of violets, her fingers play with it as if they did not quite
        know what it was; and she stands by the armchair very still, while MRS.
        MILER and the PORTER pass her with trunk and bag. And even after the
        PORTER has shouldered the trunk outside, and marched away, and MRS.
        MILER has come back into the room, CLARE still stands there.

    <p>
      MRS. MILER. [Pointing to the typewriter] D'you want this 'ere, too?

    <p>
      CLARE. Yes.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MRS. MILER carries it out. Then, from the doorway, gazing at CLARE
        taking her last look, she sobs, suddenly. At sound of that sob CLARE
        throws up her head.
      </p>

    <p>
      CLARE. Don't! It's all right. Good-bye!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She walks out and away, not looking back. MRS. MILER chokes her sobbing
        into the black stuff of her thick old jacket.

      ACT IV
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Supper-time in a small room at "The Gascony" on Derby Day. Through the
        windows of a broad corridor, out of which the door opens, is seen the
        dark blue of a summer night. The walls are of apricot-gold; the carpets,
        curtains, lamp-shades, and gilded chairs, of red; the wood-work and
        screens white; the palms in gilded tubs. A doorway that has no door
        leads to another small room. One little table behind a screen, and one
        little table in the open, are set for two persons each. On a
        service-table, above which hangs a speaking-tube, are some dishes of
        hors d'ouvres, a basket of peaches, two bottles of champagne in
        ice-pails, and a small barrel of oysters in a gilded tub. ARNAUD, the
        waiter, slim, dark, quick, his face seamed with a quiet, soft irony, is
        opening oysters and listening to the robust joy of a distant
        supper-party, where a man is playing the last bars of: "Do ye ken John
        Peel" on a horn. As the sound dies away, he murmurs: "Tres Joli!" and
        opens another oyster. Two Ladies with bare shoulders and large hats pass
        down the corridor. Their talk is faintly wafted in: "Well, I never like
        Derby night! The boys do get so bobbish!" "That horn&mdash;vulgar, I
        call it!" ARNAUD'S eyebrows rise, the corners of his mouth droop. A Lady
        with bare shoulders, and crimson roses in her hair, comes along the
        corridor, and stops for a second at the window, for a man to join her.
        They come through into the room. ARNAUD has sprung to attention, but
        with: "Let's go in here, shall we?" they pass through into the further
        room. The MANAGER, a gentleman with neat moustaches, and buttoned into a
        frock-coat, has appeared, brisk, noiseless, his eyes everywhere; he
        inspects the peaches.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MANAGER. Four shillin' apiece to-night, see?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. Yes, Sare.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        From the inner room a young man and his partner have come in. She is
        dark, almost Spanish-looking; he fair, languid, pale, clean-shaved,
        slackly smiling, with half-closed eyes-one of those who are bred and
        dissipated to the point of having lost all save the capacity for hiding
        their emotions. He speaks in a&mdash;&mdash;
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LANGUID VOICE. Awful row they're kickin' up in there, Mr. Varley. A fellow
      with a horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      MANAGER. [Blandly] Gaddesdon Hunt, my lord&mdash;always have their supper
      with us, Derby night. Quiet corner here, my lord. Arnaud!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        ARNAUD is already at the table, between screen and palm. And, there
        ensconced, the couple take their seats. Seeing them safely landed, the
        MANAGER, brisk and noiseless, moves away. In the corridor a lady in
        black, with a cloak falling open, seems uncertain whether to come in.
        She advances into the doorway. It is CLARE.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. [Pointing to the other table as he flies with dishes] Nice table,
      Madame.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        CLARE moves to the corner of it. An artist in observation of his
        clients, ARNAUD takes in her face&mdash;very pale under her wavy,
        simply-dressed hair; shadowy beneath the eyes; not powdered; her lips
        not reddened; without a single ornament; takes in her black dress,
        finely cut, her arms and neck beautifully white, and at her breast three
        gardenias. And as he nears her, she lifts her eyes. It is very much the
        look of something lost, appealing for guidance.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. Madame is waiting for some one? [She shakes her head] Then Madame
      will be veree well here&mdash;veree well. I take Madame's cloak?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He takes the cloak gently and lays it on the back of the chair fronting
        the room, that she may put it round her when she wishes. She sits down.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LANGUID VOICE. [From the corner] Waiter!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. Milord!
    </p>
    <p>
      LANGUID VOICE. The Roederer.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. At once, Milord.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        CLARE sits tracing a pattern with her finger on the cloth, her eyes
        lowered. Once she raises them, and follows ARNAUD's dark rapid figure.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. [Returning] Madame feels the 'eat? [He scans her with increased
      curiosity] You wish something, Madame?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Again giving him that look] Must I order?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. Non, Madame, it is not necessary. A glass of water. [He pours it
      out] I have not the pleasure of knowing Madame's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Faintly smiling] No.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. Madame will find it veree good 'ere, veree quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      LANGUID VOICE. Waiter!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. Pardon! [He goes]
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The bare-necked ladies with large hats again pass down the corridor
        outside, and again their voices are wafted in: "Tottie! Not she! Oh! my
        goodness, she has got a pride on her!" "Bobbie'll never stick it!" "Look
        here, dear&mdash;&mdash;" Galvanized by those sounds, CLARE has caught
        her cloak and half-risen; they die away and she subsides.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. [Back at her table, with a quaint shrug towards the corridor] It
      is not rowdy here, Madame, as a rule&mdash;not as in some places. To-night
      a little noise. Madame is fond of flowers? [He whisks out, and returns
      almost at once with a bowl of carnations from some table in the next room]
      These smell good!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. You are very kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. [With courtesy] Not at all, Madame; a pleasure. [He bows]
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        A young man, tall, thin, hard, straight, with close-cropped, sandyish
        hair and moustache, a face tanned very red, and one of those small,
        long, lean heads that only grow in Britain; clad in a thin dark overcoat
        thrown open, an opera hat pushed back, a white waistcoat round his lean
        middle, he comes in from the corridor. He looks round, glances at CLARE,
        passes her table towards the further room, stops in the doorway, and
        looks back at her. Her eyes have just been lifted, and are at once cast
        down again. The young man wavers, catches ARNAUD's eye, jerks his head
        to summon him, and passes into the further room. ARNAUD takes up the
        vase that has been superseded, and follows him out. And CLARE sits alone
        in silence, broken by the murmurs of the languid lord and his partner,
        behind the screen. She is breathing as if she had been running hard. She
        lifts her eyes. The tall young man, divested of hat and coat, is
        standing by her table, holding out his hand with a sort of bashful
        hardiness.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. How d'you do? Didn't recognize you at first. So sorry &mdash;awfully
      rude of me.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        CLARE'S eyes seem to fly from him, to appeal to him, to resign herself
        all at once. Something in the YOUNG MAN responds. He drops his hand.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Faintly] How d'you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. [Stammering] You&mdash;you been down there to-day?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. [With a smile] The Derby. What? Don't you generally go down?
      [He touches the other chair] May I?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Almost in a whisper] Yes.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As he sits down, ARNAUD returns and stands before them.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. The plovers' eggs veree good to-night, Sare. Veree good, Madame. A
      peach or two, after. Veree good peaches. The Roederer, Sare&mdash;not bad
      at all. Madame likes it frappe, but not too cold&mdash;yes?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He is away again to his service-table.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. [Burying his face in the carnations] I say&mdash;these are
      jolly, aren't they? They do you pretty well here.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Do they?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. You've never been here? [CLARE shakes her head] By Jove! I
      thought I didn't know your face. [CLARE looks full at him. Again something
      moves in the YOUNG MAN, and he stammers] I mean&mdash;not&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. It doesn't matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. [Respectfully] Of course, if I&mdash;if you were waiting for
      anybody, or anything&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;

      <p>
        [He half rises]

    <p>
      CLARE. It's all right, thank you.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The YOUNG MAN sits down again, uncomfortable, nonplussed. There is
        silence, broken by the inaudible words of the languid lord, and the
        distant merriment of the supper-party. ARNAUD brings the plovers' eggs.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. The wine, quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. At once, Sare.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. [Abruptly] Don't you ever go racing, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. No.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ARNAUD pours out champagne]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. I remember awfully well my first day. It was pretty thick&mdash;lost
      every blessed bob, and my watch and chain, playin' three cards on the way
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Everything has a beginning, hasn't it?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She drinks. The YOUNG MAN stares at her]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. [Floundering in these waters deeper than he had bargained for]
      I say&mdash;about things having beginnings&mdash;did you mean anything?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [CLARE nods]
      </p>

    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. What! D'you mean it's really the first&mdash;&mdash;?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        CLARE nods. The champagne has flicked her courage.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. By George! [He leans back] I've often wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. [Again filling the glasses] Monsieur finds&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. [Abruptly] It's all right.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He drains his glass, then sits bolt upright. Chivalry and the
        camaraderie of class have begun to stir in him.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. Of course I can see that you're not&mdash;I mean, that you're a&mdash;a
      lady. [CLARE smiles] And I say, you know&mdash;if you have to&mdash;
      because you're in a hole&mdash;I should feel a cad. Let me lend you&mdash;&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Holding up her glass] 'Le vin est tire, il faut le boire'!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She drinks. The French words, which he does not too well understand,
        completing his conviction that she is a lady, he remains quite silent,
        frowning. As CLARE held up her glass, two gentlemen have entered. The
        first is blond, of good height and a comely insolence. His crisp, fair
        hair, and fair brushed-up moustache are just going grey; an eyeglass is
        fixed in one of two eyes that lord it over every woman they see; his
        face is broad, and coloured with air and wine. His companion is a tall,
        thin, dark bird of the night, with sly, roving eyes, and hollow cheeks.
        They stand looking round, then pass into the further room; but in
        passing, they have stared unreservedly at CLARE.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. [Seeing her wince] Look here! I'm afraid you must feel me
      rather a brute, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. No, I don't; really.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. Are you absolute stoney? [CLARE nods] But [Looking at her frock
      and cloak] you're so awfully well&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I had the sense to keep them.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. [More and more disturbed] I say, you know&mdash;I wish you'd
      let me lend you something. I had quite a good day down there.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Again tracing her pattern on the cloth&mdash;then looking up at
      him full] I can't take, for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. By Jove! I don't know-really, I don't&mdash;this makes me feel
      pretty rotten. I mean, it's your being a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Smiling] That's not your fault, is it? You see, I've been beaten
      all along the line. And I really don't care what happens to me. [She has
      that peculiar fey look on her face now] I really don't; except that I
      don't take charity. It's lucky for me it's you, and not some&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper-party is getting still more boisterous, and there comes a long
      view holloa, and a blast of the horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. But I say, what about your people? You must have people of some
      sort.

        He is fast becoming fascinated, for her cheeks have begun to flush and
        her eyes to shine.

    <p>
      CLARE. Oh, yes; I've had people, and a husband, and&mdash;everything&mdash;&mdash;
      And here I am! Queer, isn't it? [She touches her glass] This is going to
      my head! Do you mind? I sha'n't sing songs and get up and dance, and I
      won't cry, I promise you!
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. [Between fascination and chivalry] By George! One simply can't
      believe in this happening to a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Have you got sisters? [Breaking into her soft laughter] My
      brother's in India. I sha'n't meet him, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. No, but&mdash;I say-are you really quite cut off from
      everybody? [CLARE nods] Something rather awful must have happened?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She smiles. The two gentlemen have returned. The blond one is again
        staring fixedly at CLARE. This time she looks back at him, flaming; and,
        with a little laugh, he passes with his friend into the corridor.

    <p>
      CLARE. Who are those two?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. Don't know&mdash;not been much about town yet. I'm just back
      from India myself. You said your brother was there; what's his regiment?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Shaking her head] You're not going to find out my name. I haven't
      got one&mdash;nothing.

        But there is such a change in her face, such rigidity of her whole body,
        that he stops and averts his eyes. When he looks again she is drinking.
        She puts the glass down, and gives a little laugh.
      </p>

    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. [With a sort of awe] Anyway it must have been like riding at a
      pretty stiff fence, for you to come here to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Yes. What's the other side?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The YOUNG MAN puts out his hand and touches her arm. It is meant for
        sympathy, but she takes it for attraction.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Shaking her head] Not yet please! I'm enjoying this. May I have a
      cigarette?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He takes out his case, and gives her one]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Letting the smoke slowly forth] Yes, I'm enjoying it. Had a pretty
      poor time lately; not enough to eat, sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. Not really! How damnable! I say&mdash;do have something more
      substantial.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        CLARE gives a sudden gasp, as if going off into hysterical laughter, but
        she stifles it, and shakes her head.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. A peach?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ARNAUD brings peaches to the table]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Smiling] Thank you.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He fills their glasses and retreats]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Raising her glass] Eat and drink, for tomorrow we&mdash;Listen!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        From the supper-party comes the sound of an abortive chorus: "With a hey
        ho, chivy, hark forrard, hark forrard, tantivy!" Jarring out into a
        discordant whoop, it sinks.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CLARE. "This day a stag must die." Jolly old song!
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. Rowdy lot! [Suddenly] I say&mdash;I admire your pluck.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [Shaking her head] Haven't kept my end up. Lots of women do! You
      see: I'm too fine, and not fine enough! My best friend said that. Too
      fine, and not fine enough. [She laughs] I couldn't be a saint and martyr,
      and I wouldn't be a soulless doll. Neither one thing nor the other&mdash;that's
      the tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. You must have had awful luck!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I did try. [Fiercely] But what's the good&mdash;when there's
      nothing before you?&mdash;Do I look ill?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. No; simply awfully pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. [With a laugh] A man once said to me: "As you haven't money, you
      should never have been pretty!" But, you see, it is some good. If I hadn't
      been, I couldn't have risked coming here, could I? Don't you think it was
      rather sporting of me to buy these [She touches the gardenias] with the
      last shilling over from my cab fare?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. Did you really? D&mdash;-d sporting!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. It's no use doing things by halves, is it? I'm&mdash;in for it&mdash;
      wish me luck! [She drinks, and puts her glass down with a smile] In for it&mdash;deep!
      [She flings up her hands above her smiling face] Down, down, till they're
      just above water, and then&mdash;down, down, down, and &mdash;all over!
      Are you sorry now you came and spoke to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. By Jove, no! It may be caddish, but I'm not.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Thank God for beauty! I hope I shall die pretty! Do you think I
      shall do well?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. I say&mdash;don't talk like that!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. I want to know. Do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. Well, then&mdash;yes, I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. That's splendid. Those poor women in the streets would give their
      eyes, wouldn't they?&mdash;that have to go up and down, up and down! Do
      you think I&mdash;shall&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The YOUNG MAN, half-rising, puts his hand on her arm.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. I think you're getting much too excited. You look all&mdash;
      Won't you eat your peach? [She shakes her head] Do! Have something else,
      then&mdash;some grapes, or something?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. No, thanks.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She has become quite calm again]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. Well, then, what d'you think? It's awfully hot in here, isn't
      it? Wouldn't it be jollier drivin'? Shall we&mdash;shall we make a move?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLARE. Yes.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The YOUNG MAN turns to look for the waiter, but ARNAUD is not in the
        room. He gets up.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. [Feverishly] D&mdash;-n that waiter! Wait half a minute, if you
      don't mind, while I pay the bill.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As he goes out into the corridor, the two gentlemen re-appear. CLARE is
        sitting motionless, looking straight before her.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      DARK ONE. A fiver you don't get her to!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLOND ONE. Done!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He advances to her table with his inimitable insolence, and taking the
        cigar from his mouth, bends his stare on her, and says: "Charmed to see
        you lookin' so well! Will you have supper with me here to-morrow night?"
        Startled out of her reverie, CLARE looks up. She sees those eyes, she
        sees beyond him the eyes of his companion-sly, malevolent,
        amused-watching; and she just sits gazing, without a word. At that
        regard, so clear, the BLOND ONE does not wince. But rather suddenly he
        says: "That's arranged then. Half-past eleven. So good of you.
        Good-night!" He replaces his cigar and strolls back to his companion,
        and in a low voice says: "Pay up!" Then at a languid "Hullo, Charles!"
        they turn to greet the two in their nook behind the screen. CLARE has
        not moved, nor changed the direction of her gaze. Suddenly she thrusts
        her hand into the, pocket of the cloak that hangs behind her, and brings
        out the little blue bottle which, six months ago, she took from MALISE.
        She pulls out the cork and pours the whole contents into her champagne.
        She lifts the glass, holds it before her&mdash;smiling, as if to call a
        toast, then puts it to her lips and drinks. Still smiling, she sets the
        empty glass down, and lays the gardenia flowers against her face. Slowly
        she droops back in her chair, the drowsy smile still on her lips; the
        gardenias drop into her lap; her arms relax, her head falls forward on
        her breast. And the voices behind the screen talk on, and the sounds of
        joy from the supper-party wax and wane. The waiter, ARNAUD, returning
        from the corridor, passes to his service-table with a tall, beribboned
        basket of fruit. Putting it down, he goes towards the table behind the
        screen, and sees. He runs up to CLARE.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. Madame! Madame! [He listens for her breathing; then suddenly
      catching sight of the little bottle, smells at it] Bon Dieu!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [At that queer sound they come from behind the screen&mdash;all four,
        and look. The dark night bird says: "Hallo; fainted!" ARNAUD holds out
        the bottle.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LANGUID LORD. [Taking it, and smelling] Good God! [The woman bends over
      CLARE, and lifts her hands; ARNAUD rushes to his service-table, and speaks
      into his tube]
    </p>
    <p>
      ARNAUD. The boss. Quick! [Looking up he sees the YOUNG MAN, returning]
      'Monsieur, elle a fui! Elle est morte'!
    </p>
    <p>
      LANGUID LORD. [To the YOUNG MAN standing there aghast] What's this? Friend
      of yours?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG MAN. My God! She was a lady. That's all I know about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      LANGUID LORD. A lady!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The blond and dark gentlemen have slipped from the room; and out of the
        supper-party's distant laughter comes suddenly a long, shrill: "Gone
        away!" And the sound of the horn playing the seven last notes of the old
        song: "This day a stag must die!" From the last note of all the sound
        flies up to an octave higher, sweet and thin, like a spirit passing,
        till it is drowned once more in laughter. The YOUNG MAN has covered his
        eyes with his hands; ARNAUD is crossing himself fervently; the LANGUID
        LORD stands gazing, with one of the dropped gardenias twisted in his
        fingers; and the woman, bending over CLARE, kisses her forehead.]

 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
 States.

 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
 copied or distributed:

 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
 with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
 1.E.9.

 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
 prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm License.

 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
 that

 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

 1.F.

 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 your equipment.

 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
 opportunities to fix the problem.

 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 people in all walks of life.

 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 particular state visit http://pglaf.org

 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate.

 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
 donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.

 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

      http://www.gutenberg.net

 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
