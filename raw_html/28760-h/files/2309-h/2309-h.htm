    <h2>
      PROLOGUE
    </h2>
    <p>
      One early April afternoon, in a Worcestershire field, the only field in
      that immediate landscape which was not down in grass, a man moved slowly
      athwart the furrows, sowing&mdash;a big man of heavy build, swinging his
      hairy brown arm with the grace of strength. He wore no coat or hat; a
      waistcoat, open over a blue-checked cotton shirt, flapped against belted
      corduroys that were somewhat the color of his square, pale-brown face and
      dusty hair. His eyes were sad, with the swimming yet fixed stare of
      epileptics; his mouth heavy-lipped, so that, but for the yearning eyes,
      the face would have been almost brutal. He looked as if he suffered from
      silence. The elm-trees bordering the field, though only just in leaf,
      showed dark against a white sky. A light wind blew, carrying already a
      scent from the earth and growth pushing up, for the year was early. The
      green Malvern hills rose in the west; and not far away, shrouded by trees,
      a long country house of weathered brick faced to the south. Save for the
      man sowing, and some rooks crossing from elm to elm, no life was visible
      in all the green land. And it was quiet&mdash;with a strange, a brooding
      tranquillity. The fields and hills seemed to mock the scars of road and
      ditch and furrow scraped on them, to mock at barriers of hedge and wall&mdash;between
      the green land and white sky was a conspiracy to disregard those small
      activities. So lonely was it, so plunged in a ground-bass of silence; so
      much too big and permanent for any figure of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across and across the brown loam the laborer doggedly finished out his
      task; scattered the few last seeds into a corner, and stood still.
      Thrushes and blackbirds were just beginning that even-song whose
      blitheness, as nothing else on earth, seems to promise youth forever to
      the land. He picked up his coat, slung it on, and, heaving a straw bag
      over his shoulder, walked out on to the grass-bordered road between the
      elms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tryst! Bob Tryst!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the gate of a creepered cottage amongst fruit-trees, high above the
      road, a youth with black hair and pale-brown face stood beside a girl with
      frizzy brown hair and cheeks like poppies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had that notice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laborer answered slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Derek. If she don&rsquo;t go, I&rsquo;ve got to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a d&mdash;d shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laborer moved his head, as though he would have spoken, but no words
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything, Bob. We&rsquo;ll see about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evenin&rsquo;, Mr. Derek. Evenin&rsquo;, Miss Sheila,&rdquo; and the laborer moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two at the wicket gate also turned away. A black-haired woman dressed
      in blue came to the wicket gate in their place. There seemed no purpose in
      her standing there; it was perhaps an evening custom, some ceremony such
      as Moslems observe at the muezzin-call. And any one who saw her would have
      wondered what on earth she might be seeing, gazing out with her dark
      glowing eyes above the white, grass-bordered roads stretching empty this
      way and that between the elm-trees and green fields; while the blackbirds
      and thrushes shouted out their hearts, calling all to witness how hopeful
      and young was life in this English countryside....

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mayday afternoon in Oxford Street, and Felix Freeland, a little late, on
      his way from Hampstead to his brother John&rsquo;s house in Porchester Gardens.
      Felix Freeland, author, wearing the very first gray top hat of the season.
      A compromise, that&mdash;like many other things in his life and works&mdash;between
      individuality and the accepted view of things, aestheticism and fashion,
      the critical sense and authority. After the meeting at John&rsquo;s, to discuss
      the doings of the family of his brother Morton Freeland&mdash;better known
      as Tod&mdash;he would perhaps look in on the caricatures at the English
      Gallery, and visit one duchess in Mayfair, concerning the George Richard
      Memorial. And so, not the soft felt hat which really suited authorship,
      nor the black top hat which obliterated personality to the point of pain,
      but this gray thing with narrowish black band, very suitable, in truth, to
      a face of a pale buff color, to a moustache of a deep buff color streaked
      with a few gray hairs, to a black braided coat cut away from a
      buff-colored waistcoat, to his neat boots&mdash;not patent leather&mdash;faintly
      buffed with May-day dust. Even his eyes, Freeland gray, were a little
      buffed over by sedentary habit, and the number of things that he was
      conscious of. For instance, that the people passing him were distressingly
      plain, both men and women; plain with the particular plainness of those
      quite unaware of it. It struck him forcibly, while he went along, how very
      queer it was that with so many plain people in the country, the population
      managed to keep up even as well as it did. To his wonderfully keen sense
      of defect, it seemed little short of marvellous. A shambling, shoddy crew,
      this crowd of shoppers and labor demonstrators! A conglomeration of
      hopelessly mediocre visages! What was to be done about it? Ah! what
      indeed!&mdash;since they were evidently not aware of their own dismal
      mediocrity. Hardly a beautiful or a vivid face, hardly a wicked one, never
      anything transfigured, passionate, terrible, or grand. Nothing Greek,
      early Italian, Elizabethan, not even beefy, beery, broad old Georgian.
      Something clutched-in, and squashed-out about it all&mdash;on that
      collective face something of the look of a man almost comfortably and
      warmly wrapped round by a snake at the very beginning of its squeeze. It
      gave Felix Freeland a sort of faint excitement and pleasure to notice
      this. For it was his business to notice things, and embalm them afterward
      in ink. And he believed that not many people noticed it, so that it
      contributed in his mind to his own distinction, which was precious to him.
      Precious, and encouraged to be so by the press, which&mdash;as he well
      knew&mdash;must print his name several thousand times a year. And yet, as
      a man of culture and of principle, how he despised that kind of fame, and
      theoretically believed that a man&rsquo;s real distinction lay in his oblivion
      of the world&rsquo;s opinion, particularly as expressed by that flighty
      creature, the Fourth Estate. But here again, as in the matter of the gray
      top hat, he had instinctively compromised, taking in press cuttings which
      described himself and his works, while he never failed to describe those
      descriptions&mdash;good, bad, and indifferent&mdash;as &lsquo;that stuff,&rsquo; and
      their writers as &lsquo;those fellows.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that it was new to him to feel that the country was in a bad way. On
      the contrary, it was his established belief, and one for which he was
      prepared to furnish due and proper reasons. In the first place he traced
      it to the horrible hold Industrialism had in the last hundred years laid
      on the nation, draining the peasantry from &lsquo;the Land&rsquo;; and in the second
      place to the influence of a narrow and insidious Officialism, sapping the
      independence of the People.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was why, in going to a conclave with his brother John, high in
      Government employ, and his brother Stanley, a captain of industry,
      possessor of the Morton Plough Works, he was conscious of a certain
      superiority in that he, at all events, had no hand in this paralysis which
      was creeping on the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      And getting more buff-colored every minute, he threaded his way on, till,
      past the Marble Arch, he secured the elbow-room of Hyde Park. Here groups
      of young men, with chivalrous idealism, were jeering at and chivying the
      broken remnants of a suffrage meeting. Felix debated whether he should
      oppose his body to their bodies, his tongue to theirs, or whether he
      should avert his consciousness and hurry on; but, that instinct which
      moved him to wear the gray top hat prevailing, he did neither, and stood
      instead, looking at them in silent anger, which quickly provoked
      endearments&mdash;such as: &ldquo;Take it off,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Keep it on,&rdquo; or &ldquo;What cheer,
      Toppy!&rdquo; but nothing more acute. And he meditated: Culture! Could culture
      ever make headway among the blind partisanships, the hand-to-mouth
      mentality, the cheap excitements of this town life? The faces of these
      youths, the tone of their voices, the very look of their bowler hats,
      said: No! You could not culturalize the impermeable texture of their
      vulgarity. And they were the coming manhood of the nation&mdash;this
      inexpressibly distasteful lot of youths! The country had indeed got too
      far away from &lsquo;the Land.&rsquo; And this essential towny commonness was not
      confined to the classes from which these youths were drawn. He had even
      remarked it among his own son&rsquo;s school and college friends&mdash;an
      impatience of discipline, an insensibility to everything but excitement
      and having a good time, a permanent mental indigestion due to a permanent
      diet of tit-bits. What aspiration they possessed seemed devoted to
      securing for themselves the plums of official or industrial life. His boy
      Alan, even, was infected, in spite of home influences and the atmosphere
      of art in which he had been so sedulously soaked. He wished to enter his
      Uncle Stanley&rsquo;s plough works, seeing in it a &lsquo;soft thing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the last of the woman-baiters had passed by now, and, conscious that
      he was really behind time, Felix hurried on....
    </p>
    <p>
      In his study&mdash;a pleasant room, if rather tidy&mdash;John Freeland was
      standing before the fire smoking a pipe and looking thoughtfully at
      nothing. He was, in fact, thinking, with that continuity characteristic of
      a man who at fifty has won for himself a place of permanent importance in
      the Home Office. Starting life in the Royal Engineers, he still preserved
      something of a military look about his figure, and grave visage with
      steady eyes and drooping moustache (both a shade grayer than those of
      Felix), and a forehead bald from justness and knowing where to lay his
      hand on papers. His face was thinner, his head narrower, than his
      brother&rsquo;s, and he had acquired a way of making those he looked at doubt
      themselves and feel the sudden instability of all their facts. He was&mdash;as
      has been said&mdash;thinking. His brother Stanley had wired to him that
      morning: &ldquo;Am motoring up to-day on business; can you get Felix to come at
      six o&rsquo;clock and talk over the position at Tod&rsquo;s?&rdquo; What position at Tod&rsquo;s?
      He had indeed heard something vague&mdash;of those youngsters of Tod&rsquo;s,
      and some fuss they were making about the laborers down there. He had not
      liked it. Too much of a piece with the general unrest, and these new
      democratic ideas that were playing old Harry with the country! For in his
      opinion the country was in a bad way, partly owing to Industrialism, with
      its rotting effect upon physique; partly to this modern analytic
      Intellectualism, with its destructive and anarchic influence on morals. It
      was difficult to overestimate the mischief of those two factors; and in
      the approaching conference with his brothers, one of whom was the head of
      an industrial undertaking, and the other a writer, whose books, extremely
      modern, he never read, he was perhaps vaguely conscious of his own cleaner
      hands. Hearing a car come to a halt outside, he went to the window and
      looked out. Yes, it was Stanley!...
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanley Freeland, who had motored up from Becket&mdash;his country place,
      close to his plough works in Worcestershire&mdash;stood a moment on the
      pavement, stretching his long legs and giving directions to his chauffeur.
      He had been stopped twice on the road for not-exceeding the limit as he
      believed, and was still a little ruffled. Was it not his invariable
      principle to be moderate in speed as in all other things? And his feeling
      at the moment was stronger even than usual, that the country was in a bad
      way, eaten up by officialism, with its absurd limitations of speed and the
      liberty of the subject, and the advanced ideas of these new writers and
      intellectuals, always talking about the rights and sufferings of the poor.
      There was no progress along either of those roads. He had it in his heart,
      as he stood there on the pavement, to say something pretty definite to
      John about interference with the liberty of the subject, and he wouldn&rsquo;t
      mind giving old Felix a rap about his precious destructive doctrines, and
      continual girding at the upper classes, vested interests, and all the rest
      of it. If he had something to put in their place that would be another
      matter. Capital and those who controlled it were the backbone of the
      country&mdash;what there was left of the country, apart from these d&mdash;d
      officials and aesthetic fellows! And with a contraction of his straight
      eyebrows above his straight gray eyes, straight blunt nose, blunter
      moustaches, and blunt chin, he kept a tight rein on his blunt tongue, not
      choosing to give way even to his own anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, perceiving Felix coming&mdash;&lsquo;in a white topper, by Jove!&rsquo;&mdash;he
      crossed the pavement to the door; and, tall, square, personable, rang the
      bell.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter at Tod&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Felix moved a little forward in his chair, his eyes fixed with
      interest on Stanley, who was about to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that wife of his, of course. It was all very well so long as she
      confined herself to writing, and talk, and that Land Society, or whatever
      it was she founded, the one that snuffed out the other day; but now she&rsquo;s
      getting herself and those two youngsters mixed up in our local broils, and
      really I think Tod&rsquo;s got to be spoken to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible for a husband to interfere with his wife&rsquo;s principles.&rdquo;
       So Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Principles!&rdquo; The word came from John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly! Kirsteen&rsquo;s a woman of great character; revolutionary by
      temperament. Why should you expect her to act as you would act
      yourselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Felix had said that, there was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Stanley muttered: &ldquo;Poor old Tod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix sighed, lost for a moment in his last vision of his youngest
      brother. It was four years ago now, a summer evening&mdash;Tod standing
      between his youngsters Derek and Sheila, in a doorway of his white,
      black-timbered, creepered cottage, his sunburnt face and blue eyes the
      serenest things one could see in a day&rsquo;s march!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why &lsquo;poor&rsquo;?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tod&rsquo;s much happier than we are. You&rsquo;ve only to
      look at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Stanley suddenly. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you remember him at Father&rsquo;s funeral?&mdash;without
      his hat, and his head in the clouds. Fine-lookin&rsquo; chap, old Tod&mdash;pity
      he&rsquo;s such a child of Nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d offered him a partnership, Stanley&mdash;it would have been the
      making of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tod in the plough works? My hat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix smiled. At sight of that smile, Stanley grew red, and John refilled
      his pipe. It is always the devil to have a brother more sarcastic than
      oneself!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are those two?&rdquo; John said abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheila&rsquo;s twenty, Derek nineteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the boy was at an agricultural college?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A black-haired, fiery fellow, not a bit like Tod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John muttered: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her Celtic blood. Her father, old Colonel Moray,
      was just that sort; by George, he was a regular black Highlander. What&rsquo;s
      the trouble exactly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Stanley who answered: &ldquo;That sort of agitation business is all very
      well until it begins to affect your neighbors; then it&rsquo;s time it stopped.
      You know the Mallorings who own all the land round Tod&rsquo;s. Well, they&rsquo;ve
      fallen foul of the Mallorings over what they call injustice to some
      laborers. Questions of morality involved. I don&rsquo;t know all the details. A
      man&rsquo;s got notice to quit over his deceased wife&rsquo;s sister; and some girl or
      other in another cottage has kicked over&mdash;just ordinary country
      incidents. What I want is that Tod should be made to see that his family
      mustn&rsquo;t quarrel with his nearest neighbors in this way. We know the
      Mallorings well, they&rsquo;re only seven miles from us at Becket. It doesn&rsquo;t
      do; sooner or later it plays the devil all round. And the air&rsquo;s full of
      agitation about the laborers and &lsquo;the Land,&rsquo; and all the rest of it&mdash;only
      wants a spark to make real trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And having finished this oration, Stanley thrust his hands deep into his
      pockets, and jingled the money that was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      John said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix, you&rsquo;d better go down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix was sitting back, his eyes for once withdrawn from his brothers&rsquo;
      faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Odd,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;really odd, that with a perfectly unique person like Tod
      for a brother, we only see him once in a blue moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because he IS so d&mdash;d unique.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix got up and gravely extended his hand to Stanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve spoken truth.&rdquo; And to John he added: &ldquo;Well, I
      WILL go, and let you know the upshot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had departed, the two elder brothers remained for some moments
      silent, then Stanley said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Felix is a bit tryin&rsquo;! With the fuss they make of him in the papers,
      his head&rsquo;s swelled!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John did not answer. One could not in so many words resent one&rsquo;s own
      brother being made a fuss of, and if it had been for something real, such
      as discovering the source of the Black River, conquering Bechuanaland,
      curing Blue-mange, or being made a Bishop, he would have been the first
      and most loyal in his appreciation; but for the sort of thing Felix made
      up&mdash;Fiction, and critical, acid, destructive sort of stuff,
      pretending to show John Freeland things that he hadn&rsquo;t seen before&mdash;as
      if Felix could!&mdash;not at all the jolly old romance which one could
      read well enough and enjoy till it sent you to sleep after a good day&rsquo;s
      work. No! that Felix should be made a fuss of for such work as that really
      almost hurt him. It was not quite decent, violating deep down one&rsquo;s sense
      of form, one&rsquo;s sense of health, one&rsquo;s traditions. Though he would not have
      admitted it, he secretly felt, too, that this fuss was dangerous to his
      own point of view, which was, of course, to him the only real one. And he
      merely said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you stay to dinner, Stan?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      If John had those sensations about Felix, so&mdash;when he was away from
      John&mdash;had Felix about himself. He had never quite grown out of the
      feeling that to make himself conspicuous in any way was bad form. In
      common with his three brothers he had been through the mills of gentility&mdash;those
      unique grinding machines of education only found in his native land. Tod,
      to be sure, had been publicly sacked at the end of his third term, for
      climbing on to the headmaster&rsquo;s roof and filling up two of his chimneys
      with football pants, from which he had omitted to remove his name. Felix
      still remembered the august scene&mdash;the horrid thrill of it, the
      ominous sound of that: &ldquo;Freeland minimus!&rdquo; the ominous sight of poor
      little Tod emerging from his obscurity near the roof of the Speech Room,
      and descending all those steps. How very small and rosy he had looked, his
      bright hair standing on end, and his little blue eyes staring up very hard
      from under a troubled frown. And the august hand holding up those sooty
      pants, and the august voice: &ldquo;These appear to be yours, Freeland minimus.
      Were you so good as to put them down my chimneys?&rdquo; And the little piping,
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask why, Freeland minimus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have had some reason, Freeland minimus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the end of term, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You must not come back here, Freeland minimus. You are too dangerous,
      to yourself, and others. Go to your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And poor little Tod ascending again all those steps, cheeks more terribly
      rosy than ever, eyes bluer, from under a still more troubled frown; little
      mouth hard set; and breathing so that you could hear him six forms off.
      True, the new Head had been goaded by other outrages, the authors of which
      had not omitted to remove their names; but the want of humor, the amazing
      want of humor! As if it had not been a sign of first-rate stuff in Tod!
      And to this day Felix remembered with delight the little bubbling hiss
      that he himself had started, squelched at once, but rippling out again
      along the rows like tiny scattered lines of fire when a conflagration is
      suppressed. Expulsion had been the salvation of Tod! Or&mdash;his
      damnation? Which? God would know, but Felix was not certain. Having
      himself been fifteen years acquiring &lsquo;Mill&rsquo; philosophy, and another
      fifteen years getting rid of it, he had now begun to think that after all
      there might be something in it. A philosophy that took everything,
      including itself, at face value, and questioned nothing, was sedative to
      nerves too highly strung by the continual examination of the insides of
      oneself and others, with a view to their alteration. Tod, of course,
      having been sent to Germany after his expulsion, as one naturally would
      be, and then put to farming, had never properly acquired &lsquo;Mill&rsquo; manner,
      and never sloughed it off; and yet he was as sedative a man as you could
      meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emerging from the Tube station at Hampstead, he moved toward home under a
      sky stranger than one might see in a whole year of evenings. Between the
      pine-trees on the ridge it was opaque and colored like pinkish stone, and
      all around violent purple with flames of the young green, and white spring
      blossom lit against it. Spring had been dull and unimaginative so far, but
      this evening it was all fire and gathered torrents; Felix wondered at the
      waiting passion of that sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached home just as those torrents began to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old house, beyond the Spaniard&rsquo;s Road, save for mice and a faint
      underlying savor of wood-rot in two rooms, well satisfied the aesthetic
      sense. Felix often stood in his hall, study, bedroom, and other
      apartments, admiring the rich and simple glow of them&mdash;admiring the
      rarity and look of studied negligence about the stuffs, the flowers, the
      books, the furniture, the china; and then quite suddenly the feeling would
      sweep over him: &ldquo;By George, do I really own all this, when my ideal is
      &lsquo;bread and water, and on feast days a little bit of cheese&rsquo;?&rdquo; True, he was
      not to blame for the niceness of his things&mdash;Flora did it; but still&mdash;there
      they were, a little hard to swallow for an epicurean. It might, of course,
      have been worse, for if Flora had a passion for collecting, it was a very
      chaste one, and though what she collected cost no little money, it always
      looked as if it had been inherited, and&mdash;as everybody knows&mdash;what
      has been inherited must be put up with, whether it be a coronet or a
      cruet-stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      To collect old things, and write poetry! It was a career; one would not
      have one&rsquo;s wife otherwise. She might, for instance, have been like
      Stanley&rsquo;s wife, Clara, whose career was wealth and station; or John&rsquo;s
      wife, Anne, whose career had been cut short; or even Tod&rsquo;s wife, Kirsteen,
      whose career was revolution. No&mdash;a wife who had two, and only two
      children, and treated them with affectionate surprise, who was never out
      of temper, never in a hurry, knew the points of a book or play, could cut
      your hair at a pinch; whose hand was dry, figure still good, verse
      tolerable, and&mdash;above all&mdash;who wished for no better fate than
      Fate had given her&mdash;was a wife not to be sneezed at. And Felix never
      had. He had depicted so many sneezing wives and husbands in his books, and
      knew the value of a happy marriage better perhaps than any one in England.
      He had laid marriage low a dozen times, wrecked it on all sorts of rocks,
      and had the greater veneration for his own, which had begun early,
      manifested every symptom of ending late, and in the meantime walked down
      the years holding hands fast, and by no means forgetting to touch lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hanging up the gray top hat, he went in search of her. He found her in his
      dressing-room, surrounded by a number of little bottles, which she was
      examining vaguely, and putting one by one into an &lsquo;inherited&rsquo; waste-paper
      basket. Having watched her for a little while with a certain pleasure, he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noticing his presence, and continuing to put bottles into the basket, she
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I must&mdash;they&rsquo;re what dear Mother&rsquo;s given us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There they lay&mdash;little bottles filled with white and brown fluids,
      white and blue and brown powders; green and brown and yellow ointments;
      black lozenges; buff plasters; blue and pink and purple pills. All
      beautifully labelled and corked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he said in a rather faltering voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless her! How she does give her things away! Haven&rsquo;t we used ANY?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one. And they have to be cleared away before they&rsquo;re stale, for fear
      we might take one by mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, she&rsquo;s found something newer than them all by now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nomadic spirit. I have it, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a sudden vision came to him of his mother&rsquo;s carved ivory face, kept
      free of wrinkles by sheer will-power, its firm chin, slightly aquiline
      nose, and measured brows; its eyes that saw everything so quickly, so
      fastidiously, its compressed mouth that smiled sweetly, with a resolute
      but pathetic acceptation. Of the piece of fine lace, sometimes black,
      sometimes white, over her gray hair. Of her hands, so thin now, always
      moving a little, as if all the composure and care not to offend any eye by
      allowing Time to ravage her face, were avenging themselves in that
      constant movement. Of her figure, that was short but did not seem so,
      still quick-moving, still alert, and always dressed in black or gray. A
      vision of that exact, fastidious, wandering spirit called Frances Fleeming
      Freeland&mdash;that spirit strangely compounded of domination and
      humility, of acceptation and cynicism; precise and actual to the point of
      desert dryness; generous to a point that caused her family to despair; and
      always, beyond all things, brave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora dropped the last little bottle, and sitting on the edge of the bath
      let her eyebrows rise. How pleasant was that impersonal humor which made
      her superior to other wives!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;nomadic? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother travels unceasingly from place to place, person to person, thing
      to thing. I travel unceasingly from motive to motive, mind to mind; my
      native air is also desert air&mdash;hence the sterility of my work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora rose, but her eyebrows descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your work,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is not sterile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, my dear,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;is prejudice.&rdquo; And perceiving that she was
      going to kiss him, he waited without annoyance. For a woman of forty-two,
      with two children and three books of poems&mdash;and not knowing which had
      taken least out of her&mdash;with hazel-gray eyes, wavy eyebrows darker
      than they should have been, a glint of red in her hair; wavy figure and
      lips; quaint, half-humorous indolence, quaint, half-humorous warmth&mdash;was
      she not as satisfactory a woman as a man could possibly have married!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got to go down and see Tod,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I like that wife of his;
      but she has no sense of humor. How much better principles are in theory
      than in practice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora repeated softly, as if to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I have none.&rdquo; She was at the window leaning out, and Felix took
      his place beside her. The air was full of scent from wet leaves, alive
      with the song of birds thanking the sky. Suddenly he felt her arm round
      his ribs; either it or they&mdash;which, he could not at the moment tell&mdash;seemed
      extraordinarily soft....
    </p>
    <p>
      Between Felix and his young daughter, Nedda, there existed the only kind
      of love, except a mother&rsquo;s, which has much permanence&mdash;love based on
      mutual admiration. Though why Nedda, with her starry innocence, should
      admire him, Felix could never understand, not realizing that she read his
      books, and even analyzed them for herself in the diary which she kept
      religiously, writing it when she ought to have been asleep. He had
      therefore no knowledge of the way his written thoughts stimulated the
      ceaseless questioning that was always going on within her; the thirst to
      know why this was and that was not. Why, for instance, her heart ached so
      some days and felt light and eager other days? Why, when people wrote and
      talked of God, they seemed to know what He was, and she never did? Why
      people had to suffer; and the world be black to so many millions? Why one
      could not love more than one man at a time? Why&mdash;a thousand things?
      Felix&rsquo;s books supplied no answers to these questions, but they were
      comforting; for her real need as yet was not for answers, but ever for
      more questions, as a young bird&rsquo;s need is for opening its beak without
      quite knowing what is coming out or going in. When she and her father
      walked, or sat, or went to concerts together, their talk was neither
      particularly intimate nor particularly voluble; they made to each other no
      great confidences. Yet each was certain that the other was not bored&mdash;a
      great thing; and they squeezed each other&rsquo;s little fingers a good deal&mdash;very
      warming. Now with his son Alan, Felix had a continual sensation of having
      to keep up to a mark and never succeeding&mdash;a feeling, as in his
      favorite nightmare, of trying to pass an examination for which he had
      neglected to prepare; of having to preserve, in fact, form proper to the
      father of Alan Freeland. With Nedda he had a sense of refreshment; the
      delight one has on a spring day, watching a clear stream, a bank of
      flowers, birds flying. And Nedda with her father&mdash;what feeling had
      she? To be with him was like a long stroking with a touch of tickle in it;
      to read his books, a long tickle with a nice touch of stroking now and
      then when one was not expecting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night after dinner, when Alan had gone out and Flora into a dream,
      she snuggled up alongside her father, got hold of his little finger, and
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into the garden, Dad; I&rsquo;ll put on goloshes. It&rsquo;s an awfully nice
      moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moon indeed was palest gold behind the pines, so that its radiance was
      a mere shower of pollen, just a brushing of white moth-down over the reeds
      of their little dark pond, and the black blur of the flowering currant
      bushes. And the young lime-trees, not yet in full leaf, quivered
      ecstatically in that moon-witchery, still letting fall raindrops of the
      past spring torrent, with soft hissing sounds. A real sense in the garden,
      of God holding his breath in the presence of his own youth swelling,
      growing, trembling toward perfection! Somewhere a bird&mdash;a thrush,
      they thought&mdash;mixed in its little mind as to night and day, was
      queerly chirruping. And Felix and his daughter went along the dark wet
      paths, holding each other&rsquo;s arms, not talking much. For, in him, very
      responsive to the moods of Nature, there was a flattered feeling, with
      that young arm in his, of Spring having chosen to confide in him this
      whispering, rustling hour. And in Nedda was so much of that night&rsquo;s
      unutterable youth&mdash;no wonder she was silent! Then, somehow&mdash;neither
      responsible&mdash;they stood motionless. How quiet it was, but for a
      distant dog or two, and the stilly shivering-down of the water drops, and
      the far vibration of the million-voiced city! How quiet and soft and
      fresh! Then Nedda spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, I do so want to know everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not rousing even a smile, with its sublime immodesty, that aspiration
      seemed to Felix infinitely touching. What less could youth want in the
      very heart of Spring? And, watching her face put up to the night, her
      parted lips, and the moon-gleam fingering her white throat, he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll all come soon enough, my pretty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To think that she must come to an end like the rest, having found out
      almost nothing, having discovered just herself, and the particle of God
      that was within her! But he could not, of course, say this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to FEEL. Can&rsquo;t I begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How many millions of young creatures all the world over were sending up
      that white prayer to climb and twine toward the stars, and&mdash;fall to
      earth again! And nothing to be answered, but:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time enough, Nedda!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Dad, there are such heaps of things, such heaps of people, and
      reasons, and&mdash;and life; and I know nothing. Dreams are the only
      times, it seems to me, that one finds out anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for that, my child, I am exactly in your case. What&rsquo;s to be done for
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slid her hand through his arm again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid! I meant it. You&rsquo;re finding out much quicker than I. It&rsquo;s
      all folk-music to you still; to me Strauss and the rest of the tired
      stuff. The variations my mind spins&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t I just swap them for
      the tunes your mind is making?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem making tunes at all. I don&rsquo;t seem to have anything to make
      them of. Take me down to see &lsquo;the Tods,&rsquo; Dad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why not? And yet&mdash;! Just as in this spring night Felix felt so much,
      so very much, lying out there behind the still and moony dark, such
      marvellous holding of breath and waiting sentiency, so behind this
      innocent petition, he could not help the feeling of a lurking fatefulness.
      That was absurd. And he said: &ldquo;If you wish it, by all means. You&rsquo;ll like
      your Uncle Tod; as to the others, I can&rsquo;t say, but your aunt is an
      experience, and experiences are what you want, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fervently, without speech, Nedda squeezed his arm.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Stanley Freeland&rsquo;s country house, Becket, was almost a show place. It
      stood in its park and pastures two miles from the little town of Transham
      and the Morton Plough Works; close to the ancestral home of the Moretons,
      his mother&rsquo;s family&mdash;that home burned down by Roundheads in the Civil
      War. The site&mdash;certain vagaries in the ground&mdash;Mrs. Stanley had
      caused to be walled round, and consecrated so to speak with a stone
      medallion on which were engraved the aged Moreton arms&mdash;arrows and
      crescent moons in proper juxtaposition. Peacocks, too&mdash;that bird
      &lsquo;parlant,&rsquo; from the old Moreton crest&mdash;were encouraged to dwell there
      and utter their cries, as of passionate souls lost in too comfortable
      surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      By one of those freaks of which Nature is so prodigal, Stanley&mdash;owner
      of this native Moreton soil&mdash;least of all four Freeland brothers, had
      the Moreton cast of mind and body. That was why he made so much more money
      than the other three put together, and had been able, with the aid of
      Clara&rsquo;s undoubted genius for rank and station, to restore a strain of
      Moreton blood to its rightful position among the county families of
      Worcestershire. Bluff and without sentiment, he himself set little store
      by that, smiling up his sleeve&mdash;for he was both kindly and prudent&mdash;at
      his wife who had been a Tomson. It was not in Stanley to appreciate the
      peculiar flavor of the Moretons, that something which in spite of their
      naivete and narrowness, had really been rather fine. To him, such Moretons
      as were left were &lsquo;dry enough sticks, clean out of it.&rsquo; They were of a
      breed that was already gone, the simplest of all country gentlemen, dating
      back to the Conquest, without one solitary conspicuous ancestor, save the
      one who had been physician to a king and perished without issue&mdash;marrying
      from generation to generation exactly their own equals; living simple,
      pious, parochial lives; never in trade, never making money, having a
      tradition and a practice of gentility more punctilious than the so-called
      aristocracy; constitutionally paternal and maternal to their dependents,
      constitutionally so convinced that those dependents and all indeed who
      were not &lsquo;gentry,&rsquo; were of different clay, that they were entirely simple
      and entirely without arrogance, carrying with them even now a sort of
      Early atmosphere of archery and home-made cordials, lavender and love of
      clergy, together with frequent use of the word &lsquo;nice,&rsquo; a peculiar
      regularity of feature, and a complexion that was rather parchmenty. High
      Church people and Tories, naturally, to a man and woman, by sheer inbred
      absence of ideas, and sheer inbred conviction that nothing else was nice;
      but withal very considerate of others, really plucky in bearing their own
      ills; not greedy, and not wasteful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Becket, as it now was, they would not have approved at all. By what
      chance Edmund Moreton (Stanley&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s grandfather), in the middle of
      the eighteenth century, had suddenly diverged from family feeling and
      ideals, and taken that &lsquo;not quite nice&rsquo; resolution to make ploughs and
      money, would never now be known. The fact remained, together with the
      plough works. A man apparently of curious energy and character,
      considering his origin, he had dropped the E from his name, and&mdash;though
      he continued the family tradition so far as to marry a Fleeming of
      Worcestershire, to be paternal to his workmen, to be known as Squire, and
      to bring his children up in the older Moreton &lsquo;niceness&rsquo;&mdash;he had yet
      managed to make his ploughs quite celebrated, to found a little town, and
      die still handsome and clean-shaved at the age of sixty-six. Of his four
      sons, only two could be found sufficiently without the E to go on making
      ploughs. Stanley&rsquo;s grandfather, Stuart Morton, indeed, had tried hard, but
      in the end had reverted to the congenital instinct for being just a
      Moreton. An extremely amiable man, he took to wandering with his family,
      and died in France, leaving one daughter&mdash;Frances, Stanley&rsquo;s mother&mdash;and
      three sons, one of whom, absorbed in horses, wandered to Australia and was
      killed by falling from them; one of whom, a soldier, wandered to India,
      and the embraces of a snake; and one of whom wandered into the embraces of
      the Holy Roman Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Morton Plough Works were dry and dwindling when Stanley&rsquo;s father,
      seeking an opening for his son, put him and money into them. From that
      moment they had never looked back, and now brought Stanley, the sole
      proprietor, an income of full fifteen thousand pounds a year. He wanted
      it. For Clara, his wife, had that energy of aspiration which before now
      has raised women to positions of importance in the counties which are not
      their own, and caused, incidentally, many acres to go out of cultivation.
      Not one plough was used on the whole of Becket, not even a Morton plough&mdash;these
      indeed were unsuitable to English soil and were all sent abroad. It was
      the corner-stone of his success that Stanley had completely seen through
      the talked-of revival of English agriculture, and sedulously cultivated
      the foreign market. This was why the Becket dining-room could contain
      without straining itself large quantities of local magnates and
      celebrities from London, all deploring the condition of &lsquo;the Land,&rsquo; and
      discussing without end the regrettable position of the agricultural
      laborer. Except for literary men and painters, present in small quantities
      to leaven the lump, Becket was, in fact, a rallying point for the advanced
      spirits of Land Reform&mdash;one of those places where they were sure of
      being well done at week-ends, and of congenial and even stimulating talk
      about the undoubted need for doing something, and the designs which were
      being entertained upon &lsquo;the Land&rsquo; by either party. This very heart of
      English country that the old Moretons in their paternal way had so
      religiously farmed, making out of its lush grass and waving corn a simple
      and by no means selfish or ungenerous subsistence, was now entirely lawns,
      park, coverts, and private golf course, together with enough grass to
      support the kine which yielded that continual stream of milk necessary to
      Clara&rsquo;s entertainments and children, all female, save little Francis, and
      still of tender years. Of gardeners, keepers, cow-men, chauffeurs,
      footmen, stablemen&mdash;full twenty were supported on those fifteen
      hundred acres that formed the little Becket demesne. Of agricultural
      laborers proper&mdash;that vexed individual so much in the air, so
      reluctant to stay on &lsquo;the Land,&rsquo; and so difficult to house when he was
      there, there were fortunately none, so that it was possible for Stanley,
      whose wife meant him to &lsquo;put up&rsquo; for the Division, and his guests, who
      were frequently in Parliament, to hold entirely unbiassed and impersonal
      views upon the whole question so long as they were at Becket.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was beautiful there, too, with the bright open fields hedged with great
      elms, and that ever-rich serenity of its grass and trees. The white house,
      timbered with dark beams in true Worcestershire fashion, and added-to from
      time to time, had preserved, thanks to a fine architect, an old-fashioned
      air of spacious presidency above its gardens and lawns. On the long
      artificial lake, with innumerable rushy nooks and water-lilies and
      coverture of leaves floating flat and bright in the sun, the half-tame
      wild duck and shy water-hens had remote little worlds, and flew and
      splashed when all Becket was abed, quite as if the human spirit, with its
      monkey-tricks and its little divine flame, had not yet been born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the shade of a copper-beech, just where the drive cut through into
      its circle before the house, an old lady was sitting that afternoon on a
      campstool. She was dressed in gray alpaca, light and cool, and had on her
      iron-gray hair a piece of black lace. A number of Hearth and Home and a
      little pair of scissors, suspended by an inexpensive chain from her waist,
      rested on her knee, for she had been meaning to cut out for dear Felix a
      certain recipe for keeping the head cool; but, as a fact, she sat without
      doing so, very still, save that, now and then, she compressed her pale
      fine lips, and continually moved her pale fine hands. She was evidently
      waiting for something that promised excitement, even pleasure, for a
      little rose-leaf flush had quavered up into a face that was colored like
      parchment; and her gray eyes under regular and still-dark brows, very far
      apart, between which there was no semblance of a wrinkle, seemed noting
      little definite things about her, almost unwillingly, as an Arab&rsquo;s or a
      Red Indian&rsquo;s eyes will continue to note things in the present, however
      their minds may be set on the future. So sat Frances Fleeming Freeland
      (nee Morton) waiting for the arrival of her son Felix and her
      grandchildren Alan and Nedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      She marked presently an old man limping slowly on a stick toward where the
      drive debouched, and thought at once: &ldquo;He oughtn&rsquo;t to be coming this way.
      I expect he doesn&rsquo;t know the way round to the back. Poor man, he&rsquo;s very
      lame. He looks respectable, too.&rdquo; She got up and went toward him,
      remarking that his face with nice gray moustaches was wonderfully regular,
      almost like a gentleman&rsquo;s, and that he touched his dusty hat with quite
      old-fashioned courtesy. And smiling&mdash;her smile was sweet but critical&mdash;she
      said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the best way is to go back to that little path, and
      past the greenhouses. Have you hurt your leg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My leg&rsquo;s been like that, m&rsquo;m, fifteen year come Michaelmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ploughin&rsquo;. The bone was injured; an&rsquo; now they say the muscle&rsquo;s dried up
      in a manner of speakin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do for it? The very best thing is this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the recesses of a deep pocket, placed where no one else wore such a
      thing, she brought out a little pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must let me give it you. Put it on when you go to bed, and rub it
      well in; you&rsquo;ll find it act splendidly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man took the little pot with dubious reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, m&rsquo;m,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;thank you, m&rsquo;m.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gaunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where do you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over to Joyfields, m&rsquo;m.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joyfields&mdash;another of my sons lives there&mdash;Mr. Morton Freeland.
      But it&rsquo;s seven miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got a lift half-way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you business at the house?&rdquo; The old man was silent; the
      downcast, rather cynical look of his lined face deepened. And Frances
      Freeland thought: &lsquo;He&rsquo;s overtired. They must give him some tea and an egg.
      What can he want, coming all this way? He&rsquo;s evidently not a beggar.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man who was not a beggar spoke suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the Mr. Freeland at Joyfields. He&rsquo;s a good gentleman, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is. I wonder I don&rsquo;t know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much about, owin&rsquo; to my leg. It&rsquo;s my grand-daughter in service
      here, I come to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! What is her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gaunt her name is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t know her by her surname.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! in the kitchen; a nice, pretty girl. I hope you&rsquo;re not in trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the old man was silent, and again spoke suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as you look at it, m&rsquo;m,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a matter of a few
      words to have with her about the family. Her father he couldn&rsquo;t come, so I
      come instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how are you going to get back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to walk, I expect, without I can pick up with a cart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland compressed her lips. &ldquo;With that leg you should have come
      by train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t the fare like,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I only gets five shillin&rsquo;s a week,
      from the council, and two o&rsquo; that I pays over to my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland thrust her hand once more into that deep pocket, and as
      she did so she noticed that the old man&rsquo;s left boot was flapping open, and
      that there were two buttons off his coat. Her mind was swiftly
      calculating: &ldquo;It is more than seven weeks to quarter day. Of course I
      can&rsquo;t afford it, but I must just give him a sovereign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew her hand from the recesses of her pocket and looked at the
      old man&rsquo;s nose. It was finely chiselled, and the same yellow as his face.
      &ldquo;It looks nice, and quite sober,&rdquo; she thought. In her hand was her purse
      and a boot-lace. She took out a sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if I give you this,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must promise me not to spend any
      of it in the public-house. And this is for your boot. And you must go back
      by train. And get those buttons sewn on your coat. And tell cook, from me,
      please, to give you some tea and an egg.&rdquo; And noticing that he took the
      sovereign and the boot-lace very respectfully, and seemed altogether very
      respectable, and not at all coarse or beery-looking, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by; don&rsquo;t forget to rub what I gave you into your leg every night
      and every morning,&rdquo; and went back to her camp-stool. Sitting down on it
      with the scissors in her hand, she still did not cut out that recipe, but
      remained as before, taking in small, definite things, and feeling with an
      inner trembling that dear Felix and Alan and Nedda would soon be here; and
      the little flush rose again in her cheeks, and again her lips and hands
      moved, expressing and compressing what was in her heart. And close behind
      her, a peacock, straying from the foundations of the old Moreton house,
      uttered a cry, and moved slowly, spreading its tail under the low-hanging
      boughs of the copper-beeches, as though it knew those dark burnished
      leaves were the proper setting for its &lsquo;parlant&rsquo; magnificence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after the little conference at John&rsquo;s, Felix had indeed received
      the following note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR FELIX:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you go down to see old Tod, why not put up with us at Becket? Any
      time will suit, and the car can take you over to Joyfields when you like.
      Give the pen a rest. Clara joins in hoping you&rsquo;ll come, and Mother is
      still here. No use, I suppose, to ask Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;STANLEY.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the twenty years of his brother&rsquo;s sojourn there Felix had been down
      to Becket perhaps once a year, and latterly alone; for Flora, having
      accompanied him the first few times, had taken a firm stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I feel all body there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix had rejoined:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No bad thing, once in a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Flora had remained firm. Life was too short! She did not get on well
      with Clara. Neither did Felix feel too happy in his sister-in-law&rsquo;s
      presence; but the gray top-hat instinct had kept him going there, for one
      ought to keep in touch with one&rsquo;s brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied to Stanley:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR STANLEY:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted; if I may bring my two youngsters. We&rsquo;ll arrive to-morrow at
      four-fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours affectionately,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FELIX.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Travelling with Nedda was always jolly; one could watch her eyes noting,
      inquiring, and when occasion served, have one&rsquo;s little finger hooked in
      and squeezed. Travelling with Alan was convenient, the young man having a
      way with railways which Felix himself had long despaired of acquiring.
      Neither of the children had ever been at Becket, and though Alan was
      seldom curious, and Nedda too curious about everything to be specially so
      about this, yet Felix experienced in their company the sensations of a new
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at Transham, that little town upon a hill which the Morton Plough
      Works had created, they were soon in Stanley&rsquo;s car, whirling into the
      sleepy peace of a Worcestershire afternoon. Would this young bird nestling
      up against him echo Flora&rsquo;s verdict: &lsquo;I feel all body there!&rsquo; or would she
      take to its fatted luxury as a duck to water? And he said: &ldquo;By the way,
      your aunt&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bigwigs&rsquo; set in on a Saturday. Are you for staying and seeing
      the lions feed, or do we cut back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From Alan he got the answer he expected:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s golf or something, I suppose we can make out all right.&rdquo; From
      Nedda: &ldquo;What sort of Bigwigs are they, Dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sort you&rsquo;ve never seen, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should like to stay. Only, about dresses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What war paint have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only two white evenings. And Mums gave me her Mechlin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twill serve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Felix, Nedda in white &lsquo;evenings&rsquo; was starry and all that man could
      desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only, Dad, do tell me about them, beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I will. And God be with you. This is where Becket begins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The car had swerved into a long drive between trees not yet full-grown,
      but decorously trying to look more than their twenty years. To the right,
      about a group of older elms, rooks were in commotion, for Stanley&rsquo;s three
      keepers&rsquo; wives had just baked their annual rook pies, and the birds were
      not yet happy again. Those elms had stood there when the old Moretons
      walked past them through corn-fields to church of a Sunday. Away on the
      left above the lake, the little walled mound had come in view. Something
      in Felix always stirred at sight of it, and, squeezing Nedda&rsquo;s arm, he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that silly wall? Behind there Granny&rsquo;s ancients lived. Gone now&mdash;new
      house&mdash;new lake&mdash;new trees&mdash;new everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he saw from his little daughter&rsquo;s calm eyes that the sentiment in him
      was not in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the lake,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Granny&mdash;oh, and a peacock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother&rsquo;s embrace, with its frail energy, and the pressure of her soft,
      dry lips, filled Felix always with remorse. Why could he not give the
      simple and direct expression to his feeling that she gave to hers? He
      watched those lips transferred to Nedda, heard her say: &ldquo;Oh, my darling,
      how lovely to see you! Do you know this for midge-bites?&rdquo; A hand, diving
      deep into a pocket, returned with a little silver-coated stick having a
      bluish end. Felix saw it rise and hover about Nedda&rsquo;s forehead, and
      descend with two little swift dabs. &ldquo;It takes them away at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but Granny, they&rsquo;re not midge-bites; they&rsquo;re only from my hat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, darling; it takes away anything like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he thought: &lsquo;Mother is really wonderful!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the house the car had already disgorged their luggage. Only one man,
      but he absolutely the butler, awaited them, and they entered, at once
      conscious of Clara&rsquo;s special pot-pourri. Its fragrance steamed from blue
      china, in every nook and crevice, a sort of baptism into luxury. Clara
      herself, in the outer morning-room, smelled a little of it. Quick and dark
      of eye, capable, comely, perfectly buttoned, one of those women who know
      exactly how not to be superior to the general taste of the period. In
      addition to that great quality she was endowed with a fine nose, an
      instinct for co-ordination not to be excelled, and a genuine love of
      making people comfortable; so that it was no wonder that she had risen in
      the ranks of hostesses, till her house was celebrated for its ease, even
      among those who at their week-ends liked to feel &lsquo;all body.&rsquo; In regard to
      that characteristic of Becket, not even Felix in his ironies had ever
      stood up to Clara; the matter was too delicate. Frances Freeland, indeed&mdash;not
      because she had any philosophic preconceptions on the matter, but because
      it was &lsquo;not nice, dear, to be wasteful&rsquo; even if it were only of
      rose-leaves, or to &lsquo;have too much decoration,&rsquo; such as Japanese prints in
      places where they hum&mdash;sometimes told her daughter-in-law frankly
      what was wrong, without, however, making the faintest impression upon
      Clara, for she was not sensitive, and, as she said to Stanley, it was
      &lsquo;only Mother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had drunk that special Chinese tea, all the rage, but which no
      one really liked, in the inner morning, or afternoon room&mdash;for the
      drawing-rooms were too large to be comfortable except at week-ends&mdash;they
      went to see the children, a special blend of Stanley and Clara, save the
      little Francis, who did not seem to be entirely body. Then Clara took them
      to their rooms. She lingered kindly in Nedda&rsquo;s, feeling that the girl
      could not yet feel quite at home, and looking in the soap-dish lest she
      might not have the right verbena, and about the dressing-table to see that
      she had pins and scent, and plenty of &lsquo;pot-pourri,&rsquo; and thinking: &lsquo;The
      child is pretty&mdash;a nice girl, not like her mother.&rsquo; Explaining
      carefully how, because of the approaching week-end, she had been obliged
      to put her in &lsquo;a very simple room&rsquo; where she would be compelled to cross
      the corridor to her bath, she asked her if she had a quilted
      dressing-gown, and finding that she had not, left her saying she would
      send one&mdash;and could she do her frocks up, or should Sirrett come?
    </p>
    <p>
      Abandoned, the girl stood in the middle of the room, so far more &lsquo;simple&rsquo;
      than she had ever slept in, with its warm fragrance of rose-leaves and
      verbena, its Aubusson carpet, white silk-quilted bed, sofa, cushioned
      window-seat, dainty curtains, and little nickel box of biscuits on little
      spindly table. There she stood and sniffed, stretched herself, and
      thought: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s jolly&mdash;only, it smells too much!&rsquo; and she went up to
      the pictures, one by one. They seemed to go splendidly with the room, and
      suddenly she felt homesick. Ridiculous, of course! Yet, if she had known
      where her father&rsquo;s room was, she would have run out to it; but her memory
      was too tangled up with stairs and corridors&mdash;to find her way down to
      the hall again was all she could have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      A maid came in now with a blue silk gown very thick and soft. Could she do
      anything for Miss Freeland? No, thanks, she could not; only, did she know
      where Mr. Freeland&rsquo;s room was?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which Mr. Freeland, miss, the young or the old?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the old!&rdquo; Having said which, Nedda felt unhappy; her Dad was not old!
      &ldquo;No, miss; but I&rsquo;ll find out. It&rsquo;ll be in the walnut wing!&rdquo; But with a
      little flutter at the thought of thus setting people to run about wings,
      Nedda murmured: &ldquo;Oh! thanks, no; it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She settled down now on the cushion of the window-seat, to look out and
      take it all in, right away to that line of hills gone blue in the haze of
      the warm evening. That would be Malvern; and there, farther to the south,
      the &lsquo;Tods&rsquo; lived. &lsquo;Joyfields!&rsquo; A pretty name! And it was lovely country
      all round; green and peaceful, with its white, timbered houses and
      cottages. People must be very happy, living here&mdash;happy and quiet
      like the stars and the birds; not like the crowds in London thronging
      streets and shops and Hampstead Heath; not like the people in all those
      disgruntled suburbs that led out for miles where London ought to have
      stopped but had not; not like the thousands and thousands of those poor
      creatures in Bethnal Green, where her slum work lay. The natives here must
      surely be happy. Only, were there any natives? She had not seen any. Away
      to the right below her window were the first trees of the fruit garden;
      for many of them Spring was over, but the apple-trees had just come into
      blossom, and the low sun shining through a gap in some far elms was
      slanting on their creamy pink, christening them&mdash;Nedda thought&mdash;with
      drops of light; and lovely the blackbirds&rsquo; singing sounded in the perfect
      hush! How wonderful to be a bird, going where you would, and from high up
      in the air seeing everything; flying down a sunbeam, drinking a raindrop,
      sitting on the very top of a tall tree, running in grass so high that you
      were hidden, laying little perfect blue-green eggs, or pure-gray speckly
      ones; never changing your dress, yet always beautiful. Surely the spirit
      of the world was in the birds and the clouds, roaming, floating, and in
      the flowers and trees that never smelled anything but sweet, never looked
      anything but lovely, and were never restless. Why was one restless,
      wanting things that did not come&mdash;wanting to feel and know, wanting
      to love, and be loved? And at that thought which had come to her so
      unexpectedly&mdash;a thought never before shaped so definitely&mdash;Nedda
      planted her arms on the window-sill, with sleeves fallen down, and let her
      hands meet cup-shaped beneath her chin. Love! To have somebody with whom
      she could share everything&mdash;some one to whom and for whom she could
      give up&mdash;some one she could protect and comfort&mdash;some one who
      would bring her peace. Peace, rest&mdash;from what? Ah! that she could not
      make clear, even to herself. Love! What would love be like? Her father
      loved her, and she loved him. She loved her mother; and Alan on the whole
      was jolly to her&mdash;it was not that. What was it&mdash;where was it&mdash;when
      would it come and wake her, and kiss her to sleep, all in one? Come and
      fill her as with the warmth and color, the freshness, light, and shadow of
      this beautiful May evening, flood her as with the singing of those birds,
      and the warm light sunning the apple blossoms. And she sighed. Then&mdash;as
      with all young things whose attention after all is but as the hovering of
      a butterfly&mdash;her speculation was attracted to a thin, high-shouldered
      figure limping on a stick, away from the house, down one of the paths
      among the apple-trees. He wavered, not knowing, it seemed, his way. And
      Nedda thought: &lsquo;Poor old man, how lame he is!&rsquo; She saw him stoop,
      screened, as he evidently thought, from sight, and take something very
      small from his pocket. He gazed, rubbed it, put it back; what it was she
      could not see. Then pressing his hand down, he smoothed and stretched his
      leg. His eyes seemed closed. So a stone man might have stood! Till very
      slowly he limped on, passing out of sight. And turning from the window,
      Nedda began hurrying into her evening things.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was ready she took a long time to decide whether to wear her
      mother&rsquo;s lace or keep it for the Bigwigs. But it was so nice and creamy
      that she simply could not take it off, and stood turning and turning
      before the glass. To stand before a glass was silly and old-fashioned; but
      Nedda could never help it, wanting so badly to be nicer to look at than
      she was, because of that something that some day was coming!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was, in fact, pretty, but not merely pretty&mdash;there was in her
      face something alive and sweet, something clear and swift. She had still
      that way of a child raising its eyes very quickly and looking straight at
      you with an eager innocence that hides everything by its very wonder; and
      when those eyes looked down they seemed closed&mdash;their dark lashes
      were so long. Her eyebrows were wide apart, arching with a slight angle,
      and slanting a little down toward her nose. Her forehead under its
      burnt-brown hair was candid; her firm little chin just dimpled.
      Altogether, a face difficult to take one&rsquo;s eyes off. But Nedda was far
      from vain, and her face seemed to her too short and broad, her eyes too
      dark and indeterminate, neither gray nor brown. The straightness of her
      nose was certainly comforting, but it, too, was short. Being creamy in the
      throat and browning easily, she would have liked to be marble-white, with
      blue dreamy eyes and fair hair, or else like a Madonna. And was she tall
      enough? Only five foot five. And her arms were too thin. The only things
      that gave her perfect satisfaction were her legs, which, of course, she
      could not at the moment see; they really WERE rather jolly! Then, in a
      panic, fearing to be late, she turned and ran out, fluttering into the
      maze of stairs and corridors.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Clara, Mrs. Stanley Freeland, was not a narrow woman either in mind or
      body; and years ago, soon indeed after she married Stanley, she had
      declared her intention of taking up her sister-in-law, Kirsteen, in spite
      of what she had heard were the woman&rsquo;s extraordinary notions. Those were
      the days of carriages, pairs, coachmen, grooms, and, with her usual
      promptitude, ordering out the lot, she had set forth. It is safe to say
      she had never forgotten that experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine an old, white, timbered cottage with a thatched roof, and no
      single line about it quite straight. A cottage crazy with age, buried up
      to the thatch in sweetbrier, creepers, honeysuckle, and perched high above
      crossroads. A cottage almost unapproachable for beehives and their bees&mdash;an
      insect for which Clara had an aversion. Imagine on the rough, pebbled
      approach to the door of this cottage (and Clara had on thin shoes) a
      peculiar cradle with a dark-eyed baby that was staring placidly at two
      bees sleeping on a coverlet made of a rough linen such as Clara had never
      before seen. Imagine an absolutely naked little girl of three, sitting in
      a tub of sunlight in the very doorway. Clara had turned swiftly and closed
      the wicket gate between the pebbled pathway and the mossed steps that led
      down to where her coachman and her footman were sitting very still, as was
      the habit of those people. She had perceived at once that she was making
      no common call. Then, with real courage she had advanced, and, looking
      down at the little girl with a fearful smile, had tickled the door with
      the handle of her green parasol. A woman younger than herself, a girl,
      indeed, appeared in a low doorway. She had often told Stanley since that
      she would never forget her first sight (she had not yet had another) of
      Tod&rsquo;s wife. A brown face and black hair, fiery gray eyes, eyes all light,
      under black lashes, and &ldquo;such a strange smile;&rdquo; bare, brown, shapely arms
      and neck in a shirt of the same rough, creamy linen, and, from under a
      bright blue skirt, bare, brown, shapely ankles and feet! A voice so soft
      and deadly that, as Clara said: &ldquo;What with her eyes, it really gave me the
      shivers. And, my dear,&rdquo; she had pursued, &ldquo;white-washed walls, bare brick
      floors, not a picture, not a curtain, not even a fire-iron. Clean&mdash;oh,
      horribly! They must be the most awful cranks. The only thing I must say
      that was nice was the smell. Sweetbrier, and honey, coffee, and baked
      apples&mdash;really delicious. I must try what I can do with it. But that
      woman&mdash;girl, I suppose she is&mdash;stumped me. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d have
      cut my head off if I&rsquo;d attempted to open my mouth on ordinary topics. The
      children were rather ducks; but imagine leaving them about like that
      amongst the bees. &lsquo;Kirsteen!&rsquo; She looked it. Never again! And Tod I didn&rsquo;t
      see at all; I suppose he was mooning about amongst his creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the memory of this visit, now seventeen years ago, that had made
      her smile so indulgently when Stanley came back from the conference. She
      had said at once that they must have Felix to stay, and for her part she
      would be only too glad to do anything she could for those poor children of
      Tod&rsquo;s, even to asking them to Becket, and trying to civilize them a
      little.... &ldquo;But as for that woman, there&rsquo;ll be nothing to be done with
      her, I can assure you. And I expect Tod is completely under her thumb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Felix, who took her in to dinner, she spoke feelingly and in a low
      voice. She liked Felix, in spite of his wife, and respected him&mdash;he
      had a name. Lady Malloring&mdash;she told him&mdash;the Mallorings owned,
      of course, everything round Joyfields&mdash;had been telling her that of
      late Tod&rsquo;s wife had really become quite rabid over the land question. &lsquo;The
      Tods&rsquo; were hand in glove with all the cottagers. She, Clara, had nothing
      to say against any one who sympathized with the condition of the
      agricultural laborer; quite the contrary. Becket was almost, as Felix knew&mdash;though
      perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t for her to say so&mdash;the centre of that movement; but
      there were ways of doing things, and one did so deprecate women like this
      Kirsteen&mdash;what an impossibly Celtic name!&mdash;putting her finger
      into any pie that really was of national importance. Nothing could come of
      anything done that sort of way. If Felix had any influence with Tod it
      would be a mercy to use it in getting those poor young creatures away from
      home, to mix a little with people who took a sane view of things. She
      would like very much to get them over to Becket, but with their notions it
      was doubtful whether they had evening clothes! She had, of course, never
      forgotten that naked mite in the tub of sunlight, nor the poor baby with
      its bees and its rough linen. Felix replied deferentially&mdash;he was
      invariably polite, and only just ironic enough, in the houses of others&mdash;that
      he had the very greatest respect for Tod, and that there could be nothing
      very wrong with the woman to whom Tod was so devoted. As for the children,
      his own young people would get at them and learn all about what was going
      on in a way that no fogey like himself could. In regard to the land
      question, there were, of course, many sides to that, and he, for one,
      would not be at all sorry to observe yet another. After all, the Tods were
      in real contact with the laborers, and that was the great thing. It would
      be very interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Clara quite saw all that, but&mdash;and here she sank her voice so
      that there was hardly any left&mdash;as Felix was going over there, she
      really must put him au courant with the heart of this matter. Lady
      Malloring had told her the whole story. It appeared there were two cases:
      A family called Gaunt, an old man, and his son, who had two daughters&mdash;one
      of them, Alice, quite a nice girl, was kitchen-maid here at Becket, but
      the other sister&mdash;Wilmet&mdash;well! she was one of those girls that,
      as Felix must know, were always to be found in every village. She was
      leading the young men astray, and Lady Malloring had put her foot down,
      telling her bailiff to tell the farmer for whom Gaunt worked that he and
      his family must go, unless they sent the girl away somewhere. That was one
      case. And the other was of a laborer called Tryst, who wanted to marry his
      deceased wife&rsquo;s sister. Of course, whether Mildred Malloring was not
      rather too churchy and puritanical&mdash;now that a deceased wife&rsquo;s sister
      was legal&mdash;Clara did not want to say; but she was undoubtedly within
      her rights if she thought it for the good of the village. This man, Tryst,
      was a good workman, and his farmer had objected to losing him, but Lady
      Malloring had, of course, not given way, and if he persisted he would get
      put out. All the cottages about there were Sir Gerald Malloring&rsquo;s, so that
      in both cases it would mean leaving the neighborhood. In regard to village
      morality, as Felix knew, the line must be drawn somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix interrupted quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I draw it at Lady Malloring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t argue that with you. But it really is a scandal that Tod&rsquo;s
      wife should incite her young people to stir up the villagers. Goodness
      knows where that mayn&rsquo;t lead! Tod&rsquo;s cottage and land, you see, are
      freehold, the only freehold thereabouts; and his being a brother of
      Stanley&rsquo;s makes it particularly awkward for the Mallorings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; murmured Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but my dear Felix, when it comes to infecting those simple people
      with inflated ideas of their rights, it&rsquo;s serious, especially in the
      country. I&rsquo;m told there&rsquo;s really quite a violent feeling. I hear from
      Alice Gaunt that the young Tods have been going about saying that dogs are
      better off than people treated in this fashion, which, of course, is all
      nonsense, and making far too much of a small matter. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Felix only smiled his peculiar, sweetish smile, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have come down just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clara, who did not know that when Felix smiled like that he was angry,
      agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re an observer. You will see the thing in right
      perspective.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall endeavor to. What does Tod say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Tod never seems to say anything. At least, I never hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tod is a well in the desert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which deep saying Clara made no reply, not indeed understanding in the
      least what it might signify.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, when Alan, having had his fill of billiards, had left the
      smoking-room and gone to bed, Felix remarked to Stanley:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, what sort of people are these Mallorings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stanley, who was settling himself for the twenty minutes of whiskey,
      potash, and a Review, with which he commonly composed his mind before
      retiring, answered negligently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Mallorings? Oh! about the best type of landowner we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What exactly do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stanley took his time to answer, for below his bluff good-nature he had
      the tenacious, if somewhat slow, precision of an English man of business,
      mingled with a certain mistrust of &lsquo;old Felix.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;they build good cottages, yellow brick, d&mdash;d
      ugly, I must say; look after the character of their tenants; give &lsquo;em
      rebate of rent if there&rsquo;s a bad harvest; encourage stock-breedin&rsquo;, and
      machinery&mdash;they&rsquo;ve got some of my ploughs, but the people don&rsquo;t like
      &lsquo;em, and, as a matter of fact, they&rsquo;re right&mdash;they&rsquo;re not made for
      these small fields; set an example goin&rsquo; to church; patronize the Rifle
      Range; buy up the pubs when they can, and run &lsquo;em themselves; send out
      jelly, and let people over their place on bank holidays. Dash it all, I
      don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t do. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they liked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liked? No, I should hardly think they were liked; respected, and all
      that. Malloring&rsquo;s a steady fellow, keen man on housing, and a gentleman;
      she&rsquo;s a bit too much perhaps on the pious side. They&rsquo;ve got one of the
      finest Georgian houses in the country. Altogether they&rsquo;re what you call
      &lsquo;model.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not human.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stanley slightly lowered the Review and looked across it at his brother.
      It was evident to him that &lsquo;old Felix&rsquo; was in one of his free-thinking
      moods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re domestic,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and fond of their children, and pleasant
      neighbors. I don&rsquo;t deny that they&rsquo;ve got a tremendous sense of duty, but
      we want that in these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duty to what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stanley raised his level eyebrows. It was a stumper. Without great care he
      felt that he would be getting over the border into the uncharted land of
      speculation and philosophy, wandering on paths that led him nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you lived in the country, old man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t ask that
      sort of question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;that you or the Mallorings live in the
      country? Why, you landlords are every bit as much town dwellers as I am&mdash;thought,
      habit, dress, faith, souls, all town stuff. There IS no &lsquo;country&rsquo; in
      England now for us of the &lsquo;upper classes.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s gone. I repeat: Duty to
      what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, rising, he went over to the window, looking out at the moonlit lawn,
      overcome by a sudden aversion from more talk. Of what use were words from
      a mind tuned in one key to a mind tuned in another? And yet, so ingrained
      was his habit of discussion, that he promptly went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Mallorings, I&rsquo;ve not the slightest doubt, believe it their duty to
      look after the morals of those who live on their property. There are three
      things to be said about that: One&mdash;you can&rsquo;t make people moral by
      adopting the attitude of the schoolmaster. Two&mdash;it implies that they
      consider themselves more moral than their neighbors. Three&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
      theory so convenient to their security that they would be exceptionally
      good people if they did not adopt it; but, from your account, they are not
      so much exceptionally as just typically good people. What you call their
      sense of duty, Stanley, is really their sense of self-preservation coupled
      with their sense of superiority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Stanley; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I quite follow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always hate an odor of sanctity. I&rsquo;d prefer them to say frankly: &lsquo;This
      is my property, and you&rsquo;ll jolly well do what I tell you, on it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear chap, after all, they really ARE superior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;I emphatically question. Put your Mallorings to earn
      their living on fifteen to eighteen shillings a week, and where would they
      be? The Mallorings have certain virtues, no doubt, natural to their
      fortunate environment, but of the primitive virtues of patience,
      hardihood, perpetual, almost unconscious self-sacrifice, and cheerfulness
      in the face of a hard fate, they are no more the equals of the people they
      pretend to be superior to than I am your equal as a man of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it!&rdquo; was Stanley&rsquo;s answer, &ldquo;what a d&mdash;d old heretic you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix frowned. &ldquo;Am I? Be honest! Take the life of a Malloring and take it
      at its best; see how it stands comparison in the ordinary virtues with
      those of an averagely good specimen of a farm-laborer. Your Malloring is
      called with a cup of tea, at, say, seven o&rsquo;clock, out of a nice, clean,
      warm bed; he gets into a bath that has been got ready for him; into
      clothes and boots that have been brushed for him; and goes down to a room
      where there&rsquo;s a fire burning already if it&rsquo;s a cold day, writes a few
      letters, perhaps, before eating a breakfast of exactly what he likes,
      nicely prepared for him, and reading the newspaper that best comforts his
      soul; when he has eaten and read, he lights his cigar or his pipe and
      attends to his digestion in the most sanitary and comfortable fashion;
      then in his study he sits down to steady direction of other people, either
      by interview or by writing letters, or what not. In this way, between
      directing people and eating what he likes, he passes the whole day, except
      that for two or three hours, sometimes indeed seven or eight hours, he
      attends to his physique by riding, motoring, playing a game, or indulging
      in a sport that he has chosen for himself. And, at the end of all that, he
      probably has another bath that has been made ready for him, puts on clean
      clothes that have been put out for him, goes down to a good dinner that
      has been cooked for him, smokes, reads, learns, and inwardly digests, or
      else plays cards, billiards, and acts host till he is sleepy, and so to
      bed, in a clean, warm bed, in a clean, fresh room. Is that exaggerated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but when you talk of his directing other people, you forget that he
      is doing what they couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be doing what they couldn&rsquo;t; but ordinary directive ability is not
      born in a man; it&rsquo;s acquired by habit and training. Suppose fortune had
      reversed them at birth, the Gaunt or Tryst would by now have it and the
      Malloring would not. The accident that they were not reversed at birth has
      given the Malloring a thousandfold advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joke directing things,&rdquo; muttered Stanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No work is any joke; but I just put it to you: Simply as work, without
      taking in the question of reward, would you dream for a minute of swapping
      your work with the work of one of your workmen? No. Well, neither would a
      Malloring with one of his Gaunts. So that, my boy, for work which is
      intrinsically more interesting and pleasurable, the Malloring gets a
      hundred to a thousand times more money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is rank socialism, my dear fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; rank truth. Now, to take the life of a Gaunt. He gets up summer and
      winter much earlier out of a bed that he cannot afford time or money to
      keep too clean or warm, in a small room that probably has not a large
      enough window; into clothes stiff with work and boots stiff with clay;
      makes something hot for himself, very likely brings some of it to his wife
      and children; goes out, attending to his digestion crudely and without
      comfort; works with his hands and feet from half past six or seven in the
      morning till past five at night, except that twice he stops for an hour or
      so and eats simple things that he would not altogether have chosen to eat
      if he could have had his will. He goes home to a tea that has been got
      ready for him, and has a clean-up without assistance, smokes a pipe of
      shag, reads a newspaper perhaps two days old, and goes out again to work
      for his own good, in his vegetable patch, or to sit on a wooden bench in
      an atmosphere of beer and &lsquo;baccy.&rsquo; And so, dead tired, but not from
      directing other people, he drowses himself to early lying again in his
      doubtful bed. Is that exaggerated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not, but he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has his compensations: Clean conscience&mdash;freedom from worry&mdash;fresh
      air, all the rest of it! I know. Clean conscience granted, but so has your
      Malloring, it would seem. Freedom from worry&mdash;yes, except when a pair
      of boots is wanted, or one of the children is ill; then he has to make up
      for lost time with a vengeance. Fresh air&mdash;and wet clothes, with a
      good chance of premature rheumatism. Candidly, which of those two lives
      demands more of the virtues on which human life is founded&mdash;courage
      and patience, hardihood and self-sacrifice? And which of two men who have
      lived those two lives well has most right to the word &lsquo;superior&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stanley dropped the Review and for fully a minute paced the room without
      reply. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix, you&rsquo;re talking flat revolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix, who, faintly smiling, had watched him up and down, up and down the
      Turkey carpet, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so. I am by no means a revolutionary person, because with all the
      good-will in the world I have been unable to see how upheavals from the
      bottom, or violence of any sort, is going to equalize these lives or do
      any good. But I detest humbug, and I believe that so long as you and your
      Mallorings go on blindly dosing yourselves with humbug about duty and
      superiority, so long will you see things as they are not. And until you
      see things as they are, purged of all that sickening cant, you will none
      of you really move to make the conditions of life more and ever more just.
      For, mark you, Stanley, I, who do not believe in revolution from the
      bottom, the more believe that it is up to us in honour to revolutionize
      things from the top!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Stanley; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all very well; but the more you give the more
      they want, till there&rsquo;s no end to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix stared round that room, where indeed one was all body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve yet to see a beginning. But, anyway, if you
      give in a grudging spirit, or the spirit of a schoolmaster, what can you
      expect? If you offer out of real good-will, so it is taken.&rdquo; And suddenly
      conscious that he had uttered a constructive phrase, Felix cast down his
      eyes, and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to my clean, warm bed. Good night, old man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When his brother had taken up his candlestick and gone, Stanley, uttering
      a dubious sound, sat down on the lounge, drank deep out of his tumbler,
      and once more took up his Review.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day Stanley&rsquo;s car, fraught with Felix and a note from Clara,
      moved swiftly along the grass-bordered roads toward Joyfields. Lying back
      on the cushioned seat, the warm air flying at his face, Felix contemplated
      with delight his favorite countryside. Certainly this garden of England
      was very lovely, its greenness, trees, and large, pied, lazy cattle; its
      very emptiness of human beings even was pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearing Joyfields he noted the Mallorings&rsquo; park and their long Georgian
      house, carefully fronting south. There, too, was the pond of what village
      there was, with the usual ducks on it; and three well-remembered cottages
      in a row, neat and trim, of the old, thatched sort, but evidently
      restored. Out of the door of one of them two young people had just
      emerged, going in the same direction as the car. Felix passed them and
      turned to look. Yes, it was they! He stopped the car. They were walking,
      with eyes straight before them, frowning. And Felix thought: &lsquo;Nothing of
      Tod in either of them; regular Celts!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s vivid, open face, crisp, brown, untidy hair, cheeks brimful of
      color, thick lips, eyes that looked up and out as a Skye terrier&rsquo;s eyes
      look out of its shagginess&mdash;indeed, her whole figure struck Felix as
      almost frighteningly vital; and she walked as if she despised the ground
      she covered. The boy was even more arresting. What a strange, pale-dark
      face, with its black, uncovered hair, its straight black brows; what a
      proud, swan&rsquo;s-eyed, thin-lipped, straight-nosed young devil, marching like
      a very Highlander; though still rather run-up, from sheer youthfulness!
      They had come abreast of the car by now, and, leaning out, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember me, I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo; The boy shook his head. Wonderful
      eyes he had! But the girl put out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Derek; it&rsquo;s Uncle Felix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both smiled now, the girl friendly, the boy rather drawn back into
      himself. And feeling strangely small and ill at ease, Felix murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see your father. Can I give you a lift home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer came as he expected:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks.&rdquo; Then, as if to tone it down, the girl added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got something to do first. You&rsquo;ll find him in the orchard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had a ringing voice, full of warmth. Lifting his hat, Felix passed on.
      They WERE a couple! Strange, attractive, almost frightening. Kirsteen had
      brought his brother a formidable little brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the cottage, he went up its mossy stones and through the
      wicket gate. There was little change, indeed, since the days of Clara&rsquo;s
      visit, save that the beehives had been moved farther out. Nor did any one
      answer his knock; and mindful of the girl&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find him in the
      orchard,&rdquo; he made his way out among the trees. The grass was long and
      starred with petals. Felix wandered over it among bees busy with the
      apple-blossom. At the very end he came on his brother, cutting down a
      pear-tree. Tod was in shirt-sleeves, his brown arms bare almost to the
      shoulders. How tremendous the fellow was! What resounding and terrific
      blows he was dealing! Down came the tree, and Tod drew his arm across his
      brow. This great, burnt, curly-headed fellow was more splendid to look
      upon than even Felix had remembered, and so well built that not a movement
      of his limbs was heavy. His cheek-bones were very broad and high; his
      brows thick and rather darker than his bright hair, so that his deep-set,
      very blue eyes seemed to look out of a thicket; his level white teeth
      gleamed from under his tawny moustache, and his brown, unshaven cheeks and
      jaw seemed covered with gold powder. Catching sight of Felix, he came
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;old Gladstone spending his leisure cutting down trees&mdash;of
      all melancholy jobs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix did not quite know what to answer, so he put his arm within his
      brother&rsquo;s. Tod drew him toward the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; he said. Then, looking sorrowfully at the pear-tree, he
      murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy years&mdash;and down in seven minutes. Now we shall burn it.
      Well, it had to go. This is the third year it&rsquo;s had no blossom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His speech was slow, like that of a man accustomed to think aloud. Felix
      admired him askance. &ldquo;I might live next door,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;for all the
      notice he&rsquo;s taken of my turning up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came over in Stanley&rsquo;s car,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Met your two coming along&mdash;fine
      couple they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Tod. And there was something in the way he said it that was
      more than a mere declaration of pride or of affection. Then he looked at
      Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you come for, old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix smiled. Quaint way to put it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Tod, and he whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      A largish, well-made dog with a sleek black coat, white underneath, and a
      black tail white-tipped, came running up, and stood before Tod, with its
      head rather to one side and its yellow-brown eyes saying: &lsquo;I simply must
      get at what you&rsquo;re thinking, you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and tell your mistress to come&mdash;Mistress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog moved his tail, lowered it, and went off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gypsy gave him to me,&rdquo; said Tod; &ldquo;best dog that ever lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one thinks that of his own dog, old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tod; &ldquo;but this IS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks intelligent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a soul,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;The gypsy said he didn&rsquo;t steal him, but he
      did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you always know when people aren&rsquo;t speaking the truth, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At such a monstrous remark from any other man, Felix would have smiled;
      but seeing it was Tod, he only asked: &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People who aren&rsquo;t speaking the truth look you in the face and never move
      their eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people do that when they are speaking the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but when they aren&rsquo;t, you can see them struggling to keep their eyes
      straight. A dog avoids your eye when he&rsquo;s something to conceal; a man
      stares at you. Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix listened and heard nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wren;&rdquo; and, screwing up his lips, Tod emitted a sound: &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix saw on the branch of an apple-tree a tiny brown bird with a little
      beak sticking out and a little tail sticking up. And he thought: &lsquo;Tod&rsquo;s
      hopeless!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow,&rdquo; said Tod softly, &ldquo;has got his nest there just behind us.&rdquo;
       Again he emitted the sound. Felix saw the little bird move its head with a
      sort of infinite curiosity, and hop twice on the branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get the hen to do that,&rdquo; Tod murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix put his hand on his brother&rsquo;s arm&mdash;what an arm!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but look here, old man&mdash;I really want to talk to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tod shook his head. &ldquo;Wait for her,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix waited. Tod was getting awfully eccentric, living this queer,
      out-of-the-way life with a cranky woman year after year; never reading
      anything, never seeing any one but tramps and animals and villagers. And
      yet, sitting there beside his eccentric brother on that fallen tree, he
      had an extraordinary sense of rest. It was, perhaps, but the beauty and
      sweetness of the day with its dappling sunlight brightening the
      apple-blossoms, the wind-flowers, the wood-sorrel, and in the blue sky
      above the fields those clouds so unimaginably white. All the tiny noises
      of the orchard, too, struck on his ear with a peculiar meaning, a strange
      fulness, as if he had never heard such sounds before. Tod, who was looking
      at the sky, said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Felix remembered that they never had any proper meals, but, when
      hungry, went to the kitchen, where a wood-fire was always burning, and
      either heated up coffee, and porridge that was already made, with boiled
      eggs and baked potatoes and apples, or devoured bread, cheese, jam, honey,
      cream, tomatoes, butter, nuts, and fruit, that were always set out there
      on a wooden table, under a muslin awning; he remembered, too, that they
      washed up their own bowls and spoons and plates, and, having finished,
      went outside and drew themselves a draught of water. Queer life, and
      deuced uncomfortable&mdash;almost Chinese in its reversal of everything
      that every one else was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am. Here she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix felt his heart beating&mdash;Clara was not alone in being frightened
      of this woman. She was coming through the orchard with the dog; a
      remarkable-looking woman&mdash;oh, certainly remarkable! She greeted him
      without surprise and, sitting down close to Tod, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why did this family somehow make him feel inferior? The way she sat there
      and looked at him so calmly! Still more the way she narrowed her eyes and
      wrinkled her lips, as if rather malicious thoughts were rising in her
      soul! Her hair, as is the way of fine, soft, almost indigo-colored hair,
      was already showing threads of silver; her whole face and figure thinner
      than he had remembered. But a striking woman still&mdash;with wonderful
      eyes! Her dress&mdash;Felix had scanned many a crank in his day&mdash;was
      not so alarming as it had once seemed to Clara; its coarse-woven,
      deep-blue linen and needle-worked yoke were pleasing to him, and he could
      hardly take his gaze from the kingfisher-blue band or fillet that she wore
      round that silver-threaded black hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began by giving her Clara&rsquo;s note, the wording of which he had himself
      dictated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR KIRSTEEN:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though we have not seen each other for so long, I am sure you will
      forgive my writing. It would give us so much pleasure if you and the two
      children would come over for a night or two while Felix and his young folk
      are staying with us. It is no use, I fear, to ask Tod; but of course if he
      would come, too, both Stanley and myself would be delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours cordially,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;CLARA FREELAND.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read it, handed it to Tod, who also read it and handed it to Felix.
      Nobody said anything. It was so altogether simple and friendly a note that
      Felix felt pleased with it, thinking: &lsquo;I expressed that well!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tod said: &ldquo;Go ahead, old man! You&rsquo;ve got something to say about the
      youngsters, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How on earth did he know that? But then Tod HAD a sort of queer
      prescience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he brought out with an effort, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a pity to
      embroil your young people in village troubles? We&rsquo;ve been hearing from
      Stanley&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen interrupted in her calm, staccato voice with just the faintest
      lisp:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stanley would not understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had put her arm through Tod&rsquo;s, but never removed her eyes from her
      brother-in-law&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;but you must remember that Stanley, John, and
      myself represent ordinary&mdash;what shall we say&mdash;level-headed
      opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With which we have nothing in common, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix glanced from her to Tod. The fellow had his head on one side and
      seemed listening to something in the distance. And Felix felt a certain
      irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I think you really have got to look at
      your children&rsquo;s future from a larger point of view. You don&rsquo;t surely want
      them to fly out against things before they&rsquo;ve had a chance to see life for
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The children know more of life than most young people. They&rsquo;ve seen it
      close to, they&rsquo;ve seen its realities. They know what the tyranny of the
      countryside means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;but youth is youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not too young to know and feel the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix was impressed. How those narrowing eyes shone! What conviction in
      that faintly lisping voice!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a fool for my pains,&rsquo; he thought, and only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what about this invitation, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it will be just the thing for them at the moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words had to Felix a somewhat sinister import. He knew well enough
      that she did not mean by them what others would have meant. But he said:
      &ldquo;When shall we expect them? Tuesday, I suppose, would be best for Clara,
      after her weekend. Is there no chance of you and Tod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She quaintly wrinkled her lips into not quite a smile, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tod shall say. Do you hear, Tod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meadow. It was there yesterday&mdash;first time this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix slipped his arm through his brother&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;Ah! let&rsquo;s go in. I&rsquo;m awfully hungry....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes out of a calm sky a few drops fall, the twigs rustle, and far
      away is heard the muttering of thunder; the traveller thinks: &lsquo;A storm
      somewhere about.&rsquo; Then all once more is so quiet and peaceful that he
      forgets he ever had that thought, and goes on his way careless.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with Felix returning to Becket in Stanley&rsquo;s car. That woman&rsquo;s face,
      those two young heathens&mdash;the unconscious Tod!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was mischief in the air above that little household. But once more
      the smooth gliding of the cushioned car, the soft peace of the meadows so
      permanently at grass, the churches, mansions, cottages embowered among
      their elms, the slow-flapping flight of the rooks and crows lulled Felix
      to quietude, and the faint far muttering of that thunder died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nedda was in the drive when he returned, gazing at a nymph set up there by
      Clara. It was a good thing, procured from Berlin, well known for
      sculpture, and beginning to green over already, as though it had been
      there a long time&mdash;a pretty creature with shoulders drooping, eyes
      modestly cast down, and a sparrow perching on her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Tuesday&mdash;the youngsters, only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might tell me a little about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Felix only smiled. His powers of description faltered before that
      task; and, proud of those powers, he did not choose to subject them to
      failure.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not till three o&rsquo;clock that Saturday did the Bigwigs begin to come. Lord
      and Lady Britto first from Erne by car; then Sir Gerald and Lady
      Malloring, also by car from Joyfields; an early afternoon train brought
      three members of the Lower House, who liked a round of golf&mdash;Colonel
      Martlett, Mr. Sleesor, and Sir John Fanfar&mdash;with their wives; also
      Miss Bawtrey, an American who went everywhere; and Moorsome, the
      landscape-painter, a short, very heavy man who went nowhere, and that in
      almost perfect silence, which he afterward avenged. By a train almost sure
      to bring no one else came Literature in Public Affairs, alone, Henry
      Wiltram, whom some believed to have been the very first to have ideas
      about the land. He was followed in the last possible train by Cuthcott,
      the advanced editor, in his habitual hurry, and Lady Maude Ughtred in her
      beauty. Clara was pleased, and said to Stanley, while dressing, that
      almost every shade of opinion about the land was represented this
      week-end. She was not, she said, afraid of anything, if she could keep
      Henry Wiltram and Cuthcott apart. The House of Commons men would, of
      course, be all right. Stanley assented: &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be &lsquo;fed up&rsquo; with talk.
      But how about Britto&mdash;he can sometimes be very nasty, and Cuthcott&rsquo;s
      been pretty rough on him, in his rag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clara had remembered that, and she was putting Lady Maude on one side of
      Cuthcott, and Moorsome on the other, so that he would be quite safe at
      dinner, and afterward&mdash;Stanley must look out!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done with Nedda?&rdquo; Stanley asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Given her to Colonel Martlett, with Sir John Fanfar on the other side;
      they both like something fresh.&rdquo; She hoped, however, to foster a
      discussion, so that they might really get further this week-end; the
      opportunity was too good to throw away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; Stanley murmured. &ldquo;Felix said some very queer things the other
      night. He, too, might make ructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, no!&mdash;Clara persisted&mdash;Felix had too much good taste. She
      thought that something might be coming out of this occasion, something as
      it were national, that would bear fruit. And watching Stanley buttoning
      his braces, she grew enthusiastic. For, think how splendidly everything
      was represented! Britto, with his view that the thing had gone too far,
      and all the little efforts we might make now were no good, with Canada and
      those great spaces to outbid anything we could do; though she could not
      admit that he was right, there was a lot in what he said; he had great
      gifts&mdash;and some day might&mdash;who knew? Then there was Sir John&mdash;Clara
      pursued&mdash;who was almost the father of the new Tory policy: Assist the
      farmers to buy their own land. And Colonel Martlett, representing the
      older Tory policy of: What the devil would happen to the landowners if
      they did? Secretly (Clara felt sure) he would never go into a lobby to
      support that. He had said to her: &lsquo;Look at my brother James&rsquo;s property; if
      we bring this policy in, and the farmers take advantage, his house might
      stand there any day without an acre round it.&rsquo; Quite true&mdash;it might.
      The same might even happen to Becket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanley grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly!&mdash;Clara went on: And that was the beauty of having got the
      Mallorings; theirs was such a steady point of view, and she was not sure
      that they weren&rsquo;t right, and the whole thing really a question of model
      proprietorship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; Stanley muttered. &ldquo;Felix will have his knife into that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clara did not think that mattered. The thing was to get everybody&rsquo;s
      opinion. Even Mr. Moorsome&rsquo;s would be valuable&mdash;if he weren&rsquo;t so
      terrifically silent, for he must think a lot, sitting all day, as he did,
      painting the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a heavy ass,&rdquo; said Stanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; but Clara did not wish to be narrow. That was why it was so splendid
      to have got Mr. Sleesor. If anybody knew the Radical mind he did, and he
      could give full force to what one always felt was at the bottom of it&mdash;that
      the Radicals&rsquo; real supporters were the urban classes; so that their policy
      must not go too far with &lsquo;the Land,&rsquo; for fear of seeming to neglect the
      towns. For, after all, in the end it was out of the pockets of the towns
      that &lsquo;the Land&rsquo; would have to be financed, and nobody really could expect
      the towns to get anything out of it. Stanley paused in the adjustment of
      his tie; his wife was a shrewd woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Wiltram will give it him hot on that,
      though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Clara assented. And it was magnificent that they had got Henry
      Wiltram, with his idealism and his really heavy corn tax; not caring what
      happened to the stunted products of the towns&mdash;and they truly were
      stunted, for all that the Radicals and the half-penny press said&mdash;till
      at all costs we could grow our own food. There was a lot in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Stanley muttered, &ldquo;and if he gets on to it, shan&rsquo;t I have a jolly
      time of it in the smoking-room? I know what Cuthcott&rsquo;s like with his shirt
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clara&rsquo;s eyes brightened; she was very curious herself to see Mr. Cuthcott
      with his&mdash;that is, to hear him expound the doctrine he was always
      writing up, namely, that &lsquo;the Land&rsquo; was gone and, short of revolution,
      there was nothing for it but garden cities. She had heard he was so
      cutting and ferocious that he really did seem as if he hated his
      opponents. She hoped he would get a chance&mdash;perhaps Felix could
      encourage him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the women?&rdquo; Stanley asked suddenly. &ldquo;Will they stand a
      political powwow? One must think of them a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clara had. She was taking a farewell look at herself in the far-away
      mirror through the door into her bedroom. It was a mistake&mdash;she added&mdash;to
      suppose that women were not interested in &lsquo;the Land.&rsquo; Lady Britto was most
      intelligent, and Mildred Malloring knew every cottage on her estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pokes her nose into &lsquo;em often enough,&rdquo; Stanley muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Fanfar again, and Mrs. Sleesor, and even Hilda Martlett, were
      interested in their husbands, and Miss Bawtrey, of course, interested in
      everything. As for Maude Ughtred, all talk would be the same to her; she
      was always week-ending. Stanley need not worry&mdash;it would be all
      right; some real work would get done, some real advance be made. So
      saying, she turned her fine shoulders twice, once this way and once that,
      and went out. She had never told even Stanley her ambition that at Becket,
      under her aegis, should be laid the foundation-stone of the real scheme,
      whatever it might be, that should regenerate &lsquo;the Land.&rsquo; Stanley would
      only have laughed; even though it would be bound to make him Lord Freeland
      when it came to be known some day....
    </p>
    <p>
      To the eyes and ears of Nedda that evening at dinner, all was new indeed,
      and all wonderful. It was not that she was unaccustomed to society or to
      conversation, for to their house at Hampstead many people came, uttering
      many words, but both the people and the words were so very different.
      After the first blush, the first reconnaissance of the two Bigwigs between
      whom she sat, her eyes WOULD stray and her ears would only half listen to
      them. Indeed, half her ears, she soon found out, were quite enough to deal
      with Colonel Martlett and Sir John Fanfar. Across the azaleas she let her
      glance come now and again to anchor on her father&rsquo;s face, and exchanged
      with him a most enjoyable blink. She tried once or twice to get through to
      Alan, but he was always eating; he looked very like a young Uncle Stanley
      this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was she feeling? Short, quick stabs of self-consciousness as to how
      she was looking; a sort of stunned excitement due to sheer noise and the
      number of things offered to her to eat and drink; keen pleasure in the
      consciousness that Colonel Martlett and Sir John Fanfar and other men,
      especially that nice one with the straggly moustache who looked as if he
      were going to bite, glanced at her when they saw she wasn&rsquo;t looking. If
      only she had been quite certain that it was not because they thought her
      too young to be there! She felt a sort of continual exhilaration, that
      this was the great world&mdash;the world where important things were said
      and done, together with an intense listening expectancy, and a sense most
      unexpected and almost frightening, that nothing important was being said
      or would be done. But this she knew to be impudent. On Sunday evenings at
      home people talked about a future existence, about Nietzsche, Tolstoy,
      Chinese pictures, post-impressionism, and would suddenly grow hot and
      furious about peace, and Strauss, justice, marriage, and De Maupassant,
      and whether people were losing their souls through materialism, and
      sometimes one of them would get up and walk about the room. But to-night
      the only words she could catch were the names of two politicians whom
      nobody seemed to approve of, except that nice one who was going to bite.
      Once very timidly she asked Colonel Martlett whether he liked Strauss, and
      was puzzled by his answer: &ldquo;Rather; those &lsquo;Tales of Hoffmann&rsquo; are rippin&rsquo;,
      don&rsquo;t you think? You go to the opera much?&rdquo; She could not, of course, know
      that the thought which instantly rose within her was doing the governing
      classes a grave injustice&mdash;almost all of whom save Colonel Martlett
      knew that the &lsquo;Tales of Hoffmann&rsquo; were by one Offenbach. But beyond all
      things she felt she would never, never learn to talk as they were all
      talking&mdash;so quickly, so continuously, so without caring whether
      everybody or only the person they were talking to heard what they said.
      She had always felt that what you said was only meant for the person you
      said it to, but here in the great world she must evidently not say
      anything that was not meant for everybody, and she felt terribly that she
      could not think of anything of that sort to say. And suddenly she began to
      want to be alone. That, however, was surely wicked and wasteful, when she
      ought to be learning such a tremendous lot; and yet, what was there to
      learn? And listening just sufficiently to Colonel Martlett, who was
      telling her how great a man he thought a certain general, she looked
      almost despairingly at the one who was going to bite. He was quite silent
      at that moment, gazing at his plate, which was strangely empty. And Nedda
      thought: &lsquo;He has jolly wrinkles about his eyes, only they might be heart
      disease; and I like the color of his face, so nice and yellow, only that
      might be liver. But I DO like him&mdash;I wish I&rsquo;d been sitting next to
      him; he looks real.&rsquo; From that thought, of the reality of a man whose name
      she did not know, she passed suddenly into the feeling that nothing else
      of this about her was real at all, neither the talk nor the faces, not
      even the things she was eating. It was all a queer, buzzing dream. Nor did
      that sensation of unreality cease when her aunt began collecting her
      gloves, and they trooped forth to the drawing-room. There, seated between
      Mrs. Sleesor and Lady Britto, with Lady Malloring opposite, and Miss
      Bawtrey leaning over the piano toward them, she pinched herself to get rid
      of the feeling that, when all these were out of sight of each other, they
      would become silent and have on their lips a little, bitter smile. Would
      it be like that up in their bedrooms, or would it only be on her (Nedda&rsquo;s)
      own lips that this little smile would come? It was a question she could
      not answer; nor could she very well ask it of any of these ladies. She
      looked them over as they sat there talking and felt very lonely. And
      suddenly her eyes fell on her grandmother. Frances Freeland was seated
      halfway down the long room in a sandalwood chair, somewhat insulated by a
      surrounding sea of polished floor. She sat with a smile on her lips, quite
      still, save for the continual movement of her white hands on her black
      lap. To her gray hair some lace of Chantilly was pinned with a little
      diamond brooch, and hung behind her delicate but rather long ears. And
      from her shoulders was depended a silvery garment, of stuff that looked
      like the mail shirt of a fairy, reaching the ground on either side. A
      tacit agreement had evidently been come to, that she was incapable of
      discussing &lsquo;the Land&rsquo; or those other subjects such as the French murder,
      the Russian opera, the Chinese pictures, and the doings of one, L&mdash;&mdash;
      , whose fate was just then in the air, so that she sat alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Nedda thought: &lsquo;How much more of a lady she looks than anybody here!
      There&rsquo;s something deep in her to rest on that isn&rsquo;t in the Bigwigs;
      perhaps it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s of a different generation.&rsquo; And, getting up,
      she went over and sat down beside her on a little chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland rose at once and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my darling, you can&rsquo;t be comfortable in that tiny chair. You must
      take mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Granny; please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; but you must! It&rsquo;s so comfortable, and I&rsquo;ve simply been longing
      to sit in the chair you&rsquo;re in. Now, darling, to please me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that a prolonged struggle would follow if she did not get up, Nedda
      rose and changed chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like these week-ends, Granny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland seemed to draw her smile more resolutely across her face.
      With her perfect articulation, in which there was, however, no trace of
      bigwiggery, she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re most interesting, darling. It&rsquo;s so nice to see new
      people. Of course you don&rsquo;t get to know them, but it&rsquo;s very amusing to
      watch, especially the head-dresses!&rdquo; And sinking her voice: &ldquo;Just look at
      that one with the feather going straight up; did you ever see such a guy?&rdquo;
       and she cackled with a very gentle archness. Gazing at that almost
      priceless feather, trying to reach God, Nedda felt suddenly how completely
      she was in her grandmother&rsquo;s little camp; how entirely she disliked
      bigwiggery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland&rsquo;s voice brought her round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, darling, I&rsquo;ve found the most splendid thing for eyebrows?
      You just put a little on every night and it keeps them in perfect order. I
      must give you my little pot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like grease, Granny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but this isn&rsquo;t grease, darling. It&rsquo;s a special thing; and you only
      put on just the tiniest touch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diving suddenly into the recesses of something, she produced an exiguous
      round silver box. Prizing it open, she looked over her shoulder at the
      Bigwigs, then placed her little finger on the contents of the little box,
      and said very softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just take the merest touch, and you put it on like that, and it keeps
      them together beautifully. Let me! Nobody&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite well understanding that this was all part of her grandmother&rsquo;s
      passion for putting the best face upon things, and having no belief in her
      eyebrows, Nedda bent forward; but in a sudden flutter of fear lest the
      Bigwigs might observe the operation, she drew back, murmuring: &ldquo;Oh,
      Granny, darling! Not just now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the men came in, and, under cover of the necessary
      confusion, she slipped away into the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pitch-black outside, with the moon not yet up. The bloomy, peaceful
      dark out there! Wistaria and early roses, clustering in, had but the ghost
      of color on their blossoms. Nedda took a rose in her fingers, feeling with
      delight its soft fragility, its coolness against her hot palm. Here in her
      hand was a living thing, here was a little soul! And out there in the
      darkness were millions upon millions of other little souls, of little
      flame-like or coiled-up shapes alive and true.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice behind her said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing nicer than darkness, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew at once it was the one who was going to bite; the voice was
      proper for him, having a nice, smothery sound. And looking round
      gratefully, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like dinner-parties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was jolly to watch his eyes twinkle and his thin cheeks puff out. He
      shook his head and muttered through that straggly moustache:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a niece, aren&rsquo;t you? I know your father. He&rsquo;s a big man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing those words spoken of her father, Nedda flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is,&rdquo; she said fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her new acquaintance went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the gift of truth&mdash;can laugh at himself as well as others;
      that&rsquo;s what makes him precious. These humming-birds here to-night couldn&rsquo;t
      raise a smile at their own tomfoolery to save their silly souls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke still in that voice of smothery wrath, and Nedda thought: &lsquo;He IS
      nice!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been talking about &lsquo;the Land&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;he raised his hands and ran
      them through his palish hair&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;the Land!&rsquo; Heavenly Father! &lsquo;The
      Land!&rsquo; Why! Look at that fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda looked and saw a man, like Richard Coeur de Lion in the history
      books, with a straw-colored moustache just going gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Gerald Malloring&mdash;hope he&rsquo;s not a friend of yours! Divine right
      of landowners to lead &lsquo;the Land&rsquo; by the nose! And our friend Britto!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda, following his eyes, saw a robust, quick-eyed man with a suave
      insolence in his dark, clean-shaved face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because at heart he&rsquo;s just a supercilious ruffian, too cold-blooded to
      feel, he&rsquo;ll demonstrate that it&rsquo;s no use to feel&mdash;waste of valuable
      time&mdash;ha! valuable!&mdash;to act in any direction. And that&rsquo;s a man
      they believe things of. And poor Henry Wiltram, with his pathetic: &lsquo;Grow
      our own food&mdash;maximum use of the land as food-producer, and let the
      rest take care of itself!&rsquo; As if we weren&rsquo;t all long past that feeble
      individualism; as if in these days of world markets the land didn&rsquo;t stand
      or fall in this country as a breeding-ground of health and stamina and
      nothing else. Well, well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they really in earnest, then?&rdquo; asked Nedda timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Freeland, this land question is a perfect tragedy. Bar one or two,
      they all want to make the omelette without breaking eggs; well, by the
      time they begin to think of breaking them, mark me&mdash;there&rsquo;ll be no
      eggs to break. We shall be all park and suburb. The real men on the land,
      what few are left, are dumb and helpless; and these fellows here for one
      reason or another don&rsquo;t mean business&mdash;they&rsquo;ll talk and tinker and
      top-dress&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Does your father take any interest in this? He
      could write something very nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He takes interest in everything,&rdquo; said Nedda. &ldquo;Please go on, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&rdquo;
       She was terribly afraid he would suddenly remember that she was too young
      and stop his nice, angry talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cuthcott. I&rsquo;m an editor, but I was brought up on a farm, and know
      something about it. You see, we English are grumblers, snobs to the
      backbone, want to be something better than we are; and education nowadays
      is all in the direction of despising what is quiet and humdrum. We never
      were a stay-at-home lot, like the French. That&rsquo;s at the back of this
      business&mdash;they may treat it as they like, Radicals or Tories, but if
      they can&rsquo;t get a fundamental change of opinion into the national mind as
      to what is a sane and profitable life; if they can&rsquo;t work a revolution in
      the spirit of our education, they&rsquo;ll do no good. There&rsquo;ll be lots of talk
      and tinkering, tariffs and tommy-rot, and, underneath, the land-bred men
      dying, dying all the time. No, madam, industrialism and vested interests
      have got us! Bar the most strenuous national heroism, there&rsquo;s nothing for
      it now but the garden city!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if we WERE all heroic, &lsquo;the Land&rsquo; could still be saved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cuthcott smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we might have a European war or something that would shake
      everything up. But, short of that, when was a country ever consciously and
      homogeneously heroic&mdash;except China with its opium? When did it ever
      deliberately change the spirit of its education, the trend of its ideas;
      when did it ever, of its own free will, lay its vested interests on the
      altar; when did it ever say with a convinced and resolute heart: &lsquo;I will
      be healthy and simple before anything. I will not let the love of sanity
      and natural conditions die out of me!&rsquo; When, Miss Freeland, when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, looking so hard at Nedda that he almost winked, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the advantage of me by thirty years. You&rsquo;ll see what I shall not&mdash;the
      last of the English peasant. Did you ever read &lsquo;Erewhon,&rsquo; where the people
      broke up their machines? It will take almost that sort of national heroism
      to save what&rsquo;s left of him, even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer, Nedda wrinkled her brows horribly. Before her there had come a
      vision of the old, lame man, whose name she had found out was Gaunt,
      standing on the path under the apple-trees, looking at that little
      something he had taken from his pocket. Why she thought of him thus
      suddenly she had no idea, and she said quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully interesting. I do so want to hear about &lsquo;the Land.&rsquo; I only
      know a little about sweated workers, because I see something of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all of a piece,&rdquo; said Mr. Cuthcott; &ldquo;not politics at all, but
      religion&mdash;touches the point of national self-knowledge and faith, the
      point of knowing what we want to become and of resolving to become it.
      Your father will tell you that we have no more idea of that at present
      than a cat of its own chemical composition. As for these good people here
      to-night&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to be disrespectful, but if they think they&rsquo;re
      within a hundred miles of the land question, I&rsquo;m a&mdash;I&rsquo;m a Jingo&mdash;more
      I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as if to cool his head, he leaned out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is nicer than darkness, as I said just now, because you can only
      see the way you MUST go instead of a hundred and fifty ways you MIGHT. In
      darkness your soul is something like your own; in daylight, lamplight,
      moonlight, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda&rsquo;s spirit gave a jump; he seemed almost at last to be going to talk
      about the things she wanted, above all, to find out. Her cheeks went hot,
      she clenched her hands and said resolutely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cuthcott, do you believe in God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cuthcott made a queer, deep little noise; it was not a laugh, however,
      and it seemed as if he knew she could not bear him to look at her just
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every one does that&mdash;according to their natures.
      Some call God IT, some HIM, some HER, nowadays&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. You might
      as well ask&mdash;do I believe that I&rsquo;m alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Nedda, &ldquo;but which do YOU call God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she asked that, he gave a wriggle, and it flashed through her: &lsquo;He must
      think me an awful enfant terrible!&rsquo; His face peered round at her, queer
      and pale and puffy, with nice, straight eyes; and she added hastily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a fair question, is it? Only you talked about darkness, and the
      only way&mdash;so I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a fair question. My answer is, of course: &lsquo;All three&rsquo;; but the
      point is rather: Does one wish to make even an attempt to define God to
      oneself? Frankly, I don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m content to feel that there is in one some
      kind of instinct toward perfection that one will still feel, I hope, when
      the lights are going out; some kind of honour forbidding one to let go and
      give up. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got; I really don&rsquo;t know that I want more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda clasped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;only&mdash;what is perfection, Mr. Cuthcott?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he emitted that deep little sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;what is perfection? Awkward, that&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&rdquo;&mdash;Nedda rushed the words out&mdash;&ldquo;is it always to be
      sacrificing yourself, or is it&mdash;is it always to be&mdash;to be
      expressing yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To some&mdash;one; to some&mdash;the other; to some&mdash;half one, half
      the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But which is it to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that you&rsquo;ve got to find out for yourself. There&rsquo;s a sort of metronome
      inside us&mdash;wonderful, sell-adjusting little machine; most delicate
      bit of mechanism in the world&mdash;people call it conscience&mdash;that
      records the proper beat of our tempos. I guess that&rsquo;s all we have to go
      by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda said breathlessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and it&rsquo;s frightfully hard, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Mr. Cuthcott answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why people devised religions and
      other ways of having the thing done second-hand. We all object to trouble
      and responsibility if we can possibly avoid it. Where do you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Hampstead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father must be a stand-by, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; Dad&rsquo;s splendid; only, you see, I AM a good deal younger than he.
      There was just one thing I was going to ask you. Are these very Bigwigs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cuthcott turned to the room and let his screwed-up glance wander. He
      looked just then particularly as if he were going to bite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you take &lsquo;em at their own valuation: Yes. If at the country&rsquo;s: So-so.
      If at mine: Ha! I know what you&rsquo;d like to ask: Should I be a Bigwig in
      THEIR estimation? Not I! As you knock about, Miss Freeland, you&rsquo;ll find
      out one thing&mdash;all bigwiggery is founded on: Scratch my back, and
      I&rsquo;ll scratch yours. Seriously, these are only tenpenny ones; but the
      mischief is, that in the matter of &lsquo;the Land,&rsquo; the men who really are in
      earnest are precious scarce. Nothing short of a rising such as there was
      in 1832 would make the land question real, even for the moment. Not that I
      want to see one&mdash;God forbid! Those poor doomed devils were treated
      worse than dogs, and would be again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Nedda could pour out questions about the rising in 1832, Stanley&rsquo;s
      voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cuthcott, I want to introduce you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her new friend screwed his eyes up tighter and, muttering something, put
      out his hand to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for our talk. I hope we shall meet again. Any time you want to
      know anything&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be only too glad. Good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt the squeeze of his hand, warm and dry, but rather soft, as of a
      man who uses a pen too much; saw him following her uncle across the room,
      with his shoulders a little hunched, as if preparing to inflict, and ward
      off, blows. And with the thought: &lsquo;He must be jolly when he gives them
      one!&rsquo; she turned once more to the darkness, than which he had said there
      was nothing nicer. It smelled of new-mown grass, was full of little
      shiverings of leaves, and all colored like the bloom of a black grape. And
      her heart felt soothed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;...When I first saw Derek I thought I should never feel anything but shy
      and hopeless. In four days, only in four days, the whole world is
      different.... And yet, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for that thunder-storm, I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have got over being shy in time. He has never loved anybody&mdash;nor
      have I. It can&rsquo;t often be like that&mdash;it makes it solemn. There&rsquo;s a
      picture somewhere&mdash;not a good one, I know&mdash;of a young Highlander
      being taken away by soldiers from his sweetheart. Derek is fiery and wild
      and shy and proud and dark&mdash;like the man in that picture. That last
      day along the hills&mdash;along and along&mdash;with the wind in our
      faces, I could have walked forever; and then Joyfields at the end! Their
      mother&rsquo;s wonderful; I&rsquo;m afraid of her. But Uncle Tod is a perfect dear. I
      never saw any one before who noticed so many things that I didn&rsquo;t, and
      nothing that I did. I am sure he has in him what Mr. Cuthcott said we were
      all losing&mdash;the love of simple, natural conditions. And then, THE
      moment, when I stood with Derek at the end of the orchard, to say good-by.
      The field below covered with those moony-white flowers, and the cows all
      dark and sleepy; the holy feeling down there was wonderful, and in the
      branches over our heads, too, and the velvety, starry sky, and the
      dewiness against one&rsquo;s face, and the great, broad silence&mdash;it was all
      worshipping something, and I was worshipping&mdash;worshipping happiness.
      I WAS happy, and I think HE was. Perhaps I shall never be so happy again.
      When he kissed me I didn&rsquo;t think the whole world had so much happiness in
      it. I know now that I&rsquo;m not cold a bit; I used to think I was. I believe I
      could go with him anywhere, and do anything he wanted. What would Dad
      think? Only the other day I was saying I wanted to know everything. One
      only knows through love. It&rsquo;s love that makes the world all beautiful&mdash;makes
      it like those pictures that seem to be wrapped in gold, makes it like a
      dream&mdash;no, not like a dream&mdash;like a wonderful tune. I suppose
      that&rsquo;s glamour&mdash;a goldeny, misty, lovely feeling, as if my soul were
      wandering about with his&mdash;not in my body at all. I want it to go on
      and on wandering&mdash;oh! I don&rsquo;t want it back in my body, all hard and
      inquisitive and aching! I shall never know anything so lovely as loving
      him and being loved. I don&rsquo;t want anything more&mdash;nothing! Stay with
      me, please&mdash;Happiness! Don&rsquo;t go away and leave me!... They frighten
      me, though; he frightens me&mdash;their idealism; wanting to do great
      things, and fight for justice. If only I&rsquo;d been brought up more like that&mdash;but
      everything&rsquo;s been so different. It&rsquo;s their mother, I think, even more than
      themselves. I seem to have grown up just looking on at life as at a show;
      watching it, thinking about it, trying to understand&mdash;not living it
      at all. I must get over that; I will. I believe I can tell the very moment
      I began to love him. It was in the schoolroom the second evening. Sheila
      and I were sitting there just before dinner, and he came, in a rage,
      looking splendid. &lsquo;That footman put out everything just as if I were a
      baby&mdash;asked me for suspenders to fasten on my socks; hung the things
      on a chair in order, as if I couldn&rsquo;t find out for myself what to put on
      first; turned the tongues of my shoes out!&mdash;curled them over!&rsquo; Then
      Derek looked at me and said: &lsquo;Do they do that for you?&mdash;And poor old
      Gaunt, who&rsquo;s sixty-six and lame, has three shillings a week to buy him
      everything. Just think of that! If we had the pluck of flies&mdash;&rsquo; And
      he clenched his fists. But Sheila got up, looked hard at me, and said:
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll do, Derek.&rsquo; Then he put his hand on my arm and said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only
      Cousin Nedda!&rsquo; I began to love him then; and I believe he saw it, because
      I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes away. But it was when Sheila sang &lsquo;The Red
      Sarafan,&rsquo; after dinner, that I knew for certain. &lsquo;The Red Sarafan&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      a wonderful song, all space and yearning, and yet such calm&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
      song of the soul; and he was looking at me while she sang. How can he love
      me? I am nothing&mdash;no good for anything! Alan calls him a &lsquo;run-up kid,
      all legs and wings.&rsquo; Sometimes I hate Alan; he&rsquo;s conventional and stodgy&mdash;the
      funny thing is that he admires Sheila. She&rsquo;ll wake him up; she&rsquo;ll stick
      pins into him. No, I don&rsquo;t want Alan hurt&mdash;I want every one in the
      world to be happy, happy&mdash;as I am.... The next day was the
      thunder-storm. I never saw lightning so near&mdash;and didn&rsquo;t care a bit.
      If he were struck I knew I should be; that made it all right. When you
      love, you don&rsquo;t care, if only the something must happen to you both. When
      it was over, and we came out from behind the stack and walked home through
      the fields, all the beasts looked at us as if we were new and had never
      been seen before; and the air was ever so sweet, and that long, red line
      of cloud low down in the purple, and the elm-trees so heavy and almost
      black. He put his arm round me, and I let him.... It seems an age to wait
      till they come to stay with us next week. If only Mother likes them, and I
      can go and stay at Joyfields. Will she like them? It&rsquo;s all so different to
      what it would be if they were ordinary. But if he were ordinary I
      shouldn&rsquo;t love him; it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s nobody like him. That isn&rsquo;t a
      loverish fancy&mdash;you only have to look at him against Alan or Uncle
      Stanley or even Dad. Everything he does is so different; the way he walks,
      and the way he stands drawn back into himself, like a stag, and looks out
      as if he were burning and smouldering inside; even the way he smiles. Dad
      asked me what I thought of him! That was only the second day. I thought he
      was too proud, then. And Dad said: &lsquo;He ought to be in a Highland regiment;
      pity&mdash;great pity!&rsquo; He is a fighter, of course. I don&rsquo;t like fighting,
      but if I&rsquo;m not ready to, he&rsquo;ll stop loving me, perhaps. I&rsquo;ve got to learn.
      O Darkness out there, help me! And Stars, help me! O God, make me brave,
      and I will believe in you forever! If you are the spirit that grows in
      things in spite of everything, until they&rsquo;re like the flowers, so perfect
      that we laugh and sing at their beauty, grow in me, too; make me beautiful
      and brave; then I shall be fit for him, alive or dead; and that&rsquo;s all I
      want. Every evening I shall stand in spirit with him at the end of that
      orchard in the darkness, under the trees above the white flowers and the
      sleepy cows, and perhaps I shall feel him kiss me again.... I&rsquo;m glad I saw
      that old man Gaunt; it makes what they feel more real to me. He showed me
      that poor laborer Tryst, too, the one who mustn&rsquo;t marry his wife&rsquo;s sister,
      or have her staying in the house without marrying her. Why should people
      interfere with others like that? It does make your blood boil! Derek and
      Sheila have been brought up to be in sympathy with the poor and oppressed.
      If they had lived in London they would have been even more furious, I
      expect. And it&rsquo;s no use my saying to myself &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know the laborer, I
      don&rsquo;t know his hardships,&rsquo; because he is really just the country half of
      what I do know and see, here in London, when I don&rsquo;t hide my eyes. One
      talk showed me how desperately they feel; at night, in Sheila&rsquo;s room, when
      we had gone up, just we four. Alan began it; they didn&rsquo;t want to, I could
      see; but he was criticising what some of those Bigwigs had said&mdash;the
      &lsquo;Varsity makes boys awfully conceited. It was such a lovely night; we were
      all in the big, long window. A little bat kept flying past; and behind the
      copper-beech the moon was shining on the lake. Derek sat in the
      windowsill, and when he moved he touched me. To be touched by him gives me
      a warm shiver all through. I could hear him gritting his teeth at what
      Alan said&mdash;frightfully sententious, just like a newspaper: &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t
      go into land reform from feeling, we must go into it from reason.&rsquo; Then
      Derek broke out: &lsquo;Walk through this country as we&rsquo;ve walked; see the
      pigsties the people live in; see the water they drink; see the tiny
      patches of ground they have; see the way their roofs let in the rain; see
      their peeky children; see their patience and their hopelessness; see them
      working day in and day out, and coming on the parish at the end! See all
      that, and then talk about reason! Reason! It&rsquo;s the coward&rsquo;s excuse, and
      the rich man&rsquo;s excuse, for doing nothing. It&rsquo;s the excuse of the man who
      takes jolly good care not to see for fear that he may come to feel! Reason
      never does anything, it&rsquo;s too reasonable. The thing is to act; then
      perhaps reason will be jolted into doing something.&rsquo; But Sheila touched
      his arm, and he stopped very suddenly. She doesn&rsquo;t trust us. I shall
      always be being pushed away from him by her. He&rsquo;s just twenty, and I shall
      be eighteen in a week; couldn&rsquo;t we marry now at once? Then, whatever
      happened, I couldn&rsquo;t be cut off from him. If I could tell Dad, and ask him
      to help me! But I can&rsquo;t&mdash;it seems desecration to talk about it, even
      to Dad. All the way up in the train to-day, coming back home, I was
      struggling not to show anything; though it&rsquo;s hateful to keep things from
      Dad. Love alters everything; it melts up the whole world and makes it
      afresh. Love is the sun of our spirits, and it&rsquo;s the wind. Ah, and the
      rain, too! But I won&rsquo;t think of that!... I wonder if he&rsquo;s told Aunt
      Kirsteen!...&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Nedda sat, long past midnight, writing her heart out in her little,
      white, lilac-curtained room of the old house above the Spaniard&rsquo;s Road,
      Derek, of whom she wrote, was walking along the Malvern hills, hurrying
      upward in the darkness. The stars were his companions; though he was no
      poet, having rather the fervid temper of the born swordsman, that
      expresses itself in physical ecstasies. He had come straight out from a
      stormy midnight talk with Sheila. What was he doing&mdash;had been the
      burden of her cry&mdash;falling in love just at this moment when they
      wanted all their wits and all their time and strength for this struggle
      with the Mallorings? It was foolish, it was weak; and with a sweet, soft
      sort of girl who could be no use. Hotly he had answered: What business was
      it of hers? As if one fell in love when one wished! She didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;her
      blood didn&rsquo;t run fast enough! Sheila had retorted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve more blood in my
      big toe than Nedda in all her body! A lot of use you&rsquo;ll be, with your
      heart mooning up in London!&rdquo; And crouched together on the end of her bed,
      gazing fixedly up at him through her hair, she had chanted mockingly:
      &ldquo;Here we go gathering wool and stars&mdash;wool and stars&mdash;wool and
      stars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not deigned to answer, but had gone out, furious with her, striding
      over the dark fields, scrambling his way through the hedges toward the
      high loom of the hills. Up on the short grass in the cooler air, with
      nothing between him and those swarming stars, he lost his rage. It never
      lasted long&mdash;hers was more enduring. With the innate lordliness of a
      brother he already put it down to jealousy. Sheila was hurt that he should
      want any one but her; as if his love for Nedda would make any difference
      to their resolution to get justice for Tryst and the Gaunts, and show
      those landed tyrants once for all that they could not ride roughshod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nedda! with her dark eyes, so quick and clear, so loving when they looked
      at him! Nedda, soft and innocent, the touch of whose lips had turned his
      heart to something strange within him, and wakened such feelings of
      chivalry! Nedda! To see whom for half a minute he felt he would walk a
      hundred miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      This boy&rsquo;s education had been administered solely by his mother till he
      was fourteen, and she had brought him up on mathematics, French, and
      heroism. His extensive reading of history had been focussed on the
      personality of heroes, chiefly knights errant, and revolutionaries. He had
      carried the worship of them to the Agricultural College, where he had
      spent four years; and a rather rough time there had not succeeded in
      knocking romance out of him. He had found that you could not have such
      beliefs comfortably without fighting for them, and though he ended his
      career with the reputation of a rebel and a champion of the weak, he had
      had to earn it. To this day he still fed himself on stories of rebellions
      and fine deeds. The figures of Spartacus, Montrose, Hofer, Garibaldi,
      Hampden, and John Nicholson, were more real to him than the people among
      whom he lived, though he had learned never to mention&mdash;especially not
      to the matter-of-fact Sheila&mdash;his encompassing cloud of heroes; but,
      when he was alone, he pranced a bit with them, and promised himself that
      he too would reach the stars. So you may sometimes see a little, grave boy
      walking through a field, unwatched as he believes, suddenly fling his feet
      and his head every which way. An active nature, romantic, without being
      dreamy and book-loving, is not too prone to the attacks of love; such a
      one is likely to survive unscathed to a maturer age. But Nedda had seduced
      him, partly by the appeal of her touchingly manifest love and admiration,
      and chiefly by her eyes, through which he seemed to see such a loyal, and
      loving little soul looking. She had that indefinable something which
      lovers know that they can never throw away. And he had at once made of
      her, secretly, the crown of his active romanticism&mdash;the lady waiting
      for the spoils of his lance. Queer is the heart of a boy&mdash;strange its
      blending of reality and idealism!
    </p>
    <p>
      Climbing at a great pace, he reached Malvern Beacon just as it came dawn,
      and stood there on the top, watching. He had not much aesthetic sense; but
      he had enough to be impressed by the slow paling of the stars over space
      that seemed infinite, so little were its dreamy confines visible in the
      May morning haze, where the quivering crimson flags and spears of sunrise
      were forging up in a march upon the sky. That vision of the English land
      at dawn, wide and mysterious, hardly tallied with Mr. Cuthcott&rsquo;s view of a
      future dedicate to Park and Garden City. While Derek stood there gazing,
      the first lark soared up and began its ecstatic praise. Save for that
      song, silence possessed all the driven dark, right out to the Severn and
      the sea, and the fastnesses of the Welsh hills, and the Wrekin, away in
      the north, a black point in the gray. For a moment dark and light hovered
      and clung together. Would victory wing back into night or on into day?
      Then, as a town is taken, all was over in one overmastering rush, and
      light proclaimed. Derek tightened his belt and took a bee-line down over
      the slippery grass. He meant to reach the cottage of the laborer Tryst
      before that early bird was away to the fields. He meditated as he went.
      Bob Tryst was all right! If they only had a dozen or two like him! A dozen
      or two whom they could trust, and who would trust each other and stand
      firm to form the nucleus of a strike, which could be timed for hay
      harvest. What slaves these laborers still were! If only they could be
      relied on, if only they would stand together! Slavery! It WAS slavery; so
      long as they could be turned out of their homes at will in this fashion.
      His rebellion against the conditions of their lives, above all against the
      manifold petty tyrannies that he knew they underwent, came from use of his
      eyes and ears in daily contact with a class among whom he had been more or
      less brought up. In sympathy with, and yet not of them, he had the queer
      privilege of feeling their slights as if they were his own, together with
      feelings of protection, and even of contempt that they should let
      themselves be slighted. He was near enough to understand how they must
      feel; not near enough to understand why, feeling as they did, they did not
      act as he would have acted. In truth, he knew them no better than he
      should.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Tryst washing at his pump. In the early morning light the big
      laborer&rsquo;s square, stubborn face, with its strange, dog-like eyes, had a
      sodden, hungry, lost look. Cutting short ablutions that certainly were
      never protracted, he welcomed Derek, and motioned him to pass into the
      kitchen. The young man went in, and perched himself on the window-sill
      beside a pot of Bridal Wreath. The cottage was one of the Mallorings&rsquo;, and
      recently repaired. A little fire was burning, and a teapot of stewed tea
      sat there beside it. Four cups and spoons and some sugar were put out on a
      deal table, for Tryst was, in fact, brewing the morning draught of himself
      and children, who still lay abed up-stairs. The sight made Derek shiver
      and his eyes darken. He knew the full significance of what he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ask him again, Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I asked &lsquo;im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said as orders was plain. &lsquo;So long as you lives there,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;along
      of yourself alone, you can&rsquo;t have her come back.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say the children wanted looking after badly? Did you make it
      clear? Did you say Mrs. Tryst wished it, before she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sorry for you, m&rsquo;lad, but them&rsquo;s m&rsquo;lady&rsquo;s orders, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t go
      contrary. I don&rsquo;t wish to go into things,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;you know better&rsquo;n I
      how far &lsquo;tis gone when she was &lsquo;ere before; but seein&rsquo; as m&rsquo;lady don&rsquo;t
      never give in to deceased wife&rsquo;s sister marryin&rsquo;, if she come back &lsquo;tis
      certain to be the other thing. So, as that won&rsquo;t do neither, you go
      elsewhere,&rsquo; he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having spoken thus at length, Tryst lifted the teapot and poured out the
      dark tea into the three cups.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will &lsquo;ee have some, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the cups, Tryst departed up the narrow stairway. And Derek remained
      motionless, staring at the Bridal Wreath, till the big man came down again
      and, retiring into a far corner, sat sipping at his own cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; said the boy suddenly, &ldquo;do you LIKE being a dog; put to what
      company your master wishes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tryst set his cup down, stood up, and crossed his thick arms&mdash;the
      swift movement from that stolid creature had in it something sinister; but
      he did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like it, Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not say what I feels, Mr. Derek; that&rsquo;s for me. What I does&rsquo;ll be
      for others, p&rsquo;raps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he lifted his strange, lowering eyes to Derek&rsquo;s. For a full minute the
      two stared, then Derek said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, then; be ready!&rdquo; and, getting off the sill, he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the bright, slimy surface of the pond three ducks were quietly
      revelling in that hour before man and his damned soul, the dog, rose to
      put the fear of God into them. In the sunlight, against the green
      duckweed, their whiteness was truly marvellous; difficult to believe that
      they were not white all through. Passing the three cottages, in the last
      of which the Gaunts lived, he came next to his own home, but did not turn
      in, and made on toward the church. It was a very little one, very old, and
      had for him a curious fascination, never confessed to man or beast. To his
      mother, and Sheila, more intolerant, as became women, that little,
      lichened, gray stone building was the very emblem of hypocrisy, of a creed
      preached, not practised; to his father it was nothing, for it was not
      alive, and any tramp, dog, bird, or fruit-tree meant far more. But in
      Derek it roused a peculiar feeling, such as a man might have gazing at the
      shores of a native country, out of which he had been thrown for no fault
      of his own&mdash;a yearning deeply muffled up in pride and resentment. Not
      infrequently he would come and sit brooding on the grassy hillock just
      above the churchyard. Church-going, with its pageantry, its tradition,
      dogma, and demand for blind devotion, would have suited him very well, if
      only blind devotion to his mother had not stood across that threshold; he
      could not bring himself to bow to that which viewed his rebellious mother
      as lost. And yet the deep fibres of heredity from her papistic Highland
      ancestors, and from old pious Moretons, drew him constantly to this spot
      at times when no one would be about. It was his enemy, this little church,
      the fold of all the instincts and all the qualities against which he had
      been brought up to rebel; the very home of patronage and property and
      superiority; the school where his friends the laborers were taught their
      place! And yet it had that queer, ironical attraction for him. In some
      such sort had his pet hero Montrose rebelled, and then been drawn despite
      himself once more to the side of that against which he had taken arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he leaned against the rail, gazing at that ancient edifice, he saw a
      girl walk into the churchyard at the far end, sit down on a gravestone,
      and begin digging a little hole in the grass with the toe of her boot. She
      did not seem to see him, and at his ease he studied her face, one of those
      broad, bright English country faces with deep-set rogue eyes and red,
      thick, soft lips, smiling on little provocation. In spite of her disgrace,
      in spite of the fact that she was sitting on her mother&rsquo;s grave, she did
      not look depressed. And Derek thought: &lsquo;Wilmet Gaunt is the jolliest of
      them all! She isn&rsquo;t a bit a bad girl, as they say; it&rsquo;s only that she must
      have fun. If they drive her out of here, she&rsquo;ll still want fun wherever
      she is; she&rsquo;ll go to a town and end up like those girls I saw in Bristol.&rsquo;
      And the memory of those night girls, with their rouged faces and cringing
      boldness, came back to him with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went across the grass toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round as he came, and her face livened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Wilmet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an early bird, Mr. Derek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t been to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been up Malvern Beacon to see the sun rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired, I expect!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be fine up there. You&rsquo;d see a long ways from there; near to London I
      should think. Do you know London, Mr. Derek?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say &lsquo;tis a funny place, too.&rdquo; Her rogue eyes gleamed from under a
      heavy frown. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d not be all &lsquo;Do this&rsquo; an&rsquo; &lsquo;Do that&rsquo;; an&rsquo; &lsquo;You bad girl&rsquo;
      an&rsquo; &lsquo;You little hussy!&rsquo; in London. They say there&rsquo;s room for more&rsquo;n one
      sort of girl there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All towns are beastly places, Wilmet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again her rogue&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo; know so much about that, Mr.
      Derek. I&rsquo;m going where I won&rsquo;t be chivied about and pointed at, like what
      I am here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your dad&rsquo;s stuck to you; you ought to stick to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Dad! He&rsquo;s losin&rsquo; his place for me, but that don&rsquo;t stop his tongue at
      home. &lsquo;Tis no use to nag me&mdash;nag me. Suppose one of m&rsquo;lady&rsquo;s
      daughters had a bit of fun&mdash;they say there&rsquo;s lots as do&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      heard tales&mdash;there&rsquo;d be none comin&rsquo; to chase her out of her home.
      &lsquo;No, my girl, you can&rsquo;t live here no more, endangerin&rsquo; the young men. You
      go away. Best for you&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;ll teach you to be&rsquo;ave. Go on! Out with
      you! I don&rsquo;t care where you go; but you just go!&rsquo; &lsquo;Tis as if girls were
      all pats o&rsquo; butter&mdash;same square, same pattern on it, same weight, an&rsquo;
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek had come closer; he put his hand down and gripped her arm. Her
      eloquence dried up before the intentness of his face, and she just stared
      up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look here, Wilmet; you promise me not to scoot without letting us
      know. We&rsquo;ll get you a place to go to. Promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little sheepishly the rogue-girl answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise; only, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she dimpled and broke into her broad smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Derek, d&rsquo;you know what they say&mdash;they say you&rsquo;re in love. You
      was seen in th&rsquo; orchard. Ah! &lsquo;tis all right for you and her! But if any
      one kiss and hug ME, I got to go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek drew back among the graves, as if he had been struck with a whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him with coaxing sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mind me, Mr. Derek, and don&rsquo;t you stay here neither. If they
      saw you here with me, they&rsquo;d say: &lsquo;Aw&mdash;look! Endangerin&rsquo; another
      young man&mdash;poor young man!&rsquo; Good mornin&rsquo;, Mr. Derek!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rogue eyes followed him gravely, then once more began examining the
      grass, and the toe of her boot again began kicking a little hole. But
      Derek did not look back.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is in the nature of men and angels to pursue with death such birds as
      are uncommon, such animals as are rare; and Society had no use for one
      like Tod, so uncut to its pattern as to be practically unconscious of its
      existence. Not that he had deliberately turned his back on anything; he
      had merely begun as a very young man to keep bees. The better to do that
      he had gone on to the cultivation of flowers and fruit, together with just
      enough farming as kept his household in vegetables, milk, butter, and
      eggs. Living thus amongst insects, birds, cows, and the peace of trees, he
      had become queer. His was not a very reflective mind, it distilled but
      slowly certain large conclusions, and followed intently the minute
      happenings of his little world. To him a bee, a bird, a flower, a tree was
      well-nigh as interesting as a man; yet men, women, and especially children
      took to him, as one takes to a Newfoundland dog, because, though capable
      of anger, he seemed incapable of contempt, and to be endowed with a sort
      of permanent wonder at things. Then, too, he was good to look at, which
      counts for more than a little in the scales of our affections; indeed, the
      slight air of absence in his blue eyes was not chilling, as is that which
      portends a wandering of its owner on his own business. People recognized
      that it meant some bee or other in that bonnet, or elsewhere, some sound
      or scent or sight of life, suddenly perceived&mdash;always of life! He had
      often been observed gazing with peculiar gravity at a dead flower, bee,
      bird, or beetle, and, if spoken to at such a moment, would say, &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;
       touching a wing or petal with his finger. To conceive of what happened
      after death did not apparently come within the few large conclusions of
      his reflective powers. That quaint grief of his in the presence of the
      death of things that were not human had, more than anything, fostered a
      habit among the gentry and clergy of the neighborhood of drawing up the
      mouth when they spoke of him, and slightly raising the shoulders. For the
      cottagers, to be sure, his eccentricity consisted rather in his being a
      &lsquo;gentleman,&rsquo; yet neither eating flesh, drinking wine, nor telling them how
      they ought to behave themselves, together with the way he would sit down
      on anything and listen to what they had to tell him, without giving them
      the impression that he was proud of himself for doing so. In fact, it was
      the extraordinary impression he made of listening and answering without
      wanting anything either for himself or for them, that they could not
      understand. How on earth it came about that he did not give them advice
      about their politics, religion, morals, or monetary states, was to them a
      never-ending mystery; and though they were too well bred to shrug their
      shoulders, there did lurk in their dim minds the suspicion that &lsquo;the good
      gentleman,&rsquo; as they called him, was &lsquo;a tiddy-bit off.&rsquo; He had, of course,
      done many practical little things toward helping them and their beasts,
      but always, as it seemed, by accident, so that they could never make up
      their minds afterward whether he remembered having done them, which, in
      fact, he probably did not; and this seemed to them perhaps the most
      damning fact of all about his being&mdash;well, about his being&mdash;not
      quite all there. Another worrying habit he had, too, that of apparently
      not distinguishing between them and any tramps or strangers who might
      happen along and come across him. This was, in their eyes, undoubtedly a
      fault; for the village was, after all, their village, and he, as it were,
      their property. To crown all, there was a story, full ten years old now,
      which had lost nothing in the telling, of his treatment of a
      cattle-drover. To the village it had an eerie look, that windmill-like
      rage let loose upon a man who, after all, had only been twisting a
      bullock&rsquo;s tail and running a spiked stick into its softer parts, as any
      drover might. People said&mdash;the postman and a wagoner had seen the
      business, raconteurs born, so that the tale had perhaps lost nothing&mdash;that
      he had positively roared as he came leaping down into the lane upon the
      man, a stout and thick-set fellow, taken him up like a baby, popped him
      into a furzebush, and held him there. People said that his own bare arms
      had been pricked to the very shoulder from pressing the drover down into
      that uncompromising shrub, and the man&rsquo;s howls had pierced the very
      heavens. The postman, to this day, would tell how the mere recollection of
      seeing it still made him sore all over. Of the words assigned to Tod on
      this occasion, the mildest and probably most true were: &ldquo;By the Lord God,
      if you treat a beast like that again, I&rsquo;ll cut your liver out, you
      hell-hearted sweep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The incident, which had produced a somewhat marked effect in regard to the
      treatment of animals all round that neighborhood, had never been
      forgotten, nor in a sense forgiven. In conjunction with the extraordinary
      peace and mildness of his general behavior, it had endowed Tod with
      mystery; and people, especially simple folk, cannot bring themselves to
      feel quite at home with mystery. Children only&mdash;to whom everything is
      so mysterious that nothing can be&mdash;treated him as he treated them,
      giving him their hands with confidence. But children, even his own, as
      they grew up, began to have a little of the village feeling toward Tod;
      his world was not theirs, and what exactly his world was they could not
      grasp. Possibly it was the sense that they partook of his interest and
      affection too much on a level with any other kind of living thing that
      might happen to be about, which discomfited their understanding. They held
      him, however, in a certain reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      That early morning he had already done a good two hours&rsquo; work in
      connection with broad beans, of which he grew, perhaps, the best in the
      whole county, and had knocked off for a moment, to examine a spider&rsquo;s web.
      This marvellous creation, which the dew had visited and clustered over, as
      stars over the firmament, was hung on the gate of the vegetable garden,
      and the spider, a large and active one, was regarding Tod with the
      misgiving natural to its species. Intensely still Tod stood, absorbed in
      contemplation of that bright and dusty miracle. Then, taking up his hoe
      again, he went back to the weeds that threatened his broad beans. Now and
      again he stopped to listen, or to look at the sky, as is the way of
      husbandmen, thinking of nothing, enjoying the peace of his muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, father&rsquo;s got into a fit again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two little girls were standing in the lane below. The elder, who had
      spoken in that small, anxious voice, had a pale little face with pointed
      chin; her hair, the color of over-ripe corn, hung fluffy on her thin
      shoulders, her flower-like eyes, with something motherly in them already,
      were the same hue as her pale-blue, almost clean, overall. She had her
      smaller, chubbier sister by the hand, and, having delivered her message,
      stood still, gazing up at Tod, as one might at God. Tod dropped his hoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biddy come with me; Susie go and tell Mrs. Freeland, or Miss Sheila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the frail little hand of the elder Tryst and ran. They ran at the
      child&rsquo;s pace, the one so very massive, the other such a whiff of flesh and
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come at once, Biddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was he taken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the kitchen&mdash;just as I was cookin&rsquo; breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Is it a bad one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, awful bad&mdash;he&rsquo;s all foamy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susie and me turned him over, and Billy&rsquo;s seein&rsquo; he don&rsquo;t get his tongue
      down his throat&mdash;like what you told us, and we ran to you. Susie was
      frightened, he hollered so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Past the three cottages, whence a woman at a window stared in amaze to see
      that queer couple running, past the pond where the ducks, whiter than ever
      in the brightening sunlight, dived and circled carelessly, into the Tryst
      kitchen. There on the brick floor lay the distressful man, already
      struggling back out of epilepsy, while his little frightened son sat
      manfully beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Towels, and hot water, Biddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With extraordinary calm rapidity the small creature brought what might
      have been two towels, a basin, and the kettle; and in silence she and Tod
      steeped his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eyes look better, Biddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t look so funny now, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Picking up that form, almost as big as his own, Tod carried it up
      impossibly narrow stairs and laid it on a dishevelled bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew! Open the window, Biddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The small creature opened what there was of window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, go down and heat two bricks and wrap them in something, and bring
      them up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tryst&rsquo;s boots and socks removed, Tod rubbed the large, warped feet. While
      doing this he whistled, and the little boy crept up-stairs and squatted in
      the doorway, to watch and listen. The morning air overcame with its
      sweetness the natural odor of that small room, and a bird or two went
      flirting past. The small creature came back with the bricks, wrapped in
      petticoats of her own, and, placing them against the soles of her father&rsquo;s
      feet, she stood gazing at Tod, for all the world like a little mother dog
      with puppies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go to school to-day, Biddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Susie and Billy to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; there&rsquo;s nothing to be frightened of now. He&rsquo;ll be nearly all right
      by evening. But some one shall stay with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Tryst lifted his hand, and the small creature went and
      stood beside him, listening to the whispering that emerged from his thick
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father says I&rsquo;m to thank you, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Have you had your breakfasts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The small creature and her smaller brother shook their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go down and get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whispering and twisting back, they went, and by the side of the bed Tod
      sat down. In Tryst&rsquo;s eyes was that same look of dog-like devotion he had
      bent on Derek earlier that morning. Tod stared out of the window and gave
      the man&rsquo;s big hand a squeeze. Of what did he think, watching a lime-tree
      outside, and the sunlight through its foliage painting bright the room&rsquo;s
      newly whitewashed wall, already gray-spotted with damp again; watching the
      shadows of the leaves playing in that sunlight? Almost cruel, that lovely
      shadow game of outside life so full and joyful, so careless of man and
      suffering; too gay almost, too alive! Of what did he think, watching the
      chase and dart of shadow on shadow, as of gray butterflies fluttering
      swift to the sack of flowers, while beside him on the bed the big laborer
      lay?...
    </p>
    <p>
      When Kirsteen and Sheila came to relieve him of that vigil he went
      down-stairs. There in the kitchen Biddy was washing up, and Susie and
      Billy putting on their boots for school. They stopped to gaze at Tod
      feeling in his pockets, for they knew that things sometimes happened after
      that. To-day there came out two carrots, some lumps of sugar, some cord, a
      bill, a pruning knife, a bit of wax, a bit of chalk, three flints, a pouch
      of tobacco, two pipes, a match-box with a single match in it, a six-pence,
      a necktie, a stick of chocolate, a tomato, a handkerchief, a dead bee, an
      old razor, a bit of gauze, some tow, a stick of caustic, a reel of cotton,
      a needle, no thimble, two dock leaves, and some sheets of yellowish paper.
      He separated from the rest the sixpence, the dead bee, and what was
      edible. And in delighted silence the three little Trysts gazed, till Biddy
      with the tip of one wet finger touched the bee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not good to eat, Biddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At those words, one after the other, cautiously, the three little Trysts
      smiled. Finding that Tod smiled too, they broadened, and Billy burst into
      chuckles. Then, clustering in the doorway, grasping the edibles and the
      sixpence, and consulting with each other, they looked long after his big
      figure passing down the road.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Still later, that same morning, Derek and Sheila moved slowly up the
      Mallorings&rsquo; well-swept drive. Their lips were set, as though they had
      spoken the last word before battle, and an old cock pheasant, running into
      the bushes close by, rose with a whir and skimmed out toward his covert,
      scared, perhaps, by something uncompromising in the footsteps of those
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only when actually under the shelter of the porch, which some folk thought
      enhanced the old Greek-temple effect of the Mallorings&rsquo; house, Derek broke
      through that taciturnity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if they won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait and see; and don&rsquo;t lose your head, Derek.&rdquo; The man who stood there
      when the door opened was tall, grave, wore his hair in powder, and waited
      without speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ask Sir Gerald and Lady Malloring if Miss Freeland and Mr. Derek
      Freeland could see them, please; and will you say the matter is urgent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man bowed, left them, and soon came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lady will see you, miss; Sir Gerald is not in. This way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Past the statuary, flowers, and antlers of the hall, they traversed a
      long, cool corridor, and through a white door entered a white room, not
      very large, and very pretty. Two children got up as they came in and
      flapped out past them like young partridges, and Lady Malloring rose from
      her writing-table and came forward, holding out her hand. The two young
      Freelands took it gravely. For all their hostility they could not
      withstand the feeling that she would think them terrible young prigs if
      they simply bowed. And they looked steadily at one with whom they had
      never before been at quite such close quarters. Lady Malloring, who had
      originally been the Honorable Mildred Killory, a daughter of Viscount
      Silport, was tall, slender, and not very striking, with very fair hair
      going rather gray; her expression in repose was pleasant, a little
      anxious; only by her eyes was the suspicion awakened that she was a woman
      of some character. They had that peculiar look of belonging to two worlds,
      so often to be met with in English eyes, a look of self-denying
      aspiration, tinctured with the suggestion that denial might not be
      confined to self.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quite friendly voice she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I do anything for you?&rdquo; And while she waited for an answer her glance
      travelled from face to face of the two young people, with a certain
      curiosity. After a silence of several seconds, Sheila answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for us, thank you; for others, you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Malloring&rsquo;s eyebrows rose a little, as if there seemed to her
      something rather unjust in those words&mdash;&lsquo;for others.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheila, whose hands were clenched, and whose face had been fiery red, grew
      suddenly almost white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Malloring, will you please let the Gaunts stay in their cottage and
      Tryst&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s sister come to live with the children and him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Malloring raised one hand; the motion, quite involuntary, ended at
      the tiny cross on her breast. She said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sheila, still very pale, &ldquo;we understand quite well. We
      understand that you are acting in what you believe to be the interests of
      morality. All the same, won&rsquo;t you? Do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May we ask why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Malloring started, and transferred her glance to Derek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said with a smile, &ldquo;that I am obliged to account for
      my actions to you two young people. Besides, you must know why, quite
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheila put out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilmet Gaunt will go to the bad if you turn them out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I think she has gone to the bad already, and I do not mean
      her to take others there with her. I am sorry for poor Tryst, and I wish
      he could find some nice woman to marry; but what he proposes is
      impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood had flared up again in Sheila&rsquo;s cheeks; she was as red as the
      comb of a turkey-cock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he marry his wife&rsquo;s sister? It&rsquo;s legal, now, and you&rsquo;ve no
      right to stop it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Malloring bit her lips; she looked straight and hard at Sheila.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not stop it; I have no means of stopping it. Only, he cannot do it
      and live in one of our cottages. I don&rsquo;t think we need discuss this
      further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words had come from Derek. Lady Malloring paused in her walk toward
      the bell. With his peculiar thin-lipped smile the boy went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We imagined you would say no; we really came because we thought it fair
      to warn you that there may be trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Malloring smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a private matter between us and our tenants, and we should be so
      glad if you could manage not to interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek bowed, and put his hand within his sister&rsquo;s arm. But Sheila did not
      move; she was trembling with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you,&rdquo; she suddenly burst out, &ldquo;to dispose of the poor, body and
      soul? Who are you, to dictate their private lives? If they pay their rent,
      that should be enough for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Malloring moved swiftly again toward the bell. She paused with her
      hand on it, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for you two; you have been miserably brought up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence; then Derek said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; we shall remember that insult to our people. Don&rsquo;t ring,
      please; we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a silence if anything more profound than that of their approach, the
      two young people retired down the drive. They had not yet learned&mdash;most
      difficult of lessons&mdash;how to believe that people could in their bones
      differ from them. It had always seemed to them that if only they had a
      chance of putting directly what they thought, the other side must at heart
      agree, and only go on saying they didn&rsquo;t out of mere self-interest. They
      came away, therefore, from this encounter with the enemy a little dazed by
      the discovery that Lady Malloring in her bones believed that she was
      right. It confused them, and heated the fires of their anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had shaken off all private dust before Sheila spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all like that&mdash;can&rsquo;t see or feel&mdash;simply certain
      they&rsquo;re superior! It makes&mdash;it makes me hate them! It&rsquo;s terrible,
      ghastly.&rdquo; And while she stammered out those little stabs of speech, tears
      of rage rolled down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Derek put his arm round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! No good groaning; let&rsquo;s think seriously what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was comfort to the girl in that curiously sudden reversal of their
      usual attitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;has got to be startling. It&rsquo;s no good
      pottering and protesting, any more.&rdquo; And between his teeth he muttered:
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Men of England, wherefore plough?&rsquo;...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the room where the encounter had taken place Mildred Malloring was
      taking her time to recover. From very childhood she had felt that the
      essence of her own goodness, the essence of her duty in life, was the
      doing of &lsquo;good&rsquo; to others; from very childhood she had never doubted that
      she was in a position to do this, and that those to whom she did good,
      although they might kick against it as inconvenient, must admit that it
      WAS their &lsquo;good.&rsquo; The thought: &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t admit that I am superior!&rsquo; had
      never even occurred to her, so completely was she unselfconscious, in her
      convinced superiority. It was hard, indeed, to be flung against such
      outspoken rudeness. It shook her more than she gave sign of, for she was
      not by any means an insensitive woman&mdash;shook her almost to the point
      of feeling that there was something in the remonstrance of those dreadful
      young people. Yet, how could there be, when no one knew better than she
      that the laborers on the Malloring estate were better off than those on
      nine out of ten estates; better paid and better housed, and&mdash;better
      looked after in their morals. Was she to give up that?&mdash;when she knew
      that she WAS better able to tell what was good for them than they were
      themselves. After all, without stripping herself naked of every thought,
      experience, and action since her birth, how could she admit that she was
      not better able? And slowly, in the white room with the moss-green carpet,
      she recovered, till there was only just a touch of soreness left, at the
      injustice implicit in their words. Those two had been &lsquo;miserably brought
      up,&rsquo; had never had a chance of finding their proper place, of
      understanding that they were just two callow young things, for whom Life
      had some fearful knocks in store. She could even feel now that she had
      meant that saying: &lsquo;I am sorry for you two!&rsquo; She WAS sorry for them, sorry
      for their want of manners and their point of view, neither of which they
      could help, of course, with a mother like that. For all her gentleness and
      sensibility, there was much practical directness about Mildred Malloring;
      for her, a page turned was a page turned, an idea absorbed was never
      disgorged; she was of religious temperament, ever trimming her course down
      the exact channel marked out with buoys by the Port Authorities, and
      really incapable of imagining spiritual wants in others that could not be
      satisfied by what satisfied herself. And this pathetic strength she had in
      common with many of her fellow creatures in every class. Sitting down at
      the writing-table from which she had been disturbed, she leaned her thin,
      rather long, gentle, but stubborn face on her hand, thinking. These Gaunts
      were a source of irritation in the parish, a kind of open sore. It would
      be better if they could be got rid of before quarter day, up to which she
      had weakly said they might remain. Far better for them to go at once, if
      it could be arranged. As for the poor fellow Tryst, thinking that by
      plunging into sin he could improve his lot and his poor children&rsquo;s, it was
      really criminal of those Freelands to encourage him. She had refrained
      hitherto from seriously worrying Gerald on such points of village policy&mdash;his
      hands were so full; but he must now take his part. And she rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Sir Gerald I&rsquo;d like to see him, please, as soon as he gets back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Gerald has just come in, my lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald Malloring&mdash;an excellent fellow, as could be seen from his face
      of strictly Norman architecture, with blue stained-glass windows rather
      deep set in&mdash;had only one defect: he was not a poet. Not that this
      would have seemed to him anything but an advantage, had he been aware of
      it. His was one of those high-principled natures who hold that breadth is
      synonymous with weakness. It may be said without exaggeration that the few
      meetings of his life with those who had a touch of the poet in them had
      been exquisitely uncomfortable. Silent, almost taciturn by nature, he was
      a great reader of poetry, and seldom went to sleep without having digested
      a page or two of Wordsworth, Milton, Tennyson, or Scott. Byron, save such
      poems as &lsquo;Don Juan&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Waltz,&rsquo; he could but did not read, for fear of
      setting a bad example. Burns, Shelley, and Keats he did not care for.
      Browning pained him, except by such things as: &lsquo;How They Brought the Good
      News from Ghent to Aix&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Cavalier Tunes&rsquo;; while of &lsquo;Omar Khayyam&rsquo;
      and &lsquo;The Hound of Heaven&rsquo; he definitely disapproved. For Shakespeare he
      had no real liking, though he concealed this, from humility in the face of
      accepted opinion. His was a firm mind, sure of itself, but not
      self-assertive. His points were so good, and he had so many of them, that
      it was only when he met any one touched with poetry that his limitations
      became apparent; it was rare, however, and getting more so every year, for
      him to have this unpleasant experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      When summoned by his wife, he came in with a wrinkle between his straight
      brows; he had just finished a morning&rsquo;s work on a drainage scheme, like
      the really good fellow that he was. She greeted him with a little special
      smile. Nothing could be friendlier than the relations between these two.
      Affection and trust, undeviating undemonstrativeness, identity of feeling
      as to religion, children, property; and, in regard to views on the
      question of sex, a really strange unanimity, considering that they were
      man and woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about these Gaunts, Gerald. I feel they must go at once. They&rsquo;re
      only creating bad feeling by staying till quarter day. I have had the
      young Freelands here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those young pups!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t it be managed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malloring did not answer hastily. He had that best point of the good
      Englishman, a dislike to being moved out of a course of conduct by
      anything save the appeal of his own conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why we should alter what we thought was just.
      Must give him time to look round and get a job elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the general state of feeling demands it. It&rsquo;s not fair to the
      villagers to let the Freelands have such a handle for agitating. Labor&rsquo;s
      badly wanted everywhere; he can&rsquo;t have any difficulty in getting a place,
      if he likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Only, I rather admire the fellow for sticking by his girl, though he
      is such a &lsquo;land-lawyer.&rsquo; I think it&rsquo;s a bit harsh to move him suddenly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I, till I saw from those young furies what harm it&rsquo;s doing. They
      really do infect the cottagers. You know how discontent spreads. And Tryst&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      egging him on, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malloring very thoughtfully filled a pipe. He was not an alarmist; if
      anything, he erred on the side of not being alarmed until it was all over
      and there was no longer anything to be alarmed at! His imagination would
      then sometimes take fire, and he would say that such and such, or so and
      so, was dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go and have a talk with Freeland,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s queer, but
      he&rsquo;s not at all a bad chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Malloring rose, and took one of his real-leather buttons in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Gerald, Mr. Freeland doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know about that; a man can always come to life, if he likes, in his
      own family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Malloring was silent. It was true. For all their unanimity of thought
      and feeling, for all the latitude she had in domestic and village affairs,
      Gerald had a habit of filling his pipe with her decisions. Quite honestly,
      she had no objection to their becoming smoke through HIS lips, though she
      might wriggle just a little. To her credit, she did entirely carry out in
      her life her professed belief that husbands should be the forefronts of
      their wives. For all that, there burst from her lips the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Freeland woman! When I think of the mischief she&rsquo;s always done here,
      by her example and her irreligion&mdash;I can&rsquo;t forgive her. I don&rsquo;t
      believe you&rsquo;ll make any impression on Mr. Freeland; he&rsquo;s entirely under
      her thumb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smoking slowly, and looking just over the top of his wife&rsquo;s head,
      Malioring answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a try; and don&rsquo;t you worry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Malloring turned away. Her soreness still wanted salve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those two young people,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;said some very unpleasant things
      to me. The boy, I believe, might have some good in him, but the girl is
      simply terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! I think just the reverse, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll come to awful grief if they&rsquo;re not brought up sharp. They ought
      to be sent to the colonies to learn reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malloring nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out, Mildred, and see how they&rsquo;re getting on with the new vinery.&rdquo;
       And they went out together through the French window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vinery was of their own designing, and of extraordinary interest. In
      contemplation of its lofty glass and aluminium-cased pipes the feeling of
      soreness left her. It was very pleasant, standing with Gerald, looking at
      what they had planned together; there was a soothing sense of reality
      about that visit, after the morning&rsquo;s happening, with its disappointment,
      its reminder of immorality and discontent, and of folk ungrateful for what
      was done for their good. And, squeezing her husband&rsquo;s arm, she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exactly what we thought it would be, Gerald!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      About five o&rsquo;clock of that same afternoon, Gerald Malloring went to see
      Tod. An open-air man himself, who often deplored the long hours he was
      compelled to spend in the special atmosphere of the House of Commons, he
      rather envied Tod his existence in this cottage, crazed from age, and
      clothed with wistaria, rambler roses, sweetbrier, honeysuckle, and
      Virginia creeper. Freeland had, in his opinion, quite a jolly life of it&mdash;the
      poor fellow not being able, of course, to help having a cranky wife and
      children like that. He pondered, as he went along, over a talk at Becket,
      when Stanley, still under the influence of Felix&rsquo;s outburst, had uttered
      some rather queer sayings. For instance, he had supposed that they
      (meaning, apparently, himself and Malloring) WERE rather unable to put
      themselves in the position of these Trysts and Gaunts. He seemed to speak
      of them as one might speak generically of Hodge, which had struck
      Malloring as singular, it not being his habit to see anything in common
      between an individual case, especially on his own estate, and the ethics
      of a general proposition. The place for general propositions was
      undoubtedly the House of Commons, where they could be supported one way or
      the other, out of blue books. He had little use for them in private life,
      where innumerable things such as human nature and all that came into play.
      He had stared rather hard at his host when Stanley had followed up that
      first remark with: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to say, I shouldn&rsquo;t care to have to get up
      at half past five, and go out without a bath!&rdquo; What that had to do with
      the land problem or the regulation of village morality Malloring had been
      unable to perceive. It all depended on what one was accustomed to; and in
      any case threw no light on the question, as to whether or not he was to
      tolerate on his estate conduct of which his wife and himself distinctly
      disapproved. At the back of national life there was always this problem of
      individual conduct, especially sexual conduct&mdash;without regularity in
      which, the family, as the unit of national life, was gravely threatened,
      to put it on the lowest ground. And he did not see how to bring it home to
      the villagers that they had got to be regular, without making examples now
      and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hoped very much to get through his call without coming across
      Freeland&rsquo;s wife and children, and was greatly relieved to find Tod, seated
      on a window-sill in front of his cottage, smoking, and gazing apparently
      at nothing. In taking the other corner of the window-sill, the thought
      passed through his mind that Freeland was really a very fine-looking
      fellow. Tod was, indeed, about Malloring&rsquo;s own height of six feet one,
      with the same fairness and straight build of figure and feature. But Tod&rsquo;s
      head was round and massive, his hair crisp and uncut; Malloring&rsquo;s head
      long and narrow, his hair smooth and close-cropped. Tod&rsquo;s eyes, blue and
      deep-set, seemed fixed on the horizon, Malloring&rsquo;s, blue and deep-set, on
      the nearest thing they could light on. Tod smiled, as it were, without
      knowing; Malloring seemed to know what he was smiling at almost too well.
      It was comforting, however, that Freeland was as shy and silent as
      himself, for this produced a feeling that there could not be any real
      difference between their points of view. Perceiving at last that if he did
      not speak they would continue sitting there dumb till it was time for him
      to go, Malloring said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Freeland; about my wife and yours and Tryst and the Gaunts,
      and all the rest of it! It&rsquo;s a pity, isn&rsquo;t it? This is a small place, you
      know. What&rsquo;s your own feeling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tod answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man has only one life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malloring was a little puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this world. I don&rsquo;t follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Live and let live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A part of Malloring undoubtedly responded to that curt saying, a part of
      him as strongly rebelled against it; and which impulse he was going to
      follow was not at first patent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, YOU keep apart,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t say that so
      easily if you had, like us, to take up the position in which we find
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why take it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malloring frowned. &ldquo;How would things go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Tod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malloring got up from the sill. This was &lsquo;laisser-faire&rsquo; with a vengeance!
      Such philosophy had always seemed to him to savor dangerously of
      anarchism. And yet twenty years&rsquo; experience as a neighbor had shown him
      that Tod was in himself perhaps the most harmless person in
      Worcestershire, and held in a curious esteem by most of the people about.
      He was puzzled, and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had a chance to talk things over with you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There
      are a good few people, Freeland, who can&rsquo;t behave themselves; we&rsquo;re not
      bees, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, having an uncomfortable suspicion that his hearer was not
      listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First I&rsquo;ve heard this year,&rdquo; said Tod.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all the rudeness of that interruption, Malloring felt a stir of
      interest. He himself liked birds. Unfortunately, he could hear nothing but
      the general chorus of their songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought they&rsquo;d gone,&rdquo; murmured Tod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malloring again got up. &ldquo;Look here, Freeland,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d give
      your mind to this. You really ought not to let your wife and children make
      trouble in the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Confound the fellow! He was smiling; there was a sort of twinkle in his
      smile, too, that Malloring found infectious!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, seriously,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know what harm you mayn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever watched a dog looking at a fire?&rdquo; asked Tod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, often; why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows better than to touch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;re helpless? But you oughtn&rsquo;t to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fellow was smiling again!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t mean to do anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tod shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malloring flushed. &ldquo;Now, look here, Freeland,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;forgive my saying
      so, but this strikes me as a bit cynical. D&rsquo;you think I enjoy trying to
      keep things straight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tod looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Birds,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;animals, insects, vegetable life&mdash;they all eat
      each other more or less, but they don&rsquo;t fuss about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malloring turned abruptly and went down the path. Fuss! He never fussed.
      Fuss! The word was an insult, addressed to him! If there was one thing he
      detested more than another, whether in public or private life, it was
      &lsquo;fussing.&rsquo; Did he not belong to the League for Suppression of Interference
      with the Liberty of the Subject? Was he not a member of the party
      notoriously opposed to fussy legislation? Had any one ever used the word
      in connection with conduct of his, before? If so, he had never heard them.
      Was it fussy to try and help the Church to improve the standard of morals
      in the village? Was it fussy to make a simple decision and stick to it?
      The injustice of the word really hurt him. And the more it hurt him, the
      slower and more dignified and upright became his march toward his drive
      gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wild geese&rsquo; in the morning sky had been forerunners; very heavy clouds
      were sweeping up from the west, and rain beginning to fall. He passed an
      old man leaning on the gate of a cottage garden and said: &ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man touched his hat but did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your leg, Gaunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis much the same, Sir Gerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rain coming makes it shoot, I expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malloring stood still. The impulse was on him to see if, after all, the
      Gaunts&rsquo; affair could not be disposed of without turning the old fellow and
      his son out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;about this unfortunate business. Why don&rsquo;t you and
      your son make up your minds without more ado to let your granddaughter go
      out to service? You&rsquo;ve been here all your lives; I don&rsquo;t want to see you
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The least touch of color invaded the old man&rsquo;s carved and grayish face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Askin&rsquo; your pardon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my son sticks by his girl, and I sticks by
      my son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very well; you know your own business, Gaunt. I spoke for your good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint smile curled the corners of old Gaunt&rsquo;s mouth downward beneath his
      gray moustaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you kindly,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malloring raised a finger to his cap and passed on. Though he felt a
      longing to stride his feelings off, he did not increase his pace, knowing
      that the old man&rsquo;s eyes were following him. But how pig-headed they were,
      seeing nothing but their own point of view! Well, he could not alter his
      decision. They would go at the June quarter&mdash;not a day before, nor
      after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing Tryst&rsquo;s cottage, he noticed a &lsquo;fly&rsquo; drawn up outside, and its
      driver talking to a woman in hat and coat at the cottage doorway. She
      avoided his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wife&rsquo;s sister again!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;So that fellow&rsquo;s going to be an
      ass, too? Hopeless, stubborn lot!&rsquo; And his mind passed on to his scheme
      for draining the bottom fields at Cantley Bromage. This village trouble
      was too small to occupy for long the mind of one who had so many
      duties....
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Gaunt remained at the gate watching till the tall figure passed out of
      sight, then limped slowly down the path and entered his son&rsquo;s cottage. Tom
      Gaunt, not long in from work, was sitting in his shirtsleeves, reading the
      paper&mdash;a short, thick-set man with small eyes, round, ruddy cheeks,
      and humorous lips indifferently concealed by a ragged moustache. Even in
      repose there was about him something talkative and disputatious. He was
      clearly the kind of man whose eyes and wit would sparkle above a pewter
      pot. A good workman, he averaged out an income of perhaps eighteen
      shillings a week, counting the two shillings&rsquo; worth of vegetables that he
      grew. His erring daughter washed for two old ladies in a bungalow, so that
      with old Gaunt&rsquo;s five shillings from the parish, the total resources of
      this family of five, including two small boys at school, was seven and
      twenty shillings a week. Quite a sum! His comparative wealth no doubt
      contributed to the reputation of Tom Gaunt, well known as local wag and
      disturber of political meetings. His method with these gatherings, whether
      Liberal or Tory, had a certain masterly simplicity. By interjecting
      questions that could not be understood, and commenting on the answers
      received, he insured perpetual laughter, with the most salutary effects on
      the over-consideration of any political question, together with a tendency
      to make his neighbors say: &ldquo;Ah! Tom Gaunt, he&rsquo;s a proper caution, he is!&rdquo;
       An encomium dear to his ears. What he seriously thought about anything in
      this world, no one knew; but some suspected him of voting Liberal, because
      he disturbed their meetings most. His loyalty to his daughter was not
      credited to affection. It was like Tom Gaunt to stick his toes in and kick&mdash;the
      Quality, for choice. To look at him and old Gaunt, one would not have
      thought they could be son and father, a relationship indeed ever dubious.
      As for his wife, she had been dead twelve years. Some said he had joked
      her out of life, others that she had gone into consumption. He was a
      reader&mdash;perhaps the only one in all the village, and could whistle
      like a blackbird. To work hard, but without too great method, to drink
      hard, but with perfect method, and to talk nineteen to the dozen anywhere
      except at home&mdash;was his mode of life. In a word, he was a
      &lsquo;character.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Gaunt sat down in a wooden rocking-chair, and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Gerald &lsquo;e&rsquo;ve a-just passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Gerald &lsquo;e can goo to hell. They&rsquo;ll know un there, by &lsquo;is little
      ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;E&rsquo;ve a-spoke about us stoppin&rsquo;; so as Mettie goes out to sarvice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;E&rsquo;ve a-spoke about what &lsquo;e don&rsquo;t know &lsquo;bout, then. Let un do what they
      like, they can&rsquo;t put Tom Gaunt about; he can get work anywhere&mdash;Tom
      Gaunt can, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you forget that, old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man, placing his thin brown hands on his knees, was silent. And
      thoughts passed through and through him. &lsquo;If so be as Tom goes, there&rsquo;ll
      be no one as&rsquo;ll take me in for less than three bob a week. Two bob a week,
      that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave to feed me&mdash;Two bob a week&mdash;two bob a
      week! But if so be&rsquo;s I go with Tom, I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave to reg&rsquo;lar sit down under he
      for me bread and butter.&rsquo; And he contemplated his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you goin&rsquo;, then?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Gaunt rustled the greenish paper he was reading, and his little, hard
      gray eyes fixed his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said I was going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Gaunt, smoothing and smoothing the lined, thin cheeks of the
      parchmenty, thin-nosed face that Frances Freeland had thought to be almost
      like a gentleman&rsquo;s, answered: &ldquo;I thart you said you was goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think too much, then&mdash;that&rsquo;s what &lsquo;tis. You think too much, old
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a slight deepening of the sardonic patience in his face, old Gaunt
      rose, took a bowl and spoon down from a shelf, and very slowly proceeded
      to make himself his evening meal. It consisted of crusts of bread soaked
      in hot water and tempered with salt, pepper, onion, and a touch of butter.
      And while he waited, crouched over the kettle, his son smoked his grayish
      clay and read his greenish journal; an old clock ticked and a little cat
      purred without provocation on the ledge of the tight-closed window. Then
      the door opened and the rogue-girl appeared. She shook her shoulders as
      though to dismiss the wetting she had got, took off her turn-down,
      speckly, straw hat, put on an apron, and rolled up her sleeves. Her arms
      were full and firm and red; the whole of her was full and firm. From her
      rosy cheeks to her stout ankles she was superabundant with vitality, the
      strangest contrast to her shadowy, thin old grandfather. About the
      preparation of her father&rsquo;s tea she moved with a sort of brooding
      stolidity, out of which would suddenly gleam a twinkle of rogue-sweetness,
      as when she stopped to stroke the little cat or to tickle the back of her
      grandfather&rsquo;s lean neck in passing. Having set the tea, she stood by the
      table and said slowly: &ldquo;Tea&rsquo;s ready, father. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom Gaunt put down his pipe and journal, took his seat at the table,
      filled his mouth with sausage, and said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; where I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom Gaunt stayed the morsel in one cheek and fixed her with his little,
      wild boar&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to catch the stick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look here, my girl, Tom
      Gaunt&rsquo;s been put about enough along of you already. Don&rsquo;t you make no
      mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to London,&rdquo; repeated the rogue-girl stolidly. &ldquo;You can get
      Alice to come over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Can I? Ye&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo; till I tell you. Don&rsquo;t you think it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;. I saw Mr. Derek this mornin&rsquo;. They&rsquo;ll get me a place there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom Gaunt remained with his fork as it were transfixed. The effort of
      devising contradiction to the chief supporters of his own rebellion was
      for the moment too much for him. He resumed mastication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go where I want you to go; and don&rsquo;t you think you can tell me
      where that is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that ensued the only sound was that of old Gaunt supping at
      his crusty-broth. Then the rogue-girl went to the window and, taking the
      little cat on her breast, sat looking out into the rain. Having finished
      his broth, old Gaunt got up, and, behind his son&rsquo;s back, he looked at his
      granddaughter and thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goin&rsquo; to London! &lsquo;Twud be best for us all. WE shudn&rsquo; need to be movin&rsquo;,
      then. Goin&rsquo; to London!&rsquo; But he felt desolate.

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Spring and first love meet in a girl&rsquo;s heart, then the birds sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The songs that blackbirds and dusty-coated thrushes flung through Nedda&rsquo;s
      window when she awoke in Hampstead those May mornings seemed to have been
      sung by herself all night. Whether the sun were flashing on the leaves, or
      rain-drops sieving through on a sou&rsquo;west wind, the same warmth glowed up
      in her the moment her eyes opened. Whether the lawn below were a field of
      bright dew, or dry and darkish in a shiver of east wind, her eyes never
      grew dim all day; and her blood felt as light as ostrich feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stormed by an attack of his cacoethes scribendi, after those few blank
      days at Becket, Felix saw nothing amiss with his young daughter. The great
      observer was not observant of things that other people observed. Neither
      he nor Flora, occupied with matters of more spiritual importance, could
      tell, offhand, for example, on which hand a wedding-ring was worn. They
      had talked enough of Becket and the Tods to produce the impression on
      Flora&rsquo;s mind that one day or another two young people would arrive in her
      house on a visit; but she had begun a poem called &lsquo;Dionysus at the Well,&rsquo;
      and Felix himself had plunged into a satiric allegory entitled &lsquo;The Last
      of the Laborers.&rsquo; Nedda, therefore, walked alone; but at her side went
      always an invisible companion. In that long, imaginary walking-out she
      gave her thoughts and the whole of her heart, and to be doing this never
      surprised her, who, before, had not given them whole to anything. A bee
      knows the first summer day and clings intoxicated to its flowers; so did
      Nedda know and cling. She wrote him two letters and he wrote her one. It
      was not poetry; indeed, it was almost all concerned with Wilmet Gaunt,
      asking Nedda to find a place in London where the girl could go; but it
      ended with the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your lover,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEREK.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter troubled Nedda. She would have taken it at once to Felix or to
      Flora if it had not been for the first words, &ldquo;Dearest Nedda,&rdquo; and those
      last three. Except her mother, she instinctively distrusted women in such
      a matter as that of Wilmet Gaunt, feeling they would want to know more
      than she could tell them, and not be too tolerant of what they heard.
      Casting about, at a loss, she thought suddenly of Mr. Cuthcott.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner that day she fished round carefully. Felix spoke of him almost
      warmly. What Cuthcott could have been doing at Becket, of all places, he
      could not imagine&mdash;the last sort of man one expected to see there; a
      good fellow, rather desperate, perhaps, as men of his age were apt to get
      if they had too many women, or no woman, about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which, said Nedda, had Mr. Cuthcott?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! None. How had he struck Nedda? And Felix looked at his little daughter
      with a certain humble curiosity. He always felt that the young
      instinctively knew so much more than he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked him awfully. He was like a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;he IS like a dog&mdash;very honest; he grins and runs
      about the city, and might be inclined to bay the moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that,&rsquo; Nedda thought, &lsquo;so long as he&rsquo;s not &ldquo;superior.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very human,&rdquo; Felix added.
    </p>
    <p>
      And having found out that he lived in Gray&rsquo;s Inn, Nedda thought: &lsquo;I will;
      I&rsquo;ll ask him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To put her project into execution, she wrote this note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MR. CUTHCOTT:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were so kind as to tell me you wouldn&rsquo;t mind if I bothered you about
      things. I&rsquo;ve got a very bothery thing to know what to do about, and I
      would be so glad of your advice. It so happens that I can&rsquo;t ask my father
      and mother. I hope you won&rsquo;t think me very horrible, wasting your time.
      And please say no, if you&rsquo;d rather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NEDDA FREELAND.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer came:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MISS FREELAND:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted. But if very bothery, better save time and ink, and have a
      snack of lunch with me to-morrow at the Elgin restaurant, close to the
      British Museum. Quiet and respectable. No flowers by request. One o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very truly yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GILES CUTHCOTT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Putting on &lsquo;no flowers&rsquo; and with a fast-beating heart, Nedda, went on her
      first lonely adventure. To say truth she did not know in the least how
      ever she was going to ask this almost strange man about a girl of doubtful
      character. But she kept saying to herself: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;he has nice
      eyes.&rsquo; And her spirit would rise as she got nearer, because, after all,
      she was going to find things out, and to find things out was jolly. The
      new warmth and singing in her heart had not destroyed, but rather
      heightened, her sense of the extraordinary interest of all things that be.
      And very mysterious to her that morning was the kaleidoscope of Oxford
      Street and its innumerable girls, and women, each going about her
      business, with a life of her own that was not Nedda&rsquo;s. For men she had
      little use just now, they had acquired a certain insignificance, not
      having gray-black eyes that smoked and flared, nor Harris tweed suits that
      smelled delicious. Only once on her journey from Oxford Circus she felt
      the sense of curiosity rise in her, in relation to a man, and this was
      when she asked a policeman at Tottenham Court Road, and he put his head
      down fully a foot to listen to her. So huge, so broad, so red in the face,
      so stolid, it seemed wonderful to her that he paid her any attention! If
      he were a human being, could she really be one, too? But that, after all,
      was no more odd than everything. Why, for instance, the spring flowers in
      that woman&rsquo;s basket had been born; why that high white cloud floated over;
      why and what was Nedda Freeland?
    </p>
    <p>
      At the entrance of the little restaurant she saw Mr. Cuthcott waiting. In
      a brown suit, with his pale but freckled face, and his gnawed-at, sandy
      moustache, and his eyes that looked out and beyond, he was certainly no
      beauty. But Nedda thought: &lsquo;He&rsquo;s even nicer than I remembered, and I&rsquo;m
      sure he knows a lot.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, to be sitting opposite to him, in front of little plates
      containing red substances and small fishes, was so exciting that she
      simply listened to his rapid, rather stammering voice mentioning that the
      English had no idea of life or cookery, that God had so made this country
      by mistake that everything, even the sun, knew it. What, however, would
      she drink? Chardonnet? It wasn&rsquo;t bad here.
    </p>
    <p>
      She assented, not liking to confess that she did not know what Chardonnet
      might be, and hoping it was some kind of sherbet. She had never yet drunk
      wine, and after a glass felt suddenly extremely strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Cuthcott, and his eyes twinkled, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your
      botheration? I suppose you want to strike out for yourself. MY daughters
      did that without consulting me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Have you got daughters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;funny ones; older than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you understand, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cuthcott smiled. &ldquo;They WERE a liberal education!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Nedda thought: &lsquo;Poor Dad, I wonder if I am!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mr. Cuthcott murmured, &ldquo;who would think a gosling would ever become
      a goose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Nedda eagerly, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it wonderful how things grow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt his eyes suddenly catch hold of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in love!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to her a great piece of luck that he had found that out. It made
      everything easy at once, and her words came out pell-mell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I haven&rsquo;t told my people yet. I don&rsquo;t seem able. He&rsquo;s given me
      something to do, and I haven&rsquo;t much experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A funny little wriggle passed over Mr. Cuthcott&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Yes, yes; go on!
      Tell us about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took a sip from her glass, and the feeling that he had been going to
      laugh passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the daughter of a laborer, down there in Worcestershire, where
      he lives, not very far from Becket. He&rsquo;s my cousin, Derek, the son of my
      other uncle at Joyfields. He and his sister feel most awfully strongly
      about the laborers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Cuthcott, &ldquo;the laborers! Queer how they&rsquo;re in the air, all
      of a sudden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This girl hasn&rsquo;t been very good, and she has to go from the village, or
      else her family have. He wants me to find a place for her in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see; and she hasn&rsquo;t been very good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very.&rdquo; She knew that her cheeks were flushing, but her eyes felt
      steady, and seeing that his eyes never moved, she did not mind. She went
      on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sir Gerald Malloring&rsquo;s estate. Lady Malloring&mdash;won&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard a snap. Mr. Cuthcott&rsquo;s mouth had closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;say no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He CAN bite nicely!&rsquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cuthcott, who had begun lightly thumping the little table with his
      open hand, broke out suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That petty bullying in the country! I know it! My God! Those prudes,
      those prisms! They&rsquo;re the ruination of half the girls on the&mdash;&rdquo; He
      looked at Nedda and stopped short. &ldquo;If she can do any kind of work, I&rsquo;ll
      find her a place. In fact, she&rsquo;d better come, for a start, under my old
      housekeeper. Let your cousin know; she can turn up any day. Name? Wilmet
      Gaunt? Right you are!&rdquo; He wrote it on his cuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nedda rose to her feet, having an inclination to seize his hand, or stroke
      his head, or something. She subsided again with a fervid sigh, and sat
      exchanging with him a happy smile. At last she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cuthcott, is there any chance of things like that changing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changing?&rdquo; He certainly had grown paler, and was again lightly thumping
      the table. &ldquo;Changing? By gum! It&rsquo;s got to change! This d&mdash;d
      pluto-aristocratic ideal! The weed&rsquo;s so grown up that it&rsquo;s choking us.
      Yes, Miss Freeland, whether from inside or out I don&rsquo;t know yet, but
      there&rsquo;s a blazing row coming. Things are going to be made new before
      long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under his thumps the little plates had begun to rattle and leap. And Nedda
      thought: &lsquo;I DO like him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But she said anxiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe there&rsquo;s something to be done, then? Derek is simply full of
      it; I want to feel like that, too, and I mean to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face grew twinkly; he put out his hand. And wondering a little whether
      he meant her to, Nedda timidly stretched forth her own and grasped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Love your cousin and don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda&rsquo;s eyes slipped into the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid for him. If you saw him, you&rsquo;d know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One&rsquo;s always afraid for the fellows that are worth anything. There was
      another young Freeland at your uncle&rsquo;s the other night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother Alan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! your brother? Well, I wasn&rsquo;t afraid for him, and it seemed a pity.
      Have some of this; it&rsquo;s about the only thing they do well here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, no. I&rsquo;ve had a lovely lunch. Mother and I generally have
      about nothing.&rdquo; And clasping her hands she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a secret, isn&rsquo;t it, Mr. Cuthcott?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed and his face melted into a mass of wrinkles. Nedda laughed also
      and drank up the rest of her wine. She felt blissful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Cuthcott, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing like loving. How long have you
      been at it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only five days, but it&rsquo;s everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cuthcott sighed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. When you can&rsquo;t love, the only thing is
      to hate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Nedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cuthcott again began banging on the little table. &ldquo;Look at them, look
      at them!&rdquo; His eyes wandered angrily about the room, wherein sat some few
      who had passed though the mills of gentility. &ldquo;What do they know of life?
      Where are their souls and sympathies? They haven&rsquo;t any. I&rsquo;d like to see
      their blood flow, the silly brutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda looked at them with alarm and curiosity. They seemed to her somewhat
      like everybody she knew. She said timidly: &ldquo;Do you think OUR blood ought
      to flow, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cuthcott relapsed into twinkles. &ldquo;Rather! Mine first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He IS human!&rsquo; thought Nedda. And she got up: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I ought to go
      now. It&rsquo;s been awfully nice. Thank you so very much. Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook her firm little hand with his frail thin one, and stood smiling
      till the restaurant door cut him off from her view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets seemed so gorgeously full of life now that Nedda&rsquo;s head swam.
      She looked at it all with such absorption that she could not tell one
      thing from another. It seemed rather long to the Tottenham Court Road,
      though she noted carefully the names of all the streets she passed, and
      was sure she had not missed it. She came at last to one called POULTRY.
      &lsquo;Poultry!&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;I should have remembered that&mdash;Poultry?&rsquo; And
      she laughed. It was so sweet and feathery a laugh that the driver of an
      old four-wheeler stopped his horse. He was old and anxious-looking, with a
      gray beard and deep folds in his red cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poultry!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Please, am I right for the Tottenham Court Road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man answered: &ldquo;Glory, no, miss; you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; East!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;East!&rsquo; thought Nedda; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d better take him.&rsquo; And she got in. She sat in
      the four-wheeler, smiling. And how far this was due to Chardonnet she did
      not consider. She was to love and not worry. It was wonderful! In this
      mood she was put down, still smiling, at the Tottenham Court Road Tube,
      and getting out her purse she prepared to pay the cabman. The fare would
      be a shilling, but she felt like giving him two. He looked so anxious and
      worn, in spite of his red face. He took them, looked at her, and said:
      &ldquo;Thank you, miss; I wanted that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Nedda, &ldquo;then please take this, too. It&rsquo;s all I happen to
      have, except my Tube fare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man took it, and water actually ran along his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless yer!&rdquo; he said. And taking up his whip, he drove off quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather choky, but still glowing, Nedda descended to her train. It was not
      till she was walking to the Spaniard&rsquo;s Road that a cloud seemed to come
      over her sky, and she reached home dejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the garden of the Freelands&rsquo; old house was a nook shut away by berberis
      and rhododendrons, where some bees were supposed to make honey, but,
      knowing its destination, and belonging to a union, made no more than they
      were obliged. In this retreat, which contained a rustic bench, Nedda was
      accustomed to sit and read; she went there now. And her eyes began filling
      with tears. Why must the poor old fellow who had driven her look so
      anxious and call on God to bless her for giving him that little present?
      Why must people grow old and helpless, like that Grandfather Gaunt she had
      seen at Becket? Why was there all the tyranny that made Derek and Sheila
      so wild? And all the grinding poverty that she herself could see when she
      went with her mother to their Girls&rsquo; Club, in Bethnal Green? What was the
      use of being young and strong if nothing happened, nothing was really
      changed, so that one got old and died seeing still the same things as
      before? What was the use even of loving, if love itself had to yield to
      death? The trees! How they grew from tiny seeds to great and beautiful
      things, and then slowly, slowly dried and decayed away to dust. What was
      the good of it all? What comfort was there in a God so great and universal
      that he did not care to keep her and Derek alive and loving forever, and
      was not interested enough to see that the poor old cab-driver should not
      be haunted day and night with fear of the workhouse for himself and an old
      wife, perhaps? Nedda&rsquo;s tears fell fast, and how far THIS was Chardonnet no
      one could tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix, seeking inspiration from the sky in regard to &lsquo;The Last of the
      Laborers,&rsquo; heard a noise like sobbing, and, searching, found his little
      daughter sitting there and crying as if her heart would break. The sight
      was so unusual and so utterly disturbing that he stood rooted, quite
      unable to bring her help. Should he sneak away? Should he go for Flora?
      What should he do? Like many men whose work keeps them centred within
      themselves, he instinctively avoided everything likely to pain or trouble
      him; for this reason, when anything did penetrate those mechanical
      defences he became almost strangely tender. Loath, for example, to believe
      that any one was ill, if once convinced of it, he made so good a nurse
      that Flora, at any rate, was in the habit of getting well with suspicious
      alacrity. Thoroughly moved now, he sat down on the bench beside Nedda, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned her forehead against his arm and sobbed the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix waited, patting her far shoulder gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had often dealt with such situations in his books, and now that one had
      come true was completely at a loss. He could not even begin to remember
      what was usually said or done, and he only made little soothing noises.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Nedda this tenderness brought a sudden sharp sense of guilt and
      yearning. She began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not because of that I&rsquo;m crying, Dad, but I want you to know that
      Derek and I are in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words: &lsquo;You! What! In those few days!&rsquo; rose, and got as far as Felix&rsquo;s
      teeth; he swallowed them and went on patting her shoulder. Nedda in love!
      He felt blank and ashy. That special feeling of owning her more than any
      one else, which was so warming and delightful, so really precious&mdash;it
      would be gone! What right had she to take it from him, thus, without
      warning! Then he remembered how odious he had always said the elderly
      were, to spoke the wheels of youth, and managed to murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck to you, my pretty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said it, conscious that a father ought to be saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re much too young, and he&rsquo;s your cousin!&rsquo; But what a father ought to
      say appeared to him just then both sensible and ridiculous. Nedda rubbed
      her cheek against his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t make any difference, Dad, I promise you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Felix thought: &lsquo;Not to you, only to me!&rsquo; But he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a scrap, my love! What WERE you crying about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the world; it seems so heartless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she told him about the water that had run along the nose of the old
      four-wheeler man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while he seemed to listen, Felix thought: &lsquo;I wish to God I were made
      of leather; then I shouldn&rsquo;t feel as if I&rsquo;d lost the warmth inside me. I
      mustn&rsquo;t let her see. Fathers ARE queer&mdash;I always suspected that.
      There goes my work for a good week!&rsquo; Then he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear, the world is not heartless; it&rsquo;s only arranged according to
      certain necessary contraries: No pain, no pleasure; no dark, no light, and
      the rest of it. If you think, it couldn&rsquo;t be arranged differently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke a blackbird came running with a chuckle from underneath the
      berberis, looked at them with alarm, and ran back. Nedda raised her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, I mean to do something with my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But long after Nedda had fallen into dreams that night, he lay awake, with
      his left foot enclosed between Floras&rsquo;, trying to regain that sense of
      warmth which he knew he must never confess to having lost.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Flora took the news rather with the air of a mother-dog that says to her
      puppy: &ldquo;Oh, very well, young thing! Go and stick your teeth in it and find
      out for yourself!&rdquo; Sooner or later this always happened, and generally
      sooner nowadays. Besides, she could not help feeling that she would get
      more of Felix, to her a matter of greater importance than she gave sign
      of. But inwardly the news had given her a shock almost as sharp as that
      felt by him. Was she really the mother of one old enough to love? Was the
      child that used to cuddle up to her in the window-seat to be read to, gone
      from her; that used to rush in every morning at all inconvenient moments
      of her toilet; that used to be found sitting in the dark on the stairs,
      like a little sleepy owl, because, for-sooth, it was so &lsquo;cosey&rsquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not having seen Derek, she did not as yet share her husband&rsquo;s anxiety on
      that score, though his description was dubious:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upstanding young cockerel, swinging his sporran and marching to pipes&mdash;a
      fine spurn about him! Born to trouble, if I know anything, trying to sweep
      the sky with his little broom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a prig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o. There&rsquo;s simplicity about his scorn, and he seems to have been
      brought up on facts, not on literature, like most of these young monkeys.
      The cousinship I don&rsquo;t think matters; Kirsteen brings in too strong an
      out-strain. He&rsquo;s HER son, not Tod&rsquo;s. But perhaps,&rdquo; he added, sighing, &ldquo;it
      won&rsquo;t last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora shook her head. &ldquo;It will last!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;Nedda&rsquo;s deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And if Nedda held, so would Fate; no one would throw Nedda over! They
      naturally both felt that. &lsquo;Dionysus at the Well,&rsquo; no less than &lsquo;The Last
      of the Laborers,&rsquo; had a light week of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though in a sense relieved at having parted with her secret, Nedda yet
      felt that she had committed desecration. Suppose Derek should mind her
      people knowing!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day that he and Sheila were to come, feeling she could not trust
      herself to seem even reasonably calm, she started out, meaning to go to
      the South Kensington Museum and wander the time away there; but once
      out-of-doors the sky seemed what she wanted, and, turning down the hill on
      the north side, she sat down under a gorse bush. Here tramps, coming in to
      London, passed the night under the stars; here was a vision, however dim,
      of nature. And nature alone could a little soothe her ecstatic nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      How would he greet her? Would he be exactly as he was when they stood at
      the edge of Tod&rsquo;s orchard, above the dreamy, darkening fields, joining
      hands and lips, moved as they had never been moved before?
    </p>
    <p>
      May blossom was beginning to come out along the hedge of the private
      grounds that bordered that bit of Cockney Common, and from it, warmed by
      the sun, the scent stole up to her. Familiar, like so many children of the
      cultured classes, with the pagan and fairy-tales of nature, she forgot
      them all the moment she was really by herself with earth and sky. In their
      breadth, their soft and stirring continuity, they rejected bookish fancy,
      and woke in her rapture and yearning, a sort of long delight, a
      never-appeased hunger. Crouching, hands round knees, she turned her face
      to get the warmth of the sun, and see the white clouds go slowly by, and
      catch all the songs that the birds sang. And every now and then she drew a
      deep breath. It was true what Dad had said: There was no real
      heartlessness in nature. It was warm, beating, breathing. And if things
      ate each other, what did it matter? They had lived and died quickly,
      helping to make others live. The sacred swing and circle of it went on
      forever, full and harmonious under the lighted sky, under the friendly
      stars. It was wonderful to be alive! And all done by love. Love! More,
      more, more love! And then death, if it must come! For, after all, to Nedda
      death was so far away, so unimaginably dim and distant, that it did not
      really count.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she sat, letting her fingers, that were growing slowly black,
      scrabble the grass and fern, a feeling came on her of a Presence, a
      creature with wings above and around, that seemed to have on its face a
      long, mysterious smile of which she, Nedda, was herself a tiny twinkle.
      She would bring Derek here. They two would sit together and let the clouds
      go over them, and she would learn all that he really thought, and tell him
      all her longings and fears; they would be silent, too, loving each other
      too much to talk. She made elaborate plans of what they were to do and
      see, beginning with the East End and the National Gallery, and ending with
      sunrise from Parliament Hill; but she somehow knew that nothing would
      happen as she had designed. If only the first moment were not different
      from what she hoped!
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat there so long that she rose quite stiff, and so hungry that she
      could not help going home and stealing into the kitchen. It was three
      o&rsquo;clock, and the old cook, as usual, asleep in an armchair, with her apron
      thrown up between her face and the fire. What would Cookie say if she
      knew? In that oven she had been allowed to bake in fancy perfect little
      doll loaves, while Cookie baked them in reality. Here she had watched the
      mysterious making of pink cream, had burned countless &lsquo;goes&rsquo; of toffy, and
      cocoanut ice; and tasted all kinds of loveliness. Dear old Cookie!
      Stealing about on tiptoe, seeking what she might devour, she found four
      small jam tarts and ate them, while the cook snored softly. Then, by the
      table, that looked so like a great loaf-platter, she stood contemplating
      cook. Old darling, with her fat, pale, crumply face! Hung to the dresser,
      opposite, was a little mahogany looking-glass tilted forward. Nedda could
      see herself almost down to her toes. &lsquo;I mean to be prettier than I am!&rsquo;
      she thought, putting her hands on her waist. &lsquo;I wonder if I can pull them
      in a bit!&rsquo; Sliding her fingers under her blouse, she began to pull at
      certain strings. They would not budge. They were loose, yes, really too
      comfortable. She would have to get the next size smaller! And dropping her
      chin, she rubbed it on the lace edging of her chest, where it felt warm
      and smelled piny. Had Cookie ever been in love? Her gray hairs were
      coming, poor old duck! The windows, where a protection of wire gauze kept
      out the flies, were opened wide, and the sun shone in and dimmed the fire.
      The kitchen clock ticked like a conscience; a faint perfume of frying-pan
      and mint scented the air. And, for the first time since this new sensation
      of love had come to her, Nedda felt as if a favorite book, read through
      and done with, were dropping from her hands. The lovely times in that
      kitchen, in every nook of that old house and garden, would never come
      again! Gone! She felt suddenly cast down to sadness. They HAD been lovely
      times! To be deserting in spirit all that had been so good to her&mdash;it
      seemed like a crime! She slid down off the table and, passing behind the
      cook, put her arms round those substantial sides. Without meaning to, out
      of sheer emotion, she pressed them somewhat hard, and, as from a
      concertina emerges a jerked and drawn-out chord, so from the cook came a
      long, quaking sound; her apron fell, her body heaved, and her drowsy,
      flat, soft voice, greasy from pondering over dishes, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Miss Nedda! it&rsquo;s you, my dear! Bless your pretty &lsquo;eart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But down Nedda&rsquo;s cheeks, behind her, rolled two tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cookie, oh, Cookie!&rdquo; And she ran out....
    </p>
    <p>
      And the first moment? It was like nothing she had dreamed of. Strange,
      stiff! One darting look, and then eyes down; one convulsive squeeze, then
      such a formal shake of hot, dry hands, and off he had gone with Felix to
      his room, and she with Sheila to hers, bewildered, biting down
      consternation, trying desperately to behave &lsquo;like a little lady,&rsquo; as her
      old nurse would have put it&mdash;before Sheila, especially, whose
      hostility she knew by instinct she had earned. All that evening, furtive
      watching, formal talk, and underneath a ferment of doubt and fear and
      longing. All a mistake! An awful mistake! Did he love her? Heaven! If he
      did not, she could never face any one again. He could not love her! His
      eyes were like those of a swan when its neck is drawn up and back in
      anger. Terrible&mdash;having to show nothing, having to smile at Sheila,
      at Dad, and Mother! And when at last she got to her room, she stood at the
      window and at first simply leaned her forehead against the glass and
      shivered. What had she done? Had she dreamed it all&mdash;dreamed that
      they had stood together under those boughs in the darkness, and through
      their lips exchanged their hearts? She must have dreamed it! Dreamed that
      most wonderful, false dream! And the walk home in the thunder-storm, and
      his arm round her, and her letters, and his letter&mdash;dreamed it all!
      And now she was awake! From her lips came a little moan, and she sank down
      huddled, and stayed there ever so long, numb and chilly. Undress&mdash;go
      to bed? Not for the world. By the time the morning came she had got to
      forget that she had dreamed. For very shame she had got to forget that; no
      one should see. Her cheeks and ears and lips were burning, but her body
      felt icy cold. Then&mdash;what time she did not know at all&mdash;she felt
      she must go out and sit on the stairs. They had always been her
      comforters, those wide, shallow, cosey stairs. Out and down the passage,
      past all their rooms&mdash;his the last&mdash;to the dark stairs, eerie at
      night, where the scent of age oozed out of the old house. All doors below,
      above, were closed; it was like looking down into a well, to sit with her
      head leaning against the banisters. And silent, so silent&mdash;just those
      faint creakings that come from nowhere, as it might be the breathing of
      the house. She put her arms round a cold banister and hugged it hard. It
      hurt her, and she embraced it the harder. The first tears of self-pity
      came welling up, and without warning a great sob burst out of her. Alarmed
      at the sound, she smothered her mouth with her arm. No good; they came
      breaking out! A door opened; all the blood rushed to her heart and away
      from it, and with a little dreadful gurgle she was silent. Some one was
      listening. How long that terrible listening lasted she had no idea; then
      footsteps, and she was conscious that it was standing in the dark behind
      her. A foot touched her back. She gave a little gasp. Derek&rsquo;s voice
      whispered hoarsely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, below her breath, she answered: &ldquo;Nedda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His arms wrenched her away from the banister, his voice in her ear said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nedda, darling, Nedda!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But despair had sunk too deep; she could only quiver and shake and try to
      drive sobbing out of her breath. Then, most queer, not his words, nor the
      feel of his arms, comforted her&mdash;any one could pity!&mdash;but the
      smell and the roughness of his Norfolk jacket. So he, too, had not been in
      bed; he, too, had been unhappy! And, burying her face in his sleeve, she
      murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Derek! Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want them all to see. I can&rsquo;t bear to give it away. Nedda, come
      down lower and let&rsquo;s love each other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Softly, stumbling, clinging together, they went down to the last turn of
      the wide stairs. How many times had she not sat there, in white frocks,
      her hair hanging down as now, twisting the tassels of little programmes
      covered with hieroglyphics only intelligible to herself, talking
      spasmodically to spasmodic boys with budding &lsquo;tails,&rsquo; while Chinese
      lanterns let fall their rose and orange light on them and all the other
      little couples as exquisitely devoid of ease. Ah! it was worth those hours
      of torture to sit there together now, comforting each other with hands and
      lips and whisperings. It was more, as much more than that moment in the
      orchard, as sun shining after a Spring storm is more than sun in placid
      mid-July. To hear him say: &ldquo;Nedda, I love you!&rdquo; to feel it in his hand
      clasped on her heart was much more, now that she knew how difficult it was
      for him to say or show it, except in the dark with her alone. Many a long
      day they might have gone through together that would not have shown her so
      much of his real heart as that hour of whispering and kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had known she was unhappy, and yet he couldn&rsquo;t! It had only made him
      more dumb! It was awful to be like that! But now that she knew, she was
      glad to think that it was buried so deep in him and kept for her alone.
      And if he did it again she would just know that it was only shyness and
      pride. And he was not a brute and a beast, as he insisted. But suppose she
      had chanced not to come out! Would she ever have lived through the night?
      And she shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you cold, darling? Put on my coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was put on her in spite of all effort to prevent him. Never was
      anything so warm, so delicious, wrapping her in something more than Harris
      tweed. And the hall clock struck&mdash;Two!
    </p>
    <p>
      She could just see his face in the glimmer that filtered from the skylight
      at the top. And she felt that he was learning her, learning all that she
      had to give him, learning the trust that was shining through her eyes.
      There was just enough light for them to realize the old house watching
      from below and from above&mdash;a glint on the dark floor there, on the
      dark wall here; a blackness that seemed to be inhabited by some spirit, so
      that their hands clutched and twitched, when the tiny, tiny noises of
      Time, playing in wood and stone, clicked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      That stare of the old house, with all its knowledge of lives past, of
      youth and kisses spent and gone, of hopes spun and faiths abashed, the old
      house cynical, stirred in them desire to clutch each other close and feel
      the thrill of peering out together into mystery that must hold for them so
      much of love and joy and trouble! And suddenly she put her fingers to his
      face, passed them softly, clingingly, over his hair, forehead, eyes,
      traced the sharp cheek-bones down to his jaw, round by the hard chin up to
      his lips, over the straight bone of his nose, lingering, back, to his eyes
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if I go blind, I shall know you. Give me one kiss, Derek. You MUST
      be tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buried in the old dark house that kiss lasted long; then, tiptoeing&mdash;she
      in front&mdash;pausing at every creak, holding breath, they stole up to
      their rooms. And the clock struck&mdash;Three!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Felix (nothing if not modern) had succumbed already to the feeling that
      youth ruled the roost. Whatever his misgivings, his and Flora&rsquo;s sense of
      loss, Nedda must be given a free hand! Derek gave no outward show of his
      condition, and but for his little daughter&rsquo;s happy serenity Felix would
      have thought as she had thought that first night. He had a feeling that
      his nephew rather despised one so soaked in mildness and reputation as
      Felix Freeland; and he got on better with Sheila, not because she was
      milder, but because she was devoid of that scornful tang which clung about
      her brother. No! Sheila was not mild. Rich-colored, downright of speech,
      with her mane of short hair, she was a no less startling companion. The
      smile of Felix had never been more whimsically employed than during that
      ten-day visit. The evening John Freeland came to dinner was the highwater
      mark of his alarmed amusement. Mr. Cuthcott, also bidden, at Nedda&rsquo;s
      instigation, seemed to take a mischievous delight in drawing out those two
      young people in face of their official uncle. The pleasure of the dinner
      to Felix&mdash;and it was not too great&mdash;was in watching Nedda&rsquo;s
      face. She hardly spoke, but how she listened! Nor did Derek say much, but
      what he did say had a queer, sarcastic twinge about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An unpleasant young man,&rdquo; was John&rsquo;s comment afterward. &ldquo;How the deuce
      did he ever come to be Tod&rsquo;s son? Sheila, of course, is one of these
      hot-headed young women that make themselves a nuisance nowadays, but she&rsquo;s
      intelligible. By the way, that fellow Cuthcott&rsquo;s a queer chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One subject of conversation at dinner had been the morality of
      revolutionary violence. And the saying that had really upset John had been
      Derek&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Conflagration first&mdash;morality afterward!&rdquo; He had looked at
      his nephew from under brows which a constant need for rejecting petitions
      to the Home Office had drawn permanently down and in toward the nose, and
      made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Felix these words had a more sinister significance. With his juster
      appreciation both of the fiery and the official points of view, his far
      greater insight into his nephew than ever John would have, he saw that
      they were more than a mere arrow of controversy. And he made up his mind
      that night that he would tackle his nephew and try to find out exactly
      what was smouldering within that crisp, black pate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following him into the garden next morning, he said to himself: &lsquo;No irony&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      fatal. Man to man&mdash;or boy to boy&mdash;whichever it is!&rsquo; But, on the
      garden path, alongside that young spread-eagle, whose dark, glowering,
      self-contained face he secretly admired, he merely began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like your Uncle John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like me, Uncle Felix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat baffled, Felix proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Derek, fortunately or unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve some claim now to a
      little knowledge of you. You&rsquo;ve got to open out a bit to me. What are you
      going to do with yourself in life? You can&rsquo;t support Nedda on revolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having drawn this bow at a venture, he paused, doubtful of his wisdom. A
      glance at Derek&rsquo;s face confirmed his doubt. It was closer than ever, more
      defiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of money in revolution, Uncle Felix&mdash;other people&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dash the young brute! There was something in him! He swerved off to a
      fresh line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it. But, Uncle Felix, don&rsquo;t you wish YOU were seeing it for
      the first time? What books you&rsquo;d write!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix felt that unconscious thrust go &lsquo;home.&rsquo; Revolt against staleness and
      clipped wings, against the terrible security of his too solid reputation,
      smote him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What strikes you most about it, then?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it ought to be jolly well blown up. Everybody seems to know that,
      too&mdash;they look it, anyway, and yet they go on as if it oughtn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why ought it to be blown up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the good of anything while London and all these other big
      towns are sitting on the country&rsquo;s chest? England must have been a fine
      place once, though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of us think it a fine place still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is, in a way. But anything new and keen gets sat on.
      England&rsquo;s like an old tom-cat by the fire: too jolly comfortable for
      anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this support to his own theory that the country was going to the dogs,
      owing to such as John and Stanley, Felix thought: &lsquo;Out of the mouths of
      babes!&rsquo; But he merely said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cheerful young man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got cramp,&rdquo; Derek muttered; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t even give women votes. Fancy my
      mother without a vote! And going to wait till every laborer is off the
      land before it attends to them. It&rsquo;s like the port you gave us last night,
      Uncle Felix, wonderful crust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is to be your contribution to its renovation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek&rsquo;s face instantly resumed its peculiar defiant smile, and Felix
      thought: &lsquo;Young beggar! He&rsquo;s as close as wax.&rsquo; After their little talk,
      however, he had more understanding of his nephew. His defiant
      self-sufficiency seemed more genuine....
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his sensations when dining with Felix, John Freeland (little
      if not punctilious) decided that it was incumbent on him to have the
      &lsquo;young Tods&rsquo; to dinner, especially since Frances Freeland had come to stay
      with him the day after the arrival of those two young people at Hampstead.
      She had reached Porchester Gardens faintly flushed from the prospect of
      seeing darling John, with one large cane trunk, and a hand-bag of a
      pattern which the man in the shop had told her was the best thing out. It
      had a clasp which had worked beautifully in the shop, but which, for some
      reason, on the journey had caused her both pain and anxiety. Convinced,
      however, that she could cure it and open the bag the moment she could get
      to that splendid new pair of pincers in her trunk, which a man had only
      yesterday told her were the latest, she still felt that she had a soft
      thing, and dear John must have one like it if she could get him one at the
      Stores to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, who had come away early from the Home Office, met her in that dark
      hall, to which he had paid no attention since his young wife died, fifteen
      years ago. Embracing him, with a smile of love almost timorous from
      intensity, Frances Freeland looked him up and down, and, catching what
      light there was gleaming on his temples, determined that she had in her
      bag, as soon as she could get it open, the very thing for dear John&rsquo;s
      hair. He had such a nice moustache, and it was a pity he was getting bald.
      Brought to her room, she sat down rather suddenly, feeling, as a fact,
      very much like fainting&mdash;a condition of affairs to which she had
      never in the past and intended never in the future to come, making such a
      fuss! Owing to that nice new patent clasp, she had not been able to get at
      her smelling-salts, nor the little flask of brandy and the one hard-boiled
      egg without which she never travelled; and for want of a cup of tea her
      soul was nearly dying within her. Dear John would never think she had not
      had anything since breakfast (she travelled always by a slow train,
      disliking motion), and she would not for the world let him know&mdash;so
      near dinner-time, giving a lot of trouble! She therefore stayed quite
      quiet, smiling a little, for fear he might suspect her. Seeing John,
      however, put her bag down in the wrong place, she felt stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, darling&mdash;not there&mdash;in the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while he was changing the position of the bag, her heart swelled with
      joy because his back was so straight, and with the thought: &lsquo;What a pity
      the dear boy has never married again! It does so keep a man from getting
      moony!&rsquo; With all that writing and thinking he had to do, such important
      work, too, it would have been so good for him, especially at night. She
      would not have expressed it thus in words&mdash;that would not have been
      quite nice&mdash;but in thought Frances Freeland was a realist.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was gone, and she could do as she liked, she sat stiller than
      ever, knowing by long experience that to indulge oneself in private only
      made it more difficult not to indulge oneself in public. It really was
      provoking that this nice new clasp should go wrong just this once, and
      that the first time it was used! And she took from her pocket a tiny
      prayer-book, and, holding it to the light, read the eighteenth psalm&mdash;it
      was a particularly good one, that never failed her when she felt low&mdash;she
      used no glasses, and up to the present had avoided any line between the
      brows, knowing it was her duty to remain as nice as she could to look at,
      so as not to spoil the pleasure of people round about her. Then saying to
      herself firmly, &ldquo;I do not, I WILL not want any tea&mdash;but I shall be
      glad of dinner!&rdquo; she rose and opened her cane trunk. Though she knew
      exactly where they were, she was some time finding the pincers, because
      there were so many interesting things above them, each raising a different
      train of thought. A pair of field-glasses, the very latest&mdash;the man
      had said&mdash;for darling Derek; they would be so useful to keep his mind
      from thinking about things that it was no good thinking about. And for
      dear Flora (how wonderful that she could write poetry&mdash;poetry!) a
      really splendid, and perfectly new, little pill. She herself had already
      taken two, and they had suited her to perfection. For darling Felix a new
      kind of eau de cologne, made in Worcester, because that was the only scent
      he would use. For her pet Nedda, a piece of &lsquo;point de Venise&rsquo; that she
      really could not be selfish enough to keep any longer, especially as she
      was particularly fond of it. For Alan, a new kind of tin-opener that the
      dear boy would like enormously; he was so nice and practical. For Sheila,
      such a nice new novel by Mr. and Mrs. Whirlingham&mdash;a bright,
      wholesome tale, with such a good description of quite a new country in it&mdash;the
      dear child was so clever, it would be a change for her. Then, actually
      resting on the pincers, she came on her pass-book, recently made up,
      containing little or no balance, just enough to get darling John that bag
      like hers with the new clasp, which would be so handy for his papers when
      he went travelling. And having reached the pincers, she took them in her
      hand, and sat down again to be quite quiet a moment, with her still-dark
      eyelashes resting on her ivory cheeks and her lips pressed to a colorless
      line; for her head swam from stooping over. In repose, with three flies
      circling above her fine gray hair, she might have served a sculptor for a
      study of the stoic spirit. Then, going to the bag, her compressed lips
      twitching, her gray eyes piercing into its clasp with a kind of
      distrustful optimism, she lifted the pincers and tweaked it hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the atmosphere of that dinner, to which all six from Hampstead came,
      was less disturbed than John anticipated, it was due to his sense of
      hospitality, and to every one&rsquo;s feeling that controversy would puzzle and
      distress Granny. That there were things about which people differed,
      Frances Freeland well knew, but that they should so differ as to make them
      forget to smile and have good manners would not have seemed right to her
      at all. And of this, in her presence, they were all conscious; so that
      when they had reached the asparagus there was hardly anything left that
      could by any possibility be talked about. And this&mdash;for fear of
      seeming awkward&mdash;they at once proceeded to discuss, Flora remarking
      that London was very full. John agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland, smiling, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so nice for Derek and Sheila to be seeing it like this for the first
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheila said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Isn&rsquo;t it always as full as this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In August practically empty. They say a hundred thousand people, at
      least, go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Double!&rdquo; remarked Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The figures are variously given. My estimate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One in sixty. That shows you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this interruption of Derek&rsquo;s John frowned slightly. &ldquo;What does it show
      you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Derek glanced at his grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it shows you,&rdquo; exclaimed Sheila, &ldquo;what a heartless great place
      it is. All &lsquo;the world&rsquo; goes out of town, and &lsquo;London&rsquo;s empty!&rsquo; But if you
      weren&rsquo;t told so you&rsquo;d never know the difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek muttered: &ldquo;I think it shows more than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under the table Flora was touching John&rsquo;s foot warningly; Nedda attempting
      to touch Derek&rsquo;s; Felix endeavoring to catch John&rsquo;s eye; Alan trying to
      catch Sheila&rsquo;s; John biting his lip and looking carefully at nothing. Only
      Frances Freeland was smiling and gazing lovingly at dear Derek, thinking
      he would be so handsome when he had grown a nice black moustache. And she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear. What were you going to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really want it, Granny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda murmured across the table: &ldquo;No, Derek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland raised her brows quizzically. She almost looked arch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of course I do, darling. I want to hear immensely. It&rsquo;s so
      interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Derek was going to say, Mother&rdquo;&mdash;every one at once looked at Felix,
      who had thus broken in&mdash;&ldquo;that all we West-End people&mdash;John and I
      and Flora and Stanley, and even you&mdash;all we people born in purple and
      fine linen, are so accustomed to think we&rsquo;re all that matters, that when
      we&rsquo;re out of London there&rsquo;s nobody in it. He meant to say that this is
      appalling enough, but that what is still more appalling is the fact that
      we really ARE all that matters, and that if people try to disturb us, we
      can, and jolly well will, take care they don&rsquo;t disturb us long. Is that
      what you meant, Derek?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek turned a rather startled look on Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What he meant to say,&rdquo; went on Felix, &ldquo;was, that age and habit, vested
      interests, culture and security sit so heavy on this country&rsquo;s chest, that
      aspiration may wriggle and squirm but will never get from under. That, for
      all we pretend to admire enthusiasm and youth, and the rest of it, we push
      it out of us just a little faster than it grows up. Is that what you
      meant, Derek?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll try to, but you won&rsquo;t succeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we shall, and with a smile, too, so that you won&rsquo;t see us
      doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call that devilish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it natural. Look at a man who&rsquo;s growing old; notice how very
      gracefully and gradually he does it. Take my hair&mdash;your aunt says she
      can&rsquo;t tell the difference from month to month. And there it is, or rather
      isn&rsquo;t&mdash;little by little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland, who during Felix&rsquo;s long speech had almost closed her
      eyes, opened them, and looked piercingly at the top of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the very thing for it. You must take some
      with you when you go tonight. John is going to try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Checked in the flow of his philosophy, Felix blinked like an owl
      surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;YOU only have the gift of keeping young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear, I&rsquo;m getting dreadfully old. I have the greatest difficulty
      in keeping awake sometimes when people are talking. But I mean to fight
      against it. It&rsquo;s so dreadfully rude, and ugly, too; I catch myself
      sometimes with my mouth open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora said quietly: &ldquo;Granny, I have the very best thing for that&mdash;quite
      new!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sweet but rather rueful smile passed over Frances Freeland&rsquo;s face.
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re chaffing me,&rdquo; and her eyes looked loving.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtful if John understood the drift of Felix&rsquo;s exordium, it is
      doubtful if he had quite listened&mdash;he having so much to not listen to
      at the Home Office that the practice was growing on him. A vested interest
      to John was a vested interest, culture was culture, and security was
      certainly security&mdash;none of them were symbols of age. Further, the
      social question&mdash;at least so far as it had to do with outbreaks of
      youth and enthusiasm&mdash;was too familiar to him to have any general
      significance whatever. What with women, labor people, and the rest of it,
      he had no time for philosophy&mdash;a dubious process at the best. A man
      who had to get through so many daily hours of real work did not dissipate
      his energy in speculation. But, though he had not listened to Felix&rsquo;s
      remarks, they had ruffled him. There is no philosophy quite so irritating
      as that of a brother! True, no doubt, that the country was in a bad way,
      but as to vested interests and security, that was all nonsense! The guilty
      causes were free thought and industrialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen them all off to Hampstead, he gave his mother her good-night
      kiss. He was proud of her, a wonderful woman, who always put a good face
      on everything! Even her funny way of always having some new thing or other
      to do you good&mdash;even that was all part of her wanting to make the
      best of things. She never lost her &lsquo;form&rsquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      John worshipped that kind of stoicism which would die with its head up
      rather than live with its tail down. Perhaps the moment of which he was
      most proud in all his life was that, when, at the finish of his school
      mile, he overheard a vulgar bandsman say: &ldquo;I like that young &mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      running; he breathes through his &mdash;&mdash; nose.&rdquo; At that moment, if
      he had stooped to breathe through his mouth, he must have won; as it was
      he had lost in great distress and perfect form.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, then, he had kissed Frances Freeland, and watched her ascend the
      stairs, breathless because she WOULD breathe through her nose to the very
      last step, he turned into his study, lighted his pipe, and sat down to a
      couple of hours of a report upon the forces of constabulary available in
      the various counties, in the event of any further agricultural rioting,
      such as had recently taken place on a mild scale in one or two districts
      where there was still Danish blood. He worked at the numbers steadily,
      with just that engineer&rsquo;s touch of mechanical invention which had caused
      him to be so greatly valued in a department where the evolution of twelve
      policemen out of ten was constantly desired. His mastery of figures was
      highly prized, for, while it had not any of that flamboyance which has
      come from America and the game of poker, it possessed a kind of English
      optimism, only dangerous when, as rarely happened, it was put to the test.
      He worked two full pipes long, and looked at the clock. Twelve! No good
      knocking off just yet! He had no liking for bed this many a long year,
      having, from loyalty to memory and a drier sense of what became one in the
      Home Department, preserved his form against temptations of the flesh. Yet,
      somehow, to-night he felt no spring, no inspiration, in his handling of
      county constabulary. A kind of English stolidity about them baffled him&mdash;ten
      of them remained ten. And leaning that forehead, whose height so troubled
      Frances Freeland, on his neat hand, he fell to brooding. Those young
      people with everything before them! Did he envy them? Or was he glad of
      his own age? Fifty! Fifty already; a fogey! An official fogey! For all the
      world like an umbrella, that every day some one put into a stand and left
      there till it was time to take it out again. Neatly rolled, too, with an
      elastic and button! And this fancy, which had never come to him before,
      surprised him. One day he, too, would wear out, slit all up his seams, and
      they would leave him at home, or give him away to the butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the window. A scent of&mdash;of May, or something! And nothing
      in sight save houses just like his own! He looked up at the strip of sky
      privileged to hang just there. He had got a bit rusty with his stars.
      There, however, certainly was Venus. And he thought of how he had stood by
      the ship&rsquo;s rail on that honeymoon trip of his twenty years ago, giving his
      young wife her first lesson in counting the stars. And something very deep
      down, very mossed and crusted over in John&rsquo;s heart, beat and stirred, and
      hurt him. Nedda&mdash;he had caught her looking at that young fellow just
      as Anne had once looked at him, John Freeland, now an official fogey, an
      umbrella in a stand. There was a policeman! How ridiculous the fellow
      looked, putting one foot before the other, flirting his lantern and trying
      the area gates! This confounded scent of hawthorn&mdash;could it be
      hawthorn?&mdash;got here into the heart of London! The look in that girl&rsquo;s
      eyes! What was he about, to let them make him feel as though he could give
      his soul for a face looking up into his own, for a breast touching his,
      and the scent of a woman&rsquo;s hair. Hang it! He would smoke a cigarette and
      go to bed! He turned out the light and began to mount the stairs; they
      creaked abominably&mdash;the felt must be wearing out. A woman about the
      place would have kept them quiet. Reaching the landing of the second
      floor, he paused a moment from habit, to look down into the dark hall. A
      voice, thin, sweet, almost young, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, darling?&rdquo; John&rsquo;s heart stood still. What&mdash;was that?
      Then he perceived that the door of the room that had been his wife&rsquo;s was
      open, and remembered that his mother was in there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Aren&rsquo;t you asleep, Mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland&rsquo;s voice answered cheerfully: &ldquo;Oh, no, dear; I&rsquo;m never
      asleep before two. Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John entered. Propped very high on her pillows, in perfect regularity, his
      mother lay. Her carved face was surmounted by a piece of fine lace, her
      thin, white fingers on the turnover of the sheet moved in continual
      interlocking, her lips smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something you must have,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I left my door open on
      purpose. Give me that little bottle, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John took from a small table by the bed a still smaller bottle. Frances
      Freeland opened it, and out came three tiny white globules.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;pop them in! You&rsquo;ve no idea how they&rsquo;ll send you to
      sleep! They&rsquo;re the most splendid things; perfectly harmless. Just let them
      rest on the tongue and swallow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John let them rest&mdash;they were sweetish&mdash;and swallowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you never go to sleep before two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland corked the little bottle, as if enclosing within it that
      awkward question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t happen to act with me, darling; but that&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s the
      very thing for any one who has to sit up so late,&rdquo; and her eyes searched
      his face. Yes&mdash;they seemed to say&mdash;I know you pretend to have
      work; but if you only had a dear little wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall leave you this bottle when I go. Kiss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John bent down, and received one of those kisses of hers that had such
      sudden vitality in the middle of them, as if her lips were trying to get
      inside his cheek. From the door he looked back. She was smiling, composed
      again to her stoic wakefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I shut the door, Mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a little lump in his throat John closed the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The London which Derek had said should be blown up was at its maximum of
      life those May days. Even on this outer rampart of Hampstead, people,
      engines, horses, all had a touch of the spring fever; indeed, especially
      on this rampart of Hampstead was there increase of the effort to believe
      that nature was not dead and embalmed in books. The poets, painters,
      talkers who lived up there were at each other all the time in their great
      game of make-believe. How could it be otherwise, when there was veritably
      blossom on the trees and the chimneys were ceasing to smoke? How
      otherwise, when the sun actually shone on the ponds? But the four young
      people (for Alan joined in&mdash;hypnotized by Sheila) did not stay in
      Hampstead. Chiefly on top of tram and &lsquo;bus they roamed the wilderness.
      Bethnal Green and Leytonstone, Kensington and Lambeth, St. James&rsquo;s and
      Soho, Whitechapel, Shoreditch, West Ham, and Piccadilly, they traversed
      the whole ant-heap at its most ebullient moment. They knew their Whitman
      and their Dostoievsky sufficiently to be aware that they ought to love and
      delight in everything&mdash;in the gentleman walking down Piccadilly with
      a flower in his buttonhole, and in the lady sewing that buttonhole in
      Bethnal Green; in the orator bawling himself hoarse close to the Marble
      Arch, the coster loading his barrow in Covent Garden; and in Uncle John
      Freeland rejecting petitions in Whitehall. All these things, of course,
      together with the long lines of little gray houses in Camden Town, long
      lines of carts with bobtail horses rattling over Blackfriars&rsquo; Bridge, long
      smells drifting behind taxicabs&mdash;all these things were as delightful
      and as stimulating to the soul as the clouds that trailed the heavens, the
      fronds of the lilac, and Leonardo&rsquo;s Cartoon in the Diploma Gallery. All
      were equal manifestations of that energy in flower known as &lsquo;Life.&rsquo; They
      knew that everything they saw and felt and smelled OUGHT equally to make
      them long to catch creatures to their hearts and cry: Hosanna! And Nedda
      and Alan, bred in Hampstead, even knew that to admit that these things did
      not all move them in the same way would be regarded as a sign of anaemia.
      Nevertheless&mdash;most queerly&mdash;these four young people confessed to
      each other all sorts of sensations besides that &lsquo;Hosanna&rsquo; one. They even
      confessed to rage and pity and disgust one moment, and to joy and dreams
      the next, and they differed greatly as to what excited which. It was truly
      odd! The only thing on which they did seem to agree was that they were
      having &lsquo;a thundering good time.&rsquo; A sort of sense of &ldquo;Blow everything!&rdquo; was
      in their wings, and this was due not to the fact that they were thinking
      of and loving and admiring the little gray streets and the gentleman in
      Piccadilly&mdash;as, no doubt, in accordance with modern culture, they
      should have been&mdash;but to the fact that they were loving and admiring
      themselves, and that entirely without the trouble of thinking about it at
      all. The practice, too, of dividing into couples was distinctly precious
      to them, for, though they never failed to start out together, they never
      failed to come home two by two. In this way did they put to confusion
      Whitman and Dostoievsky, and all the other thinkers in Hampstead. In the
      daytime they all, save Alan, felt that London ought to be blown up; but at
      night it undermined their philosophies so that they sat silent on the tops
      of their respective &lsquo;buses, with arms twined in each other&rsquo;s. For then a
      something seemed to have floated up from that mass of houses and machines,
      of men and trees, and to be hovering above them, violet-colored, caught
      between the stars and the lights, a spirit of such overpowering beauty
      that it drenched even Alan in a kind of awe. After all, the huge creature
      that sat with such a giant&rsquo;s weight on the country&rsquo;s chest, the monster
      that had spoiled so many fields and robbed so many lives of peace and
      health, could fly at night upon blue and gold and purple wings, murmur a
      passionate lullaby, and fall into deep sleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      One such night they went to the gallery at the opera, to supper at an
      oyster-shop, under Alan&rsquo;s pilotage, and then set out to walk back to
      Hampstead, timing themselves to catch the dawn. They had not gone twenty
      steps up Southampton Row before Alan and Sheila were forty steps in front.
      A fellow-feeling had made Derek and Nedda stand to watch an old man who
      walked, tortuous, extremely happy, bidding them all come. And when they
      moved on, it was very slowly, just keeping sight of the others across the
      lumbered dimness of Covent Garden, where tarpaulin-covered carts and
      barrows seemed to slumber under the blink of lamps and watchmen&rsquo;s
      lanterns. Across Long Acre they came into a street where there was not a
      soul save the two others, a long way ahead. Walking with his arm tightly
      laced with hers, touching her all down one side, Derek felt that it would
      be glorious to be attacked by night-birds in this dark, lonely street, to
      have a splendid fight and drive them off, showing himself to Nedda for a
      man, and her protector. But nothing save one black cat came near, and that
      ran for its life. He bent round and looked under the blue veil-thing that
      wrapped Nedda&rsquo;s head. Her face seemed mysteriously lovely, and her eyes,
      lifted so quickly, mysteriously true. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Derek, I feel like a hill with the sun on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like that yellow cloud with the wind in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like an apple-tree coming into blossom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like a giant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like a song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel I could sing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a river, floating along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wide one, with great plains on each side, and beasts coming down to
      drink, and either the sun or a yellow moon shining, and some one singing,
      too, far off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Red Sarafan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that yellow cloud sailing in moonlight a spurt of rain had driven
      into their faces, and they ran as fast as their blood was flowing, and the
      raindrops coming down, jumping half the width of the little dark streets,
      clutching each other&rsquo;s arms. And peering round into her face, so sweet and
      breathless, into her eyes, so dark and dancing, he felt he could run all
      night if he had her there to run beside him through the dark. Into another
      street they dashed, and again another, till she stopped, panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither knew. A policeman put them right for Portland Place. Half past
      one! And it would be dawn soon after three! They walked soberly again now
      into the outer circle of Regent&rsquo;s Park; talked soberly, too, discussing
      sublunary matters, and every now and then, their arms, round each other,
      gave little convulsive squeezes. The rain had stopped and the moon shone
      clear; by its light the trees and flowers were clothed in colors whose
      blood had spilled away; the town&rsquo;s murmur was dying, the house lights dead
      already. They came out of the park into a road where the latest taxis were
      rattling past; a face, a bare neck, silk hat, or shirt-front gleamed in
      the window-squares, and now and then a laugh came floating through. They
      stopped to watch them from under the low-hanging branches of an
      acacia-tree, and Derek, gazing at her face, still wet with rain, so young
      and round and soft, thought: &lsquo;And she loves me!&rsquo; Suddenly she clutched him
      round the neck, and their lips met.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked not at all for a long time after that kiss, walking slowly up
      the long, empty road, while the whitish clouds sailed across the dark
      river of the sky and the moon slowly sank. This was the most delicious
      part of all that long walk home, for the kiss had made them feel as though
      they had no bodies, but were just two spirits walking side by side. This
      is its curious effect sometimes in first love between the very young....
    </p>
    <p>
      Having sent Flora to bed, Felix was sitting up among his books. There was
      no need to do this, for the young folk had latch-keys, but, having begun
      the vigil, he went on with it, a volume about Eastern philosophies on his
      knee, a bowl of narcissus blooms, giving forth unexpected whiffs of odor,
      beside him. And he sank into a long reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could it be said&mdash;as was said in this Eastern book&mdash;that man&rsquo;s
      life was really but a dream; could that be said with any more truth than
      it had once been said, that he rose again in his body, to perpetual life?
      Could anything be said with truth, save that we knew nothing? And was that
      not really what had always been said by man&mdash;that we knew nothing,
      but were just blown over and about the world like soughs of wind, in
      obedience to some immortal, unknowable coherence! But had that want of
      knowledge ever retarded what was known as the upward growth of man? Had it
      ever stopped man from working, fighting, loving, dying like a hero if need
      were? Had faith ever been anything but embroidery to an instinctive
      heroism, so strong that it needed no such trappings? Had faith ever been
      anything but anodyne, or gratification of the aesthetic sense? Or had it
      really body and substance of its own? Was it something absolute and solid,
      that he&mdash;Felix Freeland&mdash;had missed? Or again, was it, perhaps,
      but the natural concomitant of youth, a naive effervescence with which
      thought and brooding had to part? And, turning the page of his book, he
      noticed that he could no longer see to read, the lamp had grown too dim,
      and showed but a decorative glow in the bright moonlight flooding through
      the study window. He got up and put another log on the fire, for these
      last nights of May were chilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly three! Where were these young people? Had he been asleep, and they
      come in? Sure enough, in the hall Alan&rsquo;s hat and Sheila&rsquo;s cloak&mdash;the
      dark-red one he had admired when she went forth&mdash;were lying on a
      chair. But of the other two&mdash;nothing! He crept up-stairs. Their doors
      were open. They certainly took their time&mdash;these young lovers. And
      the same sore feeling which had attacked Felix when Nedda first told him
      of her love came on him badly in that small of the night when his vitality
      was lowest. All the hours she had spent clambering about him, or quietly
      resting on his knee with her head tucked in just where his arm and
      shoulder met, listening while he read or told her stories, and now and
      again turning those clear eyes of hers wide open to his face, to see if he
      meant it; the wilful little tugs of her hand when they two went exploring
      the customs of birds, or bees, or flowers; all her &lsquo;Daddy, I love yous!&rsquo;
      and her rushes to the front door, and long hugs when he came back from a
      travel; all those later crookings of her little finger in his, and the
      times he had sat when she did not know it, watching her, and thinking:
      &lsquo;That little creature, with all that&rsquo;s before her, is my very own daughter
      to take care of, and share joy and sorrow with....&rsquo; Each one of all these
      seemed to come now and tweak at him, as the songs of blackbirds tweak the
      heart of one who lies, unable to get out into the Spring. His lamp had
      burned itself quite out; the moon was fallen below the clump of pines, and
      away to the north-east something stirred in the stain and texture of the
      sky. Felix opened the window. What peace out there! The chill, scentless
      peace of night, waiting for dawn&rsquo;s renewal of warmth and youth. Through
      that bay window facing north he could see on one side the town, still wan
      with the light of its lamps, on the other the country, whose dark bloom
      was graying fast. Suddenly a tiny bird twittered, and Felix saw his two
      truants coming slowly from the gate across the grass, his arm round her
      shoulders, hers round his waist. With their backs turned to him, they
      passed the corner of the house, across where the garden sloped away. There
      they stood above the wide country, their bodies outlined against a sky
      fast growing light, evidently waiting for the sun to rise. Silent they
      stood, while the birds, one by one, twittered out their first calls. And
      suddenly Felix saw the boy fling his hand up into the air. The Sun! Far
      away on the gray horizon was a flare of red!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The anxieties of the Lady Mallorings of this life concerning the moral
      welfare of their humbler neighbors are inclined to march in front of
      events. The behavior in Tryst&rsquo;s cottage was more correct than it would
      have been in nine out of ten middle or upper class demesnes under similar
      conditions. Between the big laborer and &lsquo;that woman,&rsquo; who, since the
      epileptic fit, had again come into residence, there had passed nothing
      whatever that might not have been witnessed by Biddy and her two
      nurslings. For love is an emotion singularly dumb and undemonstrative in
      those who live the life of the fields; passion a feeling severely beneath
      the thumb of a propriety born of the age-long absence of excitants,
      opportunities, and the aesthetic sense; and those two waited, almost as a
      matter of course, for the marriage which was forbidden them in this
      parish. The most they did was to sit and look at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of which Felix had seen the dawn at Hampstead, Sir Gerald&rsquo;s
      agent tapped on the door of Tryst&rsquo;s cottage, and was answered by Biddy,
      just in from school for the midday meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father home, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; Auntie&rsquo;s in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask your auntie to come and speak to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother-child vanished up the narrow stairs, and the agent sighed. A
      strong-built, leathery-skinned man in a brown suit and leggings, with a
      bristly little moustache and yellow whites to his eyes, he did not, as he
      had said to his wife that morning, &lsquo;like the job a little bit.&rsquo; And while
      he stood there waiting, Susie and Billy emerged from the kitchen and came
      to stare at him. The agent returned that stare till a voice behind him
      said: &ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That woman&rsquo; was certainly no great shakes to look at: a fresh, decent,
      faithful sort of body! And he said gruffly: &ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, miss. Sorry to say
      my orders are to make a clearance here. I suppose Tryst didn&rsquo;t think we
      should act on it, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve got to put his things out, you know.
      Now, where are you all going; that&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go home, I suppose; but Tryst and the children&mdash;we don&rsquo;t
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The agent tapped his leggings with a riding-cane. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve been
      expecting it!&rdquo; he said with relief. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; And, staring down at
      the mother-child, he added: &ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;you say, my dear; you look full
      of sense, you do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biddy answered: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and tell Mr. Freeland, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You&rsquo;re a bright maid. He&rsquo;ll know where to put you for the time bein&rsquo;.
      Have you had your dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; it&rsquo;s just ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better have it&mdash;better have it first. No hurry. What&rsquo;ve you got in
      the pot that smells so good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bubble and squeak, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bubble and squeak! Ah!&rdquo; And with those words the agent withdrew to where,
      in a farm wagon drawn up by the side of the road, three men were solemnly
      pulling at their pipes. He moved away from them a little, for, as he
      expressed it to his wife afterward: &ldquo;Look bad, you know, look bad&mdash;anybody
      seeing me! Those three little children&mdash;that&rsquo;s where it is! If our
      friends at the Hall had to do these jobs for themselves, there wouldn&rsquo;t be
      any to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently, from his discreet distance, he saw the mother-child going down
      the road toward Tod&rsquo;s, in her blue &lsquo;pinny&rsquo; and corn-colored hair. Nice
      little thing! Pretty little thing, too! Pity, great pity! And he went back
      to the cottage. On his way a thought struck him so that he well-nigh
      shivered. Suppose the little thing brought back that Mrs. Freeland, the
      lady who always went about in blue, without a hat! Phew! Mr. Freeland&mdash;he
      was another sort; a bit off, certainly&mdash;harmless, quite harmless! But
      that lady! And he entered the cottage. The woman was washing up; seemed a
      sensible body. When the two kids cleared off to school he could go to work
      and get it over; the sooner the better, before people came hanging round.
      A job of this kind sometimes made nasty blood! His yellowish eyes took in
      the nature of the task before him. Funny jam-up they did get about them,
      to be sure! Every blessed little thing they&rsquo;d ever bought, and more, too!
      Have to take precious good care nothing got smashed, or the law would be
      on the other leg! And he said to the woman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, miss, can I begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t stop me, and I blamed well wish you could!&rsquo;
      But he said: &ldquo;Got an old wagon out here. Thought I&rsquo;d save him damage by
      weather or anything; we&rsquo;ll put everything in that, and run it up into the
      empty barn at Marrow and leave it. And there they&rsquo;ll be for him when he
      wants &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman answered: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving that she meant no irony, the agent produced a sound from
      somewhere deep and went out to summon his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the best intentions, however, it is not possible, even in villages so
      scattered that they cannot be said to exist, to do anything without every
      one&rsquo;s knowing; and the work of &lsquo;putting out&rsquo; the household goods of the
      Tryst family, and placing them within the wagon, was not an hour in
      progress before the road in front of the cottage contained its knot of
      watchers. Old Gaunt first, alone&mdash;for the rogue-girl had gone to Mr.
      Cuthcott&rsquo;s and Tom Gaunt was at work. The old man had seen evictions in
      his time, and looked on silently, with a faint, sardonic grin. Four
      children, so small that not even school had any use for them as yet, soon
      gathered round his legs, followed by mothers coming to retrieve them, and
      there was no longer silence. Then came two laborers, on their way to a
      job, a stone-breaker, and two more women. It was through this little
      throng that the mother-child and Kirsteen passed into the
      fast-being-gutted cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent was standing by Tryst&rsquo;s bed, keeping up a stream of comment to
      two of his men, who were taking that aged bed to pieces. It was his habit
      to feel less when he talked more; but no one could have fallen into a more
      perfect taciturnity than he when he saw Kirsteen coming up those narrow
      stairs. In so small a space as this room, where his head nearly touched
      the ceiling, was it fair to be confronted by that lady&mdash;he put it to
      his wife that same evening&mdash;&ldquo;Was it fair?&rdquo; He had seen a mother wild
      duck look like that when you took away its young&mdash;snaky fierce about
      the neck, and its dark eye! He had seen a mare, going to bite, look not
      half so vicious! &ldquo;There she stood, and&mdash;let me have it?&mdash;not a
      bit! Too much the lady for that, you know!&mdash;Just looked at me, and
      said very quiet: &lsquo;Ah! Mr. Simmons, and are you really doing this?&rsquo; and put
      her hand on that little girl of his. &lsquo;Orders are orders, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; What
      could I say? &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;yes, orders are orders, but they needn&rsquo;t be
      obeyed.&rsquo; &lsquo;As to that, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; I said&mdash;mind you, she&rsquo;s a lady; you
      can&rsquo;t help feeling that &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a working man, the same as Tryst here; got to
      earn my living.&rsquo; &lsquo;So have slave-drivers, Mr. Simmons.&rsquo; &lsquo;Every profession,&rsquo;
      I said, &lsquo;has got its dirty jobs, ma&rsquo;am. And that&rsquo;s a fact.&rsquo; &lsquo;And will
      have,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;so long as professional men consent to do the dirty work
      of their employers.&rsquo; &lsquo;And where should I be, I should like to know,&rsquo; I
      said, &lsquo;if I went on that lay? I&rsquo;ve got to take the rough with the smooth.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;Mr. Freeland and I will take Tryst and the little ones
      in at present.&rsquo; Good-hearted people, do a lot for the laborers, in their
      way. All the same, she&rsquo;s a bit of a vixen. Picture of a woman, too,
      standin&rsquo; there; shows blood, mind you! Once said, all over&mdash;no
      nagging. She took the little girl off with her. And pretty small I felt,
      knowing I&rsquo;d got to finish that job, and the folk outside gettin&rsquo; nastier
      all the time&mdash;not sayin&rsquo; much, of course, but lookin&rsquo; a lot!&rdquo; The
      agent paused in his recital and gazed fixedly at a bluebottle crawling up
      the windowpane. Stretching out his thumb and finger, he nipped it suddenly
      and threw it in the grate. &ldquo;Blest if that fellow himself didn&rsquo;t turn up
      just as I was finishing. I was sorry for the man, you know. There was his
      home turned out-o&rsquo;-doors. Big man, too! &lsquo;You blanky-blank!&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;if
      I&rsquo;d been here you shouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; done this!&rsquo; Thought he was goin&rsquo; to hit
      me. &lsquo;Come, Tryst!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not my doing, you know!&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he said,
      &lsquo;I know that; and it&rsquo;ll be blanky well the worse for THEM!&rsquo; Rough tongue;
      no class of man at all, he is! &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;let &lsquo;em look out; I&rsquo;ll be
      even with &lsquo;em yet!&rsquo; &lsquo;None o&rsquo; that!&rsquo; I told him; &lsquo;you know which side the
      law&rsquo;s buttered. I&rsquo;m making it easy for you, too, keeping your things in
      the wagon, ready to shift any time!&rsquo; He gave me a look&mdash;he&rsquo;s got very
      queer eyes, swimmin&rsquo;, sad sort of eyes, like a man in liquor&mdash;and he
      said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been here twenty years,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;My wife died here.&rsquo; And all
      of a sudden he went as dumb as a fish. Never let his eyes off us, though,
      while we finished up the last of it; made me feel funny, seein&rsquo; him
      glowering like that all the time. He&rsquo;ll savage something over this, you
      mark my words!&rdquo; Again the agent paused, and remained as though transfixed,
      holding that face of his, whose yellow had run into the whites of the
      eyes, as still as wood. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got some feeling for the place, I suppose,&rdquo;
       he said suddenly; &ldquo;or maybe they&rsquo;ve put it into him about his rights;
      there&rsquo;s plenty of &lsquo;em like that. Well, anyhow, nobody likes his private
      affairs turned inside out for every one to gape at. I wouldn&rsquo;t myself.&rdquo;
       And with that deeply felt remark the agent put out his leathery-yellow
      thumb and finger and nipped a second bluebottle....
    </p>
    <p>
      While the agent was thus recounting to his wife the day&rsquo;s doings, the
      evicted Tryst sat on the end of his bed in a ground-floor room of Tod&rsquo;s
      cottage. He had taken off his heavy boots, and his feet, in their thick,
      soiled socks, were thrust into a pair of Tod&rsquo;s carpet slippers. He sat
      without moving, precisely as if some one had struck him a blow in the
      centre of the forehead, and over and over again he turned the heavy
      thought: &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve turned me out o&rsquo; there&mdash;I done nothing, and they
      turned me out o&rsquo; there! Blast them&mdash;they turned me out o&rsquo; there!&rsquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      In the orchard Tod sat with a grave and puzzled face, surrounded by the
      three little Trysts. And at the wicket gate Kirsteen, awaiting the arrival
      of Derek and Sheila&mdash;summoned home by telegram&mdash;stood in the
      evening glow, her blue-clad figure still as that of any worshipper at the
      muezzin-call.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fire, causing the destruction of several ricks and an empty cowshed,
      occurred in the early morning of Thursday on the home farm of Sir Gerald
      Malloring&rsquo;s estate in Worcestershire. Grave suspicions of arson are
      entertained, but up to the present no arrest has been made. The
      authorities are in doubt whether the occurrence has any relation with
      recent similar outbreaks in the eastern counties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Stanley read at breakfast, in his favorite paper; and the little leader
      thereon:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The outbreak of fire on Sir Gerald Malloring&rsquo;s Worcestershire property
      may or may not have any significance as a symptom of agrarian unrest. We
      shall watch the upshot with some anxiety. Certain it is that unless the
      authorities are prepared to deal sharply with arson, or other cases of
      deliberate damage to the property of landlords, we may bid good-by to any
      hope of ameliorating the lot of the laborer&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Stanley had risen and paced the room there would have been a good deal
      to be said for him; for, though he did not know as much as Felix of the
      nature and sentiments of Tod&rsquo;s children, he knew enough to make any but an
      Englishman uneasy. The fact that he went on eating ham, and said to Clara,
      &ldquo;Half a cup!&rdquo; was proof positive of that mysterious quality called phlegm
      which had long enabled his country to enjoy the peace of a weedy
      duck-pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanley, a man of some intelligence&mdash;witness his grasp of the secret
      of successful plough-making (none for the home market!)&mdash;had often
      considered this important proposition of phlegm. People said England was
      becoming degenerate and hysterical, growing soft, and nervous, and towny,
      and all the rest of it. In his view there was a good deal of bosh about
      that! &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;at the weight that chauffeurs put on! Look at
      the House of Commons, and the size of the upper classes!&rdquo; If there were
      growing up little shrill types of working men and Socialists, and new
      women, and half-penny papers, and a rather larger crop of professors and
      long-haired chaps&mdash;all the better for the rest of the country! The
      flesh all these skimpy ones had lost, solid people had put on. The country
      might be suffering a bit from officialism, and the tendency of modern
      thought, but the breed was not changing. John Bull was there all right
      under his moustache. Take it off and clap on little side-whiskers, and you
      had as many Bulls as you liked, any day. There would be no social upheaval
      so long as the climate was what it was! And with this simple formula, and
      a kind of very deep-down throaty chuckle, he would pass to a subject of
      more immediate importance. There was something, indeed, rather masterly in
      his grasp of the fact that rain might be trusted to put out any fire&mdash;give
      it time. And he kept a special vessel in a special corner which recorded
      for him faithfully the number of inches that fell; and now and again he
      wrote to his paper to say that there were more inches in his vessel than
      there had been &ldquo;for thirty years.&rdquo; His conviction that the country was in
      a bad way was nothing but a skin affection, causing him local irritation
      rather than affecting the deeper organs of his substantial body.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not readily confide in Clara concerning his own family, having in a
      marked degree the truly domestic quality of thinking it superior to his
      wife&rsquo;s. She had been a Tomson, not one of THE Tomsons, and it was quite a
      question whether he or she were trying to forget that fact the faster. But
      he did say to her as he was getting into the car:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just possible I might go round by Tod&rsquo;s on my way home. I want a
      run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered: &ldquo;Be careful what you say to that woman. I don&rsquo;t want her
      here by any chance. The young ones were quite bad enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when he had put in his day at the works he did turn the nose of his
      car toward Tod&rsquo;s. Travelling along grass-bordered roads, the beauty of
      this England struck his not too sensitive spirit and made him almost gasp.
      It was that moment of the year when the countryside seems to faint from
      its own loveliness, from the intoxication of its scents and sounds.
      Creamy-white may, splashed here and there with crimson, flooded the hedges
      in breaking waves of flower-foam; the fields were all buttercup glory;
      every tree had its cuckoo, calling; every bush its blackbird or thrush in
      full even-song. Swallows were flying rather low, and the sky, whose moods
      they watch, had the slumberous, surcharged beauty of a long, fine day,
      with showers not far away. Some orchards were still in blossom, and the
      great wild bees, hunting over flowers and grasses warm to their touch,
      kept the air deeply murmurous. Movement, light, color, song, scent, the
      warm air, and the fluttering leaves were confused, till one had almost
      become the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Stanley thought, for he was not rhapsodic &lsquo;Wonderful pretty country!
      The way everything&rsquo;s looked after&mdash;you never see it abroad!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the car, a creature with little patience for natural beauty, had
      brought him to the crossroads and stood, panting slightly, under the
      cliff-bank whereon grew Tod&rsquo;s cottage, so loaded now with lilac, wistaria,
      and roses that from the road nothing but a peak or two of the thatched
      roof could be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanley was distinctly nervous. It was not a weakness his face and figure
      were very capable of showing, but he felt that dryness of mouth and
      quivering of chest which precede adventures of the soul. Advancing up the
      steps and pebbled path, which Clara had trodden once, just nineteen years
      ago, and he himself but three times as yet in all, he cleared his throat
      and said to himself: &lsquo;Easy, old man! What is it, after all? She won&rsquo;t
      bite!&rsquo; And in the very doorway he came upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      What there was about this woman to produce in a man of common sense such
      peculiar sensations, he no more knew after seeing her than before. Felix,
      on returning from his visit, had said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s like a Song of the Hebrides
      sung in the middle of a programme of English ballads.&rdquo; The remark, as any
      literary man&rsquo;s might, had conveyed nothing to Stanley, and that in a
      far-fetched way. Still, when she said: &ldquo;Will you come in?&rdquo; he felt heavier
      and thicker than he had ever remembered feeling; as a glass of stout might
      feel coming across a glass of claret. It was, perhaps, the gaze of her
      eyes, whose color he could not determine, under eyebrows that waved in the
      middle and twitched faintly, or a dress that was blue, with the queerest
      effect of another color at the back of it, or perhaps the feeling of a
      torrent flowing there under a coat of ice, that might give way in little
      holes, so that your leg went in but not the whole of you. Something,
      anyway, made him feel both small and heavy&mdash;that awkward combination
      for a man accustomed to associate himself with cheerful but solid dignity.
      In seating himself by request at a table, in what seemed to be a sort of
      kitchen, he experienced a singular sensation in the legs, and heard her
      say, as it might be to the air:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biddy, dear, take Susie and Billy out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon a little girl with a sad and motherly face came crawling out
      from underneath the table, and dropped him a little courtesy. Then another
      still smaller girl came out, and a very small boy, staring with all his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these things were against Stanley, and he felt that if he did not make
      it quite clear that he was there he would soon not know where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to talk about this business up at Malloring&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And,
      encouraged by having begun, he added: &ldquo;Whose kids were those?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A level voice with a faint lisp answered him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They belong to a man called Tryst; he was turned out of his cottage on
      Wednesday because his dead wife&rsquo;s sister was staying with him, so we&rsquo;ve
      taken them in. Did you notice the look on the face of the eldest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stanley nodded. In truth, he had noticed something, though what he could
      not have said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At nine years old she has to do the housework and be a mother to the
      other two, besides going to school. This is all because Lady Malloring has
      conscientious scruples about marriage with a deceased wife&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly&rsquo;&mdash;thought Stanley&mdash;&lsquo;that does sound a bit thick!&rsquo; And
      he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the woman here, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s gone home for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Malloring&rsquo;s point is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whether or not you&rsquo;re to do
      what you like with your own property. For instance, if you had let this
      cottage to some one you thought was harming the neighborhood, wouldn&rsquo;t you
      terminate his tenancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered, still in that level voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her action is cowardly, narrow, and tyrannical, and no amount of
      sophistry will make me think differently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stanley felt precisely as if one of his feet had gone through the ice into
      water so cold that it seemed burning hot! Sophistry! In a plain man like
      himself! He had always connected the word with Felix. He looked at her,
      realizing suddenly that the association of his brother&rsquo;s family with the
      outrage on Malloring&rsquo;s estate was probably even nearer than he had feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Kirsteen!&rdquo; he said, uttering the unlikely name with
      resolution, for, after all, she was his sister-in-law: &ldquo;Did this fellow
      set fire to Malloring&rsquo;s ricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of a queer flash, a quiver, a something all over her face,
      which passed at once back to its intent gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no reason to suppose so. But tyranny produces revenge, as you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stanley shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my business to go into the
      rights and wrongs of what&rsquo;s been done. But, as a man of the world and a
      relative, I do ask you to look after your youngsters and see they don&rsquo;t
      get into a mess. They&rsquo;re an inflammable young couple&mdash;young blood,
      you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having made this speech, Stanley looked down, with a feeling that it would
      give her more chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; he heard her saying in that quiet, faintly lisping
      voice; &ldquo;but there are certain principles involved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, suddenly, his curious fear of this woman took shape. Principles! He
      had unconsciously been waiting for that word, than which none was more
      like a red rag to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What principles can possibly be involved in going against the law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where the law is unjust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stanley was startled, but he said: &ldquo;Remember that your principles, as you
      call them, may hurt other people besides yourself; Tod and your children
      most of all. How is the law unjust, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been sitting at the table opposite, but she got up now and went to
      the hearth. For a woman of forty-two&mdash;as he supposed she would be&mdash;she
      was extraordinarily lithe, and her eyes, fixed on him from under those
      twitching, wavy brows, had a curious glow in their darkness. The few
      silver threads in the mass of her over-fine black hair seemed to give it
      extra vitality. The whole of her had a sort of intensity that made him
      profoundly uncomfortable. And he thought suddenly: &lsquo;Poor old Tod! Fancy
      having to go to bed with that woman!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without raising her voice, she began answering his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These poor people have no means of setting law in motion, no means of
      choosing where and how they will live, no means of doing anything except
      just what they are told; the Mallorings have the means to set the law in
      motion, to choose where and how to live, and to dictate to others. That is
      why the law is unjust. With every independent pound a year, this equal law
      of yours&mdash;varies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; said Stanley. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a proposition!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you a simple case. If I had chosen not to marry Tod but to live
      with him in free love, we could have done it without inconvenience. We
      have some independent income; we could have afforded to disregard what
      people thought or did. We could have bought (as we did buy) our piece of
      land and our cottage, out of which we could not have been turned. Since we
      don&rsquo;t care for society, it would have made absolutely no difference to our
      present position. But Tryst, who does not even want to defy the law&mdash;what
      happens to him? What happens to hundreds of laborers all over the country
      who venture to differ in politics, religion, or morals from those who own
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By George!&rsquo; thought Stanley, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s true, in a way; I never looked at it
      quite like that.&rsquo; But the feeling that he had come to persuade her to be
      reasonable, and the deeply rooted Englishry of him, conspired to make him
      say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well; but, you see, it&rsquo;s only a necessary incident of
      property-holding. You can&rsquo;t interfere with plain rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;an evil inherent in property-holding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like; I don&rsquo;t split words. The lesser of two evils. What&rsquo;s your
      remedy? You don&rsquo;t want to abolish property; you&rsquo;ve confessed that property
      gives YOU your independence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again that curious quiver and flash!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but if people haven&rsquo;t decency enough to see for themselves how the
      law favors their independence, they must be shown that it doesn&rsquo;t pay to
      do to others as they would hate to be done by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t try reasoning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not amenable to reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stanley took up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think some of us are. I see your point; but, you know, violence
      never did any good; it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;isn&rsquo;t English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer. And, nonplussed thereby, he added lamely: &ldquo;I should
      have liked to have seen Tod and your youngsters. Remember me to them.
      Clara sent her regards;&rdquo; and, looking round the room in a rather lost way,
      he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an impression of something warm and dry put into it, with even a
      little pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the car, he said to his chauffeur, &ldquo;Go home the other way, Batter,
      past the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vision of that kitchen, with its brick floor, its black oak beams,
      bright copper pans, the flowers on the window-sill, the great, open
      hearth, and the figure of that woman in her blue dress standing before it,
      with her foot poised on a log, clung to his mind&rsquo;s eye with curious
      fidelity. And those three kids, popping out like that&mdash;proof that the
      whole thing was not a rather bad dream! &lsquo;Queer business!&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;bad
      business! That woman&rsquo;s uncommonly all there, though. Lot in what she said,
      too. Where the deuce should we all be if there were many like her!&rsquo; And
      suddenly he noticed, in a field to the right, a number of men coming along
      the hedge toward the road&mdash;evidently laborers. What were they doing?
      He stopped the car. There were fifteen or twenty of them, and back in the
      field he could see a girl&rsquo;s red blouse, where a little group of four still
      lingered. &lsquo;By George!&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;those must be the young Tods going
      it!&rsquo; And, curious to see what it might mean, Stanley fixed his attention
      on the gate through which the men were bound to come. First emerged a
      fellow in corduroys tied below the knee, with long brown moustaches
      decorating a face that, for all its haggardness, had a jovial look. Next
      came a sturdy little red-faced, bow-legged man in shirt-sleeves rolled up,
      walking alongside a big, dark fellow with a cap pushed up on his head, who
      had evidently just made a joke. Then came two old men, one of whom was
      limping, and three striplings. Another big man came along next, in a
      little clearance, as it were, between main groups. He walked heavily, and
      looked up lowering at the car. The fellow&rsquo;s eyes were queer, and
      threatening, and sad&mdash;giving Stanley a feeling of discomfort. Then
      came a short, square man with an impudent, loquacious face and a bit of
      swagger in his walk. He, too, looked up at Stanley and made some remark
      which caused two thin-faced fellows with him to grin sheepishly. A spare
      old man, limping heavily, with a yellow face and drooping gray moustaches,
      walked next, alongside a warped, bent fellow, with yellowish hair all over
      his face, whose expression struck Stanley as half-idiotic. Then two more
      striplings of seventeen or so, whittling at bits of sticks; an active,
      clean-shorn chap with drawn-in cheeks; and, last of all, a small man by
      himself, without a cap on a round head covered with thin, light hair,
      moving at a &lsquo;dot-here, dot-there&rsquo; walk, as though he had beasts to drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanley noted that all&mdash;save the big man with the threatening, sad
      eyes, the old, yellow-faced man with a limp, and the little man who came
      out last, lost in his imaginary beasts&mdash;looked at the car furtively
      as they went their ways. And Stanley thought: &lsquo;English peasant! Poor
      devil! Who is he? What is he? Who&rsquo;d miss him if he did die out? What&rsquo;s the
      use of all this fuss about him? He&rsquo;s done for! Glad I&rsquo;ve nothing to do
      with him at Becket, anyway! &ldquo;Back to the land!&rdquo; &ldquo;Independent peasantry!&rdquo;
       Not much! Shan&rsquo;t say that to Clara, though; knock the bottom out of her
      week-ends!&rsquo; And to his chauffeur he muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get on, Batter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, through the peace of that country, all laid down in grass, through the
      dignity and loveliness of trees and meadows, this May evening, with the
      birds singing under a sky surcharged with warmth and color, he sped home
      to dinner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      But next morning, turning on his back as it came dawn, Stanley thought,
      with the curious intensity which in those small hours so soon becomes
      fear: &lsquo;By Jove! I don&rsquo;t trust that woman a yard! I shall wire for Felix!&rsquo;
      And the longer he lay on his back, the more the conviction bored a hole in
      him. There was a kind of fever in the air nowadays, that women seemed to
      catch, as children caught the measles. What did it all mean? England used
      to be a place to live in. One would have thought an old country like this
      would have got through its infantile diseases! Hysteria! No one gave in to
      that. Still, one must look out! Arson was about the limit! And Stanley had
      a vision, suddenly, of his plough-works in flames. Why not? The ploughs
      were not for the English market. Who knew whether these laboring fellows
      mightn&rsquo;t take that as a grievance, if trouble began to spread? This
      somewhat far-fetched notion, having started to burrow, threw up a really
      horrid mole-hill on Stanley. And it was only the habit, in the human mind,
      of saying suddenly to fears: Stop! I&rsquo;m tired of you! that sent him to
      sleep about half past four.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not, however, neglect to wire to Felix:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If at all possible, come down again at once; awkward business at
      Joyfields.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor, on the charitable pretext of employing two old fellows past ordinary
      work, did he omit to treble his night-watchman....
    </p>
    <p>
      On Wednesday, the day of which he had seen the dawn rise, Felix had
      already been startled, on returning from his constitutional, to discover
      his niece and nephew in the act of departure. All the explanation
      vouchsafed had been: &ldquo;Awfully sorry, Uncle Felix; Mother&rsquo;s wired for us.&rdquo;
       Save for the general uneasiness which attended on all actions of that
      woman, Felix would have felt relieved at their going. They had disturbed
      his life, slipped between him and Nedda! So much so that he did not even
      expect her to come and tell him why they had gone, nor feel inclined to
      ask her. So little breaks the fine coherence of really tender ties! The
      deeper the quality of affection, the more it &lsquo;starts and puffs,&rsquo; and from
      sheer sensitive feeling, each for the other, spares attempt to get back
      into touch!
    </p>
    <p>
      His paper&mdash;though he did not apply to it the word &lsquo;favorite,&rsquo; having
      that proper literary feeling toward all newspapers, that they took him in
      rather than he them&mdash;gave him on Friday morning precisely the same
      news, of the rick-burning, as it gave to Stanley at breakfast and to John
      on his way to the Home Office. To John, less in the know, it merely
      brought a knitting of the brow and a vague attempt to recollect the
      numbers of the Worcestershire constabulary. To Felix it brought a feeling
      of sickness. Men whose work in life demands that they shall daily whip
      their nerves, run, as a rule, a little in advance of everything. And
      goodness knows what he did not see at that moment. He said no word to
      Nedda, but debated with himself and Flora what, if anything, was to be
      done. Flora, whose sense of humor seldom deserted her, held the more
      comfortable theory that there was nothing to be done as yet. Soon enough
      to cry when milk was spilled! He did not agree, but, unable to suggest a
      better course, followed her advice. On Saturday, however, receiving
      Stanley&rsquo;s wire, he had much difficulty in not saying to her, &ldquo;I told you
      so!&rdquo; The question that agitated him now was whether or not to take Nedda
      with him. Flora said: &ldquo;Yes. The child will be the best restraining
      influence, if there is really trouble brewing!&rdquo; Some feeling fought
      against this in Felix, but, suspecting it to be mere jealousy, he decided
      to take her. And, to the girl&rsquo;s rather puzzled delight, they arrived at
      Becket that day in time for dinner. It was not too reassuring to find John
      there, too. Stanley had also wired to him. The matter must indeed be
      serious!
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual week-end was in progress. Clara had made one of her greatest
      efforts. A Bulgarian had providentially written a book in which he showed,
      beyond doubt, that persons fed on brown bread, potatoes, and margarine,
      gave the most satisfactory results of all. It was a discovery of the first
      value as a topic for her dinner-table&mdash;seeming to solve the whole
      vexed problem of the laborers almost at one stroke. If they could only be
      got to feed themselves on this perfect programme, what a saving of the
      situation! On those three edibles, the Bulgarian said&mdash;and he had
      been well translated&mdash;a family of five could be maintained at full
      efficiency for a shilling per day. Why! that would leave nearly eight
      shillings a week, in many cases more, for rent, firing, insurance, the
      man&rsquo;s tobacco, and the children&rsquo;s boots. There would be no more of that
      terrible pinching by the mothers, to feed the husband and children
      properly, of which one heard so much; no more lamentable deterioration in
      our stock! Brown bread, potatoes, margarine&mdash;quite a great deal could
      be provided for seven shillings! And what was more delicious than a
      well-baked potato with margarine of good quality? The carbohydrates&mdash;or
      was it hybocardrates&mdash;ah, yes! the kybohardrates&mdash;would be
      present in really sufficient quantity! Little else was talked of all
      through dinner at her end of the table. Above the flowers which Frances
      Freeland always insisted on arranging&mdash;and very charmingly&mdash;when
      she was there&mdash;over bare shoulders and white shirt-fronts, those
      words bombed and rebombed. Brown bread, potatoes, margarine,
      carbohydrates, calorific! They mingled with the creaming sizzle of
      champagne, with the soft murmur of well-bred deglutition. White bosoms
      heaved and eyebrows rose at them. And now and again some Bigwig versed in
      science murmured the word &lsquo;Fats.&rsquo; An agricultural population fed to the
      point of efficiency without disturbance of the existing state of things!
      Eureka! If only into the bargain they could be induced to bake their own
      brown bread and cook their potatoes well! Faces flushed, eyes brightened,
      and teeth shone. It was the best, the most stimulating, dinner ever
      swallowed in that room. Nor was it until each male guest had eaten, drunk,
      and talked himself into torpor suitable to the company of his wife, that
      the three brothers could sit in the smoking-room together, undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Stanley had described his interview with &lsquo;that woman,&rsquo; his glimpse of
      the red blouse, and the laborers&rsquo; meeting, there was a silence before John
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be as well if Tod would send his two youngsters abroad for a
      bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he would, and I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d go. But we might try to
      get those two to see that anything the poor devils of laborers do is bound
      to recoil on themselves, fourfold. I suppose,&rdquo; he added, with sudden
      malice, &ldquo;a laborers&rsquo; rising would have no chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither John nor Stanley winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rising? Why should they rise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did in &lsquo;32.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In &lsquo;32!&rdquo; repeated John. &ldquo;Agriculture had its importance then. Now it has
      none. Besides, they&rsquo;ve no cohesion, no power, like the miners or railway
      men. Rising? No chance, no earthly! Weight of metal&rsquo;s dead against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money and guns! Guns and money! Confess with me, brethren, that we&rsquo;re
      glad of metal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John stared and Stanley drank off his whiskey and potash. Felix really was
      a bit &lsquo;too thick&rsquo; sometimes. Then Stanley said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder what Tod thinks of it all. Will you go over, Felix, and advise
      that our young friends be more considerate to these poor beggars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix nodded. And with &lsquo;Good night, old man&rsquo; all round, and no shaking of
      the hands, the three brothers dispersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But behind Felix, as he opened his bedroom door, a voice whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; And there, in the doorway of the adjoining room, was Nedda in her
      dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do come in for a minute. I&rsquo;ve been waiting up. You ARE late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix followed her into her room. The pleasure he would once have had in
      this midnight conspiracy was superseded now, and he stood blinking at her
      gravely. In that blue gown, with her dark hair falling on its lace collar
      and her face so round and childish, she seemed more than ever to have
      defrauded him. Hooking her arm in his, she drew him to the window; and
      Felix thought: &lsquo;She just wants to talk to me about Derek. Dog in the
      manger that I am! Here goes to be decent!&rsquo; So he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda pressed his hand with a little coaxing squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy, darling, I do love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, though Felix knew that she had grasped what he was feeling, a sort of
      warmth spread in him. She had begun counting his fingers with one of her
      own, sitting close beside him. The warmth in Felix deepened, but he
      thought: &lsquo;She must want a good deal out of me!&rsquo; Then she began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did we come down again? I know there&rsquo;s something wrong! It&rsquo;s hard not
      to know, when you&rsquo;re anxious.&rdquo; And she sighed. That little sigh affected
      Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d always rather know the truth, Dad. Aunt Clara said something about a
      fire at the Mallorings&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix stole a look at her. Yes! There was a lot in this child of his!
      Depth, warmth, and strength to hold to things. No use to treat her as a
      child! And he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, there&rsquo;s really nothing beyond what you know&mdash;our young man
      and Sheila are hotheads, and things over there are working up a bit. We
      must try and smooth them down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, ought I to back him whatever he does?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a question! The more so that one cannot answer superficially the
      questions of those whom one loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet. Some things it&rsquo;s not your duty
      to do; that&rsquo;s certain. It can&rsquo;t be right to do things simply because he
      does them&mdash;THAT&rsquo;S not real&mdash;however fond one is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I feel that. Only, it&rsquo;s so hard to know what I do really think&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      always such a lot trying to make one feel that only what&rsquo;s nice and cosey
      is right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Felix thought: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been brought up to believe that only Russian
      girls care for truth. It seems I was wrong. The saints forbid I should be
      a stumbling-block to my own daughter searching for it! And yet&mdash;where&rsquo;s
      it all leading? Is this the same child that told me only the other night
      she wanted to know everything? She&rsquo;s a woman now! So much for love!&rsquo; And
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go forward quietly, without expecting too much of ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Dad; only I distrust myself so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one ever got near the truth who didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we go over to Joyfields to-morrow? I don&rsquo;t think I could bear a whole
      day of Bigwigs and eating, with this hanging&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Bigwigs! All right! We&rsquo;ll go. And now, bed; and think of nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her whisper tickled his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a darling to me, Dad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for some time after she had forgotten everything he leaned out of his
      window, smoking cigarettes, and trying to see the body and soul of night.
      How quiet she was&mdash;night, with her mystery, bereft of moon, in whose
      darkness seemed to vibrate still the song of the cuckoos that had been
      calling so all day! And whisperings of leaves communed with Felix.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      What Tod thought of all this was, perhaps, as much of an enigma to Tod as
      to his three brothers, and never more so than on that Sunday morning when
      two police constables appeared at his door with a warrant for the arrest
      of Tryst. After regarding them fixedly for full thirty seconds, he said,
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; and left them in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen was washing breakfast things which had a leadless glaze, and
      Tryst&rsquo;s three children, extremely tidy, stood motionless at the edge of
      the little scullery, watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had joined him in the kitchen Tod shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two policemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;want Tryst. Are they to have him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the life together of these two there had, from the very start, been a
      queer understanding as to who should decide what. It had become by now so
      much a matter of instinct that combative consultations, which bulk so
      large in married lives, had no place in theirs. A frowning tremor passed
      over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they must. Derek is out. Leave it to me, Tod, and take the
      tinies into the orchard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tod took the three little Trysts to the very spot where Derek and Nedda
      had gazed over the darkening fields in exchanging that first kiss, and,
      sitting on the stump of the apple-tree he had cut down, he presented each
      of them with an apple. While they ate, he stared. And his dog stared at
      him. How far there worked in Tod the feelings of an ordinary man watching
      three small children whose only parent the law was just taking into its
      charge it would be rash to say, but his eyes were extremely blue and there
      was a frown between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Biddy?&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddy did not reply; the habit of being a mother had imposed on her,
      together with the gravity of her little, pale, oval face, a peculiar
      talent for silence. But the round-cheeked Susie said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy can eat cores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this statement, silence was broken only by munching, till Tod
      remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The children, having the instinct that he had not asked them, but himself,
      came closer. He had in his hand a little beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This beetle lives in rotten wood; nice chap, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We kill beetles; we&rsquo;re afraid of them.&rdquo; So Susie.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now round Tod so close that Billy was standing on one of his
      large feet, Susie leaning her elbows on one of his broad knees, and
      Biddy&rsquo;s slender little body pressed against his huge arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tod; &ldquo;beetles are nice chaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The birds eats them,&rdquo; remarked Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This beetle,&rdquo; said Tod, &ldquo;eats wood. It eats through trees and the trees
      get rotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biddy spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they don&rsquo;t give no more apples.&rdquo; Tod put the beetle down and Billy
      got off his foot to tread on it. When he had done his best the beetle
      emerged and vanished in the grass. Tod, who had offered no remonstrance,
      stretched out his hand and replaced Billy on his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about my treading on you, Billy?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m big and you&rsquo;re little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On Billy&rsquo;s square face came a puzzled defiance. If he had not been early
      taught his station he would evidently have found some poignant retort. An
      intoxicated humblebee broke the silence by buzzing into Biddy&rsquo;s
      fluffed-out, corn-gold hair. Tod took it off with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely chap, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The children, who had recoiled, drew close again, while the drunken bee
      crawled feebly in the cage of Tod&rsquo;s large hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bees sting,&rdquo; said Biddy; &ldquo;I fell on a bee and it stang me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stang it first,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;This chap wouldn&rsquo;t sting&mdash;not for
      worlds. Stroke it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biddy put out her little, pale finger but stayed it a couple of inches
      from the bee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Tod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening her mouth a little, Biddy went on and touched the bee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s soft,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t it buzz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to stroke it, too,&rdquo; said Susie. And Billy stamped a little on
      Tod&rsquo;s foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tod; &ldquo;only Biddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was perfect silence till the dog, rising, approached its nose, black
      with a splash of pinky whiteness on the end of the bridge, as if to love
      the bee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tod. The dog looked at him, and his yellow-brown eyes were dark
      with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll sting the dog&rsquo;s nose,&rdquo; said Biddy, and Susie and Billy came yet
      closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment, when the heads of the dog, the bee, Tod, Biddy,
      Susie, and Billy might have been contained within a noose three feet in
      diameter, that Felix dismounted from Stanley&rsquo;s car and, coming from the
      cottage, caught sight of that little idyll under the dappled sunlight,
      green, and blossom. It was something from the core of life, out of the
      heartbeat of things&mdash;like a rare picture or song, the revelation of
      the childlike wonder and delight, to which all other things are but the
      supernumerary casings&mdash;a little pool of simplicity into which fever
      and yearning sank and were for a moment drowned. And quite possibly he
      would have gone away without disturbing them if the dog had not growled
      and wagged his tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the children had been sent down into the field he experienced the
      usual difficulty in commencing a talk with Tod. How far was his big
      brother within reach of mere unphilosophic statements; how far was he
      going to attend to facts?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We came back yesterday,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;Nedda and I. You know all about Derek
      and Nedda, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tod nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Felix, &ldquo;but a firebrand. This business at Malloring&rsquo;s&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      it going to lead to, Tod? We must look out, old man. Couldn&rsquo;t you send
      Derek and Sheila abroad for a bit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, after all, they&rsquo;re dependent on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that to them; I should never see them again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix, who felt the instinctive wisdom of that remark, answered
      helplessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit tight.&rdquo; And Tod&rsquo;s hand came down on Felix&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose they get into real trouble? Stanley and John don&rsquo;t like it;
      and there&rsquo;s Mother.&rdquo; And Felix added, with sudden heat, &ldquo;Besides, I can&rsquo;t
      stand Nedda being made anxious like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tod removed his hand. Felix would have given a good deal to have been able
      to see into the brain behind the frowning stare of those blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help by worrying. What must be, will. Look at the birds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remark from any other man would have irritated Felix profoundly;
      coming from Tod, it seemed the unconscious expression of a really felt
      philosophy. And, after all, was he not right? What was this life they all
      lived but a ceaseless worrying over what was to come? Was not all man&rsquo;s
      unhappiness caused by nervous anticipations of the future? Was not that
      the disease, and the misfortune, of the age; perhaps of all the countless
      ages man had lived through?
    </p>
    <p>
      With an effort he recalled his thoughts from that far flight. What if Tod
      had rediscovered the secret of the happiness that belonged to birds and
      lilies of the field&mdash;such overpowering interest in the moment that
      the future did not exist? Why not? Were not the only minutes when he
      himself was really happy those when he lost himself in work, or love? And
      why were they so few? For want of pressure to the square moment. Yes! All
      unhappiness was fear and lack of vitality to live the present fully. That
      was why love and fighting were such poignant ecstasies&mdash;they lived
      their present to the full. And so it would be almost comic to say to those
      young people: Go away; do nothing in this matter in which your interest
      and your feelings are concerned! Don&rsquo;t have a present, because you&rsquo;ve got
      to have a future! And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a good deal for your power of losing yourself in the moment, old
      boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Tod. He was examining the bark of a tree, which
      had nothing the matter with it, so far as Felix could see; while his dog,
      who had followed them, carefully examined Tod. Both were obviously lost in
      the moment. And with a feeling of defeat Felix led the way back to the
      cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the brick-floored kitchen Derek was striding up and down; while around
      him, in an equilateral triangle, stood the three women, Sheila at the
      window, Kirsteen by the open hearth, Nedda against the wall opposite.
      Derek exclaimed at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you let them, Father? Why didn&rsquo;t you refuse to give him up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix looked at his brother. In the doorway, where his curly head nearly
      touched the wood, Tod&rsquo;s face was puzzled, rueful. He did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one could have said he wasn&rsquo;t here. We could have smuggled him away.
      Now the brutes have got him! I don&rsquo;t know that, though&mdash;&rdquo; And he made
      suddenly for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tod did not budge. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Derek turned; his mother was at the other door; at the window, the two
      girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comedy of this scene, if there be comedy in the face of grief, was for
      the moment lost on Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s come,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;What now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Derek had flung himself down at the table and was burying his head in his
      hands. Sheila went up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Derek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However right and natural that remark, it seemed inadequate.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Felix looked at Nedda. The blue motor scarf she had worn had slipped
      off her dark head; her face was white; her eyes, fixed immovably on Derek,
      seemed waiting for him to recognize that she was there. The boy broke out
      again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was treachery! We took him in; and now we&rsquo;ve given him up. They
      wouldn&rsquo;t have touched US if we&rsquo;d got him away. Not they!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix literally heard the breathing of Tod on one side of him and of
      Kirsteen on the other. He crossed over and stood opposite his nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Derek,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;your mother was quite right. You might have
      put this off for a day or two; but it was bound to come. You don&rsquo;t know
      the reach of the law. Come, my dear fellow! It&rsquo;s no good making a fuss,
      that&rsquo;s childish&mdash;the thing is to see that the man gets every chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek looked up. Probably he had not yet realized that his uncle was in
      the room; and Felix was astonished at his really haggard face; as if the
      incident had bitten and twisted some vital in his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He trusted us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix saw Kirsteen quiver and flinch, and understood why they had none of
      them felt quite able to turn their backs on that display of passion.
      Something deep and unreasoning was on the boy&rsquo;s side; something that would
      not fit with common sense and the habits of civilized society; something
      from an Arab&rsquo;s tent or a Highland glen. Then Tod came up behind and put
      his hands on his son&rsquo;s shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;milk&rsquo;s spilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Derek gruffly, and he went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix made Nedda a sign and she slipped out after him.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nedda, her blue head-gear trailing, followed along at the boy&rsquo;s side while
      he passed through the orchard and two fields; and when he threw himself
      down under an ash-tree she, too, subsided, waiting for him to notice her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that ironic little speech Derek sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll kill him,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;to burn things, Derek! To light horrible cruel flames, and burn
      things, even if they aren&rsquo;t alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek said through his teeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I who did it! If I&rsquo;d never talked to him he&rsquo;d have been like the
      others. They were taking him in a cart, like a calf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda got possession of his hand and held it tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a bitter and frightening hour under the faintly rustling
      ash-tree, while the wind sprinkled over her flakes of the may blossom,
      just past its prime. Love seemed now so little a thing, seemed to have
      lost warmth and power, seemed like a suppliant outside a door. Why did
      trouble come like this the moment one felt deeply?
    </p>
    <p>
      The church bell was tolling; they could see the little congregation pass
      across the churchyard into that weekly dream they knew too well. And
      presently the drone emerged, mingling with the voices outside, of sighing
      trees and trickling water, of the rub of wings, birds&rsquo; songs, and the
      callings of beasts everywhere beneath the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of suffering because love was not the first emotion in his heart,
      the girl could only feel he was right not to be loving her; that she ought
      to be glad of what was eating up all else within him. It was ungenerous,
      unworthy, to want to be loved at such a moment. Yet she could not help it!
      This was her first experience of the eternal tug between self and the
      loved one pulled in the hearts of lovers. Would she ever come to feel
      happy when he was just doing what he thought was right? And she drew a
      little away from him; then perceived that unwittingly she had done the
      right thing, for he at once tried to take her hand again. And this was her
      first lesson, too, in the nature of man. If she did not give her hand, he
      wanted it! But she was not one of those who calculate in love; so she gave
      him her hand at once. That went to his heart; and he put his arm round
      her, till he could feel the emotion under those stays that would not be
      drawn any closer. In this nest beneath the ash-tree they sat till they
      heard the organ wheeze and the furious sound of the last hymn, and saw the
      brisk coming-forth with its air of, &lsquo;Thank God! And now, to eat!&rsquo; till at
      last there was no stir again about the little church&mdash;no stir at all
      save that of nature&rsquo;s ceaseless thanksgiving....
    </p>
    <p>
      Tod, his brown face still rueful, had followed those two out into the air,
      and Sheila had gone quickly after him. Thus left alone with his
      sister-in-law, Felix said gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want the boy to get into real trouble, do all you can to
      show him that the last way in the world to help these poor fellows is to
      let them fall foul of the law. It&rsquo;s madness to light flames you can&rsquo;t put
      out. What happened this morning? Did the man resist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face still showed how bitter had been her mortification, and he was
      astonished that she kept her voice so level and emotionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He went with them quite quietly. The back door was open; he could
      have walked out. I did not advise him to. I&rsquo;m glad no one saw his face
      except myself. You see,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s devoted to Derek, and Derek
      knows it; that&rsquo;s why he feels it so, and will feel it more and more. The
      boy has a great sense of honour, Felix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under that tranquillity Felix caught the pain and yearning in her voice.
      Yes! This woman really felt and saw. She was not one of those who make
      disturbance with their brains and powers of criticism; rebellion leaped
      out from the heat in her heart. But he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it right to fan this flame? Do you think any good end is being
      served?&rdquo; Waiting for her answer, he found himself gazing at the ghost of
      dark down on her upper lip, wondering that he had never noticed it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very low, as if to herself, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would kill myself to-day if I didn&rsquo;t believe that tyranny and injustice
      must end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In our time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you content to go on working for an Utopia that you will never see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While our laborers are treated and housed more like dogs than human
      beings, while the best life under the sun&mdash;because life on the soil
      might be the best life&mdash;is despised and starved, and made the
      plaything of people&rsquo;s tongues, neither I nor mine are going to rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The admiration she inspired in Felix at that moment was mingled with a
      kind of pity. He said impressively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the forces you are up against? Have you looked into the
      unfathomable heart of this trouble? Understood the tug of the towns, the
      call of money to money; grasped the destructive restlessness of modern
      life; the abysmal selfishness of people when you threaten their interests;
      the age-long apathy of those you want to help? Have you grasped all
      these?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix held out his hand. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are truly brave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It got bitten into me very young. I was brought up in the Highlands among
      the crofters in their worst days. In some ways the people here are not so
      badly off, but they&rsquo;re still slaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except that they can go to Canada if they want, and save old England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flushed. &ldquo;I hate irony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix looked at her with ever-increasing interest; she certainly was of
      the kind that could be relied on to make trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that when we can no longer smile we can
      only swell and burst. It IS some consolation to reflect that by the time
      we&rsquo;ve determined to do something really effectual for the ploughmen of
      England there&rsquo;ll be no ploughmen left!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot smile at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, studying her face, Felix thought, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right there! You&rsquo;ll get no
      help from humor.&rsquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Early that afternoon, with Nedda between them, Felix and his nephew were
      speeding toward Transham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little town&mdash;a hamlet when Edmund Moreton dropped the E from his
      name and put up the works which Stanley had so much enlarged&mdash;had
      monopolized by now the hill on which it stood. Living entirely on its
      ploughs, it yet had but little of the true look of a British factory town,
      having been for the most part built since ideas came into fashion. With
      its red roofs and chimneys, it was only moderately ugly, and here and
      there an old white, timbered house still testified to the fact that it had
      once been country. On this fine Sunday afternoon the population were in
      the streets, and presented all that long narrow-headedness, that twist and
      distortion of feature, that perfect absence of beauty in face, figure, and
      dress, which is the glory of the Briton who has been for three generations
      in a town. &lsquo;And my great-grandfather&rsquo;&mdash;thought Felix&mdash;&lsquo;did all
      this! God rest his soul!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At a rather new church on the very top they halted, and went in to inspect
      the Morton memorials. There they were, in dedicated corners. &lsquo;Edmund and
      his wife Catherine&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Charles Edmund and his wife Florence&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Maurice
      Edmund and his wife Dorothy.&rsquo; Clara had set her foot down against &lsquo;Stanley
      and his wife Clara&rsquo; being in the fourth; her soul was above ploughs, and
      she, of course, intended to be buried at Becket, as Clara, dowager Lady
      Freeland, for her efforts in regard to the land. Felix, who had a tendency
      to note how things affected other people, watched Derek&rsquo;s inspection of
      these memorials and marked that they excited in him no tendency to
      ribaldry. The boy, indeed, could hardly be expected to see in them what
      Felix saw&mdash;an epitome of the great, perhaps fatal, change that had
      befallen his native country; a record of the beginning of that far-back
      fever, whose course ran ever faster, which had emptied country into town
      and slowly, surely, changed the whole spirit of life. When Edmund Moreton,
      about 1780, took the infection disseminated by the development of
      machinery, and left the farming of his acres to make money, that thing was
      done which they were all now talking about trying to undo, with their
      cries of: &ldquo;Back to the land! Back to peace and sanity in the shade of the
      elms! Back to the simple and patriarchal state of feeling which old
      documents disclose. Back to a time before these little squashed heads and
      bodies and features jutted every which way; before there were long
      squashed streets of gray houses; long squashed chimneys emitting
      smoke-blight; long squashed rows of graves; and long squashed columns of
      the daily papers. Back to well-fed countrymen who could not read, with
      Common rights, and a kindly feeling for old &lsquo;Moretons,&rsquo; who had a kindly
      feeling for them!&rdquo; Back to all that? A dream! Sirs! A dream! There was
      nothing for it now, but&mdash;progress! Progress! On with the dance! Let
      engines rip, and the little, squash-headed fellows with them! Commerce,
      literature, religion, science, politics, all taking a hand; what a
      glorious chance had money, ugliness, and ill will! Such were the
      reflections of Felix before the brass tablet:
    </p>

    <p>
      From the church they went about their proper business, to interview a Mr.
      Pogram, of the firm of Pogram &amp; Collet, solicitors, in whose hands the
      interests of many citizens of Transham and the country round were almost
      securely deposited. He occupied, curiously enough, the house where Edmund
      Morton himself had lived, conducting his works on the one hand and the
      squirearchy of the parish on the other. Incorporated now into the line of
      a long, loose street, it still stood rather apart from its neighbors,
      behind some large shrubs and trees of the holmoak variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pogram, who was finishing his Sunday after-lunch cigar, was a short,
      clean-shaved man with strong cheeks and those rather lustful gray-blue
      eyes which accompany a sturdy figure. He rose when they were introduced,
      and, uncrossing his fat little thighs, asked what he could do for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix propounded the story of the arrest, so far as might be, in words of
      one syllable, avoiding the sentimental aspect of the question, and finding
      it hard to be on the side of disorder, as any modern writer might. There
      was something, however, about Mr. Pogram that reassured him. The small
      fellow looked a fighter&mdash;looked as if he would sympathize with
      Tryst&rsquo;s want of a woman about him. The tusky but soft-hearted little brute
      kept nodding his round, sparsely covered head while he listened, exuding a
      smell of lavender-water, cigars, and gutta-percha. When Felix ceased he
      said, rather dryly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Gerald Malloring? Yes. Sir Gerald&rsquo;s country agents, I rather think,
      are Messrs. Porter of Worcester. Quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a conviction that Mr. Pogram thought they should have been Messrs.
      Pogram &amp; Collet of Transham confirmed in Felix the feeling that they
      had come to the right man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gather,&rdquo; Mr. Pogram said, and he looked at Nedda with a glance from
      which he obviously tried to remove all earthly desires, &ldquo;that you, sir,
      and your nephew wish to go and see the man. Mrs. Pogram will be delighted
      to show Miss Freeland our garden. Your great-grandfather, sir, on the
      mother&rsquo;s side, lived in this house. Delighted to meet you; often heard of
      your books; Mrs. Pogram has read one&mdash;let me see&mdash;&lsquo;The
      Bannister,&rsquo; was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Balustrade,&rsquo;&rdquo; Felix answered gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pogram rang the bell. &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Assizes are just over so
      that he can&rsquo;t come up for trial till August or September; pity&mdash;great
      pity! Bail in cases of arson&mdash;for a laborer, very doubtful! Ask your
      mistress to come, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There entered a faded rose of a woman on whom Mr. Pogram in his time had
      evidently made a great impression. A vista of two or three little Pograms
      behind her was hastily removed by the maid. And they all went into the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through here,&rdquo; said Mr. Pogram, coming to a side door in the garden wall,
      &ldquo;we can make a short cut to the police station. As we go along I shall ask
      you one or two blunt questions.&rdquo; And he thrust out his under lip:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance, what&rsquo;s your interest in this matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Felix could answer, Derek had broken in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle has come out of kindness. It&rsquo;s my affair, sir. The man has been
      tyrannously treated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pogram cocked his eye. &ldquo;Yes, yes; no doubt, no doubt! He&rsquo;s not
      confessed, I understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pogram laid a finger on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never say die; that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for. So,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a
      rebel; Socialist, perhaps. Dear me! Well, we&rsquo;re all of us something,
      nowadays&mdash;I&rsquo;m a humanitarian myself. Often say to Mrs. Pogram&mdash;humanity&rsquo;s
      the thing in this age&mdash;and so it is! Well, now, what line shall we
      take?&rdquo; And he rubbed his hands. &ldquo;Shall we have a try at once to upset what
      evidence they&rsquo;ve got? We should want a strong alibi. Our friends here will
      commit if they can&mdash;nobody likes arson. I understand he was sleeping
      in your cottage. His room, now? Was it on the ground floor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pogram frowned, as who should say: Ah! Be careful! &ldquo;He had better
      reserve his defence and give us time to turn round,&rdquo; he said rather
      shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had arrived at the police station and after a little parley were
      ushered into the presence of Tryst.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big laborer was sitting on the stool in his cell, leaning back against
      the wall, his hands loose and open at his sides. His gaze passed at once
      from Felix and Mr. Pogram, who were in advance, to Derek; and the dumb
      soul seemed suddenly to look through, as one may see all there is of
      spirit in a dog reach out to its master. This was the first time Felix had
      seen him who had caused already so much anxiety, and that broad, almost
      brutal face, with the yearning fidelity in its tragic eyes, made a
      powerful impression on him. It was the sort of face one did not forget and
      might be glad of not remembering in dreams. What had put this yearning
      spirit into so gross a frame, destroying its solid coherence? Why could
      not Tryst have been left by nature just a beer-loving serf, devoid of
      grief for his dead wife, devoid of longing for the nearest he could get to
      her again, devoid of susceptibility to this young man&rsquo;s influence? And the
      thought of all that was before the mute creature, sitting there in heavy,
      hopeless patience, stung Felix&rsquo;s heart so that he could hardly bear to
      look him in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Derek had taken the man&rsquo;s thick, brown hand; Felix could see with what
      effort the boy was biting back his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Pogram, Bob. A solicitor who&rsquo;ll do all he can for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix looked at Mr. Pogram. The little man was standing with arms akimbo;
      his face the queerest mixture of shrewdness and compassion, and he was
      giving off an almost needlessly strong scent of gutta-percha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you and I are going to have a talk when these
      gentlemen have done with you,&rdquo; and, turning on his heel, he began to touch
      up the points of his little pink nails with a penknife, in front of the
      constable who stood outside the cell door, with his professional air of
      giving a man a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Invaded by a feeling, apt to come to him in Zoos, that he was watching a
      creature who had no chance to escape being watched, Felix also turned;
      but, though his eyes saw not, his ears could not help hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Bob! It&rsquo;s I who got you into this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; naught to forgive. I&rsquo;ll soon be back, and then they&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the reddening of Mr. Pogram&rsquo;s ears Felix formed the opinion that the
      little man, also, could hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her not to fret, Mr. Derek. I&rsquo;d like a shirt, in case I&rsquo;ve got to
      stop. The children needn&rsquo; know where I be; though I an&rsquo;t ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be a longer job than you think, Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that followed Felix could not help turning. The laborer&rsquo;s
      eyes were moving quickly round his cell, as if for the first time he
      realized that he was shut up; suddenly he brought those big hands of his
      together and clasped them between his knees, and again his gaze ran round
      the cell. Felix heard the clearing of a throat close by, and, more than
      ever conscious of the scent of gutta-percha, grasped its connection with
      compassion in the heart of Mr. Pogram. He caught Derek&rsquo;s muttered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      ever think we&rsquo;re forgetting you, Bob,&rdquo; and something that sounded like,
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t ever say you did it.&rdquo; Then, passing Felix and the little
      lawyer, the boy went out. His head was held high, but tears were running
      down his cheeks. Felix followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bank of clouds, gray-white, was rising just above the red-tiled roofs,
      but the sun still shone brightly. And the thought of the big laborer
      sitting there knocked and knocked at Felix&rsquo;s heart mournfully, miserably.
      He had a warmer feeling for his young nephew than he had ever had. Mr.
      Pogram rejoined them soon, and they walked on together,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pogram answered in a somewhat grumpy voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not guilty, and reserve defence. You have influence, young man! Dumb as a
      waiter. Poor devil!&rdquo; And not another word did he say till they had
      re-entered his garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the ladies, surrounded by many little Pograms, were having tea. And
      seated next the little lawyer, whose eyes were fixed on Nedda, Felix was
      able to appreciate that in happier mood he exhaled almost exclusively the
      scent of lavender-water and cigars.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      On their way back to Becket, after the visit to Tryst, Felix and Nedda
      dropped Derek half-way on the road to Joyfields. They found that the
      Becket household already knew of the arrest. Woven into a dirge on the
      subject of &lsquo;the Land,&rsquo; the last town doings, and adventures on golf
      courses, it formed the genial topic of the dinner-table; for the Bulgarian
      with his carbohydrates was already a wonder of the past. The Bigwigs of
      this week-end were quite a different lot from those of three weeks ago,
      and comparatively homogeneous, having only three different plans for
      settling the land question, none of which, fortunately, involved any more
      real disturbance of the existing state of things than the potato,
      brown-bread plan, for all were based on the belief held by the respectable
      press, and constructive portions of the community, that omelette can be
      made without breaking eggs. On one thing alone, the whole house party was
      agreed&mdash;the importance of the question. Indeed, a sincere conviction
      on this point was like the card one produces before one is admitted to
      certain functions. No one came to Becket without it; or, if he did, he
      begged, borrowed, or stole it the moment he smelled Clara&rsquo;s special
      pot-pourri in the hall; and, though he sometimes threw it out of the
      railway-carriage window in returning to town, there was nothing remarkable
      about that. The conversational debauch of the first night&rsquo;s dinner&mdash;and,
      alas! there were only two even at Becket during a week-end&mdash;had
      undoubtedly revealed the feeling, which had set in of late, that there was
      nothing really wrong with the condition of the agricultural laborer, the
      only trouble being that the unreasonable fellow did not stay on the land.
      It was believed that Henry Wiltram, in conjunction with Colonel Martlett,
      was on the point of promoting a policy for imposing penalties on those who
      attempted to leave it without good reason, such reason to be left to the
      discretion of impartial district boards, composed each of one laborer, one
      farmer, and one landowner, decision going by favor of majority. And though
      opinion was rather freely expressed that, since the voting would always be
      two to one against, this might trench on the liberty of the subject, many
      thought that the interests of the country were so much above this
      consideration that something of the sort would be found, after all, to be
      the best arrangement. The cruder early notions of resettling the land by
      fostering peasant proprietorship, with habitable houses and security of
      tenure, were already under a cloud, since it was more than suspected that
      they would interfere unduly with the game laws and other soundly vested
      interests. Mere penalization of those who (or whose fathers before them)
      had at great pains planted so much covert, enclosed so much common, and
      laid so much country down in grass was hardly a policy for statesmen. A
      section of the guests, and that perhaps strongest because most silent,
      distinctly favored this new departure of Henry Wiltram&rsquo;s. Coupled with his
      swinging corn tax, it was indubitably a stout platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second section of the guests spoke openly in favor of Lord Settleham&rsquo;s
      policy of good-will. The whole thing, they thought, must be voluntary, and
      they did not see any reason why, if it were left to the kindness and good
      intentions of the landowner, there should be any land question at all.
      Boards would be formed in every county on which such model landowners as
      Sir Gerald Malloring, or Lord Settleham himself, would sit, to apply the
      principles of goodwill. Against this policy the only criticism was
      levelled by Felix. He could have agreed, he said, if he had not noticed
      that Lord Settleham, and nearly all landowners, were thoroughly satisfied
      with their existing good-will and averse to any changes in their education
      that might foster an increase of it. If&mdash;he asked&mdash;landowners
      were so full of good-will, and so satisfied that they could not be
      improved in that matter, why had they not already done what was now
      proposed, and settled the land question? He himself believed that the land
      question, like any other, was only capable of settlement through
      improvement in the spirit of all concerned, but he found it a little
      difficult to credit Lord Settleham and the rest of the landowners with
      sincerity in the matter so long as they were unconscious of any need for
      their own improvement. According to him, they wanted it both ways, and, so
      far as he could see, they meant to have it!
    </p>
    <p>
      His use of the word sincere, in connection with Lord Settleham, was at
      once pounced on. He could not know Lord Settleham&mdash;one of the most
      sincere of men. Felix freely admitted that he did not, and hastened to
      explain that he did not question the&mdash;er&mdash;parliamentary
      sincerity of Lord Settleham and his followers. He only ventured to doubt
      whether they realized the hold that human nature had on them. His
      experience, he said, of the houses where they had been bred, and the
      seminaries where they had been trained, had convinced him that there was
      still a conspiracy on foot to blind Lord Settleham and those others
      concerning all this; and, since they were themselves part of the
      conspiracy, there was very little danger of their unmasking it. At this
      juncture Felix was felt to have exceeded the limit of fair criticism, and
      only that toleration toward literary men of a certain reputation, in
      country houses, as persons brought there to say clever and irresponsible
      things, prevented people from taking him seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third section of the guests, unquestionably more static than the
      others, confined themselves to pointing out that, though the land question
      was undoubtedly serious, nothing whatever would result from placing any
      further impositions upon landowners. For, after all, what was land? Simply
      capital invested in a certain way, and very poorly at that. And what was
      capital? Simply a means of causing wages to be paid. And whether they were
      paid to men who looked after birds and dogs, loaded your guns, beat your
      coverts, or drove you to the shoot, or paid to men who ploughed and
      fertilized the land, what did it matter? To dictate to a man to whom he
      was to pay wages was, in the last degree, un-English. Everybody knew the
      fate which had come, or was coming, upon capital. It was being driven out
      of the country by leaps and bounds&mdash;though, to be sure, it still
      perversely persisted in yielding every year a larger revenue by way of
      income tax. And it would be dastardly to take advantage of land just
      because it was the only sort of capital which could not fly the country in
      times of need. Stanley himself, though&mdash;as became a host&mdash;he
      spoke little and argued not at all, was distinctly of this faction; and
      Clara sometimes felt uneasy lest her efforts to focus at Becket all
      interest in the land question should not quite succeed in outweighing the
      passivity of her husband&rsquo;s attitude. But, knowing that it is bad policy to
      raise the whip too soon, she trusted to her genius to bring him &lsquo;with one
      run at the finish,&rsquo; as they say, and was content to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was universal sympathy with the Mallorings. If a model landlord like
      Malloring had trouble with his people, who&mdash;who should be immune?
      Arson! It was the last word! Felix, who secretly shared Nedda&rsquo;s horror of
      the insensate cruelty of flames, listened, nevertheless, to the jubilation
      that they had caught the fellow, with profound disturbance. For the memory
      of the big laborer seated against the wall, his eyes haunting round his
      cell, quarrelled fiercely with his natural abhorrence of any kind of
      violence, and his equally natural dislike of what brought anxiety into his
      own life&mdash;and the life, almost as precious, of his little daughter.
      Scarcely a word of the evening&rsquo;s conversation but gave him in high degree
      the feeling: How glib all this is, how far from reality! How fatted up
      with shell after shell of comfort and security! What do these people know,
      what do they realize, of the pressure and beat of raw life that lies
      behind&mdash;what do even I, who have seen this prisoner, know? For us
      it&rsquo;s as simple as killing a rat that eats our corn, or a flea that sucks
      our blood. Arson! Destructive brute&mdash;lock him up! And something in
      Felix said: For order, for security, this may be necessary. But something
      also said: Our smug attitude is odious!
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched his little daughter closely, and several times marked the color
      rush up in her face, and once could have sworn he saw tears in her eyes.
      If the temper of this talk were trying to him, hardened at a hundred
      dinner-tables, what must it be to a young and ardent creature! And he was
      relieved to find, on getting to the drawing-room, that she had slipped
      behind the piano and was chatting quietly with her Uncle John....
    </p>
    <p>
      As to whether this or that man liked her, Nedda perhaps was not more
      ignorant than other women; and she had noted a certain warmth and twinkle
      in Uncle John&rsquo;s eyes the other evening, a certain rather jolly tendency to
      look at her when he should have been looking at the person to whom he was
      talking; so that she felt toward him a trustful kindliness not altogether
      unmingled with a sense that he was in that Office which controls the
      destinies of those who &lsquo;get into trouble.&rsquo; The motives even of statesmen,
      they say, are mixed; how much more so, then, of girls in love! Tucked away
      behind a Steinway, which instinct told her was not for use, she looked up
      under her lashes at her uncle&rsquo;s still military figure and said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was awfully good of you to come, too, Uncle John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And John, gazing down at that round, dark head, and those slim, pretty,
      white shoulders, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all&mdash;very glad to get a breath of fresh air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he stealthily tightened his white waistcoat&mdash;a rite neglected of
      late; the garment seemed to him at the moment unnecessarily loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have so much experience, Uncle. Do you think violent rebellion is
      ever justifiable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think that,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;because I don&rsquo;t
      think it is, either. I do so want you to like Derek, Uncle John, because&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      a secret from nearly every one&mdash;he and I are engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John jerked his head up a little, as though he had received a slight blow.
      The news was not palatable. He kept his form, however, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Really! Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda said still more softly: &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t judge him by the other night;
      he wasn&rsquo;t very nice then, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinct warned her that he agreed, and she said rather sadly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, we&rsquo;re both awfully young. It must be splendid to have
      experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over John&rsquo;s face, with its double line between the brows, its double line
      in the thin cheeks, its single firm line of mouth beneath a gray
      moustache, there passed a little grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to being young,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll change for the&mdash;er&mdash;better
      only too fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What was it in this girl that reminded him of that one with whom he had
      lived but two years, and mourned fifteen? Was it her youth? Was it that
      quick way of lifting her eyes, and looking at him with such clear
      directness? Or the way her hair grew? Or what?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like the people here, Uncle John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question caught John, as it were, between wind and water. Indeed, all
      her queries seemed to be trying to incite him to those wide efforts of
      mind which bring into use the philosophic nerve; and it was long since he
      had generalized afresh about either things or people, having fallen for
      many years past into the habit of reaching his opinions down out of some
      pigeonhole or other. To generalize was a youthful practice that one took
      off as one takes certain garments off babies when they come to years of
      discretion. But since he seemed to be in for it, he answered rather
      shortly: &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I. They make me ashamed of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John, whose dislike of the Bigwigs was that of the dogged worker of this
      life for the dogged talkers, wrinkled his brows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They make me feel as if I were part of something heavy sitting on
      something else, and all the time talking about how to make things lighter
      for the thing it&rsquo;s sitting on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A vague recollection of somebody&mdash;some writer, a dangerous one&mdash;having
      said something of this sort flitted through John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do YOU think England is done for, Uncle&mdash;I mean about &lsquo;the Land&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his conviction that &lsquo;the country was in a bad way,&rsquo; John was
      deeply, intimately shocked by that simple little question. Done for!
      Never! Whatever might be happening underneath, there must be no confession
      of that. No! the country would keep its form. The country would breathe
      through its nose, even if it did lose the race. It must never know, or let
      others know, even if it were beaten. And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth put that into your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that it seems funny, if we&rsquo;re getting richer and richer, and yet all
      the time farther and farther away from the life that every one agrees is
      the best for health and happiness. Father put it into my head, making me
      look at the little, towny people in Transham this afternoon. I know I mean
      to begin at once to learn about farm work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; This pretty young thing with the dark head and the pale, slim
      shoulders! Farm work! Women were certainly getting queer. In his
      department he had almost daily evidence of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought art was more in your line!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda looked up at him; and he was touched by that look, so straight and
      young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this. I don&rsquo;t believe Derek will be able to stay in England. When
      you feel very strongly about things it must be awfully difficult to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In bewilderment John answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! I should have said this was the country of all others for movements,
      and social work, and&mdash;and&mdash;cranks&mdash;&rdquo; he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but those are all for curing the skin, and I suppose we&rsquo;re really
      dying of heart disease, aren&rsquo;t we? Derek feels that, anyway, and, you see,
      he&rsquo;s not a bit wise, not even patient&mdash;so I expect he&rsquo;ll have to go.
      I mean to be ready, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Nedda got up. &ldquo;Only, if he does something rash, don&rsquo;t let them hurt
      him, Uncle John, if you can help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John felt her soft fingers squeezing his almost desperately, as if her
      emotions had for the moment got out of hand. And he was moved, though he
      knew that the squeeze expressed feeling for his nephew, not for himself.
      When she slid away out of the big room all friendliness seemed to go out
      with her, and very soon after he himself slipped away to the smoking-room.
      There he was alone, and, lighting a cigar, because he still had on his
      long-tailed coat which did not go with that pipe he would so much have
      preferred, he stepped out of the French window into the warm, dark night.
      He walked slowly in his evening pumps up a thin path between columbines
      and peonies, late tulips, forget-me-nots, and pansies peering up in the
      dark with queer, monkey faces. He had a love for flowers, rather starved
      for a long time past, and, strangely, liked to see them, not in the set
      and orderly masses that should seemingly have gone with his character, but
      in wilder beds, where one never knew what flower was coming next. Once or
      twice he stopped and bent down, ascertaining which kind it was, living its
      little life down there, then passed on in that mood of stammering thought
      which besets men of middle age who walk at night&mdash;a mood caught
      between memory of aspirations spun and over, and vision of aspirations
      that refuse to take shape. Why should they, any more&mdash;what was the
      use? And turning down another path he came on something rather taller than
      himself, that glowed in the darkness as though a great moon, or some white
      round body, had floated to within a few feet of the earth. Approaching, he
      saw it for what it was&mdash;a little magnolia-tree in the full of its
      white blossoms. Those clustering flower-stars, printed before him on the
      dark coat of the night, produced in John more feeling than should have
      been caused by a mere magnolia-tree; and he smoked somewhat furiously.
      Beauty, seeking whom it should upset, seemed, like a girl, to stretch out
      arms and say: &ldquo;I am here!&rdquo; And with a pang at heart, and a long ash on his
      cigar, between lips that quivered oddly, John turned on his heel and
      retraced his footsteps to the smoking-room. It was still deserted. Taking
      up a Review, he opened it at an article on &lsquo;the Land,&rsquo; and, fixing his
      eyes on the first page, did not read it, but thought: &lsquo;That child! What
      folly! Engaged! H&rsquo;m! To that young&mdash;! Why, they&rsquo;re babes! And what is
      it about her that reminds me&mdash;reminds me&mdash;What is it? Lucky
      devil, Felix&mdash;to have her for daughter! Engaged! The little thing&rsquo;s
      got her troubles before her. Wish I had! By George, yes&mdash;wish I had!&rsquo;
      And with careful fingers he brushed off the ash that had fallen on his
      lapel....
    </p>
    <p>
      The little thing who had her troubles before her, sitting in her bedroom
      window, had watched his white front and the glowing point of his cigar
      passing down there in the dark, and, though she did not know that they
      belonged to him, had thought: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s some one nice, anyway, who likes
      being out instead of in that stuffy drawing-room, playing bridge, and
      talking, talking.&rsquo; Then she felt ashamed of her uncharitableness. After
      all, it was wrong to think of them like that. They did it for rest after
      all their hard work; and she&mdash;she did not work at all! If only Aunt
      Kirsteen would let her stay at Joyfields, and teach her all that Sheila
      knew! And lighting her candles, she opened her diary to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;is like looking at the night. One never knows what&rsquo;s
      coming, only suspects, as in the darkness you suspect which trees are
      what, and try to see whether you are coming to the edge of anything.... A
      moth has just flown into my candle before I could stop it! Has it gone
      quite out of the world? If so, why should it be different for us? The same
      great Something makes all life and death, all light and dark, all love and
      hate&mdash;then why one fate for one living thing, and the opposite for
      another? But suppose there IS nothing after death&mdash;would it make me
      say: &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather not live&rsquo;? It would only make me delight more in life of
      every kind. Only human beings brood and are discontented, and trouble
      about future life. While Derek and I were sitting in that field this
      morning, a bumblebee flew to the bank and tucked its head into the grass
      and went to sleep, just tired out with flying and working at its flowers;
      it simply snoozed its head down and went off. We ought to live every
      minute to the utmost, and when we&rsquo;re tired out, tuck in our heads and
      sleep.... If only Derek is not brooding over that poor man! Poor man&mdash;all
      alone in the dark, with months of misery before him! Poor soul! Oh! I am
      sorry for all the unhappiness of people! I can&rsquo;t bear to think of it. I
      simply can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And dropping her pen, Nedda went again to her window and
      leaned out. So sweet the air smelled that it made her ache with delight to
      breathe it in. Each leaf that lived out there, each flower, each blade of
      grass, were sworn to conspiracy of perfume. And she thought: &lsquo;They MUST
      all love each other; it all goes together so beautifully!&rsquo; Then, mingled
      with the incense of the night, she caught the savor of woodsmoke. It
      seemed to make the whole scent even more delicious, but she thought,
      bewildered: &lsquo;Smoke! Cruel fire&mdash;burning the wood that once grew
      leaves like those. Oh! it IS so mixed!&rsquo; It was a thought others have had
      before her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      To see for himself how it fared with the big laborer at the hands of
      Preliminary Justice, Felix went into Transham with Stanley the following
      morning. John having departed early for town, the brothers had not further
      exchanged sentiments on the subject of what Stanley called &lsquo;the kick-up at
      Joyfields.&rsquo; And just as night will sometimes disperse the brooding moods
      of nature, so it had brought to all three the feeling: &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t we made
      too much of this? Haven&rsquo;t we been a little extravagant, and aren&rsquo;t we
      rather bored with the whole subject?&rsquo; Arson was arson; a man in prison
      more or less was a man in prison more or less! This was especially
      Stanley&rsquo;s view, and he took the opportunity to say to Felix: &ldquo;Look here,
      old man, the thing is, of course, to see it in proportion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with this intention, therefore, that Felix entered the building
      where the justice of that neighborhood was customarily dispensed. It was a
      species of small hall, somewhat resembling a chapel, with distempered
      walls, a platform, and benches for the public, rather well filled that
      morning&mdash;testimony to the stir the little affair had made. Felix,
      familiar with the appearance of London police courts, noted the efforts
      that had been made to create resemblance to those models of
      administration. The justices of the peace, hastily convoked and four in
      number, sat on the platform, with a semicircular backing of high gray
      screens and a green baize barrier in front of them, so that their legs and
      feet were quite invisible. In this way had been preserved the really
      essential feature of all human justice&mdash;at whose feet it is well
      known one must not look! Their faces, on the contrary, were entirely
      exposed to view, and presented that pleasing variety of type and unanimity
      of expression peculiar to men keeping an open mind. Below them, with his
      face toward the public, was placed a gray-bearded man at a table also
      covered with green baize, that emblem of authority. And to the side, at
      right angles, raised into the air, sat a little terrier of a man, with
      gingery, wired hair, obviously the more articulate soul of these
      proceedings. As Felix sat down to worship, he noticed Mr. Pogram at the
      green baize table, and received from the little man a nod and the faintest
      whiff of lavender and gutta-percha. The next moment he caught sight of
      Derek and Sheila, screwed sideways against one of the distempered walls,
      looking, with their frowning faces, for all the world like two young
      devils just turned out of hell. They did not greet him, and Felix set to
      work to study the visages of Justice. They impressed him, on the whole,
      more favorably than he had expected. The one to his extreme left, with a
      gray-whiskered face, was like a large and sleepy cat of mature age, who
      moved not, except to write a word now and then on the paper before him, or
      to hand back a document. Next to him, a man of middle age with bald
      forehead and dark, intelligent eyes seemed conscious now and again of the
      body of the court, and Felix thought: &lsquo;You have not been a magistrate
      long.&rsquo; The chairman, who sat next, with the moustache of a heavy dragoon
      and gray hair parted in the middle, seemed, on the other hand, oblivious
      of the public, never once looking at them, and speaking so that they could
      not hear him, and Felix thought: &lsquo;You have been a magistrate too long.&rsquo;
      Between him and the terrier man, the last of the four wrote diligently,
      below a clean, red face with clipped white moustache and little peaked
      beard. And Felix thought: &lsquo;Retired naval!&rsquo; Then he saw that they were
      bringing in Tryst. The big laborer advanced between two constables, his
      broad, unshaven face held high, and his lowering eyes, through which his
      strange and tragical soul seemed looking, turned this way and that. Felix,
      who, no more than any one else, could keep his gaze off the trapped
      creature, felt again all the sensations of the previous afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guilty? or, Not guilty?&rdquo; As if repeating something learned by heart,
      Tryst answered: &ldquo;Not guilty, sir.&rdquo; And his big hands, at his sides, kept
      clenching and unclenching. The witnesses, four in number, began now to
      give their testimony. A sergeant of police recounted how he had been first
      summoned to the scene of burning, and afterward arrested Tryst; Sir
      Gerald&rsquo;s agent described the eviction and threats uttered by the evicted
      man; two persons, a stone-breaker and a tramp, narrated that they had seen
      him going in the direction of the rick and barn at five o&rsquo;clock, and
      coming away therefrom at five-fifteen. Punctuated by the barking of the
      terrier clerk, all this took time, during which there passed through Felix
      many thoughts. Here was a man who had done a wicked, because an
      antisocial, act; the sort of act no sane person could defend; an act so
      barbarous, stupid, and unnatural that the very beasts of the field would
      turn noses away from it! How was it, then, that he himself could not feel
      incensed? Was it that in habitually delving into the motives of men&rsquo;s
      actions he had lost the power of dissociating what a man did from what he
      was; had come to see him, with his thoughts, deeds, and omissions, as a
      coherent growth? And he looked at Tryst. The big laborer was staring with
      all his soul at Derek. And, suddenly, he saw his nephew stand up&mdash;tilt
      his dark head back against the wall&mdash;and open his mouth to speak. In
      sheer alarm Felix touched Mr. Pogram on the arm. The little square man had
      already turned; he looked at that moment extremely like a frog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I wish to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you? Sit down!&rdquo; It was the chairman, speaking for the first time
      in a voice that could be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to say that he is not responsible. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! Silence, sir! Sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix saw his nephew waver, and Sheila pulling at his sleeve; then, to his
      infinite relief, the boy sat down. His sallow face was red; his thin lips
      compressed to a white line. And slowly under the eyes of the whole court
      he grew deadly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distracted by fear that the boy might make another scene, Felix followed
      the proceedings vaguely. They were over soon enough: Tryst committed,
      defence reserved, bail refused&mdash;all as Mr. Pogram had predicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Derek and Sheila had vanished, and in the street outside, idle at this
      hour of a working-day, were only the cars of the four magistrates; two or
      three little knots of those who had been in court, talking of the case;
      and in the very centre of the street, an old, dark-whiskered man, lame,
      and leaning on a stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very nearly being awkward,&rdquo; said the voice of Mr. Pogram in his ear. &ldquo;I
      say, do you think&mdash;no hand himself, surely no real hand himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix shook his head violently. If the thought had once or twice occurred
      to him, he repudiated it with all his force when shaped by another&rsquo;s mouth&mdash;and
      such a mouth, so wide and rubbery!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Strange boy! Extravagant sense of honour&mdash;too sensitive,
      that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Pogram soothingly. &ldquo;These young people! We live
      in a queer age, Mr. Freeland. All sorts of ideas about, nowadays. Young
      men like that&mdash;better in the army&mdash;safe in the army. No ideas
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happens now?&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Mr. Pogram. &ldquo;Nothing else for it&mdash;wait. Three months&mdash;twiddle
      his thumbs. Bad system! Rotten!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose in the end he&rsquo;s proved innocent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pogram shook his little round head, whose ears were very red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Often say to my wife: &lsquo;Wish I weren&rsquo;t a humanitarian!&rsquo;
      Heart of india-rubber&mdash;excellent thing&mdash;the greatest blessing.
      Well, good-morning! Anything you want to say at any time, let me know!&rdquo;
       And exhaling an overpowering whiff of gutta-percha, he grasped Felix&rsquo;s
      hand and passed into a house on the door of which was printed in brazen
      letters: &ldquo;Edward Pogram, James Collet. Solicitors. Agents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the little humanitarian, Felix drifted back toward the court.
      The cars were gone, the groups dispersed; alone, leaning on his stick, the
      old, dark-whiskered man stood like a jackdaw with a broken wing. Yearning,
      at that moment, for human intercourse, Felix went up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine day,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, &lsquo;tis fine enough.&rdquo; And they stood silent, side by side. The
      gulf fixed by class and habit between soul and human soul yawned before
      Felix as it had never before. Stirred and troubled, he longed to open his
      heart to this old, ragged, dark-eyed, whiskered creature with the game
      leg, who looked as if he had passed through all the thorns and thickets of
      hard and primitive existence; he longed that the old fellow should lay
      bare to him his heart. And for the life of him he could not think of any
      mortal words which might bridge the unreal gulf between them. At last he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a native here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. From over Malvern way. Livin&rsquo; here with my darter, owin&rsquo; to my
      leg. Her &lsquo;usband works in this here factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m from London,&rdquo; Felix said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thart you were. Fine place, London, they say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix shook his head. &ldquo;Not so fine as this Worcestershire of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man turned his quick, dark gaze. &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;people&rsquo;ll be a
      bit nervy-like in towns, nowadays. The country be a good place for a
      healthy man, too; I don&rsquo;t want no better place than the country&mdash;never
      could abide bein&rsquo; shut in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t so very many like you, judging by the towns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man smiled&mdash;that smile was the reverse of a bitter tonic
      coated with sweet stuff to make it palatable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tes the want of a life takes &lsquo;em,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a many like me.
      There&rsquo;s not so many as can&rsquo;t do without the smell of the earth. With these
      &lsquo;ere newspapers&mdash;&lsquo;tesn&rsquo;t taught nowadays. The boys and gells they
      goes to school, and &lsquo;tes all in favor of the towns there. I can&rsquo;t work no
      more; I&rsquo;m &lsquo;s good as gone meself; but I feel sometimes I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave to go
      back. I don&rsquo;t like the streets, an&rsquo; I guess &lsquo;tes worse in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Perhaps,&rdquo; Felix said, &ldquo;there are more of us like you than you think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the old man turned his dark, quick glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, an&rsquo; I widden say no to that, neither. I&rsquo;ve seen &lsquo;em terrible
      homesick. &lsquo;Tes certain sure there&rsquo;s lots would never go, ef &lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t so
      mortial hard on the land. &lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t a bare livin&rsquo;, after that. An&rsquo; they&rsquo;re
      put upon, right and left they&rsquo;re put upon. &lsquo;Tes only a man here and there
      that &lsquo;as something in &lsquo;im too strong. I widden never &lsquo;ave stayed in the
      country ef &lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t that I couldn&rsquo;t stand the town life. &lsquo;Tes like some
      breeds o&rsquo; cattle&mdash;you take an&rsquo; put &lsquo;em out o&rsquo; their own country, an&rsquo;
      you &lsquo;ave to take an&rsquo; put &lsquo;em back again. Only some breeds, though. Others
      they don&rsquo; mind where they go. Well, I&rsquo;ve seen the country pass in my time,
      as you might say; where you used to see three men you only see one now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they ever going back onto the land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tark about it. I read my newspaper reg&rsquo;lar. In some places I see
      they&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; unions. That an&rsquo;t no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! Think of it! The land&rsquo;s different to anythin&rsquo; else&mdash;that&rsquo;s why!
      Different work, different hours, four men&rsquo;s work to-day and one&rsquo;s
      to-morrow. Work land wi&rsquo; unions, same as they&rsquo;ve got in this &lsquo;ere factory,
      wi&rsquo; their eight hours an&rsquo; their do this an&rsquo; don&rsquo; do that? No! You&rsquo;ve got
      no weather in factories, an&rsquo; such-like. On the land &lsquo;tes a matter o&rsquo;
      weather. On the land a man must be ready for anythin&rsquo; at any time; you
      can&rsquo;t work it no other way. &lsquo;Tes along o&rsquo; God&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; into it; an&rsquo; no use
      pullin&rsquo; this way an&rsquo; that. Union says to me: You mustn&rsquo;t work after hours.
      Hoh! I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad to set up all night wi&rsquo; ship an&rsquo; cattle hundreds o&rsquo; times,
      an&rsquo; no extra for it. &lsquo;Tes not that way they&rsquo;ll do any good to keep people
      on the land. Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll want new laws, o&rsquo; course, to prevent farmers an&rsquo; landowners
      takin&rsquo; their advantage; you want laws to build new cottages; but mainly
      &lsquo;tes a case of hands together; can&rsquo;t be no other&mdash;the land&rsquo;s so
      ticklish. If &lsquo;tesn&rsquo;t hands together, &lsquo;tes nothing. I &lsquo;ad a master once
      that was never content so long&rsquo;s we wasn&rsquo;t content. That farm was better
      worked than any in the parish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the difficulty is to get masters that can see the other side; a
      man doesn&rsquo;t care much to look at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s dark eyes twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; an&rsquo; when &lsquo;e does, &lsquo;tes generally to say: &lsquo;Lord, an&rsquo;t I right, an&rsquo;
      an&rsquo;t they wrong, just?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s powerful customary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Felix; &ldquo;God bless us all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You may well say that, sir; an&rsquo; we want it, too. A bit more wages
      wouldn&rsquo;t come amiss, neither. An&rsquo; a bit more freedom; &lsquo;tes a man&rsquo;s liberty
      &lsquo;e prizes as well as money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear about this arson case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man cast a glance this way and that before he answered in a lower
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say &lsquo;e was put out of his cottage. I&rsquo;ve seen men put out for votin&rsquo;
      Liberal; I&rsquo;ve seen &lsquo;em put out for free-thinkin&rsquo;; all sorts o&rsquo; things I
      seen em put out for. &lsquo;Tes that makes the bad blood. A man wants to call
      &lsquo;is soul &lsquo;is own, when all&rsquo;s said an&rsquo; done. An&rsquo; &lsquo;e can&rsquo;t, not in th&rsquo; old
      country, unless &lsquo;e&rsquo;s got the dibs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you never thought of emigrating?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thart of it&mdash;ah! thart of it hundreds o&rsquo; times; but some&rsquo;ow cudden
      never bring mysel&rsquo; to the scratch o&rsquo; not seein&rsquo; th&rsquo; Beacon any more. I can
      just see it from &lsquo;ere, you know. But there&rsquo;s not so many like me, an&rsquo;
      gettin&rsquo; fewer every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Felix, &ldquo;that I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tes a &lsquo;and-made piece o&rsquo; goods&mdash;the land! You has to be fond of it,
      same as of your missis and yer chillen. These poor pitiful fellows that&rsquo;s
      workin&rsquo; in this factory, makin&rsquo; these here Colonial ploughs&mdash;union&rsquo;s
      all right for them&mdash;&lsquo;tes all mechanical; but a man on the land, &lsquo;e&rsquo;s
      got to put the land first, whether &lsquo;tes his own or some one else&rsquo;s, or
      he&rsquo;ll never do no good; might as well go for a postman, any day. I&rsquo;m
      keepin&rsquo; of you, though, with my tattle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth, Felix had looked at the old man, for the accursed question had
      begun to worry him: Ought he or not to give the lame old fellow something?
      Would it hurt his feelings? Why could he not say simply: &lsquo;Friend, I&rsquo;m
      better off than you; help me not to feel so unfairly favored&rsquo;? Perhaps he
      might risk it. And, diving into his trousers pockets, he watched the old
      man&rsquo;s eyes. If they followed his hand, he would risk it. But they did not.
      Withdrawing his hand, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a cigar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old fellow&rsquo;s dark face twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo; know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as I ever smoked one; but I can have a darned old
      try!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the lot,&rdquo; said Felix, and shuffled into the other&rsquo;s pocket the
      contents of his cigar-case. &ldquo;If you get through one, you&rsquo;ll want the rest.
      They&rsquo;re pretty good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Shuldn&rsquo; wonder, neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by. I hope your leg will soon be better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank &lsquo;ee, sir. Good-by, thank &lsquo;ee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking back from the turning, Felix saw him still standing there in the
      middle of the empty street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having undertaken to meet his mother, who was returning this afternoon to
      Becket, he had still two hours to put away, and passing Mr. Pogram&rsquo;s
      house, he turned into a path across a clover-field and sat down on a
      stile. He had many thoughts, sitting at the foot of this little town&mdash;which
      his great-grandfather had brought about. And chiefly he thought of the old
      man he had been talking to, sent there, as it seemed to him, by
      Providence, to afford a prototype for his &lsquo;The Last of the Laborers.&rsquo;
      Wonderful that the old fellow should talk of loving &lsquo;the Land,&rsquo; whereon he
      must have toiled for sixty years or so, at a number of shillings per week,
      that would certainly not buy the cigars he had shovelled into that ragged
      pocket. Wonderful! And yet, a marvellous sweet thing, when all was said&mdash;this
      land! Changing its sheen and texture, the feel of its air, its very scent,
      from day to day. This land with myriad offspring of flowers and flying
      folk; the majestic and untiring march of seasons: Spring and its wistful
      ecstasy of saplings, and its yearning, wild, wind-loosened heart; gleam
      and song, blossom and cloud, and the swift white rain; each upturned leaf
      so little and so glad to flutter; each wood and field so full of peeping
      things! Summer! Ah! Summer, when on the solemn old trees the long days
      shone and lingered, and the glory of the meadows and the murmur of life
      and the scent of flowers bewildered tranquillity, till surcharge of warmth
      and beauty brooded into dark passion, and broke! And Autumn, in mellow
      haze down on the fields and woods; smears of gold already on the beeches,
      smears of crimson on the rowans, the apple-trees still burdened, and a
      flax-blue sky well-nigh merging with the misty air; the cattle browsing in
      the lingering golden stillness; not a breath to fan the blue smoke of the
      weed-fires&mdash;and in the fields no one moving&mdash;who would disturb
      such mellow peace? And Winter! The long spaces, the long dark; and yet&mdash;and
      yet, what delicate loveliness of twig tracery; what blur of rose and brown
      and purple caught in the bare boughs and in the early sunset sky! What
      sharp dark flights of birds in the gray-white firmament! Who cared what
      season held in its arms this land that had bred them all!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not wonderful that into the veins of those who nursed it, tending,
      watching its perpetual fertility, should be distilled a love so deep and
      subtle that they could not bear to leave it, to abandon its hills, and
      greenness, and bird-songs, and all the impress of their forefathers
      throughout the ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like so many of his fellows&mdash;cultured moderns, alien to the larger
      forms of patriotism, that rich liquor brewed of maps and figures,
      commercial profit, and high-cockalorum, which served so perfectly to swell
      smaller heads&mdash;Felix had a love of his native land resembling love
      for a woman, a kind of sensuous chivalry, a passion based on her charm, on
      her tranquillity, on the power she had to draw him into her embrace, to
      make him feel that he had come from her, from her alone, and into her
      alone was going back. And this green parcel of his native land, from which
      the half of his blood came, and that the dearest half, had a potency over
      his spirit that he might well be ashamed of in days when the true Briton
      was a town-bred creature with a foot of fancy in all four corners of the
      globe. There was ever to him a special flavor about the elm-girt fields,
      the flowery coppices, of this country of the old Moretons, a special
      fascination in its full, white-clouded skies, its grass-edged roads, its
      pied and creamy cattle, and the blue-green loom of the Malvern hills. If
      God walked anywhere for him, it was surely here. Sentiment! Without
      sentiment, without that love, each for his own corner, &lsquo;the Land&rsquo; was lost
      indeed! Not if all Becket blew trumpets till kingdom came, would &lsquo;the
      Land&rsquo; be reformed, if they lost sight of that! To fortify men in love for
      their motherland, to see that insecurity, grinding poverty, interference,
      petty tyranny, could no longer undermine that love&mdash;this was to be,
      surely must be, done! Monotony? Was that cry true? What work now performed
      by humble men was less monotonous than work on the land? What work was
      even a tenth part so varied? Never quite the same from day to day: Now
      weeding, now hay, now roots, now hedging; now corn, with sowing, reaping,
      threshing, stacking, thatching; the care of beasts, and their
      companionship; sheep-dipping, shearing, wood-gathering, apple-picking,
      cider-making; fashioning and tarring gates; whitewashing walls; carting;
      trenching&mdash;never, never two days quite the same! Monotony! The poor
      devils in factories, in shops, in mines; poor devils driving &lsquo;busses,
      punching tickets, cleaning roads; baking; cooking; sewing; typing!
      Stokers; machine-tenders; brick-layers; dockers; clerks! Ah! that great
      company from towns might well cry out: Monotony! True, they got their
      holidays; true, they had more social life&mdash;a point that might well be
      raised at Becket: Holidays and social life for men on the soil! But&mdash;and
      suddenly Felix thought of the long, long holiday that was before the
      laborer Tryst. &lsquo;Twiddle his thumbs&rsquo;&mdash;in the words of the little
      humanitarian&mdash;twiddle his thumbs in a space twelve feet by seven! No
      sky to see, no grass to smell, no beast to bear him company; no anything&mdash;for,
      what resources in himself had this poor creature? No anything, but to sit
      with tragic eyes fixed on the wall before him for eighty days and eighty
      nights, before they tried him. And then&mdash;not till then&mdash;would
      his punishment for that moment&rsquo;s blind revenge for grievous wrong begin!
      What on this earth of God&rsquo;s was more disproportioned, and wickedly
      extravagant, more crassly stupid, than the arrangements of his most
      perfect creature, man? What a devil was man, who could yet rise to such
      sublime heights of love and heroism! What a ferocious brute, the most
      ferocious and cold-blooded brute that lived! Of all creatures most to be
      stampeded by fear into a callous torturer! &lsquo;Fear&rsquo;&mdash;thought Felix&mdash;&lsquo;fear!
      Not momentary panic, such as makes our brother animals do foolish things;
      conscious, calculating fear, paralyzing the reason of our minds and the
      generosity of our hearts. A detestable thing Tryst has done, a hateful
      act; but his punishment will be twentyfold as hateful!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, unable to sit and think of it, Felix rose and walked on through the
      fields....

      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      He was duly at Transham station in time for the London train, and, after a
      minute consecrated to looking in the wrong direction, he saw his mother
      already on the platform with her bag, an air-cushion, and a beautifully
      neat roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Travelling third!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;Why will she do these things?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Slightly flushed, she kissed Felix with an air of abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good of you to meet me, darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix pointed in silence to the crowded carriage from which she had
      emerged. Frances Freeland looked a little rueful. &ldquo;It would have been
      delightful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There was a dear baby there and, of course, I
      couldn&rsquo;t have the window down, so it WAS rather hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix, who could just see the dear baby, said dryly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how you go about, is it? Have you had any lunch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland put her hand under his arm. &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t fuss, darling!
      Here&rsquo;s sixpence for the porter. There&rsquo;s only one trunk&mdash;it&rsquo;s got a
      violet label. Do you know them? They&rsquo;re so useful. You see them at once. I
      must get you some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me take those things. You won&rsquo;t want this cushion. I&rsquo;ll let the air
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you won&rsquo;t be able, dear. It&rsquo;s quite the best screw I&rsquo;ve ever
      come across&mdash;a splendid thing; I can&rsquo;t get it undone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;And now we may as well go out to the car!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of a slight stoppage in his mother&rsquo;s footsteps and rather
      a convulsive squeeze of her hand on his arm. Looking at her face, he
      discovered it occupied with a process whose secret he could not penetrate,
      a kind of disarray of her features, rapidly and severely checked, and
      capped with a resolute smile. They had already reached the station exit,
      where Stanley&rsquo;s car was snorting. Frances Freeland looked at it, then,
      mounting rather hastily, sat, compressing her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were off, Felix said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to stop at the church and have a look at the brasses to
      your grandfather and the rest of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother, who had slipped her hand under his arm again, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear; I&rsquo;ve seen them. The church is not at all beautiful. I like the
      old church at Becket so much better; it is such a pity your
      great-grandfather was not buried there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had never quite got over the lack of &lsquo;niceness&rsquo; about those ploughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going, as was the habit of Stanley&rsquo;s car, at considerable speed, Felix was
      not at first certain whether the peculiar little squeezes his arm was
      getting were due to the bounds of the creature under them or to some cause
      more closely connected with his mother, and it was not till they shaved a
      cart at the turning of the Becket drive that it suddenly dawned on him
      that she was in terror. He discovered it in looking round just as she drew
      her smile over a spasm of her face and throat. And, leaning out of the
      car, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive very slowly, Batter; I want to look at the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little sigh rewarded him. Since SHE had said nothing, He said nothing,
      and Clara&rsquo;s words in the hall seemed to him singularly tactless:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I meant to have reminded you, Felix, to send the car back and take a
      fly. I thought you knew that Mother&rsquo;s terrified of motors.&rdquo; And at his
      mother&rsquo;s answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no; I quite enjoyed it, dear,&rdquo; he thought: &lsquo;Bless her heart! She IS a
      stoic!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or no to tell her of the &lsquo;kick-up at Joyfields&rsquo; exercised his
      mind. The question was intricate, for she had not yet been informed that
      Nedda and Derek were engaged, and Felix did not feel at liberty to
      forestall the young people. That was their business. On the other hand,
      she would certainly glean from Clara a garbled understanding of the recent
      events at Joyfields, if she were not first told of them by himself. And he
      decided to tell her, with the natural trepidation of one who, living among
      principles and theories, never quite knew what those, for whom each fact
      is unrelated to anything else under the moon, were going to think. Frances
      Freeland, he knew well, kept facts and theories especially unrelated, or,
      rather, modified her facts to suit her theories, instead of, like Felix,
      her theories to suit her facts. For example, her instinctive admiration
      for Church and State, her instinctive theory that they rested on gentility
      and people who were nice, was never for a moment shaken when she saw a
      half-starved baby of the slums. Her heart would impel her to pity and feed
      the poor little baby if she could, but to correlate the creature with
      millions of other such babies, and those millions with the Church and
      State, would not occur to her. And if Felix made an attempt to correlate
      them for her she would look at him and think: &lsquo;Dear boy! How good he is! I
      do wish he wouldn&rsquo;t let that line come in his forehead; it does so spoil
      it!&rsquo; And she would say: &ldquo;Yes, darling, I know, it&rsquo;s very sad; only I&rsquo;m NOT
      clever.&rdquo; And, if a Liberal government chanced to be in power, would add:
      &ldquo;Of course, I do think this Government is dreadful. I MUST show you a
      sermon of the dear Bishop of Walham. I cut it out of the &lsquo;Daily Mystery.&rsquo;
      He puts things so well&mdash;he always has such nice ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Felix, getting up, would walk a little and sit down again too
      suddenly. Then, as if entreating him to look over her want of
      &lsquo;cleverness,&rsquo; she would put out a hand that, for all its whiteness, had
      never been idle and smooth his forehead. It had sometimes touched him
      horribly to see with what despair she made attempts to follow him in his
      correlating efforts, and with what relief she heard him cease enough to
      let her say: &ldquo;Yes, dear; only, I must show you this new kind of expanding
      cork. It&rsquo;s simply splendid. It bottles up everything!&rdquo; And after staring
      at her just a moment he would acquit her of irony. Very often after these
      occasions he had thought, and sometimes said: &ldquo;Mother, you&rsquo;re the best
      Conservative I ever met.&rdquo; She would glance at him then, with a special
      loving doubtfulness, at a loss as to whether or no he had designed to
      compliment her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had given her half an hour to rest he made his way to the blue
      corridor, where a certain room was always kept for her, who never occupied
      it long enough at a time to get tired of it. She was lying on a sofa in a
      loose gray cashmere gown. The windows were open, and the light breeze just
      moved in the folds of the chintz curtains and stirred perfume from a bowl
      of pinks&mdash;her favorite flowers. There was no bed in this bedroom,
      which in all respects differed from any other in Clara&rsquo;s house, as though
      the spirit of another age and temper had marched in and dispossessed the
      owner. Felix had a sensation that one was by no means all body here. On
      the contrary. There was not a trace of the body anywhere; as if some one
      had decided that the body was not quite nice. No bed, no wash-stand, no
      chest of drawers, no wardrobe, no mirror, not even a jar of Clara&rsquo;s
      special pot-pourri. And Felix said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be your bedroom, Mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland answered, with a touch of deprecating quizzicality:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, darling. I must show you my arrangements.&rdquo; And she rose. &ldquo;This,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;you see, goes under there, and that under here; and that again
      goes under this. Then they all go under that, and then I pull this. It&rsquo;s
      lovely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but don&rsquo;t you see? It&rsquo;s so nice; nobody can tell. And it doesn&rsquo;t give
      any trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you go to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I just pop my clothes into this and open that. And there I am. It&rsquo;s
      simply splendid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;Do you think I might sit down, or shall I go
      through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland loved him with her eyes, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naughty boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Felix sat down on what appeared to be a window-seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, with slight uneasiness, for she was hovering, &ldquo;I think
      you&rsquo;re wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland put away an impeachment that she evidently felt to be too
      soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but it&rsquo;s all so simple, darling.&rdquo; And Felix saw that she had
      something in her hand, and mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my little electric brush. It&rsquo;ll do wonders with your hair. While
      you sit there, I&rsquo;ll just try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A clicking and a whirring had begun to occur close to his ear, and
      something darted like a gadfly at his scalp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to tell you something serious, Mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, darling; it&rsquo;ll be simply lovely to hear it; and you mustn&rsquo;t mind
      this, because it really is a first-rate thing&mdash;quite new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, how is it, thought Felix, that any one who loves the new as she does,
      when it&rsquo;s made of matter, will not even look at it when it&rsquo;s made of mind?
      And, while the little machine buzzed about his head, he proceeded to
      detail to her the facts of the state of things that existed at Joyfields.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, darling, bend down a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix bent down. And the little machine began severely tweaking the hairs
      on the nape of his neck. He sat up again rather suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland was contemplating the little machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very provoking! It&rsquo;s never done that before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; Felix murmured. &ldquo;But about Joyfields?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, it IS such a pity they don&rsquo;t get on with those Mallorings! I
      do think it sad they weren&rsquo;t brought up to go to church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix stared, not knowing whether to be glad or sorry that his recital had
      not roused within her the faintest suspicion of disaster. How he envied
      her that single-minded power of not seeing further than was absolutely
      needful! And suddenly he thought: &lsquo;She really is wonderful! With her love
      of church, how it must hurt her that we none of us go, not even John! And
      yet she never says a word. There really is width about her; a power of
      accepting the inevitable. Never was woman more determined to make the best
      of a bad job. It&rsquo;s a great quality!&rsquo; And he heard her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, darling, if I give you this, you must promise me to use it every
      morning. You&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;ll soon have a splendid crop of little young
      hairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said gloomily; &ldquo;but they won&rsquo;t come to anything. Age has got
      my head, Mother, just as it&rsquo;s got &lsquo;the Land&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense! You must go on with it, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix turned so that he could look at her. She was moving round the room
      now, meticulously adjusting the framed photographs of her family that were
      the only decoration of the walls. How formal, chiselled, and delicate her
      face, yet how almost fanatically decisive! How frail and light her figure,
      yet how indomitably active! And the memory assailed him of how, four years
      ago, she had defeated double pneumonia without having a doctor, simply by
      lying on her back. &lsquo;She leaves trouble,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;until it&rsquo;s under her
      nose, then simply tells it that it isn&rsquo;t there. There&rsquo;s something very
      English about that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was chasing a bluebottle now with a little fan made of wire, and,
      coming close to Felix, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen these, darling? You&rsquo;ve only to hit the fly and it kills him
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you ever hit the fly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; And she waved the fan at the bluebottle, which avoided it
      without seeming difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear hurting them, but I DON&rsquo;T like flies. There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bluebottle flew out of the window behind Felix and in at the one that
      was not behind him. He rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to rest before tea, Mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt her searching him with her eyes, as if trying desperately to find
      something she might bestow upon or do for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like this wire&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a feeling that he was defrauding love, he turned and fled. She would
      never rest while he was there! And yet there was that in her face which
      made him feel a brute to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing out of the house, sunk in its Monday hush, no vestige of a Bigwig
      left, Felix came to that new-walled mound where the old house of the
      Moretons had been burned &lsquo;by soldiers from Tewkesbury and Gloucester,&rsquo; as
      said the old chronicles dear to the heart of Clara. And on the wall he sat
      him down. Above, in the uncut grass, he could see the burning blue of a
      peacock&rsquo;s breast, where the heraldic bird stood digesting grain in the
      repose of perfect breeding, and below him gardeners were busy with the
      gooseberries. &lsquo;Gardeners and the gooseberries of the great!&rsquo; he thought.
      &lsquo;Such is the future of our Land.&rsquo; And he watched them. How methodically
      they went to work! How patient and well-done-for they looked! After all,
      was it not the ideal future? Gardeners, gooseberries, and the great! Each
      of the three content in that station of life into which&mdash;! What more
      could a country want? Gardeners, gooseberries, and the great! The phrase
      had a certain hypnotic value. Why trouble? Why fuss? Gardeners,
      gooseberries, and the great! A perfect land! A land dedicate to the
      week-end! Gardeners, goose&mdash;! And suddenly he saw that he was not
      alone. Half hidden by the angle of the wall, on a stone of the
      foundations, carefully preserved and nearly embedded in the nettles which
      Clara had allowed to grow because they added age to the appearance, was
      sitting a Bigwig. One of the Settleham faction, he had impressed Felix
      alike by his reticence, the steady sincerity of his gray eyes, a
      countenance that, beneath a simple and delicate urbanity, had still in it
      something of the best type of schoolboy. &lsquo;How comes he to have stayed?&rsquo; he
      mused. &lsquo;I thought they always fed and scattered!&rsquo; And having received an
      answer to his salutation, he moved across and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagined you&rsquo;d gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been having a look round. It&rsquo;s very jolly here. My affections are in
      the North, but I suppose this is pretty well the heart of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near &lsquo;the big song,&rsquo;&rdquo; Felix answered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll never be anything more
      English than Shakespeare, when all&rsquo;s said and done.&rdquo; And he took a steady,
      sidelong squint at his companion. &lsquo;This is another of the types I&rsquo;ve been
      looking for,&rsquo; he reflected. The peculiar &lsquo;don&rsquo;t-quite-touch-me&rsquo; accent of
      the aristocrat&mdash;and of those who would be&mdash;had almost left this
      particular one, as though he secretly aspired to rise superior and only
      employed it in the nervousness of his first greetings. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; thought
      Felix, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s just about the very best we can do among those who sit upon
      &lsquo;the Land.&rsquo; I would wager there&rsquo;s not a better landlord nor a better
      fellow in all his class, than this one. He&rsquo;s chalks away superior to
      Malloring, if I know anything of faces&mdash;would never have turned poor
      Tryst out. If this exception were the rule! And yet&mdash;! Does he, can
      he, go quite far enough to meet the case? If not&mdash;what hope of
      regeneration from above? Would he give up his shooting? Could he give up
      feeling he&rsquo;s a leader? Would he give up his town house and collecting
      whatever it is he collects? Could he let himself sink down and merge till
      he was just unseen leaven of good-fellowship and good-will, working in the
      common bread?&rsquo; And squinting at that sincere, clean, charming, almost fine
      face, he answered himself unwillingly: &lsquo;He could not!&rsquo; And suddenly he
      knew that he was face to face with the tremendous question which soon or
      late confronts all thinkers. Sitting beside him&mdash;was the highest
      product of the present system! With its charm, humanity, courage, chivalry
      up to a point, its culture, and its cleanliness, this decidedly rare
      flower at the end of a tall stalk, with dark and tortuous roots and rank
      foliage, was in a sense the sole justification of power wielded from
      above. And was it good enough? Was it quite good enough? Like so many
      other thinkers, Felix hesitated to reply. If only merit and the goods of
      this world could be finally divorced! If the reward of virtue were just
      men&rsquo;s love and an unconscious self-respect! If only &lsquo;to have nothing&rsquo; were
      the highest honour! And yet, to do away with this beside him and put in
      its place&mdash;What? No kiss-me-quick change had a chance of producing
      anything better. To scrap the long growth of man and start afresh was but
      to say: &lsquo;Since in the past the best that man has done has not been good
      enough, I have a perfect faith in him for the future!&rsquo; No! That was a
      creed for archangels and other extremists. Safer to work on what we had!
      And he began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next door to this estate I&rsquo;m told there&rsquo;s ten thousand acres almost
      entirely grass and covert, owned by Lord Baltimore, who lives in Norfolk,
      London, Cannes, and anywhere else that the whim takes him. He comes down
      here twice a year to shoot. The case is extremely common. Surely it spells
      paralysis. If land is to be owned at all in such great lumps, owners ought
      at least to live on the lumps, and to pass very high examinations as
      practical farmers. They ought to be the life and soul, the radiating sun,
      of their little universes; or else they ought to be cleared out. How
      expect keen farming to start from such an example? It really looks to me
      as if the game laws would have to go.&rdquo; And he redoubled his scrutiny of
      the Bigwig&rsquo;s face. A little furrow in its brow had deepened visibly, but
      nodding, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The absentee landlord is a curse, of course. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m a bit of a
      one myself. And I&rsquo;m bound to say&mdash;though I&rsquo;m keen on shooting&mdash;if
      the game laws were abolished, it might do a lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU wouldn&rsquo;t move in that direction, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bigwig smiled&mdash;charming, rather whimsical, that smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honestly, I&rsquo;m not up to it. The spirit, you know, but the flesh&mdash;!
      My line is housing and wages, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There it is,&rsquo; thought Felix. &lsquo;Up to a point, they&rsquo;ll move&mdash;not up to
      THE point. It&rsquo;s all fiddling. One won&rsquo;t give up his shooting; another
      won&rsquo;t give up his power; a third won&rsquo;t give up her week-ends; a fourth
      won&rsquo;t give up his freedom. Our interest in the thing is all lackadaisical,
      a kind of bun-fight of pet notions. There&rsquo;s no real steam.&rsquo; And abruptly
      changing the subject, he talked of pictures to the pleasant Bigwig in the
      sleepy afternoon. Of how this man could paint, and that man couldn&rsquo;t. And
      in the uncut grass the peacock slowly moved, displaying his breast of
      burning blue; and below, the gardeners worked among the gooseberries.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nedda, borrowing the bicycle of Clara&rsquo;s maid, Sirrett, had been over to
      Joyfields, and only learned on her return of her grandmother&rsquo;s arrival. In
      her bath before dinner there came to her one of those strategic thoughts
      that even such as are no longer quite children will sometimes conceive.
      She hurried desperately into her clothes, and, ready full twenty minutes
      before the gong was due to sound, made her way to her grandmother&rsquo;s room.
      Frances Freeland had just pulled THIS, and, to her astonishment, THAT had
      not gone in properly. She was looking at it somewhat severely, when she
      heard Nedda&rsquo;s knock. Drawing a screen temporarily over the imperfection,
      she said: &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dear child looked charming in her white evening dress with one red
      flower in her hair; and while she kissed her, she noted that the neck of
      her dress was just a little too open to be quite nice, and at once
      thought: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got the very thing for that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Going to a drawer that no one could have suspected of being there, she
      took from it a little diamond star. Getting delicate but firm hold of the
      Mechlin at the top of the frock, she popped it in, so that the neck was
      covered at least an inch higher, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, ducky, you&rsquo;re to keep that as a little present. You&rsquo;ve no idea how
      perfectly it suits you just like this.&rdquo; And having satisfied for the
      moment her sense of niceness and that continual itch to part with
      everything she had, she surveyed her granddaughter, lighted up by that red
      flower, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How sweet you look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda, looking down past cheeks colored by pleasure at the new little star
      on a neck rather browned by her day in the sun, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Granny! it&rsquo;s much too lovely! You mustn&rsquo;t give it to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were moments that Frances Freeland loved best in life; and, with the
      untruthfulness in which she only indulged when she gave things away, or
      otherwise benefited her neighbors with or without their will, she added:
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite wasted; I never wear it myself.&rdquo; And, seeing Nedda&rsquo;s smile,
      for the girl recollected perfectly having admired it during dinner at
      Uncle John&rsquo;s, and at Becket itself, she said decisively, &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s that!&rdquo;
       and settled her down on the sofa. But just as she was thinking, &lsquo;I have
      the very thing for the dear child&rsquo;s sunburn,&rsquo; Nedda said: &ldquo;Granny, dear,
      I&rsquo;ve been meaning to tell you&mdash;Derek and I are engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the moment Frances Freeland could do nothing but tremulously interlace
      her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but, darling,&rdquo; she said very gravely, &ldquo;have you thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of nothing else, Granny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But has he thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland sat staring straight before her. Nedda and Derek, Derek
      and Nedda! The news was almost unintelligible; those two were still for
      her barely more than little creatures to be tucked up at night. Engaged!
      Marriage! Between those who were both as near to her, almost, as her own
      children had been! The effort was for the moment quite too much for her,
      and a sort of pain disturbed her heart. Then the crowning principle of her
      existence came a little to her aid. No use in making a fuss; must put the
      best face on it, whether it were going to come to anything or not! And she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, darling, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. I dare say it&rsquo;s very lovely for
      you. But do you think you&rsquo;ve seen enough of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda gave her a swift look, then dropped her lashes, so that her eyes
      seemed closed. Snuggling up, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Granny, I do wish I could see more; if only I could go and stay with
      them a little!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as she planted that dart of suggestion, the gong sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Frances Freeland, lying awake till two, as was her habit, the
      suggestion grew. To this growth not only her custom of putting the best
      face on things, but her incurable desire to make others happy, and an
      instinctive sympathy with love-affairs, all contributed; moreover, Felix
      had said something about Derek&rsquo;s having been concerned in something rash.
      If darling Nedda were there it would occupy his mind and help to make him
      careful. Never dilatory in forming resolutions, she decided to take the
      girl over with her on the morrow. Kirsteen had a dear little spare room,
      and Nedda should take her bag. It would be a nice surprise for them all.
      Accordingly, next morning, not wanting to give any trouble, she sent
      Thomas down to the Red Lion, where they had a comfortable fly, with a very
      steady, respectable driver, and ordered it to come at half past two. Then,
      without saying anything to Clara, she told Nedda to be ready to pop in her
      bag, trusting to her powers of explaining everything to everybody without
      letting anybody know anything. Little difficulties of this sort never
      bunkered her; she was essentially a woman of action. And on the drive to
      Joyfields she stilled the girl&rsquo;s quavering with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, darling; it&rsquo;ll be very nice for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was perhaps the only person in the world who was not just a little bit
      afraid of Kirsteen. Indeed, she was constitutionally unable to be afraid
      of anything, except motor-cars, and, of course, earwigs, and even them one
      must put up with. Her critical sense told her that this woman in blue was
      just like anybody else, besides her father had been the colonel of a
      Highland regiment, which was quite nice, and one must put the best face on
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, pointing out the beauty of each feature of the scenery, and
      not permitting herself or Nedda to think about the bag, they drove until
      they came to Joyfields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen alone was in, and, having sent Nedda into the orchard to look for
      her uncle, Frances Freeland came at once to the point. It was so
      important, she thought, that darling Nedda should see more of dear Derek.
      They were very young, and if she could stay for a few weeks, they would
      both know their minds so much better. She had made her bring her bag,
      because she knew dear Kirsteen would agree with her; and it would be so
      nice for them all. Felix had told her about that poor man who had done
      this dreadful thing, and she thought that if Nedda were here it would be a
      distraction. She was a very good child, and quite useful in the house. And
      while she was speaking she watched Kirsteen, and thought: &lsquo;She is very
      handsome, and altogether ladylike; only it is such a pity she wears that
      blue thing in her hair&mdash;it makes her so conspicuous.&rsquo; And rather
      unexpectedly she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, dear, I believe I know the very thing to keep your hair from
      getting loose. It&rsquo;s such lovely hair. And this is quite a new thing, and
      doesn&rsquo;t show at all; invented by a very nice hairdresser in Worcester.
      It&rsquo;s simplicity itself. Do let me show you!&rdquo; Quickly going over, she
      removed the kingfisher-blue fillet, and making certain passes with her
      fingers through the hair, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so beautifully fine; it seems such a pity not to show it all, dear.
      Now look at yourself!&rdquo; And from the recesses of her pocket she produced a
      little mirror. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Tod will simply love it like that. It&rsquo;ll be such
      a nice change for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen, with just a faint wrinkling of her lips and eyebrows, waited
      till she had finished. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mother, dear, I&rsquo;m sure he will,&rdquo; and replaced the fillet. A patient,
      half-sad, half-quizzical smile visited Frances Freeland&rsquo;s lips, as who
      should say: &lsquo;Yes, I know you think that I&rsquo;m a fuss-box, but it really is a
      pity that you wear it so, darling!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of that smile, Kirsteen got up and kissed her gravely on the
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Nedda came back from a fruitless search for Tod, her bag was already
      in the little spare bedroom and Frances Freeland gone. The girl had never
      yet been alone with her aunt, for whom she had a fervent admiration not
      unmixed with awe. She idealized her, of course, thinking of her as one
      might think of a picture or statue, a symbolic figure, standing for
      liberty and justice and the redress of wrong. Her never-varying garb of
      blue assisted the girl&rsquo;s fancy, for blue was always the color of ideals
      and aspiration&mdash;was not blue sky the nearest one could get to heaven&mdash;were
      not blue violets the flowers of spring? Then, too, Kirsteen was a woman
      with whom it would be quite impossible to gossip or small-talk; with her
      one could but simply and directly say what one felt, and only that over
      things which really mattered. And this seemed to Nedda so splendid that it
      sufficed in itself to prevent the girl from saying anything whatever. She
      longed to, all the same, feeling that to be closer to her aunt meant to be
      closer to Derek. Yet, with all, she knew that her own nature was very
      different; this, perhaps, egged her on, and made her aunt seem all the
      more exciting. She waited breathless till Kirsteen said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you and Derek must know each other better. The worst kind of prison
      in the world is a mistaken marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda nodded fervently. &ldquo;It must be. But I think one knows, Aunt
      Kirsteen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt as if she were being searched right down to the soul before the
      answer came:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. I knew myself. I have seen others who did&mdash;a few. I think
      you might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda flushed from sheer joy. &ldquo;I could never go on if I didn&rsquo;t love. I
      feel I couldn&rsquo;t, even if I&rsquo;d started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With another long look through narrowing eyes, Kirsteen answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You would want truth. But after marriage truth is an unhappy thing,
      Nedda, if you have made a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be dreadful. Awful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So don&rsquo;t make a mistake, my dear&mdash;and don&rsquo;t let him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda answered solemnly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;oh, I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen had turned away to the window, and Nedda heard her say quietly to
      herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Liberty&rsquo;s a glorious feast!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trembling all over with the desire to express what was in her, Nedda
      stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would never keep anything that wanted to be free&mdash;never, never! I
      would never try to make any one do what they didn&rsquo;t want to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw her aunt smile, and wondered whether she had said anything
      exceptionally foolish. But it was not foolish&mdash;surely not&mdash;to
      say what one really felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day, Nedda, all the world will say that with you. Until then we&rsquo;ll
      fight those who won&rsquo;t say it. Have you got everything in your room you
      want? Let&rsquo;s come and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To pass from Becket to Joyfields was really a singular experience. At
      Becket you were certainly supposed to do exactly what you liked, but the
      tyranny of meals, baths, scents, and other accompaniments of the
      &lsquo;all-body&rsquo; regime soon annihilated every impulse to do anything but just
      obey it. At Joyfields, bodily existence was a kind of perpetual skirmish,
      a sort of grudged accompaniment to a state of soul. You might be alone in
      the house at any meal-time. You might or might not have water in your jug.
      And as to baths, you had to go out to a little white-washed shed at the
      back, with a brick floor, where you pumped on yourself, prepared to shout
      out, &ldquo;Halloo! I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; in case any one else came wanting to do the same.
      The conditions were in fact almost perfect for seeing more of one another.
      Nobody asked where you were going, with whom going, or how going. You
      might be away by day or night without exciting curiosity or comment. And
      yet you were conscious of a certain something always there, holding the
      house together; some principle of life, or perhaps&mdash;just a woman in
      blue. There, too, was that strangest of all phenomena in an English home&mdash;no
      game ever played, outdoors or in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next fortnight, while the grass was ripening, was a wonderful time for
      Nedda, given up to her single passion&mdash;of seeing more of him who so
      completely occupied her heart. She was at peace now with Sheila, whose
      virility forbade that she should dispute pride of place with this soft and
      truthful guest, so evidently immersed in rapture. Besides, Nedda had that
      quality of getting on well with her own sex, found in those women who,
      though tenacious, are not possessive; who, though humble, are secretly
      very self-respecting; who, though they do not say much about it, put all
      their eggs in one basket; above all, who disengage, no matter what their
      age, a candid but subtle charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that fortnight was even more wonderful for Derek, caught between two
      passions&mdash;both so fervid. For though the passion of his revolt
      against the Mallorings did not pull against his passion for Nedda, they
      both tugged at him. And this had one curious psychological effect. It made
      his love for Nedda more actual, less of an idealization. Now that she was
      close to him, under the same roof, he felt the full allurement of her
      innocent warmth; he would have been cold-blooded indeed if he had not
      taken fire, and, his pride always checking the expression of his feelings,
      they glowed ever hotter underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, over those sunshiny days there hung a shadow, as of something kept
      back, not shared between them; a kind of waiting menace. Nedda learned of
      Kirsteen and Sheila all the useful things she could; the evenings she
      passed with Derek, those long evenings of late May and early June, this
      year so warm and golden. They walked generally in the direction of the
      hills. A favorite spot was a wood of larches whose green shoots had not
      yet quite ceased to smell of lemons. Tall, slender things those trees,
      whose stems and dried lower branch-growth were gray, almost sooty, up to
      the feathery green of the tops, that swayed and creaked faintly in a wind,
      with a soughing of their branches like the sound of the sea. From the
      shelter of those Highland trees, rather strange in such a countryside,
      they two could peer forth at the last sunlight gold-powdering the fringed
      branches, at the sunset flush dyeing the sky above the Beacon; watch light
      slowly folding gray wings above the hay-fields and the elms; mark the
      squirrels scurry along, and the pigeons&rsquo; evening flight. A stream ran
      there at the edge, and beech-trees grew beside it. In the tawny-dappled
      sand bed of that clear water, and the gray-green dappled trunks of those
      beeches with their great, sinuous, long-muscled roots, was that something
      which man can never tame or garden out of the land: the strength of
      unconquerable fertility&mdash;the remote deep life in Nature&rsquo;s heart. Men
      and women had their spans of existence; those trees seemed as if there
      forever! From generation to generation lovers might come and, looking on
      this strength and beauty, feel in their veins the sap of the world. Here
      the laborer and his master, hearing the wind in the branches and the water
      murmuring down, might for a brief minute grasp the land&rsquo;s unchangeable
      wild majesty. And on the far side of that little stream was a field of
      moon-colored flowers that had for Nedda a strange fascination. Once the
      boy jumped across and brought her back a handkerchief full. They were of
      two kinds: close to the water&rsquo;s edge the marsh orchis, and farther back, a
      small marguerite. Out of this they made a crown of the alternate flowers,
      and a girdle for her waist. That was an evening of rare beauty, and warm
      enough already for an early chafer to go blooming in the dusk. An evening
      when they wandered with their arms round each other a long time, silent,
      stopping to listen to an owl; stopping to point out each star coming so
      shyly up in the gray-violet of the sky. And that was the evening when they
      had a strange little quarrel, sudden as a white squall on a blue sea, or
      the tiff of two birds shooting up in a swift spiral of attack and then&mdash;all
      over. Would he come to-morrow to see her milking? He could not. Why? He
      could not; he would be out. Ah! he never told her where he went; he never
      let her come with him among the laborers like Sheila.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;m pledged not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t trust me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I trust you; but a promise is a promise. You oughtn&rsquo;t to ask
      me, Nedda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I would never have promised to keep anything from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, I do. Love doesn&rsquo;t mean the same to you that it does to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know what it means to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have a secret from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t count honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honour only binds oneself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I include you&mdash;you don&rsquo;t include me in yourself, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re very unjust. I was obliged to promise; it doesn&rsquo;t only
      concern myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then silent, motionless, a yard apart, they looked fiercely at each other,
      their hearts stiff and sore, and in their brains no glimmer of perception
      of anything but tragedy. What more tragic than to have come out of an
      elysium of warm arms round each other, to this sudden hostility! And the
      owl went on hooting, and the larches smelled sweet! And all around was the
      same soft dusk wherein the flowers in her hair and round her waist gleamed
      white! But for Nedda the world had suddenly collapsed. Tears rushed into
      her eyes; she shook her head and turned away, hiding them passionately....
      A full minute passed, each straining to make no sound and catch the
      faintest sound from the other, till in her breathing there was a little
      clutch. His fingers came stealing round, touched her cheeks, and were
      wetted. His arms suddenly squeezed all breath out of her; his lips
      fastened on hers. She answered those lips with her own desperately,
      bending her head back, shutting her wet eyes. And the owl hooted, and the
      white flowers fell into the dusk off her hair and waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, they walked once more enlaced, avoiding with what perfect care
      any allusion to the sudden tragedy, giving themselves up to the
      bewildering ecstasy that had started throbbing in their blood with that
      kiss, longing only not to spoil it. And through the sheltering larch wood
      their figures moved from edge to edge, like two little souls in paradise,
      unwilling to come forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that evening love had a poignancy it had not quite had before; at
      once deeper, sweeter, tinged for both of them with the rich darkness of
      passion, and with discovery that love does not mean a perfect merger of
      one within another. For both felt themselves in the right over that little
      quarrel. The boy that he could not, must not, resign what was not his to
      resign; feeling dimly, without being quite able to shape the thought even
      to himself, that a man has a life of action into which a woman cannot
      always enter, with which she cannot always be identified. The girl feeling
      that she did not want any life into which he did not enter, so that it was
      hard that he should want to exclude her from anything. For all that, she
      did not try again to move him to let her into the secret of his plans of
      revolt and revenge, and disdained completely to find them out from Sheila
      or her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the grass went on ripening. Many and various as the breeds of men, or
      the trees of a forest, were the stalks that made up that greenish jungle
      with the waving, fawn-colored surface; of rye-grass and brome-grass, of
      timothy, plantain, and yarrow; of bent-grass and quake-grass, foxtail, and
      the green-hearted trefoil; of dandelion, dock, musk-thistle, and
      sweet-scented vernal.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 10th of June Tod began cutting his three fields; the whole family,
      with Nedda and the three Tryst children, working like slaves. Old Gaunt,
      who looked to the harvests to clothe him for the year, came to do his
      share of raking, and any other who could find some evening hours to spare.
      The whole was cut and carried in three days of glorious weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovers were too tired the last evening of hay harvest to go rambling,
      and sat in the orchard watching the moon slide up through the coppice
      behind the church. They sat on Tod&rsquo;s log, deliciously weary, in the scent
      of the new-mown hay, while moths flitted gray among the blue darkness of
      the leaves, and the whitened trunks of the apple-trees gleamed ghostly. It
      was very warm; a night of whispering air, opening all hearts. And Derek
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know to-morrow, Nedda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flutter of fear overtook her. What would she know?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the 13th of June Sir Gerald Malloring, returning home to dinner from
      the House of Commons, found on his hall table, enclosed in a letter from
      his agent, the following paper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We, the undersigned laborers on Sir Gerald Malloring&rsquo;s estate, beg
      respectfully to inform him that we consider it unjust that any laborer
      should be evicted from his cottage for any reason connected with private
      life, or social or political convictions. And we respectfully demand that,
      before a laborer receives notice to quit for any such reason, the case
      shall be submitted to all his fellow laborers on the estate; and that in
      the future he shall only receive such notice if a majority of his fellow
      laborers record their votes in favor of the notice being given. In the
      event of this demand being refused, we regretfully decline to take any
      hand in getting in the hay on Sir Gerald Malloring&rsquo;s estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed ninety-three signatures, or signs of the cross with names
      printed after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent&rsquo;s letter which enclosed this document mentioned that the hay was
      already ripe for cutting; that everything had been done to induce the men
      to withdraw the demand, without success, and that the farmers were very
      much upset. The thing had been sprung on them, the agent having no notion
      that anything of the sort was on foot. It had been very secretly, very
      cleverly, managed; and, in the agent&rsquo;s opinion, was due to Mr. Freeland&rsquo;s
      family. He awaited Sir Gerald&rsquo;s instructions. Working double tides, with
      luck and good weather, the farmers and their families might perhaps save
      half of the hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malloring read this letter twice, and the enclosure three times, and
      crammed them deep down into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pre-eminently one of those moments which bring out the qualities of
      Norman blood. And the first thing he did was to look at the barometer. It
      was going slowly down. After a month of first-class weather it would not
      do that without some sinister intention. An old glass, he believed in it
      implicitly. He tapped, and it sank further. He stood there frowning.
      Should he consult his wife? General friendliness said: Yes! A Norman
      instinct of chivalry, and perhaps the deeper Norman instinct, that, when
      it came to the point, women were too violent, said, No! He went up-stairs
      three at a time, and came down two. And all through dinner he sat thinking
      it over, and talking as if nothing had happened; so that he hardly spoke.
      Three-quarters of the hay at stake, if it rained soon! A big loss to the
      farmers, a further reduction in rents already far too low. Should he grin
      and bear it, and by doing nothing show these fellows that he could afford
      to despise their cowardly device? For it WAS cowardly to let his grass get
      ripe and play it this low trick! But if he left things unfought this time,
      they would try it on again with the corn&mdash;not that there was much of
      that on the estate of a man who only believed in corn as a policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should he make the farmers sack the lot and get in other labor? But where?
      Agricultural laborers were made, not born. And it took a deuce of a lot of
      making, at that! Should he suspend wages till they withdrew their demand?
      That might do&mdash;but he would still lose the hay. The hay! After all,
      anybody, pretty well, could make hay; it was the least skilled of all farm
      work, so long as the farmers were there to drive the machines and direct.
      Why not act vigorously? And his jaws set so suddenly on a piece of salmon
      that he bit his tongue. The action served to harden a growing purpose. So
      do small events influence great! Suspend those fellows&rsquo; wages, get down
      strike-breakers, save the hay! And if there were a row&mdash;well, let
      there be a row! The constabulary would have to act. It was characteristic
      of his really Norman spirit that the notion of agreeing to the demand, or
      even considering whether it were just, never once came into his mind. He
      was one of those, comprising nowadays nearly all his class, together with
      their press, who habitually referred to his country as a democratic power,
      a champion of democracy&mdash;but did not at present suspect the meaning
      of the word; nor, to say truth, was it likely they ever would. Nothing,
      however, made him more miserable than indecision. And so, now that he was
      on the point of deciding, and the decision promised vigorous consequences,
      he felt almost elated. Closing his jaws once more too firmly, this time on
      lamb, he bit his tongue again. It was impossible to confess what he had
      done, for two of his children were there, expected to eat with that
      well-bred detachment which precludes such happenings; and he rose from
      dinner with his mind made up. Instead of going back to the House of
      Commons, he went straight to a strike-breaking agency. No grass should
      grow under the feet of his decision! Thence he sought the one post-office
      still open, despatched a long telegram to his agent, another to the chief
      constable of Worcestershire; and, feeling he had done all he could for the
      moment, returned to the &lsquo;House,&rsquo; where they were debating the rural
      housing question. He sat there, paying only moderate attention to a
      subject on which he was acknowledged an authority. To-morrow, in all
      probability, the papers would have got hold of the affair! How he loathed
      people poking their noses into his concerns! And suddenly he was assailed,
      very deep down, by a feeling with which in his firmness he had not
      reckoned&mdash;a sort of remorse that he was going to let a lot of loafing
      blackguards down onto his land, to toss about his grass, and swill their
      beastly beer above it. And all the real love he had for his fields and
      coverts, all the fastidiousness of an English gentleman, and, to do him
      justice, the qualms of a conscience telling him that he owed better things
      than this to those born on his estate, assaulted him in force. He sat back
      in his seat, driving his long legs hard against the pew in front. His
      thick, wavy, still brown hair was beautifully parted above the square brow
      that frowned over deep-set eyes and a perfectly straight nose. Now and
      again he bit into a side of his straw-colored moustache, or raised a hand
      and twisted the other side. Without doubt one of the handsomest and
      perhaps the most Norman-looking man in the whole &lsquo;House.&rsquo; There was a
      feeling among those round him that he was thinking deeply. And so he was.
      But he had decided, and he was not a man who went back on his decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning brought even worse sensations. Those ruffians that he had ordered
      down&mdash;the farmers would never consent to put them up! They would have
      to camp. Camp on his land! It was then that for two seconds the thought
      flashed through him: Ought I to have considered whether I could agree to
      that demand? Gone in another flash. If there was one thing a man could not
      tolerate, it was dictation! Out of the question! But perhaps he had been a
      little hasty about strike-breakers. Was there not still time to save the
      situation from that, if he caught the first train? The personal touch was
      everything. If he put it to the men on the spot, with these
      strike-breakers up his sleeve, surely they must listen! After all, they
      were his own people. And suddenly he was overcome with amazement that they
      should have taken such a step. What had got into them? Spiritless enough,
      as a rule, in all conscience; the sort of fellows who hadn&rsquo;t steam even to
      join the miniature rifle-range that he had given them! And visions of
      them, as he was accustomed to pass them in the lanes, slouching along with
      their straw bags, their hoes, and their shamefaced greetings, passed
      before him. Yes! It was all that fellow Freeland&rsquo;s family! The men had
      been put up to it&mdash;put up to it! The very wording of their demand
      showed that! Very bitterly he thought of the unneighborly conduct of that
      woman and her cubs. It was impossible to keep it from his wife! And so he
      told her. Rather to his surprise, she had no scruples about the
      strike-breakers. Of course, the hay must be saved! And the laborers be
      taught a lesson! All the unpleasantness he and she had gone through over
      Tryst and that Gaunt girl must not go for nothing! It must never be said
      or thought that the Freeland woman and her children had scored over them!
      If the lesson were once driven home, they would have no further trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      He admired her firmness, though with a certain impatience. Women never
      quite looked ahead; never quite realized all the consequences of anything.
      And he thought: &lsquo;By George! I&rsquo;d no idea she was so hard! But, then, she
      always felt more strongly about Tryst and that Gaunt girl than I did.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall the glass was still going down. He caught the 9.15, wiring to
      his agent to meet him at the station, and to the impresario of the
      strike-breakers to hold up their departure until he telegraphed. The
      three-mile drive up from the station, fully half of which was through his
      own land, put him in possession of all the agent had to tell: Nasty spirit
      abroad&mdash;men dumb as fishes&mdash;the farmers, puzzled and angry, had
      begun cutting as best they could. Not a man had budged. He had seen young
      Mr. and Miss Freeland going about. The thing had been worked very
      cleverly. He had suspected nothing&mdash;utterly unlike the laborers as he
      knew them. They had no real grievance, either! Yes, they were going on
      with all their other work&mdash;milking, horses, and that; it was only the
      hay they wouldn&rsquo;t touch. Their demand was certainly a very funny one&mdash;very
      funny&mdash;had never heard of anything like it. Amounted almost to
      security of tenure. The Tryst affair no doubt had done it! Malloring cut
      him short:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till they&rsquo;ve withdrawn this demand, Simmons, I can&rsquo;t discuss that or
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The agent coughed behind his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally! Only perhaps there might be a way of wording it that would
      satisfy them. Never do to really let them have such decisions in their
      hands, of course!
    </p>
    <p>
      They were just passing Tod&rsquo;s. The cottage wore its usual air of embowered
      peace. And for the life of him Malloring could not restrain a gesture of
      annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching home he sent gardeners and grooms in all directions with word
      that he would be glad to meet the men at four o&rsquo;clock at the home farm.
      Much thought, and interviews with several of the farmers, who all but one&mdash;a
      shaky fellow at best&mdash;were for giving the laborers a sharp lesson,
      occupied the interval. Though he had refused to admit the notion that the
      men could be chicaned, as his agent had implied, he certainly did wonder a
      little whether a certain measure of security might not in some way be
      guaranteed, which would still leave him and the farmers a free hand. But
      the more he meditated on the whole episode, the more he perceived how
      intimately it interfered with the fundamental policy of all good
      landowners&mdash;of knowing what was good for their people better than
      those people knew themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      As four o&rsquo;clock approached, he walked down to the home farm. The sky was
      lightly overcast, and a rather chill, draughty, rustling wind had risen.
      Resolved to handle the men with the personal touch, he had discouraged his
      agent and the farmers from coming to the conference, and passed the gate
      with the braced-up feeling of one who goes to an encounter. In that very
      spick-and-span farmyard ducks were swimming leisurely on the greenish
      pond, white pigeons strutting and preening on the eaves of the barn, and
      his keen eye noted that some tiles were out of order up there. Four
      o&rsquo;clock! Ah, here was a fellow coming! And instinctively he crisped his
      hands that were buried in his pockets, and ran over to himself his opening
      words. Then, with a sensation of disgust, he saw that the advancing
      laborer was that incorrigible &lsquo;land lawyer&rsquo; Gaunt. The short, square man
      with the ruffled head and the little bright-gray eyes saluted, uttered an
      &ldquo;Afternoon, Sir Gerald!&rdquo; in his teasing voice, and stood still. His face
      wore the jeering twinkle that had disconcerted so many political meetings.
      Two lean fellows, rather alike, with lined faces and bitten, drooped
      moustaches, were the next to come through the yard gate. They halted
      behind Gaunt, touching their forelocks, shuffling a little, and looking
      sidelong at each other. And Malloring waited. Five past four! Ten past!
      Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;you mind telling the others that I&rsquo;m here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaunt answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so be as you was waitin&rsquo; for the meetin&rsquo;, I fancy as &lsquo;ow you&rsquo;ve got
      it, Sir Gerald!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wave of anger surged up in Malloring, dyeing his face brick-red. So! He
      had come all that way with the best intentions&mdash;to be treated like
      this; to meet this &lsquo;land lawyer,&rsquo; who, he could see, was only here to
      sharpen his tongue, and those two scarecrow-looking chaps, who had come to
      testify, no doubt, to his discomfiture. And he said sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the best you can do to meet me, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaunt answered imperturbably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is, Sir Gerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve mistaken your man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Sir Gerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without another look Malloring passed the three by, and walked back to the
      house. In the hall was the agent, whose face clearly showed that he had
      foreseen this defeat. Malloring did not wait for him to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make arrangements. The strike-breakers will be down by noon to-morrow. I
      shall go through with it now, Simmons, if I have to clear the whole lot
      out. You&rsquo;d better go in and see that they&rsquo;re ready to send police if
      there&rsquo;s any nonsense. I&rsquo;ll be down again in a day or two.&rdquo; And, without
      waiting for reply, he passed into his study. There, while the car was
      being got ready, he stood in the window, very sore; thinking of what he
      had meant to do; thinking of his good intentions; thinking of what was
      coming to the country, when a man could not even get his laborers to come
      and hear what he had to say. And a sense of injustice, of anger, of
      bewilderment, harrowed his very soul.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the first two days of this new &lsquo;kick-up,&rsquo; that &lsquo;fellow Freeland&rsquo;s&rsquo;
      family undoubtedly tasted the sweets of successful mutiny. The fellow
      himself alone shook his head. He, like Nedda, had known nothing, and there
      was to him something unnatural and rather awful in this conduct toward
      dumb crops.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment he heard of it he hardly spoke, and a perpetual little
      frown creased a brow usually so serene. In the early morning of the day
      after Malloring went back to town, he crossed the road to a field where
      the farmer, aided by his family and one of Malloring&rsquo;s gardeners, was
      already carrying the hay; and, taking up a pitchfork, without a word to
      anybody, he joined in the work. The action was deeper revelation of his
      feeling than any expostulation, and the young people watched it rather
      aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Derek said at last; &ldquo;Father never has understood, and
      never will, that you can&rsquo;t get things without fighting. He cares more for
      trees and bees and birds than he does for human beings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t explain why he goes over to the enemy, when it&rsquo;s only a lot
      of grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t gone over to the enemy, Sheila. You don&rsquo;t understand your
      father; to neglect the land is sacrilege to him. It feeds us&mdash;he
      would say&mdash;we live on it; we&rsquo;ve no business to forget that but for
      the land we should all be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; said Nedda quickly; &ldquo;and true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheila answered angrily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be true in France with their bread and wine. People don&rsquo;t live off
      the land here; they hardly eat anything they grow themselves. How can we
      feel like that when we&rsquo;re all brought up on mongrel food? Besides, it&rsquo;s
      simply sentimental, when there are real wrongs to fight about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father is not sentimental, Sheila. It&rsquo;s too deep with him for that,
      and too unconscious. He simply feels so unhappy about the waste of that
      hay that he can&rsquo;t keep his hands off it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek broke in: &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s right. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter, except that we&rsquo;ve
      got to see that the men don&rsquo;t follow his example. They&rsquo;ve a funny feeling
      about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid. He&rsquo;s always been too strange to them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to stiffen their backs. Coming Sheila?&rdquo; And they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left, as she seemed always to be in these days of open mutiny, Nedda said
      sadly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is coming, Aunt Kirsteen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her aunt was standing in the porch, looking straight before her; a trail
      of clematis had drooped over her fine black hair down on to the blue of
      her linen dress. She answered, without turning:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever seen, on jubilee nights, bonfire to bonfire, from hill to
      hill, to the end of the land? This is the first lighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda felt something clutch her heart. What was that figure in blue?
      Priestess? Prophetess? And for a moment the girl felt herself swept into
      the vision those dark glowing eyes were seeing; some violent, exalted,
      inexorable, flaming vision. Then something within her revolted, as though
      one had tried to hypnotize her into seeing what was not true; as though
      she had been forced for the moment to look, not at what was really there,
      but at what those eyes saw projected from the soul behind them. And she
      said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe, Aunt Kirsteen. I don&rsquo;t really believe. I think it must
      go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are like your father,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;a doubter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t persuade myself to see what isn&rsquo;t there. I never can, Aunt
      Kirsteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without reply, save a quiver of her brows, Kirsteen went back into the
      house. And Nedda stayed on the pebbled path before the cottage, unhappy,
      searching her own soul. Did she fail to see because she was afraid to see,
      because she was too dull to see; or because, as she had said, there was
      really nothing there&mdash;no flames to leap from hill to hill, no lift,
      no tearing in the sky that hung over the land? And she thought: &lsquo;London&mdash;all
      those big towns, their smoke, the things they make, the things we want
      them to make, that we shall always want them to make. Aren&rsquo;t they there?
      For every laborer who&rsquo;s a slave Dad says there are five town workers who
      are just as much slaves! And all those Bigwigs with their great houses,
      and their talk, and their interest in keeping things where they are!
      Aren&rsquo;t they there? I don&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t believe anything much can happen,
      or be changed. Oh! I shall never see visions, and dream dreams!&rsquo; And from
      her heart she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Derek and Sheila were going their round on bicycles, to
      stiffen the backs of the laborers. They had hunted lately, always in a
      couple, desiring no complications, having decided that it was less likely
      to provoke definite assault and opposition from the farmers. To their
      mother was assigned all correspondence; to themselves the verbal
      exhortations, the personal touch. It was past noon, and they were already
      returning, when they came on the char-a-bancs containing the head of the
      strike-breaking column. The two vehicles were drawn up opposite the gate
      leading to Marrow Farm, and the agent was detaching the four men destined
      to that locality, with their camping-gear. By the open gate the farmer
      stood eying his new material askance. Dejected enough creatures they
      looked&mdash;poor devils picked up at ten pound the dozen, who, by the
      mingled apathy and sheepish amusement on their faces, might never have
      seen a pitchfork, or smelled a field of clover, in their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young Freelands rode slowly past; the boy&rsquo;s face scornfully drawn
      back into itself; the girl&rsquo;s flaming scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take notice,&rdquo; Derek said; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll soon stop that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they had gone another mile before he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to make our round again; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words of Mr. Pogram, &lsquo;You have influence, young man,&rsquo; were just. There
      was about Derek the sort of quality that belongs to the good regimental
      officer; men followed and asked themselves why the devil they had,
      afterward. And if it be said that no worse leader than a fiery young fool
      can be desired for any movement, it may also be said that without youth
      and fire and folly there is usually no movement at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon they returned home, dead beat. That evening the
      farmers and their wives milked the cows, tended the horses, did everything
      that must be done, not without curses. And next morning the men, with
      Gaunt and a big, dark fellow, called Tulley, for spokesmen, again
      proffered their demand. The agent took counsel with Malloring by wire. His
      answer, &ldquo;Concede nothing,&rdquo; was communicated to the men in the afternoon,
      and received by Gaunt with the remark: &ldquo;I thart we should be hearin&rsquo; that.
      Please to thank Sir Gerald. The men concedes their gratitood....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night it began to rain. Nedda, waking, could hear the heavy drops
      pattering on the sweetbrier and clematis thatching her open window. The
      scent of rain-cooled leaves came in drifts, and it seemed a shame to
      sleep. She got up; put on her dressing-gown, and went to thrust her nose
      into that bath of dripping sweetness. Dark as the clouds had made the
      night, there was still the faint light of a moon somewhere behind. The
      leaves of the fruit-trees joined in the long, gentle hissing, and now and
      again rustled and sighed sharply; a cock somewhere, as by accident, let
      off a single crow. There were no stars. All was dark and soft as velvet.
      And Nedda thought: &lsquo;The world is dressed in living creatures! Trees,
      flowers, grass, insects, ourselves&mdash;woven together&mdash;the world is
      dressed in life! I understand Uncle Tod&rsquo;s feeling! If only it would rain
      till they have to send these strike-breakers back because there&rsquo;s no hay
      worth fighting about!&rsquo; Suddenly her heart beat fast. The wicket gate had
      clicked. There was something darker than the darkness coming along the
      path! Scared, but with all protective instinct roused, she leaned out,
      straining to see. A faint grating sound from underneath came up to her. A
      window being opened! And she flew to her door. She neither barred it,
      however, nor cried out, for in that second it had flashed across her:
      &lsquo;Suppose it&rsquo;s he! Gone out to do something desperate, as Tryst did!&rsquo; If it
      were, he would come up-stairs and pass her door, going to his room. She
      opened it an inch, holding her breath. At first, nothing! Was it fancy? Or
      was some one noiselessly rifling the room down-stairs? But surely no one
      would steal of Uncle Tod, who, everybody knew, had nothing valuable. Then
      came a sound as of bootless feet pressing the stairs stealthily! And the
      thought darted through her, &lsquo;If it isn&rsquo;t he, what shall I do?&rsquo; And then&mdash;&lsquo;What
      shall I do&mdash;if it IS!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Desperately she opened the door, clasping her hands on the place whence
      her heart had slipped down to her bare feet. But she knew it was he before
      she heard him whisper: &ldquo;Nedda!&rdquo; and, clutching him by the sleeve, she drew
      him in and closed the door. He was wet through, dripping; so wet that the
      mere brushing against him made her skin feel moist through its thin
      coverings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been? What have you been doing? Oh, Derek!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was just light enough to see his face, his teeth, the whites of his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cutting their tent-ropes in the rain. Hooroosh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was such a relief that she just let out a little gasping &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and
      leaned her forehead against his coat. Then she felt his wet arms round
      her, his wet body pressed to hers, and in a second he was dancing with her
      a sort of silent, ecstatic war dance. Suddenly he stopped, went down on
      his knees, pressing his face to her waist, and whispering: &ldquo;What a brute,
      what a brute! Making her wet! Poor little Nedda!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda bent over him; her hair covered his wet head, her hands trembled on
      his shoulders. Her heart felt as if it would melt right out of her; she
      longed so to warm and dry him with herself. And, in turn, his wet arms
      clutched her close, his wet hands could not keep still on her. Then he
      drew back, and whispering: &ldquo;Oh, Nedda! Nedda!&rdquo; fled out like a dark ghost.
      Oblivious that she was damp from head to foot, Nedda stood swaying, her
      eyes closed and her lips just open; then, putting out her arms, she drew
      them suddenly in and clasped herself....
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came down to breakfast the next morning, he had gone out already,
      and Uncle Tod, too; her aunt was writing at the bureau. Sheila greeted her
      gruffly, and almost at once went out. Nedda swallowed coffee, ate her egg,
      and bread and honey, with a heavy heart. A newspaper lay open on the
      table; she read it idly till these words caught her eye:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The revolt which has paralyzed the hay harvest on Sir Gerald Malloring&rsquo;s
      Worcestershire estate and led to the introduction of strike-breakers,
      shows no sign of abatement. A very wanton spirit of mischief seems to be
      abroad in this neighborhood. No reason can be ascertained for the arson
      committed a short time back, nor for this further outbreak of discontent.
      The economic condition of the laborers on this estate is admittedly rather
      above than below the average.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at once she thought: &lsquo;&ldquo;Mischief!&rdquo; What a shame!&rsquo; Were people, then, to
      know nothing of the real cause of the revolt&mdash;nothing of the Tryst
      eviction, the threatened eviction of the Gaunts? Were they not to know
      that it was on principle, and to protest against that sort of petty
      tyranny to the laborers all over the country, that this rebellion had been
      started? For liberty! only simple liberty not to be treated as though they
      had no minds or souls of their own&mdash;weren&rsquo;t the public to know that?
      If they were allowed to think that it was all wanton mischief&mdash;that
      Derek was just a mischief-maker&mdash;it would be dreadful! Some one must
      write and make this known? Her father? But Dad might think it too personal&mdash;his
      own relations! Mr. Cuthcott! Into whose household Wilmet Gaunt had gone.
      Ah! Mr. Cuthcott who had told her that he was always at her service! Why
      not? And the thought that she might really do something at last to help
      made her tingle all over. If she borrowed Sheila&rsquo;s bicycle she could catch
      the nine-o&rsquo;clock train to London, see him herself, make him do something,
      perhaps even bring him back with her! She examined her purse. Yes, she had
      money. She would say nothing, here, because, of course, he might refuse!
      At the back of her mind was the idea that, if a real newspaper took the
      part of the laborers, Derek&rsquo;s position would no longer be so dangerous; he
      would be, as it were, legally recognized, and that, in itself, would make
      him more careful and responsible. Whence she got this belief in the
      legalizing power of the press it is difficult to say, unless that, reading
      newspapers but seldom, she still took them at their own valuation, and
      thought that when they said: &ldquo;We shall do this,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We must do that,&rdquo;
       they really were speaking for the country, and that forty-five millions of
      people were deliberately going to do something, whereas, in truth, as was
      known to those older than Nedda, they were speaking, and not too
      conclusively at that, for single anonymous gentlemen in a hurry who were
      not going to do anything. She knew that the press had power, great power&mdash;for
      she was always hearing that&mdash;and it had not occurred to her as yet to
      examine the composition of that power so as to discover that, while the
      press certainly had a certain monopoly of expression, and that same
      &lsquo;spirit of body&rsquo; which makes police constables swear by one another, it
      yet contained within its ring fence the sane and advisable futility of a
      perfectly balanced contradiction; so that its only functions, practically
      speaking, were the dissemination of news, seven-tenths of which would have
      been happier in obscurity; and&mdash;&lsquo;irritation of the Dutch!&rsquo; Not, of
      course, that the press realized this; nor was it probable that any one
      would tell it, for it had power&mdash;great power.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught her train&mdash;glowing outwardly from the speed of her ride,
      and inwardly from the heat of adventure and the thought that at last she
      was being of some use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only other occupants of her third-class compartment were a friendly
      looking man, who might have been a sailor or other wanderer on leave, and
      his thin, dried-up, black-clothed cottage woman of an old mother. They sat
      opposite each other. The son looked at his mother with beaming eyes, and
      she remarked: &ldquo;An&rsquo; I says to him, says I, I says, &lsquo;What?&rsquo; I says; so &lsquo;e
      says to me, he says, &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s what I say,&rsquo; he says.&rdquo; And
      Nedda thought: &lsquo;What an old dear! And the son looks nice too; I do like
      simple people.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They got out at the first stop and she journeyed on alone. Taking a
      taxicab from Paddington, she drove toward Gray&rsquo;s Inn. But now that she was
      getting close she felt very nervous. How expect a busy man like Mr.
      Cuthcott to spare time to come down all that way? It would be something,
      though, if she could get him even to understand what was really happening,
      and why; so that he could contradict that man in the other paper. It must
      be wonderful to be writing, daily, what thousands and thousands of people
      read! Yes! It must be a very sacred-feeling life! To be able to say things
      in that particularly authoritative way which must take such a lot of
      people in&mdash;that is, make such a lot of people think in the same way!
      It must give a man a terrible sense of responsibility, make him feel that
      he simply must be noble, even if he naturally wasn&rsquo;t. Yes! it must be a
      wonderful profession, and only fit for the highest! In addition to Mr.
      Cuthcott, she knew as yet but three young journalists, and those all
      weekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her timid ring the door was opened by a broad-cheeked girl, enticingly
      compact in apron and black frock, whose bright color, thick lips, and
      rogue eyes came of anything but London. It flashed across Nedda that this
      must be the girl for whose sake she had faced Mr. Cuthcott at the
      luncheon-table! And she said: &ldquo;Are you Wilmet Gaunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled till her eyes almost disappeared, and answered: &ldquo;Yes,
      miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Nedda Freeland, Miss Sheila&rsquo;s cousin. I&rsquo;ve just come from Joyfields.
      How are you getting on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine, thank you, miss. Plenty of life here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda thought: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what Derek said of her. Bursting with life! And so
      she is.&rsquo; And she gazed doubtfully at the girl, whose prim black dress and
      apron seemed scarcely able to contain her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Cuthcott in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, miss; he&rsquo;ll be down at the paper. Two hundred and five Floodgate
      Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; thought Nedda with dismay; &lsquo;I shall never venture there!&rsquo; And
      glancing once more at the girl, whose rogue slits of eyes, deep sunk
      between check-bones and brow, seemed to be quizzing her and saying: &lsquo;You
      and Mr. Derek&mdash;oh! I know!&rsquo; she went sadly away. And first she
      thought she would go home to Hampstead, then that she would go back to the
      station, then: &lsquo;After all, why shouldn&rsquo;t I go and try? They can&rsquo;t eat me.
      I will!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached her destination at the luncheon-hour, so that the offices of
      the great evening journal were somewhat deserted. Producing her card, she
      was passed from hand to hand till she rested in a small bleak apartment
      where a young woman was typing fast. She longed to ask her how she liked
      it, but did not dare. The whole atmosphere seemed to her charged with a
      strenuous solemnity, as though everything said, &lsquo;We have power&mdash;great
      power.&rsquo; And she waited, sitting by the window which faced the street. On
      the buildings opposite she could read the name of another great evening
      journal. Why, it was the one which had contained the paragraph she had
      read at breakfast! She had bought a copy of it at the station. Its
      temperament, she knew, was precisely opposed to that of Mr. Cuthcott&rsquo;s
      paper. Over in that building, no doubt there would be the same strenuously
      loaded atmosphere, so that if they opened the windows on both sides little
      puffs of power would meet in mid-air, above the heads of the passers-by,
      as might the broadsides of old three-deckers, above the green, green sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for the first time an inkling of the great comic equipoise in
      Floodgate Street and human affairs stole on Nedda&rsquo;s consciousness. They
      puffed and puffed, and only made smoke in the middle! That must be why Dad
      always called them: &lsquo;Those fellows!&rsquo; She had scarcely, however, finished
      beginning to think these thoughts when a handbell sounded sharply in some
      adjoining room, and the young woman nearly fell into her typewriter.
      Readjusting her balance, she rose, and, going to the door, passed out in
      haste. Through the open doorway Nedda could see a large and pleasant room,
      whose walls seemed covered with prints of men standing in attitudes such
      that she was almost sure they were statesmen; and, at a table in the
      centre, the back of Mr. Cuthcott in a twiddly chair, surrounded by sheets
      of paper reposing on the floor, shining like autumn leaves on a pool of
      water. She heard his voice, smothery, hurried, but still pleasant, say:
      &ldquo;Take these, Miss Mayne, take these! Begin on them, begin! Confound it!
      What&rsquo;s the time?&rdquo; And the young woman&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;Half past one, Mr.
      Cuthcott!&rdquo; And a noise from Mr. Cuthcott&rsquo;s throat that sounded like an
      adjuration to the Deity not to pass over something. Then the young woman
      dipped and began gathering those leaves of paper, and over her comely back
      Nedda had a clear view of Mr. Cuthcott hunching one brown shoulder as
      though warding something off, and of one of his thin hands ploughing up
      and throwing back his brown hair on one side, and heard the sound of his
      furiously scratching pen. And her heart pattered; it was so clear that he
      was &lsquo;giving them one&rsquo; and had no time for her. And involuntarily she
      looked at the windows beyond him to see if there were any puffs of power
      issuing therefrom. But they were closed. She saw the young woman rise and
      come back toward her, putting the sheets of paper in order; and, as the
      door was closing, from the twiddly chair a noise that seemed to couple God
      with the condemnation of silly souls. When the young woman was once more
      at the typewriter she rose and said: &ldquo;Have you given him my card yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman looked at her surprised, as if she had broken some rule of
      etiquette, and answered: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t, please. I can see that he&rsquo;s too busy. I won&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman abstractedly placed a sheet of paper in her typewriter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And before Nedda reached the door she heard the click-click of the
      machine, reducing Mr. Cuthcott to legibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was stupid to come,&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;He must be terribly overworked. Poor
      man! He does say lovely things!&rsquo; And, crestfallen, she went along the
      passages, and once more out into Floodgate Street. She walked along it
      frowning, till a man who was selling newspapers said as she passed: &ldquo;Mind
      ye don&rsquo;t smile, lydy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that he was selling Mr. Cuthcott&rsquo;s paper, she felt for a coin to
      buy one, and, while searching, scrutinized the newsvender&rsquo;s figure, almost
      entirely hidden by the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      GREAT HOUSING SCHEME

      HOPE FOR THE MILLION!
</pre>
    <p>
      on a buff-colored board; while above it, his face, that had not quite
      blood enough to be scorbutic, was wrapped in the expression of those
      philosophers to whom a hope would be fatal. He was, in fact, just what he
      looked&mdash;a street stoic. And a dim perception of the great social
      truth: &ldquo;The smell of half a loaf is not better than no bread!&rdquo; flickered
      in Nedda&rsquo;s brain as she passed on. Was that what Derek was doing with the
      laborers&mdash;giving them half the smell of a liberty that was not there?
      And a sudden craving for her father came over her. He&mdash;he only, was
      any good, because he, only, loved her enough to feel how distracted and
      unhappy she was feeling, how afraid of what was coming. So, making for a
      Tube station, she took train to Hampstead....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was past two, and Felix, on the point of his constitutional. He had
      left Becket the day after Nedda&rsquo;s rather startling removal to Joyfields,
      and since then had done his level best to put the whole Tryst affair, with
      all its somewhat sinister relevance to her life and his own, out of his
      mind as something beyond control. He had but imperfectly succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora, herself not too present-minded, had in these days occasion to speak
      to him about the absent-minded way in which he fulfilled even the most
      domestic duties, and Alan was always saying to him, &ldquo;Buck up, Dad!&rdquo; With
      Nedda&rsquo;s absorption into the little Joyfields whirlpool, the sun shone but
      dimly for Felix. And a somewhat febrile attention to &lsquo;The Last of the
      Laborers&rsquo; had not brought it up to his expectations. He fluttered under
      his buff waistcoat when he saw her coming in at the gate. She must want
      something of him! For to this pitch of resignation, as to his little
      daughter&rsquo;s love for him, had he come! And if she wanted something of him,
      things would be going wrong again down there! Nor did the warmth of her
      embrace, and her: &ldquo;Oh! Dad, it IS nice to see you!&rdquo; remove that
      instinctive conviction; though delicacy, born of love, forbade him to ask
      her what she wanted. Talking of the sky and other matters, thinking how
      pretty she was looking, he waited for the new, inevitable proof that youth
      was first, and a mere father only second fiddle now. A note from Stanley
      had already informed him of the strike. The news had been something of a
      relief. Strikes, at all events, were respectable and legitimate means of
      protest, and to hear that one was in progress had not forced him out of
      his laborious attempt to believe the whole affair only a mole-hill. He had
      not, however, heard of the strike-breakers, nor had he seen any newspaper
      mention of the matter; and when she had shown him the paragraph; recounted
      her visit to Mr. Cuthcott, and how she had wanted to take him back with
      her to see for himself&mdash;he waited a moment, then said almost timidly:
      &ldquo;Should I be of any use, my dear?&rdquo; She flushed and squeezed his hand in
      silence; and he knew he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had packed a handbag and left a note for Flora, he rejoined her in
      the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was past seven when they reached their destination, and, taking the
      station &lsquo;fly,&rsquo; drove slowly up to Joyfields, under a showery sky.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Felix and Nedda reached Tod&rsquo;s cottage, the three little Trysts, whose
      activity could never be quite called play, were all the living creatures
      about the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Freeland, Biddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know; a man came, and she went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Miss Sheila?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went out in the mornin&rsquo;. And Mr. Freeland&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susie added: &ldquo;The dog&rsquo;s gone, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then help me to get some tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the assistance of the mother-child, and the hindrance of Susie and
      Billy, Nedda made and laid tea, with an anxious heart. The absence of her
      aunt, who so seldom went outside the cottage, fields, and orchard,
      disturbed her; and, while Felix refreshed himself, she fluttered several
      times on varying pretexts to the wicket gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her third visit, from the direction of the church, she saw figures
      coming on the road&mdash;dark figures carrying something, followed by
      others walking alongside. What sun there had been had quite given in to
      heavy clouds; the light was dull, the elm-trees dark; and not till they
      were within two hundred yards could Nedda make out that these were figures
      of policemen. Then, alongside that which they were carrying, she saw her
      aunt&rsquo;s blue dress. WHAT were they carrying like that? She dashed down the
      steps, and stopped. No! If it were HE they would bring him in! She rushed
      back again, distracted. She could see now a form stretched on a hurdle. It
      WAS he!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad! Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix came, startled at that cry, to find his little daughter on the path
      wringing her hands and flying back to the wicket gate. They were close
      now. She saw them begin to mount the steps, those behind raising their
      arms so that the hurdle should be level. Derek lay on his back, with head
      and forehead swathed in wet blue linen, torn from his mother&rsquo;s skirt; and
      the rest of his face very white. He lay quite still, his clothes covered
      with mud. Terrified, Nedda plucked at Kirsteen&rsquo;s sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Concussion!&rdquo; The stillness of that blue-clothed figure, so calm beside
      her, gave her strength to say quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put him in my room, Aunt Kirsteen; there&rsquo;s more air there!&rdquo; And she flew
      up-stairs, flinging wide her door, making the bed ready, snatching her
      night things from the pillow; pouring out cold water, sprinkling the air
      with eau de cologne. Then she stood still. Perhaps, they would not bring
      him there? Yes, they were coming up. They brought him in, and laid him on
      the bed. She heard one say: &ldquo;Doctor&rsquo;ll be here directly, ma&rsquo;am. Let him
      lie quiet.&rdquo; Then she and his mother were alone beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undo his boots,&rdquo; said Kirsteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nedda&rsquo;s fingers trembled, and she hated them for fumbling so, while she
      drew off those muddy boots. Then her aunt said softly: &ldquo;Hold him up, dear,
      while I get his things off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, with a strange rapture that she was allowed to hold him thus, she
      supported him against her breast till he was freed and lying back inert.
      Then, and only then, she whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long before he&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen shook her head; and, slipping her arm round the girl, murmured:
      &ldquo;Courage, Nedda!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl felt fear and love rush up desperately to overwhelm her. She
      choked them back, and said quite quietly: &ldquo;I will. I promise. Only let me
      help nurse him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen nodded. And they sat down to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      That quarter of an hour was the longest of her life. To see him thus,
      living, yet not living, with the spirit driven from him by a cruel blow,
      perhaps never to come back! Curious, how things still got themselves
      noticed when all her faculties were centred in gazing at his face. She
      knew that it was raining again; heard the swish and drip, and smelled the
      cool wet perfume through the scent of the eau de cologne that she had
      spilled. She noted her aunt&rsquo;s arm, as it hovered, wetting the bandage; the
      veins and rounded whiteness from under the loose blue sleeve slipped up to
      the elbow. One of his feet lay close to her at the bed&rsquo;s edge; she stole
      her hand beneath the sheet. That foot felt very cold, and she grasped it
      tight. If only she could pass life into him through her hot hand. She
      heard the ticking of her little travelling-clock, and was conscious of
      flies wheeling close up beneath the white ceiling, of how one by one they
      darted at each other, making swift zigzags in the air. And something in
      her she had not yet known came welling up, softening her eyes, her face,
      even the very pose of her young body&mdash;the hidden passion of a
      motherliness, that yearned so to &lsquo;kiss the place,&rsquo; to make him well, to
      nurse and tend, restore and comfort him. And with all her might she
      watched the movements of those rounded arms under the blue sleeves&mdash;how
      firm and exact they were, how soft and quiet and swift, bathing the dark
      head! Then from beneath the bandage she caught sight suddenly of his eyes.
      And her heart turned sick. Oh, they were not quite closed! As if he hadn&rsquo;t
      life enough to close them! She bit into her lip to stop a cry. It was so
      terrible to see them without light. Why did not that doctor come? Over and
      over and over again within her the prayer turned: Let him live! Oh, let
      him live!
    </p>
    <p>
      The blackbirds out in the orchard were tuning up for evening. It seemed
      almost dreadful they should be able to sing like that. All the world was
      going on just the same! If he died, the world would have no more light for
      her than there was now in his poor eyes&mdash;and yet it would go on the
      same! How was that possible? It was not possible, because she would die
      too! She saw her aunt turn her head like a startled animal; some one was
      coming up the stairs! It was the doctor, wiping his wet face&mdash;a young
      man in gaiters. How young&mdash;dreadfully young! No; there was a little
      gray at the sides of his hair! What would he say? And Nedda sat with hands
      tight clenched in her lap, motionless as a young crouching sphinx. An
      interminable testing, and questioning, and answer! Never smoked&mdash;never
      drank&mdash;never been ill! The blow&mdash;ah, here! Just here! Concussion&mdash;yes!
      Then long staring into the eyes, the eyelids lifted between thumb and
      finger. And at last (how could he talk so loud! Yet it was a comfort too&mdash;he
      would not talk like that if Derek were going to die!)&mdash;Hair cut
      shorter&mdash;ice&mdash;watch him like a lynx! This and that, if he came
      to. Nothing else to be done. And then those blessed words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t worry too much. I think it&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo; She could not help
      a little sigh escaping her clenched teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was looking at her. His eyes were nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Well, I&rsquo;ll get back now, and send you out some ice, at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More talk outside the door. Nedda, alone with her lover, crouched forward
      on her knees, and put her lips to his. They were not so cold as his foot,
      and the first real hope and comfort came to her. Watch him like a lynx&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t
      she? But how had it all happened? And where was Sheila? and Uncle Tod?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her aunt had come back and was stroking her shoulder. There had been
      fighting in the barn at Marrow Farm. They had arrested Sheila. Derek had
      jumped down to rescue her and struck his head against a grindstone. Her
      uncle had gone with Sheila. They would watch, turn and turn about. Nedda
      must go now and eat something, and get ready to take the watch from eight
      to midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following her resolve to make no fuss, the girl went out. The police had
      gone. The mother-child was putting her little folk to bed; and in the
      kitchen Felix was arranging the wherewithal to eat. He made her sit down
      and kept handing things; watching like a cat to see that she put them in
      her mouth, in the way from which only Flora had suffered hitherto; he
      seemed so anxious and unhappy, and so awfully sweet, that Nedda forced
      herself to swallow what she thought would never go down a dry and choky
      throat. He kept coming up and touching her shoulder or forehead. Once he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, you know, my pet; concussion often takes two days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two days with his eyes like that! The consolation was not so vivid as
      Felix might have wished; but she quite understood that he was doing his
      best to give it. She suddenly remembered that he had no room to sleep in.
      He must use Derek&rsquo;s. No! That, it appeared, was to be for her when she
      came off duty. Felix was going to have an all-night sitting in the
      kitchen. He had been looking forward to an all-night sitting for many
      years, and now he had got his chance. It was a magnificent opportunity&mdash;&ldquo;without
      your mother, my dear, to insist on my sleeping.&rdquo; And staring at his smile,
      Nedda thought: &lsquo;He&rsquo;s like Granny&mdash;he comes out under difficulties. If
      only I did!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The ice arrived by motor-cycle just before her watch began. It was some
      comfort to have that definite thing to see to. How timorous and humble are
      thoughts in a sick-room, above all when the sick are stretched behind the
      muffle of unconsciousness, withdrawn from the watcher by half-death! And
      yet, for him or her who loves, there is at least the sense of being alone
      with the loved one, of doing all that can be done; and in some strange way
      of twining hearts with the exiled spirit. To Nedda, sitting at his feet,
      and hardly ever turning eyes away from his still face, it sometimes seemed
      that the flown spirit was there beside her. And she saw into his soul in
      those hours of watching, as one looking into a stream sees the
      leopard-like dapple of its sand and dark-strewn floor, just reached by
      sunlight. She saw all his pride, courage, and impatience, his reserve, and
      strange unwilling tenderness, as she had never seen them. And a queer
      dreadful feeling moved her that in some previous existence she had looked
      at that face dead on a field of battle, frowning up at the stars. That was
      absurd&mdash;there were no previous existences! Or was it prevision of
      what would come some day?
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at half past nine, the light began to fail, she lighted two candles
      in tall, thin, iron candlesticks beside her. They burned without flicker,
      those spires of yellow flame, slowly conquering the dying twilight, till
      in their soft radiance the room was full of warm dusky shadows, the night
      outside ever a deeper black. Two or three times his mother came, looked at
      him, asked her if she should stay, and, receiving a little silent shake of
      the head, went away again. At eleven o&rsquo;clock, when once more she changed
      the ice-cap, his eyes had still no lustre, and for a moment her courage
      failed her utterly. It seemed to her that he could never win back, that
      death possessed the room already, possessed those candle-flames, the
      ticking of the clock, the dark, dripping night, possessed her heart. Could
      he be gone before she had been his! Gone! Where? She sank down on her
      knees, covering her eyes. What good to watch, if he were never coming
      back! A long time&mdash;it seemed hours&mdash;passed thus, with the
      feeling growing deeper in her that no good would come while she was
      watching. And behind the barrier of her hands she tried desperately to
      rally courage. If things were&mdash;they were! One must look them in the
      face! She took her hands away. His eyes! Was it light in them? Was it?
      They were seeing&mdash;surely they saw. And his lips made the tiniest
      movement. In that turmoil of exultation she never knew how she managed to
      continue kneeling there, with her hands on his. But all her soul shone
      down to him out of her eyes, and drew and drew at his spirit struggling
      back from the depths of him. For many minutes that struggle lasted; then
      he smiled. It was the feeblest smile that ever was on lips, but it made
      the tears pour down Nedda&rsquo;s cheeks and trickle off on to his hands. Then,
      with a stoicism that she could not believe in, so hopelessly unreal it
      seemed, so utterly the negation of the tumult within her, she settled back
      again at his feet to watch and not excite him. And still his lips smiled
      that faint smile, and his opened eyes grew dark and darker with meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      So at midnight Kirsteen found them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the early hours of his all-night sitting Felix had first only memories,
      and then Kirsteen for companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I worry most about Tod,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He had that look in his face when he
      went off from Marrow Farm. He might do something terrible if they
      ill-treat Sheila. If only she has sense enough to see and not provoke
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely she will,&rdquo; Felix murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if she realizes. But she won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m afraid. Even I have only known
      him look like that three times. Tod is so gentle&mdash;passion stores
      itself in him; and when it comes, it&rsquo;s awful. If he sees cruelty, he goes
      almost mad. Once he would have killed a man if I hadn&rsquo;t got between them.
      He doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing at such moments. I wish&mdash;I wish he
      were back. It&rsquo;s hard one can&rsquo;t pierce through, and see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gazing at her eyes so dark and intent, Felix thought: &lsquo;If YOU can&rsquo;t pierce
      through&mdash;none can.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He learned the story of the disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early that morning Derek had assembled twenty of the strongest laborers,
      and taken them a round of the farms to force the strike-breakers to
      desist. There had been several fights, in all of which the strike-breakers
      had been beaten. Derek himself had fought three times. In the afternoon
      the police had come, and the laborers had rushed with Derek and Sheila,
      who had joined them, into a barn at Marrow Farm, barred it, and thrown
      mangolds at the police, when they tried to force an entrance. One by one
      the laborers had slipped away by a rope out of a ventilation-hole high up
      at the back, and they had just got Sheila down when the police appeared on
      that side, too. Derek, who had stayed to the last, covering their escape
      with mangolds, had jumped down twenty feet when he saw them taking Sheila,
      and, pitching forward, hit his head against a grindstone. Then, just as
      they were marching Sheila and two of the laborers away, Tod had arrived
      and had fallen in alongside the policemen&mdash;he and the dog. It was
      then she had seen that look on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix, who had never beheld his big brother in Berserk mood, could offer
      no consolation; nor had he the heart to adorn the tale, and inflict on
      this poor woman his reflection: &lsquo;This, you see, is what comes of the
      ferment you have fostered. This is the reward of violence!&rsquo; He longed,
      rather, to comfort her; she seemed so lonely and, in spite of all her
      stoicism, so distraught and sad. His heart went out, too, to Tod. How
      would he himself have felt, walking by the side of policemen whose arms
      were twisted in Nedda&rsquo;s! But so mixed are the minds of men that at this
      very moment there was born within him the germ of a real revolt against
      the entry of his little daughter into this family of hotheads. It was more
      now than mere soreness and jealousy; it was fear of a danger hitherto but
      sniffed at, but now only too sharply savored.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she left him to go up-stairs, Felix stayed consulting the dark night.
      As ever, in hours of ebbed vitality, the shapes of fear and doubt grew
      clearer and more positive; they loomed huge out there among the
      apple-trees, where the drip-drip of the rain made music. But his thoughts
      were still nebulous, not amounting to resolve. It was no moment for
      resolves&mdash;with the boy lying up there between the tides of chance;
      and goodness knew what happening to Tod and Sheila. The air grew sharper;
      he withdrew to the hearth, where a wood fire still burned, gray ash, red
      glow, scent oozing from it. And while he crouched there, blowing it with
      bellows, he heard soft footsteps, and saw Nedda standing behind him
      transformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the midst of all his glad sympathy Felix could not help thinking:
      &lsquo;Better for you, perhaps, if he had never returned from darkness!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She came and crouched down by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me sit with you, Dad. It smells so good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; but you must sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll ever want to sleep again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at the glow in her Felix glowed too. What is so infectious as delight?
      They sat a long time talking, as they had not talked since the first fatal
      visit to Becket. Of how love, and mountains, works of art, and doing
      things for others were the only sources of happiness; except scents, and
      lying on one&rsquo;s back looking through tree-tops at the sky; and tea, and
      sunlight, flowers, and hard exercise; oh, and the sea! Of how, when things
      went hard, one prayed&mdash;but what did one pray to? Was it not to
      something in oneself? It was of no use to pray to the great mysterious
      Force that made one thing a cabbage, and the other a king; for That could
      obviously not be weak-minded enough to attend. And gradually little pauses
      began to creep into their talk; then a big pause, and Nedda, who would
      never want to sleep again, was fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix watched those long, dark lashes resting on her cheeks; the slow,
      soft rise of her breast; the touching look of trust and goodness in that
      young face abandoned to oblivion after these hours of stress; watched the
      little tired shadows under the eyes, the tremors of the just-parted lips.
      And, getting up, stealthy as a cat, he found a light rug, and ever more
      stealthily laid it over her. She stirred at that, smiled up at him, and
      instantly went off again. And he thought: &lsquo;Poor little sweetheart, she WAS
      tired!&rsquo; And a passionate desire to guard her from trials and troubles came
      on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o&rsquo;clock Kirsteen slipped in again, and whispered: &ldquo;She made me
      promise to come for her. How pretty she looks, sleeping!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Felix answered; &ldquo;pretty and good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda raised her head, stared up at her aunt, and a delighted smile spread
      over her face. &ldquo;Is it time again? How lovely!&rdquo; Then, before either could
      speak or stop her, she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is more in love,&rdquo; Kirsteen murmured, &ldquo;than I ever saw a girl of her
      age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is more in love,&rdquo; Felix answered, &ldquo;than is good to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not truer than Derek is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be, but she will suffer from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women who love must always suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her cheeks were sunken, shadowy; she looked very tired. When she had gone
      to get some sleep, Felix restored the fire and put on a kettle, meaning to
      make himself some coffee. Morning had broken, clear and sparkling after
      the long rain, and full of scent and song. What glory equalled this early
      morning radiance, the dewy wonder of everything! What hour of the day was
      such a web of youth and beauty as this, when all the stars from all the
      skies had fallen into the grass! A cold nose was thrust into his hand, and
      he saw beside him Tod&rsquo;s dog. The animal was wet, and lightly moved his
      white-tipped tail; while his dark-yellow eyes inquired of Felix what he
      was going to give a dog to eat. Then Felix saw his brother coming in.
      Tod&rsquo;s face was wild and absent as a man with all his thoughts turned on
      something painful in the distance. His ruffled hair had lost its
      brightness; his eyes looked as if driven back into his head; he was
      splashed with mud, and wet from head to foot. He walked up to the hearth
      without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old man?&rdquo; said Felix anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tod looked at him, but did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Felix; &ldquo;tell us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Locked up,&rdquo; said Tod in a voice unlike his own. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t knock them
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! I should hope not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix put his hand within his brother&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They twisted her arms; one of them pushed her from behind. I can&rsquo;t
      understand it. How was it I didn&rsquo;t? I can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;They were the Law. If they had been mere men you&rsquo;d
      have done it, fast enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Tod repeated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been walking ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix stroked his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go up-stairs, old man. Kirsteen&rsquo;s anxious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tod sat down and took his boots off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he said once more. Then, without another word, or
      even a look at Felix, he went out and up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Felix thought: &lsquo;Poor Kirsteen! Ah, well&mdash;they&rsquo;re all about as
      queer, one as the other! How to get Nedda out of it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, with that question gnawing at him, he went out into the orchard. The
      grass was drenching wet, so he descended to the road. Two wood-pigeons
      were crooning to each other, truest of all sounds of summer; there was no
      wind, and the flies had begun humming. In the air, cleared of dust, the
      scent of hay was everywhere. What about those poor devils of laborers,
      now? They would get the sack for this! and he was suddenly beset with a
      feeling of disgust. This world where men, and women too, held what they
      had, took what they could; this world of seeing only one thing at a time;
      this world of force, and cunning, of struggle, and primitive appetites; of
      such good things, too, such patience, endurance, heroism&mdash;and yet at
      heart so unutterably savage!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very tired; but it was too wet to sit down, so he walked on. Now
      and again he passed a laborer going to work; but very few in all those
      miles, and they quite silent. &lsquo;Did they ever really whistle?&rsquo; Felix
      thought. &lsquo;Were they ever jolly ploughmen? Or was that always a fiction?
      Surely, if they can&rsquo;t give tongue this morning, they never can!&rsquo; He
      crossed a stile and took a slanting path through a little wood. The scent
      of leaves and sap, the dapple of sunlight&mdash;all the bright early glow
      and beauty struck him with such force that he could have cried out in the
      sharpness of sensation. At that hour when man was still abed and the land
      lived its own life, how full and sweet and wild that life seemed, how in
      love with itself! Truly all the trouble in the world came from the
      manifold disharmonies of the self-conscious animal called Man!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, coming out on the road again, he saw that he must be within a mile
      or two of Becket; and finding himself suddenly very hungry, determined to
      go there and get some breakfast.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Duly shaved with one of Stanley&rsquo;s razors, bathed, and breakfasted, Felix
      was on the point of getting into the car to return to Joyfields when he
      received a message from his mother: Would he please go up and see her
      before he went?
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her looking anxious and endeavoring to conceal it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having kissed him, she drew him to her sofa and said: &ldquo;Now, darling, come
      and sit down here, and tell me all about this DREADFUL business.&rdquo; And
      taking up an odorator she blew over him a little cloud of scent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      quite a new perfume; isn&rsquo;t it delicious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix, who dreaded scent, concealed his feelings, sat down, and told her.
      And while he told her he was conscious of how pathetically her
      fastidiousness was quivering under those gruesome details&mdash;fighting
      with policemen, fighting with common men, prison&mdash;FOR A LADY;
      conscious too of her still more pathetic effort to put a good face on it.
      When he had finished she remained so perfectly still, with lips so hard
      compressed, that he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good worrying, Mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland rose, pulled something hard, and a cupboard appeared. She
      opened it, and took out a travelling-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go back with you at once,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s in the least necessary, and you&rsquo;ll only knock yourself
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense, darling! I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Knowing that further dissuasion would harden her determination, Felix
      said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in the car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. I shall be ready in ten minutes. Oh! and do you know
      this? It&rsquo;s splendid for taking lines out under the eyes!&rdquo; She was holding
      out a little round box with the lid off. &ldquo;Just wet your finger with it,
      and dab it gently on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Touched by this evidence of her deep desire that he should put as good a
      face on it as herself, Felix dabbed himself under the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Now, wait for me, dear; I shan&rsquo;t be a minute. I&rsquo;ve only to
      get my things. They&rsquo;ll all go splendidly in this little bag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour they had started. During that journey Frances
      Freeland betrayed no sign of tremor. She was going into action, and,
      therefore, had no patience with her nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you proposing to stay, Mother?&rdquo; Felix hazarded; &ldquo;because I don&rsquo;t
      think there&rsquo;s a room for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s nothing, darling. I sleep beautifully in a chair. It suits me
      better than lying down.&rdquo; Felix cast up his eyes, and made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving, they found that the doctor had been there, expressed his
      satisfaction, and enjoined perfect quiet. Tod was on the point of starting
      back to Transham, where Sheila and the two laborers would be brought up
      before the magistrates. Felix and Kirsteen took hurried counsel. Now that
      Mother, whose nursing was beyond reproach, had come, it would be better if
      they went with Tod. All three started forthwith in the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Frances Freeland took her bag&mdash;a noticeably old one,
      without any patent clasp whatever, so that she could open it&mdash;went
      noiselessly upstairs, tapped on Derek&rsquo;s door, and went in. A faint but
      cheerful voice remarked: &ldquo;Halloo, Granny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland went up to the bed, smiled down on him ineffably, laid a
      finger on his lips, and said, in the stillest voice: &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t talk,
      darling!&rdquo; Then she sat down in the window with her bag beside her. Half a
      tear had run down her nose, and she had no intention that it should be
      seen. She therefore opened her bag, and, having taken out a little bottle,
      beckoned Nedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, darling,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;you must just take one of these. It&rsquo;s
      nothing new; they&rsquo;re what my mother used to give me at your age. And for
      one hour you must go out and get some fresh air, and then you can come
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I, Granny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you must keep up your strength. Kiss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda kissed a cheek that seemed extraordinarily smooth and soft, received
      a kiss in the middle of her own, and, having stayed a second by the bed,
      looking down with all her might, went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland, in the window, wasted no thoughts, but began to run over
      in her mind the exact operations necessary to defeat this illness of
      darling Derek&rsquo;s. Her fingers continually locked and interlocked themselves
      with fresh determinations; her eyes, fixed on imaginary foods, methods of
      washing, and ways of keeping him quiet, had an almost fanatical intensity.
      Like a good general she marshalled her means of attack and fixed them in
      perfect order. Now and then she gazed into her bag, making quite sure that
      she had everything, and nothing that was new-fangled or liable to go
      wrong. For into action she never brought any of those patent novelties
      that delighted her soul in times of peace. For example, when she herself
      had pneumonia and no doctor, for two months, it was well known that she
      had lain on her back, free from every kind of remedy, employing only
      courage, nature, and beef tea, or some such simple sustenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having now made her mental dispositions, she got up without sound and
      slipped off a petticoat that she suspected of having rustled a little when
      she came in; folding and popping it where it could not be suspected any
      more, she removed her shoes and put on very old velvet slippers. She
      walked in these toward the bed, listening to find out whether she could
      hear herself, without success. Then, standing where she could see when his
      eyes opened, she began to take stock. That pillow wasn&rsquo;t very comfortable!
      A little table was wanted on both sides, instead of on one. There was no
      odorator, and she did not see one of those arrangements! All these things
      would have to be remedied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed in this reconnoitring, she failed to observe that darling Derek
      was looking at her through eyelashes that were always so nice and black.
      He said suddenly, in that faint and cheerful voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Granny; I&rsquo;m going to get up to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland, whose principle it was that people should always be
      encouraged to believe themselves better than they were, answered. &ldquo;Yes,
      darling, of course; you&rsquo;ll be up in no time. It&rsquo;ll be delightful to see
      you in a chair to-morrow. But you mustn&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek sighed, closed his eyes, and went off into a faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in moments such as these that Frances Freeland was herself. Her
      face flushed a little and grew terribly determined. Conscious that she was
      absolutely alone in the house, she ran to her bag, took out her sal
      volatile, applied it vigorously to his nose, and poured a little between
      his lips. She did other things to him, and not until she had brought him
      round, and the best of it was already made, did she even say to herself:
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use fussing; I must make the best of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, having discovered that he felt quite comfortable&mdash;as he said&mdash;she
      sat down in a chair to fan him and tremble vigorously. She would not have
      allowed that movement of her limbs if it had in any way interfered with
      the fanning. But since, on the contrary, it seemed to be of assistance,
      she certainly felt it a relief; for, whatever age her spirit might be, her
      body was seventy-three.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while she fanned she thought of Derek as a little, black-haired,
      blazing-gray-eyed slip of a sallow boy, all little thin legs and arms
      moving funnily like a foal&rsquo;s. He had been such a dear, gentlemanlike
      little chap. It was dreadful he should be forgetting himself so, and
      getting into such trouble. And her thoughts passed back beyond him to her
      own four little sons, among whom she had been so careful not to have a
      favorite, but to love them all equally. And she thought of how their
      holland suits wore out, especially in the elastic, and got green behind,
      almost before they were put on; and of how she used to cut their hairs,
      spending at least three-quarters of an hour on each, because she had never
      been quick at it, while they sat so good&mdash;except Stanley, and darling
      Tod, who WOULD move just as she had got into the comb particularly nice
      bits of his hair, always so crisp and difficult! And of how she had cut
      off Felix&rsquo;s long golden curls when he was four, and would have cried over
      it, if crying hadn&rsquo;t always been silly! And of how beautifully they had
      all had their measles together, so that she had been up with them day and
      night for about a fortnight. And of how it was a terrible risk with Derek
      and darling Nedda, not at all a wise match, she was afraid. And yet, if
      they really were attached, of course one must put the best face on it! And
      how lovely it would be to see another little baby some day; and what a
      charming little mother Nedda would make&mdash;if only the dear child would
      do her hair just a little differently! And she perceived that Derek was
      asleep&mdash;and one of her own legs, from the knee down. She would
      certainly have bad pins and needles if she did not get up; but, since she
      would not wake him for the world, she must do something else to cure it.
      And she hit upon this plan. She had only to say, &lsquo;Nonsense, you haven&rsquo;t
      anything of the sort!&rsquo; and it was sure to go away. She said this to her
      leg, but, being a realist, she only made it feel like a pin-cushion. She
      knew, however, that she had only to persevere, because it would never do
      to give in. She persevered, and her leg felt as if red-hot needles were
      being stuck in it. Then, for the life of her, she could not help saying a
      little psalm. The sensation went away and left her leg quite dead. She
      would have no strength in it at all when she got up. But that would be
      easily cured, when she could get to her bag, with three globules of nux
      vomica&mdash;and darling Derek must not be waked up for anything! She
      waited thus till Nedda came back, and then said, &ldquo;Sssh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He woke at once, so that providentially she was able to get up, and,
      having stood with her weight on one leg for five minutes, so as to be
      quite sure she did not fall, she crossed back to the window, took her nux
      vomica, and sat down with her tablets to note down the little affairs she
      would require, while Nedda took her place beside the bed, to fan him.
      Having made her list, she went to Nedda and whispered that she was going
      down to see about one or two little things, and while she whispered she
      arranged the dear child&rsquo;s hair. If only she would keep it just like that,
      it would be so much more becoming! And she went down-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accustomed to the resources of Stanley&rsquo;s establishment, or at least to
      those of John&rsquo;s and Felix&rsquo;s, and of the hotels she stayed at, she felt for
      a moment just a little nonplussed at discovering at her disposal nothing
      but three dear little children playing with a dog, and one bicycle. For a
      few seconds she looked at the latter hard. If only it had been a tricycle!
      Then, feeling certain that she could not make it into one, she knew that
      she must make the best of it, especially as, in any case, she could not
      have used it, for it would never do to leave darling Nedda alone in the
      house. She decided therefore to look in every room to see if she could
      find the things she wanted. The dog, who had been attracted by her, left
      the children and came too, and the children, attracted by the dog,
      followed; so they all five went into a room on the ground floor. It was
      partitioned into two by a screen; in one portion was a rough camp
      bedstead, and in the other two dear little child&rsquo;s beds, that must once
      have been Derek&rsquo;s and Sheila&rsquo;s, and one still smaller, made out of a large
      packing-case. The eldest of the little children said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where Billy sleeps, Susie sleeps here, and I sleeps there; and our
      father sleeped in here before he went to prison.&rdquo; Frances Freeland
      experienced a shock. To prison! The idea of letting these little things
      know such a thing as that! The best face had so clearly not been put on it
      that she decided to put it herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not to prison, dear! Only into a house in the town for a little
      while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to her quite dreadful that they should know the truth&mdash;it
      was simply necessary to put it out of their heads. That dear little girl
      looked so old already, such a little mother! And, as they stood about her,
      she gazed piercingly at their heads. They were quite clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second dear little thing said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We like bein&rsquo; here; we hope Father won&rsquo;t be comin&rsquo; back from prison for a
      long time, so as we can go on stayin&rsquo; here. Mr. Freeland gives us apples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The failure of her attempt to put a nicer idea into their heads
      disconcerted Frances Freeland for a moment only. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you he was in prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biddy answered slowly: &ldquo;Nobody didn&rsquo;t tell us; we picked it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you should never pick things up! That&rsquo;s not at all nice. You
      don&rsquo;t know what harm they may do you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy replied: &ldquo;We picked up a dead cat yesterday. It didn&rsquo;t scratch a
      bit, it didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Biddy added: &ldquo;Please, what is prison like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pity seized on Frances Freeland for these little derelicts, whose heads
      and pinafores and faces were so clean. She pursed her lips very tight and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold out your hands, all of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three small hands were held out, and three small pairs of gray-blue eyes
      looked up at her. From the recesses of her pocket she drew forth her
      purse, took from it three shillings, and placed one in the very centre of
      each palm. The three small hands closed; two small grave bodies dipped in
      little courtesies; the third remained stock-still, but a grin spread
      gradually on its face from ear to ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; said Frances Freeland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Now run away and play a nice game in the orchard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three turned immediately and went. A sound of whispering rose busily
      outside. Frances Freeland, glancing through the window, saw them
      unlatching the wicket gate. Sudden alarm seized her. She put out her head
      and called. Biddy came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t spend them all at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biddy shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Once we had a shillin&rsquo;, and we were sick. We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to spend three
      pennies out of one shillin&rsquo; every day, till they&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And aren&rsquo;t you going to put any by for a rainy day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland did not know what to answer. Dear little things!
    </p>
    <p>
      The dear little things vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Tod&rsquo;s and Kirsteen&rsquo;s room she found a little table and a pillow, and
      something that might do, and having devised a contrivance by which this
      went into that and that into this and nothing whatever showed, she
      conveyed the whole very quietly up near dear Derek&rsquo;s room, and told
      darling Nedda to go down-stairs and look for something that she knew she
      would not find, for she could not think at the moment of any better
      excuse. When the child had gone, she popped this here, and popped that
      there. And there she was! And she felt better. It was no use whatever to
      make a fuss about that aspect of nursing which was not quite nice. One
      just put the best face upon it, quietly did what was necessary, and
      pretended that it was not there. Kirsteen had not seen to things quite as
      she should have. But then dear Kirsteen was so clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her attitude, indeed, to that blue bird, who had alighted now twenty-one
      years ago in the Freeland nest, had always, after the first few shocks,
      been duly stoical. For, however her fastidiousness might jib at neglect of
      the forms of things, she was the last woman not to appreciate really
      sterling qualities. Though it was a pity dear Kirsteen did expose her neck
      and arms so that they had got quite brown, a pity that she never went to
      church and had brought up the dear children not to go, and to have ideas
      that were not quite right about &lsquo;the Land,&rsquo; still she was emphatically a
      lady, and devoted to dear Tod, and very good. And her features were so
      regular, and she had such a good color, and was so slim and straight in
      the back, that she was always a pleasure to look at. And if she was not
      quite so practical as she might have been, that was not everything; and
      she would never get stout, as there was every danger of Clara doing. So
      that from the first she had always put a good face on her. Derek&rsquo;s voice
      interrupted her thoughts:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully thirsty, Granny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, darling. Don&rsquo;t move your head; and just let me pop in some of this
      delicious lemonade with a spoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda, returning, found her supporting his head with one hand, while with
      the other she kept popping in the spoon, her soul smiling at him lovingly
      through her lips and eyes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Felix went back to London the afternoon of Frances Freeland&rsquo;s
      installation, taking Sheila with him. She had been &lsquo;bound over to keep the
      peace&rsquo;&mdash;a task which she would obviously be the better able to
      accomplish at a distance. And, though to take charge of her would be
      rather like holding a burning match till there was no match left, he felt
      bound to volunteer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left Nedda with many misgivings; but had not the heart to wrench her
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recovery of a young man who means to get up to-morrow is not so rapid
      when his head, rather than his body, is the seat of trouble. Derek&rsquo;s
      temperament was against him. He got up several times in spirit, to find
      that his body had remained in bed. And this did not accelerate his
      progress. It had been impossible to dispossess Frances Freeland from
      command of the sick-room; and, since she was admittedly from experience
      and power of paying no attention to her own wants, the fittest person for
      the position, there she remained, taking turn and turn about with Nedda,
      and growing a little whiter, a little thinner, more resolute in face, and
      more loving in her eyes, from day to day. That tragedy of the old&mdash;the
      being laid aside from life before the spirit is ready to resign, the
      feeling that no one wants you, that all those you have borne and brought
      up have long passed out on to roads where you cannot follow, that even the
      thought-life of the world streams by so fast that you lie up in a
      backwater, feebly, blindly groping for the full of the water, and always
      pushed gently, hopelessly back; that sense that you are still young and
      warm, and yet so furbelowed with old thoughts and fashions that none can
      see how young and warm you are, none see how you long to rub hearts with
      the active, how you yearn for something real to do that can help life on,
      and how no one will give it you! All this&mdash;this tragedy&mdash;was for
      the time defeated. She was, in triumph, doing something real for those she
      loved and longed to do things for. She had Sheila&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week at least Derek asked no questions, made no allusion to the
      mutiny, not even to the cause of his own disablement. It had been
      impossible to tell whether the concussion had driven coherent recollection
      from his mind, or whether he was refraining from an instinct of
      self-preservation, barring such thoughts as too exciting. Nedda dreaded
      every day lest he should begin. She knew that the questions would fall on
      her, since no answer could possibly be expected from Granny except: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      all right, darling, everything&rsquo;s going on perfectly&mdash;only you mustn&rsquo;t
      talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It began the last day of June, the very first day that he got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t save the hay, did they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was he fit to hear the truth? Would he forgive her if she did not tell it?
      If she lied about this, could she go on lying to his other questions? When
      he discovered, later, would not the effect undo the good of lies now? She
      decided to lie; but, when she opened her lips, simply could not, with his
      eyes on her; and said faintly: &ldquo;Yes, they did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face contracted. She slipped down at once and knelt beside his chair.
      He said between his teeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on; tell me. Did it all collapse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could only stroke his hands and bow her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. What&rsquo;s happened to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without looking up, she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some have been dismissed; the others are working again all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up then so pitifully that he did not ask her anything more. But
      the news put him back a week. And she was in despair. The day he got up
      again he began afresh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are the assizes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 7th of August.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anybody been to see Bob Tryst?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Aunt Kirsteen has been twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having been thus answered, he was quiet for a long time. She had slipped
      again out of her chair to kneel beside him; it seemed the only place from
      which she could find courage for her answers. He put his hand, that had
      lost its brown, on her hair. At that she plucked up spirit to ask:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like me to go and see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I will&mdash;to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever tell me what isn&rsquo;t true, Nedda! People do; that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t
      ask before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered fervently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t! Oh, I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dreaded this visit to the prison. Even to think of those places gave
      her nightmare. Sheila&rsquo;s description of her night in a cell had made her
      shiver with horror. But there was a spirit in Nedda that went through with
      things; and she started early the next day, refusing Kirsteen&rsquo;s proffered
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look of that battlemented building, whose walls were pierced with
      emblems of the Christian faith, turned her heartsick, and she stood for
      several minutes outside the dark-green door before she could summon
      courage to ring the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stout man in blue, with a fringe of gray hair under his peaked cap, and
      some keys dangling from a belt, opened, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being called &lsquo;miss&rsquo; gave her a little spirit, and she produced the card
      she had been warming in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to see a man called Robert Tryst, waiting for trial at the
      assizes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stout man looked at the card back and front, as is the way of those in
      doubt, closed the door behind her, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a minute, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shutting of the door behind her sent a little shiver down Nedda&rsquo;s
      spine; but the temperature of her soul was rising, and she looked round.
      Beyond the heavy arch, beneath which she stood, was a courtyard where she
      could see two men, also in blue, with peaked caps. Then, to her left, she
      became conscious of a shaven-headed noiseless being in drab-gray clothes,
      on hands and knees, scrubbing the end of a corridor. Her tremor at the
      stealthy ugliness of this crouching figure yielded at once to a spasm of
      pity. The man gave her a look, furtive, yet so charged with intense
      penetrating curiosity that it seemed to let her suddenly into innumerable
      secrets. She felt as if the whole life of people shut away in silence and
      solitude were disclosed to her in the swift, unutterably alive look of
      this noiseless kneeling creature, riving out of her something to feed his
      soul and body on. That look seemed to lick its lips. It made her angry,
      made her miserable, with a feeling of pity she could hardly bear. Tears,
      too startled to flow, darkened her eyes. Poor man! How he must hate her,
      who was free, and all fresh from the open world and the sun, and people to
      love and talk to! The &lsquo;poor man&rsquo; scrubbed on steadily, his ears standing
      out from his shaven head; then, dragging his knee-mat skew-ways, he took
      the chance to look at her again. Perhaps because his dress and cap and
      stubble of hair and even the color of his face were so drab-gray, those
      little dark eyes seemed to her the most terribly living things she had
      ever seen. She felt that they had taken her in from top to toe, clothed
      and unclothed, taken in the resentment she had felt and the pity she was
      feeling; they seemed at once to appeal, to attack, and to possess her
      ravenously, as though all the starved instincts in a whole prisoned world
      had rushed up and for a second stood outside their bars. Then came the
      clank of keys, the eyes left her as swiftly as they had seized her, and he
      became again just that stealthy, noiseless creature scrubbing a stone
      floor. And, shivering, Nedda thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear myself here&mdash;me with everything in the world I want&mdash;and
      these with nothing!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the stout janitor was standing by her again, together with another man
      in blue, who said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, miss; this way, please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And down that corridor they went. Though she did not turn, she knew well
      that those eyes were following, still riving something from her; and she
      heaved a sigh of real relief when she was round a corner. Through barred
      windows that had no glass she could see another court, where men in the
      same drab-gray clothes printed with arrows were walking one behind the
      other, making a sort of moving human hieroglyphic in the centre of the
      concrete floor. Two warders with swords stood just outside its edge. Some
      of those walking had their heads up, their chests expanded, some slouched
      along with heads almost resting on their chests; but most had their eyes
      fixed on the back of the neck of the man in front; and there was no sound
      save the tramp of feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nedda put her hand to her throat. The warder beside her said in a chatty
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the &lsquo;ards takes their exercise, miss. You want to see a man
      called Tryst, waitin&rsquo; trial, I think. We&rsquo;ve had a woman here to see him,
      and a lady in blue, once or twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! just so. Laborer, I think&mdash;case of arson. Funny thing; never yet
      found a farm-laborer that took to prison well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda shivered. The words sounded ominous. Then a little flame lit itself
      within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does anybody ever &lsquo;take to&rsquo; prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The warder uttered a sound between a grunt and chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some has a better time here than they have out, any day. No doubt
      about it&mdash;they&rsquo;re well fed here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her aunt&rsquo;s words came suddenly into Nedda&rsquo;s mind: &lsquo;Liberty&rsquo;s a glorious
      feast!&rsquo; But she did not speak them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the warder proceeded, &ldquo;some o&rsquo; them we get look as if they didn&rsquo;t
      have a square meal outside from one year&rsquo;s end to the other. If you&rsquo;ll
      just wait a minute, miss, I&rsquo;ll fetch the man down to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a bare room with distempered walls, and bars to a window out of which
      she could see nothing but a high brick wall, Nedda waited. So rapid is the
      adjustment of the human mind, so quick the blunting of human sensation,
      that she had already not quite the passion of pitiful feeling which had
      stormed her standing under that archway. A kind of numbness gripped her
      nerves. There were wooden forms in this room, and a blackboard, on which
      two rows of figures had been set one beneath the other, but not yet added
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence at first was almost deathly. Then it was broken by a sound as
      of a heavy door banged, and the shuffling tramp of marching men&mdash;louder,
      louder, softer&mdash;a word of command&mdash;still softer, and it died
      away. Dead silence again! Nedda pressed her hands to her breast. Twice she
      added up those figures on the blackboard; each time the number was the
      same. Ah, there was a fly&mdash;two flies! How nice they looked, moving,
      moving, chasing each other in the air. Did flies get into the cells?
      Perhaps not even a fly came there&mdash;nothing more living than walls and
      wood! Nothing living except what was inside oneself! How dreadful! Not
      even a clock ticking, not even a bird&rsquo;s song! Silent, unliving, worse than
      in this room! Something pressed against her leg. She started violently and
      looked down. A little cat! Oh, what a blessed thing! A little sandy, ugly
      cat! It must have crept in through the door. She was not locked in, then,
      anyway! Thus far had nerves carried her already! Scrattling the little
      cat&rsquo;s furry pate, she pulled herself together. She would not tremble and
      be nervous. It was disloyal to Derek and to her purpose, which was to
      bring comfort to poor Tryst. Then the door was pushed open, and the warder
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A quarter of an hour, miss. I&rsquo;ll be just outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw a big man with unshaven cheeks come in, and stretched out her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mr. Derek&rsquo;s cousin, going to be married to him. He&rsquo;s been ill, but
      he&rsquo;s getting well again now. We knew you&rsquo;d like to hear.&rdquo; And she thought:
      &lsquo;Oh! What a tragic face! I can&rsquo;t bear to look at his eyes!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand, said, &ldquo;Thank you, miss,&rdquo; and stood as still as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please come and sit down, and we can talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tryst moved to a form and took his seat thereon, with his hands between
      his knees, as if playing with an imaginary cap. He was dressed in an
      ordinary suit of laborer&rsquo;s best clothes, and his stiff, dust-colored hair
      was not cut particularly short. The cheeks of his square-cut face had
      fallen in, the eyes had sunk back, and the prominence thus given to his
      cheek and jawbones and thick mouth gave his face a savage look&mdash;only
      his dog-like, terribly yearning eyes made Nedda feel so sorry that she
      simply could not feel afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The children are such dears, Mr. Tryst. Billy seems to grow every day.
      They&rsquo;re no trouble at all, and quite happy. Biddy&rsquo;s wonderful with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good maid.&rdquo; The thick lips shaped the words as though they had
      almost lost power of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they let you see the newspapers we send? Have you got everything you
      want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a minute he did not seem to be going to answer; then, moving his head
      from side to side, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; I want, but just get out of here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda murmured helplessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a month now to the assizes. Does Mr. Pogram come to see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he comes. He can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t despair! Even if they don&rsquo;t acquit you, it&rsquo;ll soon be over.
      Don&rsquo;t despair!&rdquo; And she stole her hand out and timidly touched his arm.
      She felt her heart turning over and over, he looked so sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said in that stumbling, thick voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you kindly. I must get out. I won&rsquo;t stand long of it&mdash;not much
      longer. I&rsquo;m not used to it&mdash;always been accustomed to the air, an&rsquo;
      bein&rsquo; about, that&rsquo;s where &lsquo;tis. But don&rsquo;t you tell him, miss. You say I&rsquo;m
      goin&rsquo; along all right. Don&rsquo;t you tell him what I said. &lsquo;Tis no use him
      frettin&rsquo; over me. &lsquo;Twon&rsquo; do me no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Nedda murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I won&rsquo;t tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly came the words she had dreaded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;you think they&rsquo;ll let me go, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I think so&mdash;I hope so!&rdquo; But she could not meet his eyes,
      and hearing him grit his boot on the floor knew he had not believed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never meant to do it when I went out that mornin&rsquo;. It came on me
      sudden, lookin&rsquo; at the straw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda gave a little gasp. Could that man outside hear?
    </p>
    <p>
      Tryst went on: &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t let me go, I won&rsquo; stand it. &lsquo;Tis too much
      for a man. I can&rsquo;t sleep, I can&rsquo;t eat, nor nothin&rsquo;. I won&rsquo; stand it. It
      don&rsquo; take long to die, if you put your mind to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Feeling quite sick with pity, Nedda got up and stood beside him; and,
      moved by an uncontrollable impulse, she lifted one of his great hands and
      clasped it in both her own. &ldquo;Oh, try and be brave and look forward! You&rsquo;re
      going to be ever so happy some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a strange long stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll be happy some day. Don&rsquo; you never fret about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Nedda saw that the warder was standing in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, miss, time&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word Tryst rose and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nedda was alone again with the little sandy cat. Standing under the
      high-barred window she wiped her cheeks, that were all wet. Why, why must
      people suffer so? Suffer so slowly, so horribly? What were men made of
      that they could go on day after day, year after year, watching others
      suffer?
    </p>
    <p>
      When the warder came back to take her out, she did not trust herself to
      speak, or even to look at him. She walked with hands tight clenched, and
      eyes fixed on the ground. Outside the prison door she drew a long, long
      breath. And suddenly her eyes caught the inscription on the corner of a
      lane leading down alongside the prison wall&mdash;&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Walk&rdquo;!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peremptorily ordered by the doctor to the sea, but with instructions to
      avoid for the present all excitement, sunlight, and color, Derek and his
      grandmother repaired to a spot well known to be gray, and Nedda went home
      to Hampstead. This was the last week in July. A fortnight spent in the
      perfect vacuity of an English watering-place restored the boy wonderfully.
      No one could be better trusted than Frances Freeland to preserve him from
      looking on the dark side of anything, more specially when that thing was
      already not quite nice. Their conversation was therefore free from
      allusion to the laborers, the strike, or Bob Tryst. And Derek thought the
      more. The approaching trial was hardly ever out of his mind. Bathing, he
      would think of it; sitting on the gray jetty looking over the gray sea, he
      would think of it. Up the gray cobbled streets and away on the headlands,
      he would think of it. And, so as not to have to think of it, he would try
      to walk himself to a standstill. Unfortunately the head will continue
      working when the legs are at rest. And when he sat opposite to her at
      meal-times, Frances Freeland would gaze piercingly at his forehead and
      muse: &lsquo;The dear boy looks much better, but he&rsquo;s getting a little line
      between his brows&mdash;it IS such a pity!&rsquo; It worried her, too, that the
      face he was putting on their little holiday together was not quite as full
      as she could have wished&mdash;though the last thing in the world she
      could tolerate were really fat cheeks, those signs of all that her
      stoicism abhorred, those truly unforgivable marks of the loss of &lsquo;form.&rsquo;
      He struck her as dreadfully silent, too, and she would rack her brains for
      subjects that would interest him, often saying to herself: &lsquo;If only I were
      clever!&rsquo; It was natural he should think of dear Nedda, but surely it was
      not that which gave him the little line. He must be brooding about those
      other things. He ought not to be melancholy like this and let anything
      prevent the sea from doing him good. The habit&mdash;hard-learned by the
      old, and especially the old of her particular sex&mdash;of not wishing for
      the moon, or at all events of not letting others know that you are wishing
      for it, had long enabled Frances Freeland to talk cheerfully on the most
      indifferent subjects whether or no her heart were aching. One&rsquo;s heart
      often did ache, of course, but it simply didn&rsquo;t do to let it interfere,
      making things uncomfortable for others. And once she said to him: &ldquo;You
      know, darling, I think it would be so nice for you to take a little
      interest in politics. They&rsquo;re very absorbing when you once get into them.
      I find my paper most enthralling. And it really has very good principles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If politics did anything for those who most need things done, Granny&mdash;but
      I can&rsquo;t see that they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought a little, then, making firm her lips, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s quite just, darling, there are a great many
      politicians who are very much looked up to&mdash;all the bishops, for
      instance, and others whom nobody could suspect of self-seeking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that politicians were self-seeking, Granny; I meant that
      they&rsquo;re comfortable people, and the things that interest them are those
      that interest comfortable people. What have they done for the laborers,
      for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but, darling! they&rsquo;re going to do a great deal. In my paper they&rsquo;re
      continually saying that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they wouldn&rsquo;t say so if they weren&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s quite a new plan,
      and it sounds most sensible. And so I don&rsquo;t think, darling, that if I were
      you I should make myself unhappy about all that kind of thing. They must
      know best. They&rsquo;re all so much older than you. And you&rsquo;re getting quite a
      little line between your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Granny; I shall have a big one soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Frances Freeland smiled, too, but shook her head.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and that&rsquo;s why I really think you ought to take interest in
      politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather take interest in you, Granny. You&rsquo;re very jolly to look at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland raised her brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? My dear, I&rsquo;m a perfect fright nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus pushing away what her stoicism and perpetual aspiration to an
      impossibly good face would not suffer her to admit, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where would you like to drive this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For they took drives in a small victoria, Frances Freeland holding her
      sunshade to protect him from the sun whenever it made the mistake of being
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      On August the fourth he insisted that he was well and must go back home.
      And, though to bring her attendance on him to an end was a grief, she
      humbly admitted that he must be wanting younger company, and, after one
      wistful attempt, made no further bones. The following day they travelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      On getting home he found that the police had been to see little Biddy
      Tryst, who was to be called as a witness. Tod would take her over on the
      morning of the trial. Derek did not wait for this, but on the day before
      the assizes repacked his bag and went off to the Royal Charles Hostel at
      Worcester. He slept not at all that night, and next morning was early at
      the court, for Tryst&rsquo;s case would be the first. Anxiously he sat watching
      all the queer and formal happenings that mark the initiation of the higher
      justice&mdash;the assemblage of the gentlemen in wigs; the sifting,
      shifting, settling of clerks, and ushers, solicitors, and the public; the
      busy indifference, the cheerful professionalism of it all. He saw little
      Mr. Pogram come in, more square and rubbery than ever, and engage in
      conclave with one of the bewigged. The smiles, shrugs, even the sharp
      expressions on that barrister&rsquo;s face; the way he stood, twisting round,
      one hand wrapped in his gown, one foot on the bench behind; it was all as
      if he had done it hundreds of times before and cared not the snap of one
      of his thin, yellow fingers. Then there was a sudden hush; the judge came
      in, bowed, and took his seat. And that, too, seemed so professional.
      Haunted by the thought of him to whom this was almost life and death, the
      boy was incapable of seeing how natural it was that they should not all
      feel as he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case was called and Tryst brought in. Derek had once more to undergo
      the torture of those tragic eyes fixed on him. Round that heavy figure,
      that mournful, half-brutal, and half-yearning face, the pleadings, the
      questions, the answers buzzed, bringing out facts with damning clearness,
      yet leaving the real story of that early morning as hidden as if the court
      and all were but gibbering figures of air. The real story of Tryst, heavy
      and distraught, rising and turning out from habit into the early haze on
      the fields, where his daily work had lain, of Tryst brooding, with the
      slow, the wrathful incoherence that centuries of silence in those lonely
      fields had passed into the blood of his forebears and himself. Brooding,
      in the dangerous disproportion that enforced continence brings to certain
      natures, loading the brain with violence till the storm bursts and there
      leap out the lurid, dark insanities of crime. Brooding, while in the air
      flies chased each other, insects crawled together in the grass, and the
      first principle of nature worked everywhere its sane fulfilment. They
      might talk and take evidence as they would, be shrewd and sharp with all
      the petty sharpness of the Law; but the secret springs would still lie
      undisclosed, too natural and true to bear the light of day. The probings
      and eloquence of justice would never paint the picture of that moment of
      maniacal relief, when, with jaw hanging loose, eyes bulging in exultation
      of revenge, he had struck those matches with his hairy hands and let them
      flare in the straw, till the little red flames ran and licked, rustled and
      licked, and there was nothing to do but watch them lick and burn. Nor of
      that sudden wildness of dumb fear that rushed into the heart of the
      crouching creature, changing the madness of his face to palsy. Nor of the
      recoil from the burning stack; those moments empty with terror. Nor of how
      terror, through habit of inarticulate, emotionless existence, gave place
      again to brute stolidity. And so, heavily back across the dewy fields,
      under the larks&rsquo; songs, the cooings of pigeons, the hum of wings, and all
      the unconscious rhythm of ageless Nature. No! The probings of Justice
      could never reach the whole truth. And even Justice quailed at its own
      probings when the mother-child was passed up from Tod&rsquo;s side into the
      witness-box and the big laborer was seen to look at her and she at him.
      She seemed to have grown taller; her pensive little face and beautifully
      fluffed-out corn-brown hair had an eerie beauty, perched up there in the
      arid witness-box, as of some small figure from the brush of Botticelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biddy Tryst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten next month, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember going to live at Mr. Freeland&rsquo;s cottage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you remember the first night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you sleep, Biddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, we slept in a big room with a screen. Billy and Susie and
      me; and father behind the screen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where was the room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down-stairs, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Biddy, what time did you wake up the first morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Father got up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that early or late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you know the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was very early; how did you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a long time before we had any breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what time did you have breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half past six by the kitchen clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it light when you woke up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Father got up, did he dress or did he go to bed again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t never undressed, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then did he stay with you or did he go out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how long was it before he came back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was puttin&rsquo; on Billy&rsquo;s boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had you done in between?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helped Susie and dressed Billy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how long does that take you generally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an hour, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. What did Father look like when he came in, Biddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother-child paused. For the first time it seemed to dawn on her that
      there was something dangerous in these questions. She twisted her small
      hands before her and gazed at her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like he does now, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Biddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all; the mother-child was suffered to step down and take her
      place again by Tod. And in the silence rose the short and rubbery report
      of little Mr. Pogram blowing his nose. No evidence given that morning was
      so conclusive, actual, terrible as that unconscious: &ldquo;Like he does now,
      sir.&rdquo; That was why even Justice quailed a little at its own probings.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this moment the boy knew that Tryst&rsquo;s fate was sealed. What did all
      those words matter, those professional patterings one way and the other;
      the professional jeers: &lsquo;My friend has told you this&rsquo; and &lsquo;My friend will
      tell you that.&rsquo; The professional steering of the impartial judge, seated
      there above them all; the cold, calculated rhapsodies about the
      heinousness of arson; the cold and calculated attack on the characters of
      the stone-breaker witness and the tramp witness; the cold and calculated
      patter of the appeal not to condemn a father on the evidence of his little
      child; the cold and calculated outburst on the right of every man to be
      assumed innocent except on overwhelming evidence such as did not here
      exist. The cold and calculated balancing of pro and con; and those minutes
      of cold calculation veiled from the eyes of the court. Even the verdict:
      &lsquo;Guilty&rsquo;; even the judgment: &lsquo;Three years&rsquo; penal servitude.&rsquo; All nothing,
      all superfluity to the boy supporting the tragic gaze of Tryst&rsquo;s eyes and
      making up his mind to a desperate resort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three years&rsquo; penal servitude!&rdquo; The big laborer paid no more attention to
      those words than to any others spoken during that hour&rsquo;s settlement of his
      fate. True, he received them standing, as is the custom, fronting the
      image of Justice, from whose lips they came. But by no single gesture did
      he let any one see the dumb depths of his soul. If life had taught him
      nothing else, it had taught him never to express himself. Mute as any
      bullock led into the slaughtering-house, with something of a bullock&rsquo;s
      dulled and helpless fear in his eyes, he passed down and away between his
      jailers. And at once the professional noises rose, and the professional
      rhapsodists, hunching their gowns, swept that little lot of papers into
      their pink tape, and, turning to their neighbors, smiled, and talked, and
      jerked their eyebrows.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The nest on the Spaniard&rsquo;s Road had not been able to contain Sheila long.
      There are certain natures, such as that of Felix, to whom the claims and
      exercise of authority are abhorrent, who refuse to exercise it themselves
      and rage when they see it exercised over others, but who somehow never
      come into actual conflict with it. There are other natures, such as
      Sheila&rsquo;s, who do not mind in the least exercising authority themselves,
      but who oppose it vigorously when they feel it coming near themselves or
      some others. Of such is the kingdom of militancy. Her experience with the
      police had sunk deep into her soul. They had not, as a fact, treated her
      at all badly, which did not prevent her feeling as if they had outraged in
      her the dignity of woman. She arrived, therefore, in Hampstead seeing red
      even where red was not. And since, undoubtedly, much real red was to be
      seen, there was little other color in the world or in her cheeks those
      days. Long disagreements with Alan, to whom she was still a magnet but
      whose Stanley-like nature stood firm against the blandishments of her
      revolting tongue, drove her more and more toward a decision the seeds of
      which had, perhaps, been planted during her former stay among the breezy
      airs of Hampstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix, coming one day into his wife&rsquo;s study&mdash;for the house knew not
      the word drawing-room&mdash;found Flora, with eyebrows lifted up and
      smiling lips, listening to Sheila proclaiming the doctrine that it was
      impossible not to live &lsquo;on one&rsquo;s own.&rsquo; Nothing else&mdash;Felix learned&mdash;was
      compatible with dignity, or even with peace of mind. She had, therefore,
      taken a back room high up in a back street, in which she was going to live
      perfectly well on ten shillings a week; and, having thirty-two pounds
      saved up, she would be all right for a year, after which she would be able
      to earn her living. The principle she purposed to keep before her eyes was
      that of committing herself to nothing which would seriously interfere with
      her work in life. Somehow, it was impossible to look at this girl, with
      her glowing cheeks and her glowing eyes, and her hair frizzy from ardor,
      and to distrust her utterances. Yes! She would arrive, if not where she
      wanted, at all events somewhere; which, after all, was the great thing.
      And in fact she did arrive the very next day in the back room high up in
      the back street, and neither Tod&rsquo;s cottage nor the house on the Spaniard&rsquo;s
      Road saw more than flying gleams of her, thenceforth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another by-product, this, of that little starting episode, the notice
      given to Tryst! Strange how in life one little incident, one little piece
      of living stress, can attract and gather round it the feelings, thoughts,
      actions of people whose lives run far and wide away therefrom. But
      episodes are thus potent only when charged with a significance that comes
      from the clash of the deepest instincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the six weeks which had elapsed between his return home from
      Joyfields and the assizes, Felix had much leisure to reflect that if Lady
      Malloring had not caused Tryst to be warned that he could not marry his
      deceased wife&rsquo;s sister and continue to stay on the estate&mdash;the lives
      of Felix himself, his daughter, mother, brother, brother&rsquo;s wife, their son
      and daughter, and in less degree of his other brothers, would have been
      free of a preoccupation little short of ludicrous in proportion to the
      face value of the cause. But he had leisure, too, to reflect that in
      reality the issue involved in that tiny episode concerned human existence
      to its depths&mdash;for, what was it but the simple, all-important
      question of human freedom? The simple, all-important issue of how far men
      and women should try to rule the lives of others instead of trying only to
      rule their own, and how far those others should allow their lives to be so
      ruled? This it was which gave that episode its power of attracting and
      affecting the thoughts, feelings, actions of so many people otherwise
      remote. And though Felix was paternal enough to say to himself nearly all
      the time, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t let Nedda get further into this mess!&rsquo; he was
      philosopher enough to tell himself, in the unfatherly balance of his
      hours, that the mess was caused by the fight best of all worth fighting&mdash;of
      democracy against autocracy, of a man&rsquo;s right to do as he likes with his
      life if he harms not others; of &lsquo;the Land&rsquo; against the fetterers of &lsquo;the
      Land.&rsquo; And he was artist enough to see how from that little starting
      episode the whole business had sprung&mdash;given, of course, the entrance
      of the wilful force called love. But a father, especially when he has been
      thoroughly alarmed, gives the artist and philosopher in him short shrift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nedda came home soon after Sheila went, and to the eyes of Felix she came
      back too old and thoughtful altogether. How different a girl from the
      Nedda who had so wanted &lsquo;to know everything&rsquo; that first night of May! What
      was she brooding over, what planning, in that dark, round, pretty head? At
      what resolve were those clear eyes so swiftly raised to look? What was
      going on within, when her breast heaved so, without seeming cause, and the
      color rushed up in her cheeks at a word, as though she had been so far
      away that the effort of recall was alone enough to set all her veins
      throbbing. And yet Felix could devise no means of attack on her
      infatuation. For a man cannot cultivate the habit of never interfering and
      then suddenly throw it over; least of all when the person to be interfered
      with is his pet and only daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora, not of course in the swim of those happenings at Joyflelds, could
      not be got to take the matter very seriously. In fact&mdash;beyond what
      concerned Felix himself and poetry&mdash;the matter that she did take
      seriously had yet to be discovered. Hers was one of those semi-detached
      natures particularly found in Hampstead. When exhorted to help tackle the
      question, she could only suggest that Felix should take them all abroad
      when he had finished &lsquo;The Last of the Laborers.&rsquo; A tour, for instance, in
      Norway and Sweden, where none of them had ever been, and perhaps down
      through Finland into Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling like one who squirts on a burning haystack with a garden syringe,
      Felix propounded this scheme to his little daughter. She received it with
      a start, a silence, a sort of quivering all over, as of an animal who
      scents danger. She wanted to know when, and being told&mdash;&lsquo;not before
      the middle of August&rsquo;, relapsed into her preoccupation as if nothing had
      been said. Felix noted on the hall table one afternoon a letter in her
      handwriting, addressed to a Worcester newspaper, and remarked thereafter
      that she began to receive this journal daily, obviously with a view to
      reports of the coming assizes. Once he tried to break through into her
      confidence. It was August Bank Holiday, and they had gone out on to the
      heath together to see the people wonderfully assembled. Coming back across
      the burnt-up grass, strewn with paper bags, banana peel, and the cores of
      apples, he hooked his hand into her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done with a child that goes about all day thinking and
      thinking and not telling anybody what she is thinking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled round at him and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Dad. She IS a pig, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This comparison with an animal of proverbial stubbornness was not
      encouraging. Then his hand was squeezed to her side and he heard her
      murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if all daughters are such beasts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He understood well that she had meant: &lsquo;There is only one thing I want&mdash;one
      thing I mean to have&mdash;one thing in the world for me now!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he said soberly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t expect anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Daddy!&rdquo; she answered, but nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only four days later she came to his study with a letter, and a face so
      flushed and troubled that he dropped his pen and got up in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read this, Dad! It&rsquo;s impossible! It&rsquo;s not true! It&rsquo;s terrible! Oh! What
      am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter ran thus, in a straight, boyish handwriting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ROYAL CHARLES HOSTEL,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WORCESTER, Aug. 7th.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY NEDDA,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just seen Bob tried. They have given him three years&rsquo; penal. It
      was awful to sit there and watch him. He can never stand it. It was awful
      to watch him looking at ME. It&rsquo;s no good. I&rsquo;m going to give myself up. I
      must do it. I&rsquo;ve got everything ready; they&rsquo;ll have to believe me and
      squash his sentence. You see, but for me it would never have been done.
      It&rsquo;s a matter of honour. I can&rsquo;t let him suffer any more. This isn&rsquo;t
      impulse. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do it for some time, if they found him
      guilty. So in a way, it&rsquo;s an immense relief. I&rsquo;d like to have seen you
      first, but it would only distress you, and I might not have been able to
      go through with it after. Nedda, darling, if you still love me when I get
      out, we&rsquo;ll go to New Zealand, away from this country where they bully poor
      creatures like Bob. Be brave! I&rsquo;ll write to-morrow, if they let me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Derek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first sensation in Felix on reading this effusion was poignant
      recollection of the little lawyer&rsquo;s look after Derek had made the scene at
      Tryst&rsquo;s committal and of his words: &lsquo;Nothing in it, is there?&rsquo; His second
      thought: &lsquo;Is this the cutting of the knot that I&rsquo;ve been looking for?&rsquo; His
      third, which swept all else away: &lsquo;My poor little darling! What business
      has that boy to hurt her again like this!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tryst told me himself he did it, Dad! He told me when I went to see him
      in the prison. Honour doesn&rsquo;t demand what isn&rsquo;t true! Oh, Dad, help me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix was slow in getting free from the cross currents of reflection. &ldquo;He
      wrote this last night,&rdquo; he said dismally. &ldquo;He may have done it already. We
      must go and see John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda clasped her hands. &ldquo;Ah! Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Felix had not the heart to add what he was thinking: &lsquo;Not that I see
      what good he can do!&rsquo; But, though sober reason told him this, it was
      astonishingly comforting to be going to some one who could be relied on to
      see the facts of the situation without any of that &lsquo;flimflam&rsquo; with which
      imagination is accustomed to surround them. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll send Derek a wire
      for what it&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went at once to the post-office, Felix composing this message on the
      way: &lsquo;Utterly mistaken chivalry you have no right await our arrival Felix
      Freeland.&rsquo; He handed it to her to read, and passed it under the brass
      railing to the clerk, not without the feeling of shame due from one who
      uses the word chivalry in a post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way to the Tube station he held her arm tightly, but whether to
      impart courage or receive it he could not have said, so strung-up in
      spirit did he feel her. With few words exchanged they reached Whitehall.
      Marking their card &lsquo;Urgent,&rsquo; they were received within ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      John was standing in a high, white room, smelling a little of papers and
      tobacco, and garnished solely by five green chairs, a table, and a bureau
      with an immense number of pigeonholes, whereat he had obviously been
      seated. Quick to observe what concerned his little daughter, Felix noted
      how her greeting trembled up at her uncle and how a sort of warmth thawed
      for the moment the regularity of his brother&rsquo;s face. When they had taken
      two of the five green chairs and John was back at his bureau, Felix handed
      over the letter. John read it and looked at Nedda. Then taking a pipe out
      of his pocket, which he had evidently filled before they came in, he
      lighted it and re-read the letter. Then, looking very straight at Nedda,
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in it? Honour bright, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Uncle John, nothing. Only that he fancies his talk about injustice
      put it into Tryst&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John nodded; the girl&rsquo;s face was evidence enough for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any proof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tryst himself told me in the prison that he did it. He said it came on
      him suddenly, when he saw the straw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pause followed before John said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! You and I and your father will go down and see the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda lifted her hands and said breathlessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Uncle! Dad! Have I the right? He says&mdash;honour. Won&rsquo;t it be
      betraying him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix could not answer, but with relief he heard John say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not honorable to cheat the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but he trusted me or he wouldn&rsquo;t have written.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John answered slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think your duty&rsquo;s plain, my dear. The question for the police will be
      whether or not to take notice of this false confession. For us to keep the
      knowledge that it&rsquo;s false from them, under the circumstances, is clearly
      not right. Besides being, to my mind, foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Felix to watch this mortal conflict going on in the soul of his
      daughter&mdash;that soul which used to seem, perhaps even now seemed, part
      of himself; to know that she so desperately wanted help for her decision,
      and to be unable to give it, unable even to trust himself to be honest&mdash;this
      was hard for Felix. There she sat, staring before her; and only her
      tight-clasped hands, the little movements of her lips and throat, showed
      the struggle going on in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t, without seeing him; I MUST see him first, Uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John got up and went over to the window; he, too, had been affected by her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You realize,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you risk everything by that. If he&rsquo;s given
      himself up, and they&rsquo;ve believed him, he&rsquo;s not the sort to let it fall
      through. You cut off your chance if he won&rsquo;t let you tell. Better for your
      father and me to see him first, anyway.&rdquo; And Felix heard a mutter that
      sounded like: &lsquo;Confound him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nedda rose. &ldquo;Can we go at once, then, Uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a solemnity that touched Felix, John put a hand on each side of her
      face, raised it, and kissed her on the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silent trio sought Paddington in a taxi-cab, digesting this desperate
      climax of an affair that sprang from origins so small.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Felix, contemplating his daughter&rsquo;s face, there was profound
      compassion, but also that family dismay, that perturbation of self-esteem,
      which public scandal forces on kinsmen, even the most philosophic. He felt
      exasperation against Derek, against Kirsteen, almost even against Tod, for
      having acquiesced passively in the revolutionary bringing-up which had
      brought on such a disaster. War against injustice; sympathy with
      suffering; chivalry! Yes! But not quite to the point whence they recoiled
      on his daughter, his family, himself! The situation was impossible! He was
      fast resolving that, whether or no they saved Derek from this quixotry,
      the boy should not have Nedda. And already his eyes found difficulty in
      meeting hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They secured a compartment to themselves and, having settled down in
      corners, began mechanically unfolding evening journals. For after all,
      whatever happens, one must read the papers! Without that, life would
      indeed be insupportable! Felix had bought Mr. Cuthcott&rsquo;s, but, though he
      turned and turned the sheets, they seemed to have no sense till these
      words caught his eyes: &ldquo;Convict&rsquo;s tragic death! Yesterday afternoon at
      Worcester, while being conveyed from the assize court back to prison, a
      man named Tryst, sentenced to three years&rsquo; penal servitude for arson,
      suddenly attacked the warders in charge of him and escaped. He ran down
      the street, hotly pursued, and, darting out into the traffic, threw
      himself under a motor-car going at some speed. The car struck him on the
      head, and the unfortunate man was killed on the spot. No reason whatever
      can be assigned for this desperate act. He is known, however, to have
      suffered from epilepsy, and it is thought an attack may have been coming
      on him at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Felix had read these words he remained absolutely still, holding that
      buff-colored paper before his face, trying to decide what he must do now.
      What was the significance&mdash;exactly the significance of this? Now that
      Tryst was dead, Derek&rsquo;s quixotic action had no meaning. But had he already
      &lsquo;confessed&rsquo;? It seemed from this account that the suicide was directly
      after the trial; even before the boy&rsquo;s letter to Nedda had been written.
      He must surely have heard of it since and given up his mad idea! He leaned
      over, touched John on the knee, and handed him the paper. John read the
      paragraph, handed it back; and the two brothers stared fixedly at each
      other. Then Felix made the faintest movement of his head toward his
      daughter, and John nodded. Crossing to Nedda, Felix hooked his arm in hers
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just look at this, my child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda read, started to her feet, sank back, and cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor, poor man! Oh, Dad! Poor man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix felt ashamed. Though Tryst&rsquo;s death meant so much relief to her, she
      felt first this rush of compassion; he himself, to whom it meant so much
      less relief, had felt only that relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he couldn&rsquo;t stand it; he told me that. But I never thought&mdash;Oh!
      Poor man!&rdquo; And, burying her face against his arm, she gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petrified, and conscious that John at the far end of the carriage was
      breathing rather hard, Felix could only stroke her arm till at last she
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody now for Derek to save. Oh, if you&rsquo;d seen that poor man in
      prison, Dad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the only words of comfort Felix could find were:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child, there are thousands and thousands of poor prisoners and
      captives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a truce to agitation they spent the rest of that three hours&rsquo; journey,
      while the train rattled and rumbled through the quiet, happy-looking land.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was tea-time when they reached Worcester, and at once went up to the
      Royal Charles Hostel. A pretty young woman in the office there informed
      them that the young gentleman had paid his bill and gone out about ten
      o&rsquo;clock; but had left his luggage. She had not seen him come in. His room
      was up that little staircase at the end of the passage. There was another
      entrance that he might have come in at. The &lsquo;Boots&rsquo; would take them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Past the hall stuffed with furniture and decorated with the stags&rsquo; heads
      and battle-prints common to English county-town hotels, they followed the
      &lsquo;Boots&rsquo; up five red-carpeted steps, down a dingy green corridor, to a door
      at the very end. There was no answer to their knock. The dark little room,
      with striped walls, and more battle-prints, looked out on a side street
      and smelled dusty. On a shiny leather sofa an old valise, strapped-up
      ready for departure, was reposing with Felix&rsquo;s telegram, unopened,
      deposited thereon. Writing on his card, &ldquo;Have come down with Nedda. F.
      F.,&rdquo; and laying it on the telegram, in case Derek should come in by the
      side entrance, Felix and Nedda rejoined John in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      To wait in anxiety is perhaps the hardest thing in life; tea, tobacco, and
      hot baths perhaps the only anodynes. These, except the baths, they took.
      Without knowing what had happened, neither John nor Felix liked to make
      inquiry at the police station, nor did they care to try and glean
      knowledge from the hotel people by questions that might lead to gossip.
      They could but kick their heels till it became reasonably certain that
      Derek was not coming back. The enforced waiting increased Felix&rsquo;s
      exasperation. Everything Derek did seemed designed to cause Nedda pain. To
      watch her sitting there, trying resolutely to mask her anxiety, became
      intolerable. At last he got up and said to John:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better go round there,&rdquo; and, John nodding, he added: &ldquo;Wait
      here, my child. One of us&rsquo;ll come back at once and tell you anything we
      hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave them a grateful look and the two brothers went out. They had not
      gone twenty yards when they met Derek striding along, pale, wild,
      unhappy-looking. When Felix touched him on the arm, he started and stared
      blankly at his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen about Tryst,&rdquo; Felix said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not done anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! John, tell Nedda that, and stay with her a bit. I want to talk to
      Derek. We&rsquo;ll go in the other way.&rdquo; He put his hand under the boy&rsquo;s arm and
      turned him down into the side street. When they reached the gloomy little
      bedroom Felix pointed to the telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From me. I suppose the news of his death stopped you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Derek opened the telegram, dropped it, and sat down beside his
      valise on the shiny sofa. He looked positively haggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking his stand against the chest of drawers, Felix said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have it out with you, Derek. Do you understand what all this
      means to Nedda? Do you realize how utterly unhappy you&rsquo;re making her? I
      don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;re happy yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy&rsquo;s whole figure writhed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy! When you&rsquo;ve killed some one you don&rsquo;t think much of happiness&mdash;your
      own or any one&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Startled in his turn, Felix said sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that. It&rsquo;s monomania.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek laughed. &ldquo;Bob Tryst&rsquo;s dead&mdash;through me! I can&rsquo;t get out of
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gazing at the boy&rsquo;s tortured face, Felix grasped the gruesome fact that
      this idea amounted to obsession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Derek,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve dwelt on this till you see it out of all
      proportion. If we took to ourselves the remote consequences of all our
      words we should none of us survive a week. You&rsquo;re overdone. You&rsquo;ll see it
      differently to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek got up to pace the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear I would have saved him. I tried to do it when they committed him
      at Transham.&rdquo; He looked wildly at Felix. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I? You were there; you
      heard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t let me then. I thought they mightn&rsquo;t find him guilty here&mdash;so
      I let it go on. And now he&rsquo;s dead. You don&rsquo;t know how I feel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His throat was working, and Felix said with real compassion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy! Your sense of honour is too extravagant altogether. A grown
      man like poor Tryst knew perfectly what he was doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He was like a dog&mdash;he did what he thought was expected of him. I
      never meant him to burn those ricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly! No one can blame you for a few wild words. He might have been
      the boy and you the man by the way you take it! Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek sat down again on the shiny sofa and buried his head in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get away from him. He&rsquo;s been with me all day. I see him all the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That the boy was really haunted was only too apparent. How to attack this
      mania? If one could make him feel something else! And Felix said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Derek! Before you&rsquo;ve any right to Nedda you&rsquo;ve got to find
      ballast. That&rsquo;s a matter of honour, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek flung up his head as if to escape a blow. Seeing that he had riveted
      him, Felix pressed on, with some sternness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man can&rsquo;t serve two passions. You must give up this championing the
      weak and lighting flames you can&rsquo;t control. See what it leads to! You&rsquo;ve
      got to grow and become a man. Until then I don&rsquo;t trust my daughter to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy&rsquo;s lips quivered; a flush darkened his face, ebbed, and left him
      paler than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix felt as if he had hit that face. Still, anything was better than to
      leave him under this gruesome obsession! Then, to his consternation, Derek
      stood up and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I go and see his body at the prison, perhaps he&rsquo;ll leave me alone a
      little!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catching at that, as he would have caught at anything, Felix said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Yes! Go and see the poor fellow; we&rsquo;ll come, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he went out to find Nedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time they reached the street Derek had already started, and they
      could see him going along in front. Felix racked his brains to decide
      whether he ought to prepare her for the state the boy was in. Twice he
      screwed himself up to take the plunge, but her face&mdash;puzzled, as
      though wondering at her lover&rsquo;s neglect of her&mdash;stopped him. Better
      say nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as they reached the prison she put her hand on his arm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Dad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Felix read on the corner of the prison lane those words: &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s
      Walk&rsquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Derek was waiting at the door. After some difficulty they were admitted
      and taken down the corridor where the prisoner on his knees had stared up
      at Nedda, past the courtyard where those others had been pacing out their
      living hieroglyphic, up steps to the hospital. Here, in a white-washed
      room on a narrow bed, the body of the big laborer lay, wrapped in a sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We bury him Friday, poor chap! Fine big man, too!&rdquo; And at the warder&rsquo;s
      words a shudder passed through Felix. The frozen tranquillity of that
      body!
    </p>
    <p>
      As the carved beauty of great buildings, so is the graven beauty of death,
      the unimaginable wonder of the abandoned thing lying so quiet, marvelling
      at its resemblance to what once lived! How strange this thing, still
      stamped by all that it had felt, wanted, loved, and hated, by all its
      dumb, hard, commonplace existence! This thing with the calm, pathetic look
      of one who asks of his own fled spirit: Why have you abandoned me?
    </p>
    <p>
      Death! What more wonderful than a dead body&mdash;that still perfect work
      of life, for which life has no longer use! What more mysterious than this
      sight of what still is, yet is not!
    </p>
    <p>
      Below the linen swathing the injured temples, those eyes were closed
      through which such yearning had looked forth. From that face, where the
      hair had grown faster than if it had been alive, death&rsquo;s majesty had
      planed away the aspect of brutality, removed the yearning, covering all
      with wistful acquiescence. Was his departed soul coherent? Where was it?
      Did it hover in this room, visible still to the boy? Did it stand there
      beside what was left of Tryst the laborer, that humblest of all creatures
      who dared to make revolt&mdash;serf, descendant of serfs, who, since the
      beginning, had hewn wood, drawn water, and done the will of others? Or was
      it winged, and calling in space to the souls of the oppressed?
    </p>
    <p>
      This body would go back to the earth that it had tended, the wild grass
      would grow over it, the seasons spend wind and rain forever above it. But
      that which had held this together&mdash;the inarticulate, lowly spirit,
      hardly asking itself why things should be, faithful as a dog to those who
      were kind to it, obeying the dumb instinct of a violence that in his
      betters would be called &lsquo;high spirit,&rsquo; where&mdash;Felix wondered&mdash;where
      was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      And what were they thinking&mdash;Nedda and that haunted boy&mdash;so
      motionless? Nothing showed on their faces, nothing but a sort of living
      concentration, as if they were trying desperately to pierce through and
      see whatever it was that held this thing before them in such awful
      stillness. Their first glimpse of death; their first perception of that
      terrible remoteness of the dead! No wonder they seemed to be conjured out
      of the power of thought and feeling!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nedda was first to turn away. Walking back by her side, Felix was
      surprised by her composure. The reality of death had not been to her half
      so harrowing as the news of it. She said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have seen him like that; now I shall think of him&mdash;at
      peace; not as he was that other time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek rejoined them, and they went in silence back to the hotel. But at
      the door she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me to the cathedral, Derek; I can&rsquo;t go in yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Felix&rsquo;s dismay the boy nodded, and they turned to go. Should he stop
      them? Should he go with them? What should a father do? And, with a heavy
      sigh, he did nothing but retire into the hotel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was calm, with a dark-blue sky, and a golden moon, and the lighted
      street full of people out for airing. The great cathedral, cutting the
      heavens with its massive towers, was shut. No means of getting in; and
      while they stood there looking up the thought came into Nedda&rsquo;s mind:
      Where would they bury poor Tryst who had killed himself? Would they refuse
      to bury that unhappy one in a churchyard? Surely, the more unhappy and
      desperate he was, the kinder they ought to be to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned away down into a little lane where an old, white, timbered
      cottage presided ghostly at the corner. Some church magnate had his garden
      back there; and it was quiet, along the waving line of a high wall, behind
      which grew sycamores spreading close-bunched branches, whose shadows, in
      the light of the corner lamps, lay thick along the ground this glamourous
      August night. A chafer buzzed by, a small black cat played with its tail
      on some steps in a recess. Nobody passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s heart was beating fast. Derek&rsquo;s face was so strange and
      strained. And he had not yet said one word to her. All sorts of fears and
      fancies beset her till she was trembling all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t stopped
      loving me, Derek?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one could stop loving you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, then? Are you thinking of poor Tryst?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a catch in his throat and a sort of choked laugh he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all over. He&rsquo;s at peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; Then, in a queer, dead voice, he added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Nedda. It&rsquo;s
      beastly for you. But I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What couldn&rsquo;t he help? Why did he keep her suffering like this&mdash;not
      telling her? What was this something that seemed so terribly between them?
      She walked on silently at his side, conscious of the rustling of the
      sycamores, of the moonlit angle of the church magnate&rsquo;s house, of the
      silence in the lane, and the gliding of their own shadows along the wall.
      What was this in his face, his thoughts, that she could not reach! And she
      cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me! Oh, tell me, Derek! I can go through anything with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get rid of him, that&rsquo;s all. I thought he&rsquo;d go when I&rsquo;d seen him
      there. But it&rsquo;s no good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Terror got hold of her then. She peered at his face&mdash;very white and
      haggard. There seemed no blood in it. They were going down-hill now, along
      the blank wall of a factory; there was the river in front, with the
      moonlight on it and boats drawn up along the bank. From a chimney a scroll
      of black smoke was flung out across the sky, and a lighted bridge glowed
      above the water. They turned away from that, passing below the dark pile
      of the cathedral. Here couples still lingered on benches along the
      river-bank, happy in the warm night, under the August moon! And on and on
      they walked in that strange, miserable silence, past all those benches and
      couples, out on the river-path by the fields, where the scent of
      hay-stacks, and the freshness from the early stubbles and the grasses
      webbed with dew, overpowered the faint reek of the river mud. And still on
      and on in the moonlight that haunted through the willows. At their
      footsteps the water-rats scuttled down into the water with tiny splashes;
      a dog barked somewhere a long way off; a train whistled; a frog croaked.
      From the stubbles and second crops of sun-baked clover puffs of warm air
      kept stealing up into the chillier air beneath the willows. Such moonlit
      nights never seem to sleep. And there was a kind of triumph in the night&rsquo;s
      smile, as though it knew that it ruled the river and the fields, ruled
      with its gleams the silent trees that had given up all rustling. Suddenly
      Derek said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s walking with us! Look! Over there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And for a second there did seem to Nedda a dim, gray shape moving square
      and dogged, parallel with them at the stubble edges. Gasping out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; don&rsquo;t frighten me! I can&rsquo;t bear it tonight!&rdquo; She hid her face
      against his shoulder like a child. He put his arm round her and she
      pressed her face deep into his coat. This ghost of Bob Tryst holding him
      away from her! This enemy! This uncanny presence! She pressed closer,
      closer, and put her face up to his. It was wonderfully lonely, silent,
      whispering, with the moongleams slipping through the willow boughs into
      the shadow where they stood. And from his arms warmth stole through her!
      Closer and closer she pressed, not quite knowing what she did, not quite
      knowing anything but that she wanted him never to let her go; wanted his
      lips on hers, so that she might feel his spirit pass, away from what was
      haunting it, into hers, never to escape. But his lips did not come to
      hers. They stayed drawn back, trembling, hungry-looking, just above her
      lips. And she whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt him shudder in her arms, saw his eyes darken, his lips quiver and
      quiver, as if he wanted them to, but they would not. What was it? Oh, what
      was it? Wasn&rsquo;t he going to kiss her&mdash;not to kiss her? And while in
      that unnatural pause they stood, their heads bent back among the
      moongleams and those willow shadows, there passed through Nedda such
      strange trouble as she had never known. Not kiss her! Not kiss her! Why
      didn&rsquo;t he? When in her blood and in the night all round, in the feel of
      his arms, the sight of his hungry lips, was something unknown, wonderful,
      terrifying, sweet! And she wailed out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;I want you!&rdquo; She felt him sway, reel,
      and clutch her as if he were going to fall, and all other feeling vanished
      in the instinct of the nurse she had already been to him. He was ill
      again! Yes, he was ill! And she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Derek&mdash;don&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s all right. Let&rsquo;s walk on quietly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She got his arm tightly in hers and drew him along toward home. By the
      jerking of that arm, the taut look on his face, she could feel that he did
      not know from step to step whether he could stay upright. But she herself
      was steady and calm enough, bent on keeping emotion away, and somehow
      getting him back along the river-path, abandoned now to the moon and the
      bright, still spaces of the night and the slow-moving, whitened water. Why
      had she not felt from the first that he was overwrought and only fit for
      bed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, very slowly, they made their way up by the factory again into the
      lane by the church magnate&rsquo;s garden, under the branches of the sycamores,
      past the same white-faced old house at the corner, to the high street
      where some few people were still abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the front door of the hotel stood Felix, looking at his watch,
      disconsolate as an old hen. To her great relief he went in quickly when he
      saw them coming. She could not bear the thought of talk and explanation.
      The one thing was to get Derek to bed. All the time he had gone along with
      that taut face; and now, when he sat down on the shiny sofa in the little
      bedroom, he shivered so violently that his teeth chattered. She rang for a
      hot bottle and brandy and hot water. When he had drunk he certainly
      shivered less, professed himself all right, and would not let her stay.
      She dared not ask, but it did seem as if the physical collapse had driven
      away, for the time at all events, that ghostly visitor, and, touching his
      forehead with her lips&mdash;very motherly&mdash;so that he looked up and
      smiled at her&mdash;she said in a matter-of-fact voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back after a bit and tuck you up,&rdquo; and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix was waiting in the hall, at a little table on which stood a bowl of
      bread and milk. He took the cover off it for her without a word. And while
      she supped he kept glancing at her, trying to make up his mind to words.
      But her face was sealed. And all he said was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle&rsquo;s gone to Becket for the night. I&rsquo;ve got you a room next mine,
      and a tooth-brush, and some sort of comb. I hope you&rsquo;ll be able to manage,
      my child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda left him at the door of his room and went into her own. After
      waiting there ten minutes she stole out again. It was all quiet, and she
      went resolutely back down the stairs. She did not care who saw her or what
      they thought. Probably they took her for Derek&rsquo;s sister; but even if they
      didn&rsquo;t she would not have cared. It was past eleven, the light nearly out,
      and the hall in the condition of such places that await a morning&rsquo;s
      renovation. His corridor, too, was quite dark. She opened the door without
      sound and listened, till his voice said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, little angel; I&rsquo;m not asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And by a glimmer of moonlight, through curtains designed to keep out
      nothing, she stole up to the bed. She could just see his face, and eyes
      looking up at her with a sort of adoration. She put her hand on his
      forehead and whispered: &ldquo;Are you comfy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He murmured back: &ldquo;Yes, quite comfy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kneeling down, she laid her face beside his on the pillow. She could not
      help doing that; it made everything seem holy, cuddley, warm. His lips
      touched her nose. Her eyes, for just that instant, looked up into his,
      that were very dark and soft; then she got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like me to stay till you&rsquo;re asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; forever. But I shouldn&rsquo;t exactly sleep. Would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness Nedda vehemently shook her head. Sleep! No! She would not
      sleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, little dark angel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; With that last whisper she slipped back to the door and
      noiselessly away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was long before she closed her eyes, spending the hours in fancy where
      still less she would have slept. But when she did drop off she dreamed
      that he and she were alone upon a star, where all the trees were white,
      the water, grass, birds, everything, white, and they were walking arm in
      arm, among white flowers. And just as she had stooped to pick one&mdash;it
      was no flower, but&mdash;Tryst&rsquo;s white-banded face! She woke with a little
      cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dressed by eight and went at once to Derek&rsquo;s room. There was no
      answer to her knock, and in a flutter of fear she opened the door. He had
      gone&mdash;packed, and gone. She ran back to the hall. There was a note
      for her in the office, and she took it out of sight to read. It said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came back this morning. I&rsquo;m going home by the first train. He seems to
      want me to do something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEREK.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Came back! That thing&mdash;that gray thing that she, too, had seemed to
      see for a moment in the fields beside the river! And he was suffering
      again as he had suffered yesterday! It was awful. She waited miserably
      till her father came down. To find that he, too, knew of this trouble was
      some relief. He made no objection when she begged that they should follow
      on to Joyfields. Directly after breakfast they set out. Once on her way to
      Derek again, she did not feel so frightened. But in the train she sat very
      still, gazing at her lap, and only once glanced up from under those long
      lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you understand it, Dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix, not much happier than she, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man had something queer about him. Besides Derek&rsquo;s been ill, don&rsquo;t
      forget that. But it&rsquo;s too bad for you, Nedda. I don&rsquo;t like it; I don&rsquo;t
      like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be parted from him, Dad. That&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix was silenced by the vigor of those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His mother can help, perhaps,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! If his mother would help&mdash;send him away from the laborers, and
      all this!
    </p>
    <p>
      Up from the station they took the field paths, which cut off quite a mile.
      The grass and woods were shining brightly, peacefully in the sun; it
      seemed incredible that there should be heartburnings about a land so
      smiling, that wrongs and miseries should haunt those who lived and worked
      in these bright fields. Surely in this earthly paradise the dwellers were
      enviable, well-nourished souls, sleek and happy as the pied cattle that
      lifted their inquisitive muzzles! Nedda tried to stroke the nose of one&mdash;grayish,
      blunt, moist. But the creature backed away from her hand, snuffling, and
      its cynical, soft eyes with chestnut lashes seemed warning the girl that
      she belonged to the breed that might be trusted to annoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last fields before the Joyfields crossroads they came up with a
      little, square, tow-headed man, without coat or cap, who had just driven
      some cattle in and was returning with his dog, at a &lsquo;dot-here dot-there&rsquo;
      walk, as though still driving them. He gave them a look rather like that
      of the bullock Nedda had tried to stroke. She knew he must be one of the
      Malloring men, and longed to ask him questions; but he, too, looked shy
      and distrustful, as if he suspected that they wanted something out of him.
      She summoned up courage, however, to say: &ldquo;Did you see about poor Bob
      Tryst?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;eard tell. &lsquo;E didn&rsquo; like prison. They say prison takes the &lsquo;eart out
      of you. &lsquo;E didn&rsquo; think o&rsquo; that.&rdquo; And the smile that twisted the little
      man&rsquo;s lips seemed to Nedda strange and cruel, as if he actually found
      pleasure in the fate of his fellow. All she could find to answer was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a good dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man looked down at the dog trotting alongside with drooped
      tail, and shook his head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;E&rsquo;s no good wi&rsquo; beasts&mdash;won&rsquo;t touch &lsquo;em!&rdquo; Then, looking up
      sidelong, he added surprisingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mast&rsquo; Freeland &lsquo;e got a crack on the head, though!&rdquo; Again there was that
      satisfied resentment in his voice and the little smile twisting his lips.
      Nedda felt more lost than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted at the crossroads and saw him looking back at them as they
      went up the steps to the wicket gate. Amongst a patch of early sunflowers,
      Tod, in shirt and trousers, was surrounded by his dog and the three small
      Trysts, all apparently engaged in studying the biggest of the sunflowers,
      where a peacock-butterfly and a bee were feeding, one on a gold petal, the
      other on the black heart. Nedda went quickly up to them and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Derek come, Uncle Tod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tod raised his eyes. He did not seem in the least surprised to see her, as
      if his sky were in the habit of dropping his relatives at ten in the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone out again,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nedda made a sign toward the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard, Uncle Tod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tod nodded and his blue eyes, staring above the children&rsquo;s heads,
      darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Granny still here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Tod nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Felix in the garden, Nedda stole upstairs and tapped on Frances
      Freeland&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, whose stoicism permitted her the one luxury of never coming down to
      breakfast, had just made it for herself over a little spirit-lamp. She
      greeted Nedda with lifted eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my darling! Where HAVE you come from? You must have my nice cocoa!
      Isn&rsquo;t this the most perfect lamp you ever saw? Did you ever see such a
      flame? Watch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She touched the spirit-lamp and what there was of flame died out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, isn&rsquo;t that provoking? It&rsquo;s really a splendid thing, quite a new
      kind. I mean to get you one. Now, drink your cocoa; it&rsquo;s beautifully hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had breakfast, Granny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland gazed at her doubtfully, then, as a last resource, began
      to sip the cocoa, of which, in truth, she was badly in want.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granny, will you help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, darling. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do so want Derek to forget all about this terrible business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland, who had unscrewed the top of a little canister,
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, I quite agree. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s best for him. Open your mouth and
      let me pop in one of these delicious little plasmon biscuits. They&rsquo;re
      perfect after travelling. Only,&rdquo; she added wistfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he won&rsquo;t
      pay any attention to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you could speak to Aunt Kirsteen; it&rsquo;s for her to stop him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of her most pathetic smiles came over Frances Freeland&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I could speak to her. But, you see, I don&rsquo;t count for anything. One
      doesn&rsquo;t when one gets old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Granny, you do! You count for a lot; every one admires you so. You
      always seem to have something that&mdash;that other people haven&rsquo;t got.
      And you&rsquo;re not a bit old in spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland was fingering her rings; she slipped one off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no good thinking about that, is it? I&rsquo;ve wanted to
      give you this for ages, darling; it IS so uncomfortable on my finger. Now,
      just let me see if I can pop it on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda recoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Granny!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You ARE&mdash;!&rdquo; and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still no one in the kitchen, and she sat down to wait for her
      aunt to finish her up-stairs duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen came down at last, in her inevitable blue dress, betraying her
      surprise at this sudden appearance of her niece only by a little quivering
      of her brows. And, trembling with nervousness, Nedda took her plunge,
      pouring out the whole story&mdash;of Derek&rsquo;s letter; their journey down;
      her father&rsquo;s talk with him; the visit to Tryst&rsquo;s body; their walk by the
      river; and of how haunted and miserable he was. Showing the little note he
      had left that morning, she clasped her hands and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Aunt Kirsteen, make him happy again! Stop that awful haunting and
      keep him from all this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen had listened, with one foot on the hearth in her favorite
      attitude. When the girl had finished she said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a witch, Nedda!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it wasn&rsquo;t for you he would never have started. And now that poor
      Tryst&rsquo;s dead he would leave it alone. I&rsquo;m sure only you can make him lose
      that haunted feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Nedda!&rdquo; she said slowly, as though weighing each word. &ldquo;I should
      like you to understand. There&rsquo;s a superstition in this country that people
      are free. Ever since I was a girl your age I&rsquo;ve known that they are not;
      no one is free here who can&rsquo;t pay for freedom. It&rsquo;s one thing to see,
      another to feel this with your whole being. When, like me, you have an
      open wound, which something is always inflaming, you can&rsquo;t wonder, can
      you, that fever escapes into the air. Derek may have caught the infection
      of my fever&mdash;that&rsquo;s all! But I shall never lose that fever, Nedda&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Aunt Kirsteen, this haunting is dreadful. I can&rsquo;t bear to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, Derek is very highly strung, and he&rsquo;s been ill. It&rsquo;s in my
      family to see things. That&rsquo;ll go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda said passionately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;ll ever lose it while he goes on here, tearing his
      heart out. And they&rsquo;re trying to get me away from him. I know they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen turned; her eyes seemed to blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They? Ah! Yes! You&rsquo;ll have to fight if you want to marry a rebel, Nedda!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda put her hands to her forehead, bewildered. &ldquo;You see, Nedda,
      rebellion never ceases. It&rsquo;s not only against this or that injustice, it&rsquo;s
      against all force and wealth that takes advantage of its force and wealth.
      That rebellion goes on forever. Think well before you join in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda turned away. Of what use to tell her to think when &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t be parted from him!&rsquo; kept every other thought paralyzed. And she
      pressed her forehead against the cross-bar of the window, trying to find
      better words to make her appeal again. Out there above the orchard the sky
      was blue, and everything light and gay, as the very butterflies that
      wavered past. A motor-car seemed to have stopped in the road close by; its
      whirring and whizzing was clearly audible, mingled with the cooings of
      pigeons and a robin&rsquo;s song. And suddenly she heard her aunt say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have your chance, Nedda! Here they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda turned. There in the doorway were her Uncles John and Stanley coming
      in, followed by her father and Uncle Tod.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did this mean? What had they come for? And, disturbed to the heart,
      she gazed from one to the other. They had that curious look of people not
      quite knowing what their reception will be like, yet with something
      resolute, almost portentous, in their mien. She saw John go up to her aunt
      and hold out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say Felix and Nedda have told you about yesterday,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Stanley and I thought it best to come over.&rdquo; Kirsteen answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tod, will you tell Mother who&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then none of them seemed to know quite what to say, or where to look, till
      Frances Freeland, her face all pleased and anxious, came in. When she had
      kissed them they all sat down. And Nedda, at the window, squeezed her
      hands tight together in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come about Derek,&rdquo; John said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; broke in Stanley. &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, Kirsteen, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have
      any more of this! Just think what would have happened yesterday if that
      poor fellow hadn&rsquo;t providentially gone off the hooks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Providentially!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was. You see to what lengths Derek was prepared to go. Hang it
      all! We shouldn&rsquo;t have been exactly proud of a felon in the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Freeland, who had been lacing and unlacing her fingers, suddenly
      fixed her eyes on Kirsteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand very well, darling, but I am sure that whatever dear
      John says will be wise and right. You must remember that he is the eldest
      and has a great deal of experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen bent her head. If there was irony in the gesture, it was not
      perceived by Frances Freeland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be right for dear Derek, or any gentleman, to go against the law
      of the land or be mixed up with wrong-doing in any way. I haven&rsquo;t said
      anything, but I HAVE felt it very much. Because&mdash;it&rsquo;s all been not
      quite nice, has it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda saw her father wince. Then Stanley broke in again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that the whole thing&rsquo;s done with, do, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, let&rsquo;s have a
      little peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment her aunt&rsquo;s face seemed wonderful to Nedda; so quiet, yet so
      burningly alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace! There is no peace in this world. There is death, but no peace!&rdquo;
       And, moving nearer to Tod, she rested her hand on his shoulder, looking,
      as it seemed to Nedda, at something far away, till John said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hardly the point, is it? We should be awfully glad to know that
      there&rsquo;ll be no more trouble. All this has been very worrying. And now the
      cause seems to be&mdash;removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was always a touch of finality in John&rsquo;s voice. Nedda saw that all
      had turned to Kirsteen for her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If those up and down the land who profess belief in liberty will cease to
      filch from the helpless the very crust of it, the cause will be removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is to say&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At those words from Felix, Frances Freeland, gazing first at him and then
      at Kirsteen, said in a pained voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ought to talk like that, Kirsteen, dear. Nobody who&rsquo;s
      at all nice means to be unkind. We&rsquo;re all forgetful sometimes. I know I
      often forget to be sympathetic. It vexes me dreadfully!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, don&rsquo;t defend tyranny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s often from the best motives, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So is rebellion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t understand about that, darling. But I do think, with dear
      John, it&rsquo;s a great pity. It will be a dreadful drawback to Derek if he has
      to look back on something that he regrets when he&rsquo;s older. It&rsquo;s always
      best to smile and try to look on the bright side of things and not be
      grumbly-grumbly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that little speech of Frances Freeland&rsquo;s there was a silence that
      Nedda thought would last forever, till her aunt, pressing close to Tod&rsquo;s
      shoulder, spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want me to stop Derek. I tell you all what I&rsquo;ve just told Nedda. I
      don&rsquo;t attempt to control Derek; I never have. For myself, when I see a
      thing I hate I can&rsquo;t help fighting against it. I shall never be able to
      help that. I understand how you must dislike all this; I know it must be
      painful to you, Mother. But while there is tyranny in this land, to
      laborers, women, animals, anything weak and helpless, so long will there
      be rebellion against it, and things will happen that will disturb you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Nedda saw her father wince. But Frances Freeland, bending forward,
      fixed her eyes piercingly on Kirsteen&rsquo;s neck, as if she were noticing
      something there more important than that about tyranny!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then John said very gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to think that we approve of such things being done to the
      helpless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that you disapprove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the masterly inactivity,&rdquo; Felix said suddenly, in a voice more
      bitter than Nedda had ever heard from him, &ldquo;of authority, money, culture,
      and philosophy. With the disapproval that lifts no finger&mdash;winking at
      tyrannies lest worse befall us. Yes, WE&mdash;brethren&mdash;we&mdash;and
      so we shall go on doing. Quite right, Kirsteen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The world is changing, Felix, changing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Nedda had started up. There at the door was Derek.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Derek, who had slept the sleep of the dead, having had none for two
      nights, woke thinking of Nedda hovering above him in the dark; of her face
      laid down beside him on the pillow. And then, suddenly, up started that
      thing, and stood there, haunting him! Why did it come? What did it want of
      him? After writing the little note to Nedda, he hurried to the station and
      found a train about to start. To see and talk with the laborers; to do
      something, anything to prove that this tragic companion had no real
      existence! He went first to the Gaunts&rsquo; cottage. The door, there, was
      opened by the rogue-girl, comely and robust as ever, in a linen frock,
      with her sleeves rolled up, and smiling broadly at his astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Mr. Derek; I&rsquo;m only here for the week-end, just to tiddy
      up a bit. &lsquo;Tis all right in London. I wouldn&rsquo;t come back here, I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;not
      if you was to give me&mdash;&rdquo; and she pouted her red lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your father, Wilmet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over in Willey&rsquo;s Copse cuttin&rsquo; stakes. I hear you&rsquo;ve been ill, Mr. Derek.
      You do look pale. Were you very bad?&rdquo; And her eyes opened as though the
      very thought of illness was difficult for her to grasp. &ldquo;I saw your young
      lady up in London. She&rsquo;s very pretty. Wish you happiness, Mr. Derek.
      Grandfather, here&rsquo;s Mr. Derek!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of old Gaunt, carved, cynical, yellow, appeared above her
      shoulder. There he stood, silent, giving Derek no greeting. And with a
      sudden miserable feeling the boy said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and find him. Good-by, Wilmet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Derek. &lsquo;Tis quiet enough here now; there&rsquo;s changes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her rogue face twinkled again, and, turning her chin, she rubbed it on her
      plump shoulder, as might a heifer, while from behind her Grandfather
      Gaunt&rsquo;s face looked out with a faint, sardonic grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Derek, hurrying on to Willey&rsquo;s Copse, caught sight, along a far hedge, of
      the big dark laborer, Tulley, who had been his chief lieutenant in the
      fighting; but, whether the man heard his hail or no, he continued along
      the hedgeside without response and vanished over a stile. The field dipped
      sharply to a stream, and at the crossing Derek came suddenly on the little
      &lsquo;dot-here dot-there&rsquo; cowherd, who, at Derek&rsquo;s greeting, gave him an abrupt
      &ldquo;Good day!&rdquo; and went on with his occupation of mending a hurdle. Again
      that miserable feeling beset the boy, and he hastened on. A sound of
      chopping guided him. Near the edge of the coppice Tom Gaunt was lopping at
      some bushes. At sight of Derek he stopped and stood waiting, his
      loquacious face expressionless, his little, hard eye cocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Tom. It&rsquo;s ages since I saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, &lsquo;tis a proper long time! You &lsquo;ad a knock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek winced; it was said as if he had been disabled in an affair in which
      Gaunt had neither part nor parcel. Then, with a great effort, the boy
      brought out his question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard about poor Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yaas; &lsquo;tis the end of HIM.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some meaning behind those words, the unsmiling twist of that hard-bitten
      face, the absence of the &lsquo;sir&rsquo; that even Tom Gaunt generally gave him, all
      seemed part of an attack. And, feeling as if his heart were being
      squeezed, Derek looked straight into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter! I don&rsquo; know as there&rsquo;s anything the matter, ezactly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I done? Tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom Gaunt smiled; his little, gray eyes met Derek&rsquo;s full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t for a gentleman to be held responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; Derek cried passionately. &ldquo;What is it? D&rsquo;you think I deserted you,
      or what? Speak out, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abating nothing of his stare and drawl, Gaunt answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deserted? Oh, dear no! Us can&rsquo;t afford to do no more dyin&rsquo; for you&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me! Dying! My God! D&rsquo;you think I wouldn&rsquo;t have&mdash;? Oh! Confound
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye! Confounded us you &lsquo;ave! Hope you&rsquo;re satisfied!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pale as death and quivering all over, Derek answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think I&rsquo;ve just been frying fish of my own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom Gaunt, emitted a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve fried no fish at all. That&rsquo;s what I think. And no one else
      does, neither, if you want to know&mdash;except poor Bob. You&rsquo;ve fried his
      fish, sure enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stung to the heart, the boy stood motionless. A pigeon was cooing; the
      sappy scent from the lopped bushes filled all the sun-warmed air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thanks, Tom; I&rsquo;m glad to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without moving a muscle, Tom Gaunt answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it!&rdquo; and resumed his lopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Derek turned and walked out of the little wood. But when he had put a
      field between him and the sound of Gaunt&rsquo;s bill-hook, he lay down and
      buried his face in the grass, chewing at its green blades, scarce dry of
      dew, and with its juicy sweetness tasting the full of bitterness. And the
      gray shade stalked out again, and stood there in the warmth of the August
      day, with its scent and murmur of full summer, while the pigeons cooed and
      dandelion fluff drifted by....
    </p>
    <p>
      When, two hours later, he entered the kitchen at home, of the company
      assembled Frances Freeland alone retained equanimity enough to put up her
      face to be kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so thankful you&rsquo;ve come back in time to see your uncles, darling.
      Your Uncle John thinks, and we all agree, that to encourage those poor
      laborers to do things which are not nice is&mdash;is&mdash;you know what I
      mean, darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek gave a bitter little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Criminal, Granny! Yes, and puppyish! I&rsquo;ve learned all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of his voice was utterly unlike his own, and Kirsteen, starting
      forward, put her arm round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Mother. They&rsquo;ve chucked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, when all, save his mother, wanted so to express their
      satisfaction, Frances Freeland alone succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad, darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then John rose and, holding out his hand to his nephew, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the end of the trouble, then, Derek?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And I beg your pardon, Uncle John; and all&mdash;Uncle Stanley,
      Uncle Felix; you, Dad; Granny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had all risen now. The boy&rsquo;s face gave them&mdash;even John, even
      Stanley&mdash;a choke in the throat. Frances Freeland suddenly took their
      arms and went to the door; her other two sons followed. And quietly they
      all went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Derek, who had stayed perfectly still, staring past Nedda into a corner of
      the room, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him what he wants, Mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda smothered down a cry. But Kirsteen, tightening her clasp of him and
      looking steadily into that corner, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, my boy. He&rsquo;s quite friendly. He only wants to be with you for a
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t do anything for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he wouldn&rsquo;t, Mother. I can&rsquo;t be more sorry than I have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirsteen&rsquo;s face quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, it will go quite soon. Love Nedda! See! She wants you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derek answered in the same quiet voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Nedda is the comfort. Mother, I want to go away&mdash;away out of
      England&mdash;right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nedda rushed and flung her arms round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, Derek; I, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening Felix came out to the old &lsquo;fly,&rsquo; waiting to take him from
      Joyfields to Becket. What a sky! All over its pale blue a far-up wind had
      drifted long, rosy clouds, and through one of them the half-moon peered,
      of a cheese-green hue; and, framed and barred by the elm-trees, like some
      roseate, stained-glass window, the sunset blazed. In a corner of the
      orchard a little bonfire had been lighted, and round it he could see the
      three small Trysts dropping armfuls of leaves and pointing at the flames
      leaping out of the smoulder. There, too, was Tod&rsquo;s big figure, motionless,
      and his dog sitting on its haunches, with head poked forward, staring at
      those red tongues of flame. Kirsteen had come with him to the wicket gate.
      He held her hand long in his own and pressed it hard. And while that blue
      figure, turned to the sunset, was still visible, he screwed himself back
      to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been in painful conclave, as it seemed to Felix, all day, coming
      to the decision that those two young things should have their wish, marry,
      and go out to New Zealand. The ranch of Cousin Alick Morton (son of that
      brother of Frances Freeland, who, absorbed in horses, had wandered to
      Australia and died in falling from them) had extended a welcome to Derek.
      Those two would have a voyage of happiness&mdash;see together the red
      sunsets in the Mediterranean, Pompeii, and the dark ants of men swarming
      in endless band up and down with their coal-sacks at Port Said; smell the
      cinnamon gardens of Colombo; sit up on deck at night and watch the
      stars.... Who could grudge it them? Out there youth and energy would run
      unchecked. For here youth had been beaten!
    </p>
    <p>
      On and on the old &lsquo;fly&rsquo; rumbled between the shadowy fields. &lsquo;The world is
      changing, Felix&mdash;changing!&rsquo; Was that defeat of youth, then, nothing?
      Under the crust of authority and wealth, culture and philosophy&mdash;was
      the world really changing; was liberty truly astir, under that sky in the
      west all blood; and man rising at long last from his knees before the God
      of force? The silent, empty fields darkened, the air gathered dewy
      thickness, and the old &lsquo;fly&rsquo; rumbled and rolled as slow as fate. Cottage
      lamps were already lighted for the evening meal. No laborer abroad at this
      hour! And Felix thought of Tryst, the tragic fellow&mdash;the moving,
      lonely figure; emanation of these solitary fields, shade of the departing
      land! One might well see him as that boy saw him, silent, dogged, in a
      gray light such as this now clinging above the hedgerows and the grass!
    </p>
    <p>
      The old &lsquo;fly&rsquo; turned into the Becket drive. It had grown dark now, save
      for the half-moon; the last chafer was booming by, and a bat flitting, a
      little, blind, eager bat, through the quiet trees. He got out to walk the
      last few hundred yards. A lovely night, silent below her stars&mdash;cool
      and dark, spread above field after field, wood on wood, for hundreds of
      miles on every side. Night covering his native land. The same silence had
      reigned out there, the same perfume stolen up, the same star-shine fallen,
      for millions of years in the past, and would for millions of years to
      come. Close to where the half-moon floated, a slow, narrow, white cloud
      was passing&mdash;curiously shaped. At one end of it Felix could see
      distinctly the form of a gleaming skull, with dark sky showing through its
      eyeholes, cheeks, and mouth. A queer phenomenon; fascinating, rather
      ghastly! It grew sharper in outline, more distinct. One of those sudden
      shudders, that seize men from the crown of the head to the very heels,
      passed down his back. He shut his eyes. And, instead, there came up before
      him Kirsteen&rsquo;s blue-clothed figure turned to the sunset glow. Ah! Better
      to see that than this skull above the land! Better to believe her words:
      &lsquo;The world is changing, Felix&mdash;changing!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
