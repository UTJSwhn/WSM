    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Each man born into the world is born like Shelton in this book&mdash;to go
      a journey, and for the most part he is born on the high road. At first he
      sits there in the dust, with his little chubby hands reaching at nothing,
      and his little solemn eyes staring into space. As soon as he can toddle,
      he moves, by the queer instinct we call the love of life, straight along
      this road, looking neither to the right nor left, so pleased is he to
      walk. And he is charmed with everything&mdash;with the nice flat road, all
      broad and white, with his own feet, and with the prospect he can see on
      either hand. The sun shines, and he finds the road a little hot and dusty;
      the rain falls, and he splashes through the muddy puddles. It makes no
      matter&mdash;all is pleasant; his fathers went this way before him; they
      made this road for him to tread, and, when they bred him, passed into his
      fibre the love of doing things as they themselves had done them. So he
      walks on and on, resting comfortably at nights under the roofs that have
      been raised to shelter him, by those who went before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly one day, without intending to, he notices a path or opening in
      the hedge, leading to right or left, and he stands, looking at the
      undiscovered. After that he stops at all the openings in the hedge; one
      day, with a beating heart, he tries one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is where the fun begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of ten of him that try the narrow path, nine of him come back to the
      broad road, and, when they pass the next gap in the hedge, they say:
      &ldquo;No, no, my friend, I found you pleasant for a while, but after
      that-ah! after that! The way my fathers went is good enough for me, and it
      is obviously the proper one; for nine of me came back, and that poor silly
      tenth&mdash;I really pity him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he comes to the next inn, and snuggles in his well-warmed, bed,
      he thinks of the wild waste of heather where he might have had to spend
      the night alone beneath the stars; nor does it, I think, occur to him that
      the broad road he treads all day was once a trackless heath itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the poor silly tenth is faring on. It is a windy night that he is
      travelling through a windy night, with all things new around, and nothing
      to help him but his courage. Nine times out of ten that courage fails, and
      he goes down into the bog. He has seen the undiscovered, and&mdash;like
      Ferrand in this book&mdash;the undiscovered has engulfed him; his spirit,
      tougher than the spirit of the nine that burned back to sleep in inns, was
      yet not tough enough. The tenth time he wins across, and on the traces he
      has left others follow slowly, cautiously&mdash;a new road is opened to
      mankind! A true saying goes: Whatever is, is right! And if all men from
      the world&rsquo;s beginning had said that, the world would never have
      begun&mdash;at all. Not even the protoplasmic jelly could have commenced
      its journey; there would have been no motive force to make it start.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, that other saying had to be devised before the world could set up
      business: Whatever is, is wrong! But since the Cosmic Spirit found that
      matters moved too fast if those that felt &ldquo;All things that are, are
      wrong&rdquo; equalled in number those that felt &ldquo;All things that
      are, are right,&rdquo; It solemnly devised polygamy (all, be it said, in a
      spiritual way of speaking); and to each male spirit crowing &ldquo;All
      things that are, are wrong&rdquo; It decreed nine female spirits clucking
      &ldquo;All things that are, are right.&rdquo; The Cosmic Spirit, who was
      very much an artist, knew its work, and had previously devised a quality
      called courage, and divided it in three, naming the parts spiritual,
      moral, physical. To all the male-bird spirits, but to no female
      (spiritually, not corporeally speaking), It gave courage that was
      spiritual; to nearly all, both male and female, It gave courage that was
      physical; to very many hen-bird spirits It gave moral courage too. But,
      because It knew that if all the male-bird spirits were complete, the
      proportion of male to female&mdash;one to ten&mdash;would be too great,
      and cause upheavals, It so arranged that only one in ten male-bird spirits
      should have all three kinds of courage; so that the other nine, having
      spiritual courage, but lacking either in moral or in physical, should fail
      in their extensions of the poultry-run. And having started them upon these
      lines, it left them to get along as best they might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in the subdivision of the poultry-run that we call England, the
      proportion of the others to the complete male-bird spirit, who, of course,
      is not infrequently a woman, is ninety-nine to one; and with every Island
      Pharisee, when he or she starts out in life, the interesting question
      ought to be, &ldquo;Am I that one?&rdquo; Ninety very soon find out that
      they are not, and, having found it out, lest others should discover, they
      say they are. Nine of the other ten, blinded by their spiritual courage,
      are harder to convince; but one by one they sink, still proclaiming their
      virility. The hundredth Pharisee alone sits out the play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the journey of this young man Shelton, who is surely not the
      hundredth Pharisee, is but a ragged effort to present the working of the
      truth &ldquo;All things that are, are wrong,&rdquo; upon the truth &ldquo;All
      things that are, are right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Institutions of this country, like the Institutions of all other
      countries, are but half-truths; they are the working daily clothing of the
      nation; no more the body&rsquo;s permanent dress than is a baby&rsquo;s
      frock. Slowly but surely they wear out, or are outgrown; and in their
      fashion they are always thirty years at least behind the fashions of those
      spirits who are concerned with what shall take their place. The conditions
      that dictate our education, the distribution of our property, our marriage
      laws, amusements, worship, prisons, and all other things, change
      imperceptibly from hour to hour; the moulds containing them, being
      inelastic, do not change, but hold on to the point of bursting, and then
      are hastily, often clumsily, enlarged. The ninety desiring peace and
      comfort for their spirit, the ninety of the well-warmed beds, will have it
      that the fashions need not change, that morality is fixed, that all is
      ordered and immutable, that every one will always marry, play, and worship
      in the way that they themselves are marrying, playing, worshipping. They
      have no speculation, and they hate with a deep hatred those who speculate
      with thought. This is the function they were made for. They are the dough,
      and they dislike that yeasty stuff of life which comes and works about in
      them. The Yeasty Stuff&mdash;the other ten&mdash;chafed by all things that
      are, desirous ever of new forms and moulds, hate in their turn the
      comfortable ninety. Each party has invented for the other the hardest
      names that it can think of: Philistines, Bourgeois, Mrs. Grundy, Rebels,
      Anarchists, and Ne&rsquo;er-do-weels. So we go on! And so, as each of us
      is born to go his journey, he finds himself in time ranged on one side or
      on the other, and joins the choruses of name-slingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now and then&mdash;ah! very seldom&mdash;we find ourselves so near
      that thing which has no breadth, the middle line, that we can watch them
      both, and positively smile to see the fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this book was published first, many of its critics found that Shelton
      was the only Pharisee, and a most unsatisfactory young man&mdash;and so,
      no doubt, he is. Belonging to the comfortable ninety, they felt, in fact,
      the need of slinging names at one who obviously was of the ten. Others of
      its critics, belonging to the ten, wielded their epithets upon Antonia,
      and the serried ranks behind her, and called them Pharisees; as dull as
      ditch-water&mdash;and so, I fear, they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the greatest charms of authorship is the privilege it gives the
      author of studying the secret springs of many unseen persons, of analysing
      human nature through the criticism that his work evokes&mdash;criticism
      welling out of the instinctive likings or aversions, out of the very fibre
      of the human being who delivers it; criticism that often seems to leap out
      against the critic&rsquo;s will, startled like a fawn from some deep bed,
      of sympathy or of antipathy. And so, all authors love to be abused&mdash;as
      any man can see.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the little matter of the title of this book, we are all Pharisees,
      whether of the ninety or the ten, and we certainly do live upon an Island.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SOCIETY
    </h3>
    <p>
      A quiet, well-dressed man named Shelton, with a brown face and a short,
      fair beard, stood by the bookstall at Dover Station. He was about to
      journey up to London, and had placed his bag in the corner of a
      third-class carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his long travel, the flat-vowelled voice of the bookstall clerk
      offering the latest novel sounded pleasant&mdash;pleasant the independent
      answers of a bearded guard, and the stodgy farewell sayings of a man and
      wife. The limber porters trundling their barrows, the greyness of the
      station and the good stolid humour clinging to the people, air, and
      voices, all brought to him the sense of home. Meanwhile he wavered between
      purchasing a book called Market Hayborough, which he had read and would
      certainly enjoy a second time, and Carlyle&rsquo;s French Revolution,
      which he had not read and was doubtful of enjoying; he felt that he ought
      to buy the latter, but he did not relish giving up the former. While he
      hesitated thus, his carriage was beginning to fill up; so, quickly buying
      both, he took up a position from which he could defend his rights. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;
      he thought, &ldquo;shows people up like travelling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage was almost full, and, putting his bag, up in the rack, he
      took his seat. At the moment of starting yet another passenger, a girl
      with a pale face, scrambled in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a fool to go third,&rdquo; thought Shelton, taking in his
      neighbours from behind his journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were seven. A grizzled rustic sat in the far corner; his empty pipe,
      bowl downwards, jutted like a handle from his face, all bleared with the
      smear of nothingness that grows on those who pass their lives in the
      current of hard facts. Next to him, a ruddy, heavy-shouldered man was
      discussing with a grey-haired, hatchet-visaged person the condition of
      their gardens; and Shelton watched their eyes till it occurred to him how
      curious a look was in them&mdash;a watchful friendliness, an allied
      distrust&mdash;and that their voices, cheerful, even jovial, seemed to be
      cautious all the time. His glance strayed off, and almost rebounded from
      the semi-Roman, slightly cross, and wholly self-complacent face of a stout
      lady in a black-and-white costume, who was reading the Strand Magazine,
      while her other, sleek, plump hand, freed from its black glove, and
      ornamented with a thick watch-bracelet, rested on her lap. A younger,
      bright-cheeked, and self-conscious female was sitting next her, looking at
      the pale girl who had just got in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about that girl,&rdquo; thought Shelton,
      &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; Her brown eyes certainly looked
      frightened, her clothes were of a foreign cut. Suddenly he met the glance
      of another pair of eyes; these eyes, prominent and blue, stared with a
      sort of subtle roguery from above a thin, lopsided nose, and were at once
      averted. They gave Shelton the impression that he was being judged, and
      mocked, enticed, initiated. His own gaze did not fall; this sanguine face,
      with its two-day growth of reddish beard, long nose, full lips, and irony,
      puzzled him. &ldquo;A cynical face!&rdquo; he thought, and then, &ldquo;but
      sensitive!&rdquo; and then, &ldquo;too cynical,&rdquo; again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man who owned it sat with his legs parted at the knees, his
      dusty trouser-ends and boots slanting back beneath the seat, his yellow
      finger-tips crisped as if rolling cigarettes. A strange air of detachment
      was about that youthful, shabby figure, and not a scrap of luggage filled
      the rack above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frightened girl was sitting next this pagan personality; it was
      possibly the lack of fashion in his looks that caused, her to select him
      for her confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;do you speak French?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then can you tell me where they take the tickets?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young man shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am a foreigner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the matter, ma&rsquo;moiselle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl did not reply, twisting her hands on an old bag in her lap.
      Silence had stolen on the carriage&mdash;a silence such as steals on
      animals at the first approach of danger; all eyes were turned towards the
      figures of the foreigners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; broke out the red-faced man, &ldquo;he was a bit
      squiffy that evening&mdash;old Tom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied his neighbour, &ldquo;he would be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something seemed to have destroyed their look of mutual distrust. The
      plump, sleek hand of the lady with the Roman nose curved convulsively; and
      this movement corresponded to the feeling agitating Shelton&rsquo;s heart.
      It was almost as if hand and heart feared to be asked for something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the girl, with a tremble in her voice,
      &ldquo;I am very unhappy; can you tell me what to do? I had no money for a
      ticket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreign youth&rsquo;s face flickered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that might happen to anyone, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will they do to me?&rdquo; sighed the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose courage, ma&rsquo;moiselle.&rdquo; The young man
      slid his eyes from left to right, and rested them on Shelton. &ldquo;Although
      I don&rsquo;t as yet see your way out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monsieur!&rdquo; sighed the girl, and, though it was clear that
      none but Shelton understood what they were saying, there was a chilly
      feeling in the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could assist you,&rdquo; said the foreign youth; &ldquo;unfortunately&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      he shrugged his shoulders, and again his eyes returned to Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter thrust his hand into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I be of any use?&rdquo; he asked in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir; you could render this young lady the greatest
      possible service by lending her the money for a ticket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton produced a sovereign, which the young man took. Passing it to the
      girl, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks&mdash;&rsquo;voila une belle action&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The misgivings which attend on casual charity crowded up in Shelton&rsquo;s
      mind; he was ashamed of having them and of not having them, and he stole
      covert looks at this young foreigner, who was now talking to the girl in a
      language that he did not understand. Though vagabond in essence, the
      fellow&rsquo;s face showed subtle spirit, a fortitude and irony not found
      upon the face of normal man, and in turning from it to the other
      passengers Shelton was conscious of revolt, contempt, and questioning,
      that he could not define. Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he tried to
      diagnose this new sensation. He found it disconcerting that the faces and
      behaviour of his neighbours lacked anything he could grasp and secretly
      abuse. They continued to converse with admirable and slightly conscious
      phlegm, yet he knew, as well as if each one had whispered to him
      privately, that this shady incident had shaken them. Something unsettling
      to their notions of propriety-something dangerous and destructive of
      complacency&mdash;had occurred, and this was unforgivable. Each had a
      different way, humorous or philosophic, contemptuous, sour, or sly, of
      showing this resentment. But by a flash of insight Shelton saw that at the
      bottom of their minds and of his own the feeling was the same. Because he
      shared in their resentment he was enraged with them and with himself. He
      looked at the plump, sleek hand of the woman with the Roman nose. The
      insulation and complacency of its pale skin, the passive righteousness
      about its curve, the prim separation from the others of the fat little
      finger, had acquired a wholly unaccountable importance. It embodied the
      verdict of his fellow-passengers, the verdict of Society; for he knew
      that, whether or no repugnant to the well-bred mind, each assemblage of
      eight persons, even in a third-class carriage, contains the kernel of
      Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      But being in love, and recently engaged, Shelton had a right to be immune
      from discontent of any kind, and he reverted to his mental image of the
      cool, fair face, quick movements, and the brilliant smile that now in his
      probationary exile haunted his imagination; he took out his fiancee&rsquo;s
      last letter, but the voice of the young foreigner addressing him in rapid
      French caused him to put it back abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what she tells me, sir,&rdquo; he said, bending forward to be
      out of hearing of the girl, &ldquo;hers is an unhappy case. I should have
      been only too glad to help her, but, as you see&rdquo;&mdash;and he made a
      gesture by which Shelton observed that he had parted from his waistcoat&mdash;&ldquo;I
      am not Rothschild. She has been abandoned by the man who brought her over
      to Dover under promise of marriage. Look&rdquo;&mdash;and by a subtle
      flicker of his eyes he marked how the two ladies had edged away from the
      French girl &ldquo;they take good care not to let their garments touch
      her. They are virtuous women. How fine a thing is virtue, sir! and finer
      to know you have it, especially when you are never likely to be tempted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton was unable to repress a smile; and when he smiled his face grew
      soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you observed,&rdquo; went on the youthful foreigner,
      &ldquo;that those who by temperament and circumstance are worst fitted to
      pronounce judgment are usually the first to judge? The judgments of
      Society are always childish, seeing that it&rsquo;s composed for the most
      part of individuals who have never smelt the fire. And look at this: they
      who have money run too great a risk of parting with it if they don&rsquo;t
      accuse the penniless of being rogues and imbeciles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton was startled, and not only by an outburst of philosophy from an
      utter stranger in poor clothes, but at this singular wording of his own
      private thoughts. Stifling his sense of the unusual for the queer
      attraction this young man inspired, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re a stranger over here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in England seven months, but not yet in London,&rdquo;
      replied the other. &ldquo;I count on doing some good there&mdash;it is
      time!&rdquo; A bitter and pathetic smile showed for a second on his lips.
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be my fault if I fail. You are English, Sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive my asking; your voice lacks something I&rsquo;ve nearly
      always noticed in the English a kind of&mdash;&rsquo;comment cela s&rsquo;appelle&rsquo;&mdash;cocksureness,
      coming from your nation&rsquo;s greatest quality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; asked Shelton with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Complacency,&rdquo; replied the youthful foreigner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Complacency!&rdquo; repeated Shelton; &ldquo;do you call that a
      great quality?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should rather say, monsieur, a great defect in what is always a
      great people. You are certainly the most highly-civilised nation on the
      earth; you suffer a little from the fact. If I were an English preacher my
      desire would be to prick the heart of your complacency.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton, leaning back, considered this impertinent suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d be unpopular; I don&rsquo;t
      know that we&rsquo;re any cockier than other nations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young foreigner made a sign as though confirming this opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In effect,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is a sufficiently widespread
      disease. Look at these people here&rdquo;&mdash;and with a rapid glance he
      pointed to the inmates of the carnage,&mdash;&ldquo;very average persons!
      What have they done to warrant their making a virtuous nose at those who
      do not walk as they do? That old rustic, perhaps, is different&mdash;he
      never thinks at all&mdash;but look at those two occupied with their
      stupidities about the price of hops, the prospects of potatoes, what
      George is doing, a thousand things all of that sort&mdash;look at their
      faces; I come of the bourgeoisie myself&mdash;have they ever shown proof
      of any quality that gives them the right to pat themselves upon the back?
      No fear! Outside potatoes they know nothing, and what they do not
      understand they dread and they despise&mdash;there are millions of that
      breed. &lsquo;Voila la Societe&rsquo;. The sole quality these people have
      shown they have is cowardice. I was educated by the Jesuits,&rdquo; he
      concluded; &ldquo;it has given me a way of thinking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Under ordinary circumstances Shelton would have murmured in a well-bred
      voice, &ldquo;Ah! quite so,&rdquo; and taken refuge in the columns of the
      Daily Telegraph. In place of this, for some reason that he did not
      understand, he looked at the young foreigner, and asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say all this to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tramp&mdash;for by his boots he could hardly have been better&mdash;hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve travelled like me,&rdquo; he said, as if resolved
      to speak the truth, &ldquo;you acquire an instinct in choosing to whom and
      how you speak. It is necessity that makes the law; if you want to live you
      must learn all that sort of thing to make face against life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton, who himself possessed a certain subtlety, could not but observe
      the complimentary nature of these words. It was like saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not afraid of you misunderstanding me, and thinking me a rascal just
      because I study human nature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is there nothing to be done for that poor girl?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His new acquaintance shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A broken jug,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;&mdash;you&rsquo;ll never mend
      her. She&rsquo;s going to a cousin in London to see if she can get help;
      you&rsquo;ve given her the means of getting there&mdash;it&rsquo;s all
      that you can do. One knows too well what&rsquo;ll become of her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton said gravely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s horrible! Could n&rsquo;t she be induced to go
      back home? I should be glad&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreign vagrant shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon cher monsieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you evidently have not
      yet had occasion to know what the &lsquo;family&rsquo; is like. &lsquo;The
      family&rsquo; does not like damaged goods; it will have nothing to say to
      sons whose hands have dipped into the till or daughters no longer to be
      married. What the devil would they do with her? Better put a stone about
      her neck and let her drown at once. All the world is Christian, but
      Christian and good Samaritan are not quite the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton looked at the girl, who was sitting motionless, with her hands
      crossed on her bag, and a revolt against the unfair ways of life arose
      within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the young foreigner, as if reading all his
      thoughts, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s called virtue is nearly always only luck.&rdquo;
      He rolled his eyes as though to say: &ldquo;Ah! La, Conventions? Have them
      by all means&mdash;but don&rsquo;t look like peacocks because you are
      preserving them; it is but cowardice and luck, my friends&mdash;but
      cowardice and luck!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give her my
      address, and if she wants to go back to her family she can write to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never go back; she won&rsquo;t have the courage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton caught the cringing glance of the girl&rsquo;s eyes; in the droop
      of her lip there was something sensuous, and the conviction that the young
      man&rsquo;s words were true came over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had better not give them my private address,&rdquo; he thought,
      glancing at the faces opposite; and he wrote down the following: &ldquo;Richard
      Paramor Shelton, c/o Paramor and Herring, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very good, sir. My name is Louis Ferrand; no address
      at present. I&rsquo;ll make her understand; she&rsquo;s half stupefied
      just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton returned to the perusal of his paper, too disturbed to read; the
      young vagrant&rsquo;s words kept sounding in his ears. He raised his eyes.
      The plump hand of the lady with the Roman nose still rested on her lap; it
      had been recased in its black glove with large white stitching. Her
      frowning gaze was fixed on him suspiciously, as if he had outraged her
      sense of decency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did n&rsquo;t get anything from me,&rdquo; said the voice of the
      red-faced man, ending a talk on tax-gatherers. The train whistled loudly,
      and Shelton reverted to his paper. This time he crossed his legs,
      determined to enjoy the latest murder; once more he found himself looking
      at the vagrant&rsquo;s long-nosed, mocking face. &ldquo;That fellow,&rdquo;
      he thought, &ldquo;has seen and felt ten times as much as I, although he
      must be ten years younger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned for distraction to the landscape, with its April clouds, trim
      hedgerows, homely coverts. But strange ideas would come, and he was
      discontented with himself; the conversation he had had, the personality of
      this young foreigner, disturbed him. It was all as though he had made a
      start in some fresh journey through the fields of thought.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ANTONIA
    </h3>
    <p>
      Five years before the journey just described Shelton had stood one
      afternoon on the barge of his old college at the end of the summer races.
      He had been &ldquo;down&rdquo; from Oxford for some years, but these
      Olympian contests still attracted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boats were passing, and in the usual rush to the barge side his arm
      came in contact with a soft young shoulder. He saw close to him a young
      girl with fair hair knotted in a ribbon, whose face was eager with
      excitement. The pointed chin, long neck, the fluffy hair, quick gestures,
      and the calm strenuousness of her grey-blue eyes, impressed him vividly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we must bump them!&rdquo; he heard her sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know my people, Shelton?&rdquo; said a voice behind his
      back; and he was granted a touch from the girl&rsquo;s shy, impatient
      hand, the warmer fingers of a lady with kindly eyes resembling a hare&rsquo;s,
      the dry hand-clasp of a gentleman with a thin, arched nose, and a
      quizzical brown face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the Mr. Shelton who used to play the &lsquo;bones&rsquo; at
      Eton?&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;Oh; we so often heard of you from
      Bernard! He was your fag, was n&rsquo;t he? How distressin&rsquo; it is to
      see these poor boys in the boats!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, they like it!&rdquo; cried the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antonia ought to be rowing, herself,&rdquo; said her father, whose
      name was Dennant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton went back with them to their hotel, walking beside Antonia through
      the Christchurch meadows, telling her details of his college life. He
      dined with them that evening, and, when he left, had a feeling like that
      produced by a first glass of champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dennants lived at Holm Oaks, within six miles of Oxford, and two days
      later he drove over and paid a call. Amidst the avocations of reading for
      the Bar, of cricket, racing, shooting, it but required a whiff of some
      fresh scent&mdash;hay, honeysuckle, clover&mdash;to bring Antonia&rsquo;s
      face before him, with its uncertain colour and its frank, distant eyes.
      But two years passed before he again saw her. Then, at an invitation from
      Bernard Dennant, he played cricket for the Manor of Holm Oaks against a
      neighbouring house; in the evening there was dancing oh the lawn. The fair
      hair was now turned up, but the eyes were quite unchanged. Their steps
      went together, and they outlasted every other couple on the slippery
      grass. Thence, perhaps, sprang her respect for him; he was wiry, a little
      taller than herself, and seemed to talk of things that interested her. He
      found out she was seventeen, and she found out that he was twenty-nine.
      The following two years Shelton went to Holm Oaks whenever he was asked;
      to him this was a period of enchanted games, of cub-hunting, theatricals,
      and distant sounds of practised music, and during it Antonia&rsquo;s eyes
      grew more friendly and more curious, and his own more shy, and schooled,
      more furtive and more ardent. Then came his father&rsquo;s death, a voyage
      round the world, and that peculiar hour of mixed sensations when, one
      March morning, abandoning his steamer at Marseilles, he took train for
      Hyeres.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her at one of those exclusive hostelries amongst the pines where
      the best English go, in common with Americans, Russian princesses, and
      Jewish families; he would not have been shocked to find her elsewhere, but
      he would have been surprised. His sunburnt face and the new beard, on
      which he set some undefined value, apologetically displayed, were scanned
      by those blue eyes with rapid glances, at once more friendly and less
      friendly. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; they seemed to say, &ldquo;here you are; how
      glad I am! But&mdash;what now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was admitted to their sacred table at the table d&rsquo;hote, a snowy
      oblong in an airy alcove, where the Honourable Mrs. Dennant, Miss Dennant,
      and the Honourable Charlotte Penguin, a maiden aunt with insufficient
      lungs, sat twice a day in their own atmosphere. A momentary weakness came
      on Shelton the first time he saw them sitting there at lunch. What was it
      gave them their look of strange detachment? Mrs. Dennant was bending above
      a camera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, d&rsquo; you know, it&rsquo;s under-exposed,&rdquo;
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity! The kitten was rather nice!&rdquo; The maiden aunt,
      placing the knitting of a red silk tie beside her plate, turned her
      aspiring, well-bred gaze on Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Auntie,&rdquo; said Antonia in her clear, quick voice,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the funny little man again!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the maiden aunt&mdash;a smile revealed her upper
      teeth; she looked for the funny little man (who was not English)&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      rather nice!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton did not look for the funny little man; he stole a glance that
      barely reached Antonia&rsquo;s brow, where her eyebrows took their tiny
      upward slant at the outer corners, and her hair was still ruffled by a
      windy walk. From that moment he became her slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Shelton, do you know anything about these periscopic
      binoculars?&rdquo; said Mrs. Dennant&rsquo;s voice; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
      splendid for buildin&rsquo;s, but buildin&rsquo;s are so disappointin&rsquo;.
      The thing is to get human interest, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; and her glance
      wandered absently past Shelton in search of human interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t put down what you&rsquo;ve taken, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From a little leather bag Mrs. Dennant took a little leather book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so easy to forget what they&rsquo;re about,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so annoyin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton was not again visited by his uneasiness at their detachment; he
      accepted them and all their works, for there was something quite sublime
      about the way that they would leave the dining-room, unconscious that they
      themselves were funny to all the people they had found so funny while they
      had been sitting there, and he would follow them out unnecessarily upright
      and feeling like a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the ensuing fortnight, chaperoned by the maiden aunt, for Mrs. Dennant
      disliked driving, he sat opposite to Antonia during many drives; he played
      sets of tennis with her; but it was in the evenings after dinner&mdash;those
      long evenings on a parquet floor in wicker chairs dragged as far as might
      be from the heating apparatus&mdash;that he seemed so very near her. The
      community of isolation drew them closer. In place of a companion he had
      assumed the part of friend, to whom she could confide all her home-sick
      aspirations. So that, even when she was sitting silent, a slim, long foot
      stretched out in front, bending with an air of cool absorption over some
      pencil sketches which she would not show him&mdash;even then, by her very
      attitude, by the sweet freshness that clung about her, by her quick,
      offended glances at the strange persons round, she seemed to acknowledge
      in some secret way that he was necessary. He was far from realising this;
      his intellectual and observant parts were hypnotised and fascinated even
      by her failings. The faint freckling across her nose, the slim and
      virginal severeness of her figure, with its narrow hips and arms, the
      curve of her long neck-all were added charms. She had the wind and rain
      look, a taste of home; and over the glaring roads, where the palm-tree
      shadows lay so black, she seemed to pass like the very image of an English
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon he had taken her to play tennis with some friends, and
      afterwards they strolled on to her favourite view. Down the Toulon road
      gardens and hills were bathed in the colour of ripe apricot; an evening
      crispness had stolen on the air; the blood, released from the sun&rsquo;s
      numbing, ran gladly in the veins. On the right hand of the road was a
      Frenchman playing bowls. Enormous, busy, pleased, and upright as a
      soldier, pathetically trotting his vast carcass from end to end, he
      delighted Shelton. But Antonia threw a single look at the huge creature,
      and her face expressed disgust. She began running up towards the ruined
      tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton let her keep in front, watching her leap from stone to stone and
      throw back defiant glances when he pressed behind. She stood at the top,
      and he looked up at her. Over the world, gloriously spread below, she,
      like a statue, seemed to rule. The colour was brilliant in her cheeks, her
      young bosom heaved, her eyes shone, and the flowing droop of her long,
      full sleeves gave to her poised figure the look of one who flies. He
      pulled himself up and stood beside her; his heart choked him, all the
      colour had left his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antonia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She started, as if his whisper had intruded on her thoughts; but his face
      must have expressed his hunger, for the resentment in her eyes vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood for several minutes without speaking, and then went home.
      Shelton painfully revolved the riddle of the colour in her face. Had he a
      chance then? Was it possible? That evening the instinct vouchsafed at
      times to lovers in place of reason caused him to pack his bag and go to
      Cannes. On returning, two days later, and approaching the group in the
      centre of the Winter Garden, the voice of the maiden aunt reading aloud an
      extract from the Morning Post reached him across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s rather nice?&rdquo; he heard her
      ask, and then: &ldquo;Oh, here you aye! It&rsquo;s very nice to see you
      back!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton slipped into a wicker chair. Antonia looked up quickly from her
      sketch-book, put out a hand, but did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her bending head, and his eagerness was changed to gloom. With
      desperate vivacity he sustained the five intolerable minutes of inquiry,
      where had he been, what had he been doing? Then once again the maiden aunt
      commenced her extracts from the Morning Post.
    </p>
    <p>
      A touch on his sleeve startled him. Antonia was leaning forward; her
      cheeks were crimson above the pallor of her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to see my sketches?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To Shelton, bending above those sketches, that drawl of the well-bred
      maiden aunt intoning the well-bred paper was the most pleasant sound that
      he had ever listened to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Dick,&rdquo; Mrs. Dennant said to him a fortnight later,
      &ldquo;we would rather, after you leave here, that you don&rsquo;t see
      each other again until July. Of course I know you count it an engagement
      and all that, and everybody&rsquo;s been writin&rsquo; to congratulate
      you. But Algie thinks you ought to give yourselves a chance. Young people
      don&rsquo;t always know what they&rsquo;re about, you know; it&rsquo;s not
      long to wait.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three months!&rdquo; gasped Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to swallow down this pill with what grace he could command. There
      was no alternative. Antonia had acquiesced in the condition with a queer,
      grave pleasure, as if she expected it to do her good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be something to look forward to, Dick,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He postponed departure as long as possible, and it was not until the end
      of April that he left for England. She came alone to see him off. It was
      drizzling, but her tall, slight figure in the golf cape looked impervious
      to cold and rain amongst the shivering natives. Desperately he clutched
      her hand, warm through the wet glove; her smile seemed heartless in its
      brilliancy. He whispered &ldquo;You will write?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; don&rsquo;t be so stupid, you old Dick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran forward as the train began to move; her clear &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;
      sounded shrill and hard above the rumble of the wheels. He saw her raise
      her hand, an umbrella waving, and last of all, vivid still amongst
      receding shapes, the red spot of her scarlet tam-o&rsquo;-shanter.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A ZOOLOGICAL GARDEN
    </h3>
    <p>
      After his journey up from Dover, Shelton was still fathering his luggage
      at Charing Cross, when the foreign girl passed him, and, in spite of his
      desire to say something cheering, he could get nothing out but a
      shame-faced smile. Her figure vanished, wavering into the hurly-burly; one
      of his bags had gone astray, and so all thought of her soon faded from his
      mind. His cab, however, overtook the foreign vagrant marching along
      towards Pall Mall with a curious, lengthy stride&mdash;an observant,
      disillusioned figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first bustle of installation over, time hung heavy on his hands. July
      loomed distant, as in some future century; Antonia&rsquo;s eyes beckoned
      him faintly, hopelessly. She would not even be coming back to England for
      another month.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . I met a young foreigner in the train from Dover [he wrote to her]&mdash;a
      curious sort of person altogether, who seems to have infected me.
      Everything here has gone flat and unprofitable; the only good things in
      life are your letters.... John Noble dined with me yesterday; the poor
      fellow tried to persuade me to stand for Parliament. Why should I think
      myself fit to legislate for the unhappy wretches one sees about in the
      streets? If people&rsquo;s faces are a fair test of their happiness, I&rsquo;
      d rather not feel in any way responsible....
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets, in fact, after his long absence in the East, afforded him
      much food for thought: the curious smugness of the passers-by; the utterly
      unending bustle; the fearful medley of miserable, over-driven women, and
      full-fed men, with leering, bull-beef eyes, whom he saw everywhere&mdash;in
      club windows, on their beats, on box seats, on the steps of hotels,
      discharging dilatory duties; the appalling chaos of hard-eyed, capable
      dames with defiant clothes, and white-cheeked hunted-looking men; of
      splendid creatures in their cabs, and cadging creatures in their broken
      hats&mdash;the callousness and the monotony!
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon in May he received this letter couched in French:
    </p>
    <p>
      3, BLANK ROW WESTMINSTER. MY DEAR SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      Excuse me for recalling to your memory the offer of assistance you so
      kindly made me during the journey from Dover to London, in which I was so
      fortunate as to travel with a man like you. Having beaten the whole town,
      ignorant of what wood to make arrows, nearly at the end of my resources,
      my spirit profoundly discouraged, I venture to avail myself of your
      permission, knowing your good heart. Since I saw you I have run through
      all the misfortunes of the calendar, and cannot tell what door is left at
      which I have not knocked. I presented myself at the business firm with
      whose name you supplied me, but being unfortunately in rags, they refused
      to give me your address. Is this not very much in the English character?
      They told me to write, and said they would forward the letter. I put all
      my hopes in you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believe me, my dear sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      (whatever you may decide)
    </p>
    <p>
      Your devoted
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUIS FERRAND.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton looked at the envelope, and saw, that it, bore date a week ago.
      The face of the young vagrant rose before him, vital, mocking, sensitive;
      the sound of his quick French buzzed in his ears, and, oddly, the whole
      whiff of him had a power of raising more vividly than ever his memories of
      Antonia. It had been at the end of the journey from Hyeres to London that
      he had met him; that seemed to give the youth a claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his hat and hurried, to Blank Row. Dismissing his cab at the
      corner of Victoria Street he with difficulty found the house in question.
      It was a doorless place, with stone-flagged corridor&mdash;in other words,
      a &ldquo;doss-house.&rdquo; By tapping on a sort of ticket-office with a
      sliding window, he attracted the attention of a blowsy woman with
      soap-suds on her arms, who informed him that the person he was looking for
      had gone without leaving his address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t there anybody,&rdquo; asked Shelton, &ldquo;of whom
      I can make inquiry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; there&rsquo;s a Frenchman.&rdquo; And opening an inner door
      she bellowed: &ldquo;Frenchy! Wanted!&rdquo; and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dried-up, yellow little man, cynical and weary in the face, as if a
      moral steam-roller had passed over it, answered this call, and stood,
      sniffing, as it were, at Shelton, on whom he made the singular impression
      of some little creature in a cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He left here ten days ago, in the company of a mulatto. What do you
      want with him, if I may ask?&rdquo; The little man&rsquo;s yellow cheeks
      were wrinkled with suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton produced the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! now I know you&rdquo;&mdash;a pale smile broke through the
      Frenchman&rsquo;s crow&rsquo;s-feet&mdash;&ldquo;he spoke of you. &lsquo;If
      I can only find him,&rsquo; he used to say, &lsquo;I &lsquo;m saved.&rsquo;
      I liked that young man; he had ideas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no way of getting at him through his consul?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might as well look for diamonds at the bottom of the sea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he will come back here? But by that time I suppose,
      you&rsquo;ll hardly be here yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of amusement played about the Frenchman&rsquo;s teeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Oh, yes, sir! Once upon a time I cherished the hope of emerging;
      I no longer have illusions. I shave these specimens for a living, and
      shall shave them till the day of judgment. But leave a letter with me by
      all means; he will come back. There&rsquo;s an overcoat of his here on
      which he borrowed money&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth more. Oh, yes; he will come
      back&mdash;a youth of principle. Leave a letter with me; I&rsquo;m always
      here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton hesitated, but those last three words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always
      here,&rdquo; touched him in their simplicity. Nothing more dreadful could
      be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you find me a sheet of paper, then?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;please
      keep the change for the trouble I am giving you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the Frenchman simply; &ldquo;he told me that
      your heart was good. If you don&rsquo;t mind the kitchen, you could write
      there at your ease.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton wrote his letter at the table of this stone-flagged kitchen in
      company with an aged, dried-up gentleman; who was muttering to himself;
      and Shelton tried to avoid attracting his attention, suspecting that he
      was not sober. Just as he was about to take his leave, however, the old
      fellow thus accosted him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever go to the dentist, mister?&rdquo; he said, working at
      a loose tooth with his shrivelled fingers. &ldquo;I went to a dentist
      once, who professed to stop teeth without giving pain, and the beggar did
      stop my teeth without pain; but did they stay in, those stoppings? No, my
      bhoy; they came out before you could say Jack Robinson. Now, I shimply ask
      you, d&rsquo;you call that dentistry?&rdquo; Fixing his eyes on Shelton&rsquo;s
      collar, which had the misfortune to be high and clean, he resumed with
      drunken scorn: &ldquo;Ut&rsquo;s the same all over this pharisaical
      counthry. Talk of high morality and Anglo-Shaxon civilisation! The world
      was never at such low ebb! Phwhat&rsquo;s all this morality? Ut stinks of
      the shop. Look at the condition of Art in this counthry! look at the fools
      you see upon th&rsquo; stage! look at the pictures and books that sell! I
      know what I&rsquo;m talking about, though I am a sandwich man. Phwhat&rsquo;s
      the secret of ut all? Shop, my bhoy! Ut don&rsquo;t pay to go below a
      certain depth! Scratch the skin, but pierce ut&mdash;Oh! dear, no! We hate
      to see the blood fly, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton stood disconcerted, not knowing if he were expected to reply; but
      the old gentleman, pursing up his lips, went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, there are no extremes in this fog-smitten land. Do ye think
      blanks loike me ought to exist? Whoy don&rsquo;t they kill us off?
      Palliatives&mdash;palliatives&mdash;and whoy? Because they object to th&rsquo;
      extreme course. Look at women: the streets here are a scandal to the
      world. They won&rsquo;t recognise that they exist&mdash;their noses are so
      dam high! They blink the truth in this middle-class counthry. My bhoy&rdquo;&mdash;and
      he whispered confidentially&mdash;&ldquo;ut pays &lsquo;em. Eh? you say,
      why shouldn&rsquo;t they, then?&rdquo; (But Shelton had not spoken.)
      &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;em! let &lsquo;em! But don&rsquo;t tell me that&rsquo;sh
      morality, don&rsquo;t tell me that&rsquo;sh civilisation! What can you
      expect in a counthry where the crimson, emotions are never allowed to
      smell the air? And what&rsquo;sh the result? My bhoy, the result is
      sentiment, a yellow thing with blue spots, like a fungus or a Stilton
      cheese. Go to the theatre, and see one of these things they call plays.
      Tell me, are they food for men and women? Why, they&rsquo;re pap for babes
      and shop-boys! I was a blanky actor moyself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton listened with mingled feelings of amusement and dismay, till the
      old actor, having finished, resumed his crouching posture at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get dhrunk, I suppose?&rdquo; he said suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;too
      much of &lsquo;n Englishman, no doubt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very seldom,&rdquo; said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity! Think of the pleasures of oblivion! Oi &lsquo;m dhrunk every
      night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long will you last at that rate?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There speaks the Englishman! Why should Oi give up me only pleasure
      to keep me wretched life in? If you&rsquo;ve anything left worth the
      keeping shober for, keep shober by all means; if not, the sooner you are
      dhrunk the better&mdash;that stands to reason.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the corridor Shelton asked the Frenchman where the old man came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, and Englishman! Yes, yes, from Belfast very drunken old man.
      You are a drunken nation&rdquo;&mdash;he made a motion with his hands
      &ldquo;he no longer eats&mdash;no inside left. It is unfortunate-a man of
      spirit. If you have never seen one of these palaces, monsieur, I shall be
      happy to show you over it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton took out his cigarette case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the Frenchman, making a wry nose and taking a
      cigarette; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m accustomed to it. But you&rsquo;re wise to
      fumigate the air; one is n&rsquo;t in a harem.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Shelton felt ashamed of his fastidiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the guide, leading him up-stairs and opening a
      door, &ldquo;is a specimen of the apartments reserved for these princes of
      the blood.&rdquo; There were four empty beds on iron legs, and, with the
      air of a showman, the Frenchman twitched away a dingy quilt. &ldquo;They
      go out in the mornings, earn enough to make them drunk, sleep it off, and
      then begin again. That&rsquo;s their life. There are people who think they
      ought to be reformed. &lsquo;Mon cher monsieur&rsquo;, one must face
      reality a little, even in this country. It would be a hundred times better
      for these people to spend their time reforming high Society. Your high
      Society makes all these creatures; there&rsquo;s no harvest without
      cutting stalks. &lsquo;Selon moi&rsquo;,&rdquo; he continued, putting back
      the quilt, and dribbling cigarette smoke through his nose, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      no grand difference between your high Society and these individuals here;
      both want pleasure, both think only of themselves, which is very natural.
      One lot have had the luck, the other&mdash;well, you see.&rdquo; He
      shrugged. &ldquo;A common set! I&rsquo;ve been robbed here half a dozen
      times. If you have new shoes, a good waistcoat, an overcoat, you want eyes
      in the back of your head. And they are populated! Change your bed, and you&rsquo;ll
      run all the dangers of not sleeping alone. &lsquo;V&rsquo;la ma clientele&rsquo;.
      The half of them don&rsquo;t pay me!&rdquo; He, snapped his yellow sticks
      of fingers. &ldquo;A penny for a shave, twopence a cut! &lsquo;Quelle vie&rsquo;.
      Here,&rdquo; he continued, standing by a bed, &ldquo;is a gentleman who
      owes me fivepence. Here&rsquo;s one who was a soldier; he&rsquo;s done
      for! All brutalised; not one with any courage left! But, believe me,
      monsieur,&rdquo; he went on, opening another door, &ldquo;when you come
      down to houses of this sort you must have a vice; it&rsquo;s as necessary
      as breath is to the lungs. No matter what, you must have a vice to give
      you a little solace&mdash;&rsquo;un peu de soulagement&rsquo;. Ah, yes!
      before you judge these swine, reflect on life! I&rsquo;ve been through it.
      Monsieur, it is not nice never to know where to get your next meal.
      Gentlemen who have food in their stomachs, money in their pockets, and
      know where to get more, they never think. Why should they&mdash;&rsquo;pas
      de danger&rsquo;. All these cages are the same. Come down, and you shall
      see the pantry.&rdquo; He took Shelton through the kitchen, which seemed
      the only sitting-room of the establishment, to an inner room furnished
      with dirty cups and saucers, plates, and knives. Another fire was burning
      there. &ldquo;We always have hot water,&rdquo; said the Frenchman, &ldquo;and
      three times a week they make a fire down there&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed to
      a cellar&mdash;&ldquo;for our clients to boil their vermin. Oh, yes, we
      have all the luxuries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton returned to the kitchen, and directly after took leave of the
      little Frenchman, who said, with a kind of moral button-holing, as if
      trying to adopt him as a patron:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me, monsieur; if he comes back&mdash;that young man&mdash;he
      shall have your letter without fail. My name is Carolan Jules Carolan; and
      I am always at your service.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE PLAY
    </h3>
    <p>
      Shelton walked away; he had been indulging in a nightmare. &ldquo;That old
      actor was drunk,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;and no doubt he was an
      Irishman; still, there may be truth in what he said. I am a Pharisee, like
      all the rest who are n&rsquo;t in the pit. My respectability is only luck.
      What should I have become if I&rsquo;d been born into his kind of life?&rdquo;
      and he stared at a stream of people coming from the Stares, trying to
      pierce the mask of their serious, complacent faces. If these ladies and
      gentlemen were put into that pit into which he had been looking, would a
      single one of them emerge again? But the effort of picturing them there
      was too much for him; it was too far&mdash;too ridiculously far.
    </p>
    <p>
      One particular couple, a large; fine man and wife, who, in the midst of
      all the dirt and rumbling hurry, the gloomy, ludicrous, and desperately
      jovial streets, walked side by side in well-bred silence, had evidently
      bought some article which pleased them. There was nothing offensive in
      their manner; they seemed quite unconcerned at the passing of the other
      people. The man had that fine solidity of shoulder and of waist, the
      glossy self-possession that belongs to those with horses, guns, and
      dressing-bags. The wife, her chin comfortably settled in her fur, kept her
      grey eyes on the ground, and, when she spoke, her even and unruffled voice
      reached Shelton&rsquo;s ears above all the whirring of the traffic. It was
      leisurely precise, as if it had never hurried, had never been exhausted,
      or passionate, or afraid. Their talk, like that of many dozens of fine
      couples invading London from their country places, was of where to dine,
      what theatre they should go to, whom they had seen, what they should buy.
      And Shelton knew that from day&rsquo;s end to end, and even in their bed,
      these would be the subjects of their conversation. They were the best-bred
      people of the sort he met in country houses and accepted as of course,
      with a vague discomfort at the bottom of his soul. Antonia&rsquo;s home,
      for instance, had been full of them. They were the best-bred people of the
      sort who supported charities, knew everybody, had clear, calm judgment,
      and intolerance of all such conduct as seemed to them &ldquo;impossible,&rdquo;
      all breaches of morality, such as mistakes of etiquette, such as
      dishonesty, passion, sympathy (except with a canonised class of objects&mdash;the
      legitimate sufferings, for instance, of their own families and class). How
      healthy they were! The memory of the doss-house worked in Shelton&rsquo;s
      mind like poison. He was conscious that in his own groomed figure, in the
      undemonstrative assurance of his walk, he bore resemblance to the couple
      he apostrophised. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;how vulgar our
      refinement is!&rdquo; But he hardly believed in his own outburst. These
      people were so well mannered, so well conducted, and so healthy, he could
      not really understand what irritated him. What was the matter with them?
      They fulfilled their duties, had good appetites, clear consciences, all
      the furniture of perfect citizens; they merely lacked-feelers, a loss
      that, he had read, was suffered by plants and animals which no longer had
      a need for using them. Some rare national faculty of seeing only the
      obvious and materially useful had destroyed their power of catching gleams
      or scents to right or left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady looked up at her husband. The light of quiet, proprietary
      affection shone in her calm grey eyes, decorously illumining her features
      slightly reddened by the wind. And the husband looked back at her, calm,
      practical, protecting. They were very much alike. So doubtless he looked
      when he presented himself in snowy shirt-sleeves for her to straighten the
      bow of his white tie; so nightly she would look, standing before the
      full-length mirror, fixing his gifts upon her bosom. Calm, proprietary,
      kind! He passed them and walked behind a second less distinguished couple,
      who manifested a mutual dislike as matter-of-fact and free from nonsense
      as the unruffled satisfaction of the first; this dislike was just as
      healthy, and produced in Shelton about the same sensation. It was like
      knocking at a never-opened door, looking at a circle&mdash;couple after
      couple all the same. No heads, toes, angles of their souls stuck out
      anywhere. In the sea of their environments they were drowned; no leg
      braved the air, no arm emerged wet and naked waving at the skies;
      shop-persons, aristocrats, workmen, officials, they were all respectable.
      And he himself as respectable as any.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned, thus moody, to his rooms and, with the impetuosity which
      distinguished him when about to do an unwise thing, he seized a pen and
      poured out before Antonia some of his impressions:
    </p>
    <p>
      ... Mean is the word, darling; we are mean, that&rsquo;s what &lsquo;s the
      matter with us, dukes and dustmen, the whole human species&mdash;as mean
      as caterpillars. To secure our own property and our own comfort, to dole
      out our sympathy according to rule just so that it won&rsquo;t really hurt
      us, is what we&rsquo;re all after. There&rsquo;s something about human
      nature that is awfully repulsive, and the healthier people are, the more
      repulsive they seem to me to be....
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, biting his pen. Had he one acquaintance who would not counsel
      him to see a doctor for writing in that style? How would the world go
      round, how could Society exist, without common-sense, practical ability,
      and the lack of sympathy?
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked out of the open window. Down in the street a footman was
      settling the rug over the knees of a lady in a carriage, and the decorous
      immovability of both their faces, which were clearly visible to him, was
      like a portion of some well-oiled engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and walked up and down. His rooms, in a narrow square skirting
      Belgravia, were unchanged since the death of his father had made him a man
      of means. Selected for their centrality, they were furnished in a very
      miscellaneous way. They were not bare, but close inspection revealed that
      everything was damaged, more or less, and there was absolutely nothing
      that seemed to have an interest taken in it. His goods were accidents,
      presents, or the haphazard acquisitions of a pressing need. Nothing, of
      course, was frowsy, but everything was somewhat dusty, as if belonging to
      a man who never rebuked a servant. Above all, there was nothing that
      indicated hobbies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later he had her answer to his letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . I don&rsquo;t think I understand what you mean by &ldquo;the
      healthier people are, the more repulsive they seem to be&rdquo;; one must
      be healthy to be perfect, must n&rsquo;t one? I don&rsquo;t like unhealthy
      people. I had to play on that wretched piano after reading your letter; it
      made me feel unhappy. I&rsquo;ve been having a splendid lot of tennis
      lately, got the back-handed lifting stroke at last&mdash;hurrah! . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      By the same post, too, came the following note in an autocratic writing:
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR BIRD [for this was Shelton&rsquo;s college nickname],
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife has gone down to her people, so I&rsquo;m &lsquo;en garcon&rsquo;
      for a few days. If you&rsquo;ve nothing better to do, come and dine
      to-night at seven, and go to the theatre. It&rsquo;s ages since I saw you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours as ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      B. M. HALIDOME.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton had nothing better to do, for pleasant were his friend Halidome&rsquo;s
      well-appointed dinners. At seven, therefore, he went to Chester Square.
      His friend was in his study, reading Matthew Arnold by the light of an
      electric lamp. The walls of the room were hung with costly etchings,
      arranged with solid and unfailing taste; from the carving of the
      mantel-piece to the binding of the books, from the miraculously-coloured
      meerschaums to the chased fire-irons, everything displayed an
      unpretentious luxury, an order and a finish significant of life completely
      under rule of thumb. Everything had been collected. The collector rose as
      Shelton entered, a fine figure of a man, clean shaven,&mdash;with dark
      hair, a Roman nose, good eyes, and the rather weighty dignity of attitude
      which comes from the assurance that one is in the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking Shelton by the lapel, he drew him into the radius of the lamp,
      where he examined him, smiling a slow smile. &ldquo;Glad to see you, old
      chap. I rather like your beard,&rdquo; he said with genial brusqueness;
      and nothing, perhaps, could better have summed up his faculty for forming
      independent judgments which Shelton found so admirable. He made no apology
      for the smallness of the dinner, which, consisting of eight courses and
      three wines, served by a butler and one footman, smacked of the same
      perfection as the furniture; in fact, he never apologised for anything,
      except with a jovial brusqueness that was worse than the offence. The
      suave and reasonable weight of his dislikes and his approvals stirred
      Shelton up to feel ironical and insignificant; but whether from a sense of
      the solid, humane, and healthy quality of his friend&rsquo;s egoism, or
      merely from the fact that this friendship had been long in bottle, he did
      not resent his mixed sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, I congratulate you, old chap,&rdquo; said Halidome,
      while driving to the theatre; there was no vulgar hurry about his
      congratulations, no more than about himself. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re awfully
      nice people, the Dennants.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sense of having had a seal put on his choice came over Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to live? You ought to come down and live near
      us; there are some ripping houses to be had down there; it&rsquo;s really
      a ripping neighbourhood. Have you chucked the Bar? You ought to do
      something, you know; it&rsquo;ll be fatal for you to have nothing to do. I
      tell you what, Bird: you ought to stand for the County Council.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But before Shelton had replied they reached the theatre, and their
      energies were spent in sidling to their stalls. He had time to pass his
      neighbours in review before the play began. Seated next to him was a lady
      with large healthy shoulders, displayed with splendid liberality; beyond
      her a husband, red-cheeked, with drooping, yellow-grey moustache and a
      bald head; beyond him again two men whom he had known at Eton. One of them
      had a clean-shaved face, dark hair, and a weather-tanned complexion; his
      small mouth with its upper lip pushed out above the lower, his eyelids a
      little drooped over his watchful eyes, gave him a satirical and resolute
      expression. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got hold of your tail, old fellow,&rdquo; he
      seemed to say, as though he were always busy with the catching of some
      kind of fox. The other&rsquo;s goggling eyes rested on Shelton with a
      chaffing smile; his thick, sleek hair, brushed with water and parted in
      the middle, his neat moustache and admirable waistcoat, suggested the sort
      of dandyism that despises women. From his recognition of these old
      schoolfellows Shelton turned to look at Halidome, who, having cleared his
      throat, was staring straight before him at the curtain. Antonia&rsquo;s
      words kept running in her lover&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
      unhealthy people.&rdquo; Well, all these people, anyway, were healthy;
      they looked as if they had defied the elements to endow them with a spark
      of anything but health. Just then the curtain rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, unwillingly, for he was of a trustful disposition, Shelton
      recognised that this play was one of those masterpieces of the modern
      drama whose characters were drawn on the principle that men were made for
      morals rather than morals made by men, and he watched the play unfold with
      all its careful sandwiching of grave and gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      A married woman anxious to be ridded of her husband was the pivot of the
      story, and a number of scenes, ingeniously contrived, with a hundred
      reasons why this desire was wrong and inexpedient, were revealed to
      Shelton&rsquo;s eyes. These reasons issued mainly from the mouth of a
      well-preserved old gentleman who seemed to play the part of a sort of
      Moral Salesman. He turned to Halidome and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you stand that old woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend fixed his fine eyes on him wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What old woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the old ass with the platitudes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Halidome&rsquo;s countenance grew cold, a little shocked, as though he had
      been assailed in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean Pirbright?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s
      ripping.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton turned to the play rebuffed; he felt guilty of a breach of
      manners, sitting as he was in one of his friend&rsquo;s stalls, and he
      naturally set to work to watch the play more critically than ever. Antonia&rsquo;s
      words again recurred to him, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like unhealthy people,&rdquo;
      and they seemed to throw a sudden light upon this play. It was healthy!
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was a drawing-room, softly lighted by electric lamps, with a cat
      (Shelton could not decide whether she was real or not) asleep upon the
      mat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband, a thick-set, healthy man in evening dress, was drinking off
      neat whisky. He put down his tumbler, and deliberately struck a match;
      then with even greater deliberation he lit a gold-tipped cigarette....
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton was no inexperienced play-goer. He shifted his elbows, for he felt
      that something was about to happen; and when the match was pitched into
      the fire, he leaned forward in his seat. The husband poured more whisky
      out, drank it at a draught, and walked towards the door; then, turning to
      the audience as if to admit them to the secret of some tremendous
      resolution, he puffed at them a puff of smoke. He left the room, returned,
      and once more filled his glass. A lady now entered, pale of face and dark
      of eye&mdash;his wife. The husband crossed the stage, and stood before the
      fire, his legs astride, in the attitude which somehow Shelton had felt
      sure he would assume. He spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, and shut the door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton suddenly perceived that he was face to face with one of those dumb
      moments in which two people declare their inextinguishable hatred&mdash;the
      hatred underlying the sexual intimacy of two ill-assorted creatures&mdash;and
      he was suddenly reminded of a scene he had once witnessed in a restaurant.
      He remembered with extreme minuteness how the woman and the man had sat
      facing each other across the narrow patch of white, emblazoned by a candle
      with cheap shades and a thin green vase with yellow flowers. He remembered
      the curious scornful anger of their voices, subdued so that only a few
      words reached him. He remembered the cold loathing in their eyes. And,
      above all, he remembered his impression that this sort of scene happened
      between them every other day, and would continue so to happen; and as he
      put on his overcoat and paid his bill he had asked himself, &ldquo;Why in
      the name of decency do they go on living together?&rdquo; And now he
      thought, as he listened to the two players wrangling on the stage: &ldquo;What
      &lsquo;s the good of all this talk? There&rsquo;s something here past
      words.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain came down upon the act, and he looked at the lady next him.
      She was shrugging her shoulders at her husband, whose face was healthy and
      offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do dislike these unhealthy women,&rdquo; he was saying, but
      catching Shelton&rsquo;s eye he turned square in his seat and sniffed
      ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of Shelton&rsquo;s friend beyond, composed, satirical as ever,
      was clothed with a mask of scornful curiosity, as if he had been listening
      to something that had displeased him not a little. The goggle-eyed man was
      yawning. Shelton turned to Halidome:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you stand this sort of thing?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I call that scene a bit too hot,&rdquo; replied his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton wriggled; he had meant to say it was not hot enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you anything,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s
      going to happen now. You&rsquo;ll have that old ass&mdash;what&rsquo;s his
      name?&mdash;lunching off cutlets and champagne to fortify himself&mdash;for
      a lecture to the wife. He&rsquo;ll show her how unhealthy her feelings are&mdash;I
      know him&mdash;and he&rsquo;ll take her hand and say, &lsquo;Dear lady, is
      there anything in this poor world but the good opinion of Society?&rsquo;
      and he&rsquo;ll pretend to laugh at himself for saying it; but you&rsquo;ll
      see perfectly well that the old woman means it. And then he&rsquo;ll put
      her into a set of circumstances that are n&rsquo;t her own but his version
      of them, and show her the only way of salvation is to kiss her husband&rdquo;;
      and Shelton grinned. &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll bet you anything he takes
      her hand and says, &lsquo;Dear lady.&rsquo;.rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Halidome turned on him the disapproval of his eyes, and again he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Pirbright &lsquo;s ripping!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But as Shelton had predicted, so it turned out, amidst great applause.

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE GOOD CITIZEN
    </h3>
    <p>
      Leaving the theatre, they paused a moment in the hall to don their coats;
      a stream of people with spotless bosoms eddied round the doors, as if in
      momentary dread of leaving this hothouse of false morals and emotions for
      the wet, gusty streets, where human plants thrive and die, human weeds
      flourish and fade under the fresh, impartial skies. The lights revealed
      innumerable solemn faces, gleamed innumerably on jewels, on the silk of
      hats, then passed to whiten a pavement wet with newly-fallen rain, to
      flare on horses, on the visages of cabmen, and stray, queer objects that
      do not bear the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we walk?&rdquo; asked Halidome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it ever struck you,&rdquo; answered Shelton, &ldquo;that in a
      play nowadays there&rsquo;s always a &lsquo;Chorus of Scandalmongers&rsquo;
      which seems to have acquired the attitude of God?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Halidome cleared his throat, and there was something portentous in the
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so d&mdash;-d fastidious,&rdquo; was his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a prejudice for keeping the two things separate,&rdquo;
      went on Shelton. &ldquo;That ending makes me sick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; replied Halidome. &ldquo;What other end is possible?
      You don&rsquo;t want a play to leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Halidome increased his stride, already much too long; for in his walk, as
      in all other phases of his life, he found it necessary to be in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; he asked urbanely; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s better
      than the woman making a fool of herself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of the man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The husband.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What &lsquo;s the matter with him? He was a bit of a bounder,
      certainly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand any man wanting to live with a woman who
      doesn&rsquo;t want him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some note of battle in Shelton&rsquo;s voice, rather than the sentiment
      itself, caused his friend to reply with dignity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of nonsense talked about that sort of thing.
      Women don&rsquo;t really care; it&rsquo;s only what&rsquo;s put into their
      heads.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s much the same as saying to a starving man: &lsquo;You
      don&rsquo;t really want anything; it&rsquo;s only what&rsquo;s put into
      your head!&rsquo; You are begging the question, my friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing was more calculated to annoy Halidome than to tell him he was
      &ldquo;begging the question,&rdquo; for he prided himself on being strong
      in logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That be d&mdash;-d,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, old chap. Here is a case where a woman wants her
      freedom, and you merely answer that she dogs n&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women like that are impossible; better leave them out of court.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton pondered this and smiled; he had recollected an acquaintance of
      his own, who, when his wife had left him, invented the theory that she was
      mad, and this struck him now as funny. But then he thought: &ldquo;Poor
      devil! he was bound to call her mad! If he didn&rsquo;t, it would be
      confessing himself distasteful; however true, you can&rsquo;t expect a man
      to consider himself that.&rdquo; But a glance at his friend&rsquo;s eye
      warned him that he, too, might think his wife mad in such a case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;even if she&rsquo;s his wife, a man&rsquo;s
      bound to behave like a gentleman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends on whether she behaves like a lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it? I don&rsquo;t see the connection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Halidome paused in the act of turning the latch-key in his door; there was
      a rather angry smile in his fine eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear chap,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re too sentimental
      altogether.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The word &ldquo;sentimental&rdquo; nettled Shelton. &ldquo;A gentleman
      either is a gentleman or he is n&rsquo;t; what has it to do with the way
      other people behave?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Halidome turned the key in the lock and opened the door into his hall,
      where the firelight fell on the decanters and huge chairs drawn towards
      the blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Bird,&rdquo; he said, resuming his urbanity, and gathering his
      coat-tails in his hands; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all very well to talk, but wait
      until you&rsquo;re married. A man must be master, and show it, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An idea occurred to Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Hal,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;what should you do if your
      wife got tired of you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression on Halidome&rsquo;s face was a mixture of amusement and
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean anything personal, of course, but apply the
      situation to yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Halidome took out a toothpick, used it brusquely, and responded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t stand any humbug&mdash;take her travelling; shake
      her mind up. She&rsquo;d soon come round.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose she really loathed you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Halidome cleared his throat; the idea was so obviously indecent. How could
      anybody loathe him? With great composure, however, regarding Shelton as if
      he were a forward but amusing child, he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a great many things to be taken into consideration.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears to me,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;to be a question of
      common pride. How can you, ask anything of a woman who doesn&rsquo;t want
      to give it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend&rsquo;s voice became judicial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man ought not to suffer,&rdquo; he said, poring over his whisky,
      &ldquo;because a woman gets hysteria. You have to think of Society, your
      children, house, money arrangements, a thousand things. It&rsquo;s all
      very well to talk. How do you like this whisky?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The part of the good citizen, in fact,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;self-preservation!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Common-sense,&rdquo; returned his friend; &ldquo;I believe in
      justice before sentiment.&rdquo; He drank, and callously blew smoke at
      Shelton. &ldquo;Besides, there are many people with religious views about
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always seemed to me,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;to be
      quaint that people should assert that marriage gives them the right to
      &lsquo;an eye for an eye,&rsquo; and call themselves Christians. Did you
      ever know anybody stand on their rights except out of wounded pride or for
      the sake of their own comfort? Let them call their reasons what they like,
      you know as well as I do that it&rsquo;s cant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Halidome, more and more
      superior as Shelton grew more warm; &ldquo;when you stand on your rights,
      you do it for the sake of Society as well as for your own. If you want to
      do away with marriage, why don&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;is it likely? Why, I&rsquo;m
      going&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped without adding the words &ldquo;to be
      married myself,&rdquo; for it suddenly occurred to him that the reason was
      not the most lofty and philosophic in the world. &ldquo;All I can say is,&rdquo;
      he went on soberly, &ldquo;that you can&rsquo;t make a horse drink by
      driving him. Generosity is the surest way of tightening the knot with
      people who&rsquo;ve any sense of decency; as to the rest, the chief thing
      is to prevent their breeding.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Halidome smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a rum chap,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton jerked his cigarette into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what&rdquo;&mdash;for late at night a certain power of
      vision came to him&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s humbug to talk of doing things
      for the sake of Society; it&rsquo;s nothing but the instinct to keep our
      own heads above the water.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Halidome remained unruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;call it that. I don&rsquo;t see
      why I should go to the wall; it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit, then,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;that our morality is
      the sum total of everybody&rsquo;s private instinct of self-preservation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Halidome stretched his splendid frame and yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that I should quite
      call it that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the compelling complacency of his fine eyes, the dignified posture of
      his healthy body, the lofty slope of his narrow forehead, the perfectly
      humane look of his cultivated brutality, struck Shelton as ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it, Hall&rdquo; he cried, jumping from his chair, &ldquo;what
      an old fraud you are! I&rsquo;ll be off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, look here!&rdquo; said Halidome; the faintest shade of doubt
      had appeared upon his face; he took Shelton by a lapel: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      quite wrong&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely; good-night, old chap!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton walked home, letting the spring wind into him. It was Saturday,
      and he passed many silent couples. In every little patch of shadow he
      could see two forms standing or sitting close together, and in their
      presence Words the Impostors seemed to hold their tongues. The wind
      rustled the buds; the stars, one moment bright as diamonds, vanished the
      next. In the lower streets a large part of the world was under the
      influence of drink, but by this Shelton was far from being troubled. It
      seemed better than Drama, than dressing-bagged men, unruffled women, and
      padded points of view, better than the immaculate solidity of his friend&rsquo;s
      possessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s right for every reason,
      social, religious, and convenient, to inflict one&rsquo;s society where it&rsquo;s
      not desired. There are obviously advantages about the married state;
      charming to feel respectable while you&rsquo;re acting in a way that in
      any other walk of life would bring on you contempt. If old Halidome showed
      that he was tired of me, and I continued to visit him, he&rsquo;d think me
      a bit of a cad; but if his wife were to tell him she couldn&rsquo;t stand
      him, he&rsquo;d still consider himself a perfect gentleman if he persisted
      in giving her the burden of his society; and he has the cheek to bring
      religion into it&mdash;a religion that says, &lsquo;Do unto others!&rsquo;.rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this he was unjust to Halidome, forgetting how impossible it was
      for him to believe that a woman could not stand him. He reached his rooms,
      and, the more freely to enjoy the clear lamplight, the soft, gusty breeze,
      and waning turmoil of the streets, waited a moment before entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;if I shall turn out a cad when
      I marry, like that chap in the play. It&rsquo;s natural. We all want our
      money&rsquo;s worth, our pound of flesh! Pity we use such fine words&mdash;&rsquo;Society,
      Religion, Morality.&rsquo; Humbug!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in, and, throwing his window open, remained there a long time, his
      figure outlined against the lighted room for the benefit of the dark
      square below, his hands in his pockets, his head down, a reflective frown
      about his eyes. A half-intoxicated old ruffian, a policeman, and a man in
      a straw hat had stopped below, and were holding a palaver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yus,&rdquo; the old ruffian said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a rackety old
      blank; but what I say is, if we wus all alike, this would n&rsquo;t be a
      world!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They went their way, and before the listener&rsquo;s eyes there rose
      Antonia&rsquo;s face, with its unruffled brow; Halidome&rsquo;s, all
      health and dignity; the forehead of the goggle-eyed man, with its line of
      hair parted in the centre, and brushed across. A light seemed to illumine
      the plane of their existence, as the electric lamp with the green shade
      had illumined the pages of the Matthew Arnold; serene before Shelton&rsquo;s
      vision lay that Elysium, untouched by passion or extremes of any kind,
      autocratic; complacent, possessive, and well-kept as any Midland
      landscape. Healthy, wealthy, wise! No room but for perfection,
      self-preservation, the survival of the fittest! &ldquo;The part of the
      good citizen,&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;no, if we were all alike, this
      would n&rsquo;t be a world!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Richard&rdquo; (wrote Shelton&rsquo;s uncle the next day),
      &ldquo;I shall be glad to see you at three o&rsquo;clock to-morrow
      afternoon upon the question of your marriage settlement....&rdquo; At that
      hour accordingly Shelton made his way to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, where
      in fat black letters the names &ldquo;Paramor and Herring (Commissioners
      for Oaths)&rdquo; were written on the wall of a stone entrance. He
      ascended the solid steps with nervousness, and by a small red-haired boy
      was introduced to a back room on the first floor. Here, seated at a table
      in the very centre, as if he thereby better controlled his universe, a
      pug-featured gentleman, without a beard, was writing. He paused. &ldquo;Ow,
      Mr. Richard!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;glad to see you, sir. Take a chair.
      Your uncle will be disengaged in &lsquo;arf a minute&rdquo;; and in the
      tone of his allusion to his employer was the satirical approval that comes
      with long and faithful service. &ldquo;He will do everything himself,&rdquo;
      he went on, screwing up his sly, greenish, honest eyes, &ldquo;and he
      &lsquo;s not a young man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton never saw his uncle&rsquo;s clerk without marvelling at the
      prosperity deepening upon his face. In place of the look of harassment
      which on most faces begins to grow after the age of fifty, his old friend&rsquo;s
      countenance, as though in sympathy with the nation, had expanded&mdash;a
      little greasily, a little genially, a little coarsely&mdash;every time he
      met it. A contemptuous tolerance for people who were not getting on was
      spreading beneath its surface; it left each time a deeper feeling that its
      owner could never be in the wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re well, sir,&rdquo; he resumed: &ldquo;most
      important for you to have your health now you&rsquo;re going-to&rdquo;&mdash;and,
      feeling for the delicate way to put it, he involuntarily winked&mdash;&ldquo;to
      become a family man. We saw it in the paper. My wife said to me the other
      morning at breakfast: &lsquo;Bob, here&rsquo;s a Mr. Richard Paramor
      Shelton goin&rsquo; to be married. Is that any relative of your Mr.
      Shelton?&rsquo; &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; I said to her, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
      the very man!&rsquo;.rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It disquieted Shelton to perceive that his old friend did not pass the
      whole of his life at that table writing in the centre of the room, but
      that somewhere (vistas of little grey houses rose before his eyes) he
      actually lived another life where someone called him &ldquo;Bob.&rdquo;
      Bob! And this, too, was a revelation. Bob! Why, of course, it was the only
      name for him! A bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your uncle&rdquo;; and again the head clerk&rsquo;s
      voice sounded ironical. &ldquo;Good-bye, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to clip off intercourse as one clips off electric light. Shelton
      left him writing, and preceded the red-haired boy to an enormous room in
      the front where his uncle waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund Paramor was a medium-sized and upright man of seventy, whose brown
      face was perfectly clean-shaven. His grey, silky hair was brushed in a
      cock&rsquo;s comb from his fine forehead, bald on the left side. He stood
      before the hearth facing the room, and his figure had the springy
      abruptness of men who cannot fatten. There was a certain youthfulness,
      too, in his eyes, yet they had a look as though he had been through fire;
      and his mouth curled at the corners in surprising smiles. The room was
      like the man&mdash;morally large, void of red-tape and almost void of
      furniture; no tin boxes were ranged against the walls, no papers littered
      up the table; a single bookcase contained a complete edition of the law
      reports, and resting on the Law Directory was a single red rose in a glass
      of water. It looked the room of one with a sober magnanimity, who went to
      the heart of things, despised haggling, and before whose smiles the more
      immediate kinds of humbug faded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Dick,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how&rsquo;s your mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton replied that his mother was all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her that I&rsquo;m going to sell her Easterns after all, and
      put into this Brass thing. You can say it&rsquo;s safe, from me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton made a face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;always believes things are safe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His uncle looked through him with his keen, half-suffering glance, and up
      went the corners of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s splendid,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;splendid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The transaction, however, did not interest him; his uncle&rsquo;s judgment
      in such matters had a breezy soundness he would never dream of
      questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, about your settlement&rdquo;; and, touching a bell three
      times, Mr. Paramor walked up and down the room. &ldquo;Bring me the draft
      of Mr. Richard&rsquo;s marriage settlement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stalwart commissionaire reappearing with a document&mdash;&ldquo;Now
      then, Dick,&rdquo; said Mr. Paramor. &ldquo;She &lsquo;s not bringing
      anything into settlement, I understand; how &lsquo;s that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t want it,&rdquo; replied Shelton, unaccountably
      ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Paramor&rsquo;s lips quivered; he drew the draft closer, took up a
      blue pencil, and, squeezing Shelton&rsquo;s arm, began to read. The
      latter, following his uncle&rsquo;s rapid exposition of the clauses, was
      relieved when he paused suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you die and she marries again,&rdquo; said Mr. Paramor, &ldquo;she
      forfeits her life interest&mdash;see?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;wait a minute, Uncle Ted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Paramor waited, biting his pencil; a smile flickered on his mouth, and
      was decorously subdued. It was Shelton&rsquo;s turn to walk about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she marries again,&rdquo; he repeated to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Paramor was a keen fisherman; he watched his nephew as he might have
      watched a fish he had just landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very usual,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton took another turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She forfeits,&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;exactly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was dead, he would have no other way of seeing that she continued
      to belong to him. Exactly!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Paramor&rsquo;s haunting eyes were fastened on his nephew&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; they seemed to say, &ldquo;what &lsquo;s the
      matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly! Why should she have his money if she married again? She would
      forfeit it. There was comfort in the thought. Shelton came back and
      carefully reread the clause, to put the thing on a purely business basis,
      and disguise the real significance of what was passing in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I die and she marries again,&rdquo; he repeated aloud, &ldquo;she
      forfeits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What wiser provision for a man passionately in love could possibly have
      been devised? His uncle&rsquo;s eye travelled beyond him, humanely turning
      from the last despairing wriggles of his fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to tie her,&rdquo; said Shelton suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The corners of Mr. Paramour&rsquo;s mouth flew up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want the forfeiture out?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood rushed into Shelton&rsquo;s face; he felt he had been detected
      in a piece of sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite!&rdquo; The answer was a little sulky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle&rsquo;s pencil descended on the clause, and he resumed the
      reading of the draft, but Shelton could not follow it; he was too much
      occupied in considering exactly why Mr. Paramor had been amused, and to do
      this he was obliged to keep his eyes upon him. Those features, just
      pleasantly rugged; the springy poise of the figure; the hair neither
      straight nor curly, neither short nor long; the haunting look of his eyes
      and the humorous look of his mouth; his clothes neither shabby nor
      dandified; his serviceable, fine hands; above all, the equability of the
      hovering blue pencil, conveyed the impression of a perfect balance between
      heart and head, sensibility and reason, theory and its opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;During coverture,&rsquo;.rdquo; quoted Mr. Paramor, pausing
      again, &ldquo;you understand, of course, if you don&rsquo;t get on, and
      separate, she goes on taking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If they didn&rsquo;t get on! Shelton smiled. Mr. Paramor did not smile,
      and again Shelton had the sense of having knocked up against something
      poised but firm. He remarked irritably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we &lsquo;re not living together, all the more reason for her
      having it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This time his uncle smiled. It was difficult for Shelton to feel angry at
      that ironic merriment, with its sudden ending; it was too impersonal to
      irritate: it was too concerned with human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If&mdash;hum&mdash;it came to the other thing,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Paramor, &ldquo;the settlement&rsquo;s at an end as far as she &lsquo;s
      concerned. We &lsquo;re bound to look at every case, you know, old boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory of the play and his conversation with Halidome was still strong
      in Shelton. He was not one of those who could not face the notion of
      transferred affections&mdash;at a safe distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Uncle Ted,&rdquo; said he. For one mad moment he was
      attacked by the desire to &ldquo;throw in&rdquo; the case of divorce.
      Would it not be common chivalry to make her independent, able to change
      her affections if she wished, unhampered by monetary troubles? You only
      needed to take out the words &ldquo;during coverture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost anxiously he looked into his uncle&rsquo;s face. There was no
      meanness there, but neither was there encouragement in that comprehensive
      brow with its wide sweep of hair. &ldquo;Quixotism,&rdquo; it seemed to
      say, &ldquo;has merits, but&mdash;&rdquo; The room, too, with its wide
      horizon and tall windows, looking as if it dealt habitually in
      common-sense, discouraged him. Innumerable men of breeding and the
      soundest principles must have bought their wives in here. It was perfumed
      with the atmosphere of wisdom and law-calf. The aroma of Precedent was
      strong; Shelton swerved his lance, and once more settled down to complete
      the purchase of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t conceive what you&rsquo;re&mdash;in such a hurry for;
      you &lsquo;re not going to be married till the autumn,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Paramor, finishing at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Replacing the blue pencil in the rack, he took the red rose from the
      glass, and sniffed at it. &ldquo;Will you come with me as far as Pall
      Mall? I &lsquo;m going to take an afternoon off; too cold for Lord&rsquo;s,
      I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked into the Strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen this new play of Borogrove&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked
      Shelton, as they passed the theatre to which he had been with Halidome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never go to modern plays,&rdquo; replied Mr. Paramor; &ldquo;too
      d&mdash;-d gloomy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton glanced at him; he wore his hat rather far back on his head, his
      eyes haunted the street in front; he had shouldered his umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Psychology &lsquo;s not in your line, Uncle Ted?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what they call putting into words things that can&rsquo;t
      be put in words?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The French succeed in doing it,&rdquo; replied Shelton, &ldquo;and
      the Russians; why should n&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Paramor stopped to look in at a fishmonger&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s right for the French and Russians, Dick,&rdquo; he
      said &ldquo;is wrong for us. When we begin to be real, we only really
      begin to be false. I should like to have had the catching of that fellow;
      let&rsquo;s send him to your mother.&rdquo; He went in and bought a
      salmon:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear,&rdquo; he continued, as they went on, &ldquo;do you
      tell me that it&rsquo;s decent for men and women on the stage to writhe
      about like eels? Is n&rsquo;t life bad enough already?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It suddenly struck Shelton that, for all his smile, his uncle&rsquo;s face
      had a look of crucifixion. It was, perhaps, only the stronger sunlight in
      the open spaces of Trafalgar Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I think I prefer the
      truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad endings and the rest,&rdquo; said Mr. Paramor, pausing under
      one of Nelson&rsquo;s lions and taking Shelton by a button. &ldquo;Truth
      &lsquo;s the very devil!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there, very straight, his eyes haunting his nephew&rsquo;s face;
      there seemed to Shelton a touching muddle in his optimism&mdash;a muddle
      of tenderness and of intolerance, of truth and second-handedness. Like the
      lion above him, he seemed to be defying Life to make him look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; he said, handing sixpence to a sweeper; &ldquo;feelings
      are snakes! only fit to be kept in bottles with tight corks. You won&rsquo;t
      come to my club? Well, good-bye, old boy; my love to your mother when you
      see her&rdquo;; and turning up the Square, he left Shelton to go on to his
      own club, feeling that he had parted, not from his uncle, but from the
      nation of which they were both members by birth and blood and education.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE CLUB
    </h3>
    <p>
      He went into the library of his club, and took up Burke&rsquo;s Peerage.
      The words his uncle had said to him on hearing his engagement had been
      these: &ldquo;Dennant! Are those the Holm Oaks Dennants? She was a
      Penguin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No one who knew Mr. Paramor connected him with snobbery, but there had
      been an &ldquo;Ah! that &lsquo;s right; this is due to us&rdquo; tone
      about the saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton hunted for the name of Baltimore: &ldquo;Charles Penguin, fifth
      Baron Baltimore. Issue: Alice, b. 184-, m. 186-Algernon Dennant, Esq., of
      Holm Oaks, Cross Eaton, Oxfordshire.&rdquo; He put down the Peerage and
      took up the &lsquo;Landed Gentry&rsquo;. &ldquo;Dennant, Algernon Cuffe,
      eldest son of the late Algernon Cuffe Dennant, Esq., J. P., and Irene, 2nd
      daur. of the Honble. Philip and Lady Lillian March Mallow; ed. Eton and
      Ch. Ch., Oxford, J. P. for Oxfordshire. Residence, Holm Oaks,&rdquo; etc.,
      etc. Dropping the &lsquo;Landed Gentry&rsquo;, he took up a volume of the
      &lsquo;Arabian Nights&rsquo;, which some member had left reposing on the
      book-rest of his chair, but instead of reading he kept looking round the
      room. In almost every seat, reading or snoozing, were gentlemen who, in
      their own estimation, might have married Penguins. For the first time it
      struck him with what majestic leisureliness they turned the pages of their
      books, trifled with their teacups, or lightly snored. Yet no two were
      alike&mdash;a tall man-with dark moustache, thick hair, and red, smooth
      cheeks; another, bald, with stooping shoulders; a tremendous old buck,
      with a grey, pointed beard and large white waistcoat; a clean-shaven
      dapper man past middle age, whose face was like a bird&rsquo;s; a long,
      sallow, misanthrope; and a sanguine creature fast asleep. Asleep or awake,
      reading or snoring, fat or thin, hairy or bald, the insulation of their
      red or pale faces was complete. They were all the creatures of good form.
      Staring at them or reading the Arabian Nights Shelton spent the time
      before dinner. He had not been long seated in the dining-room when a
      distant connection strolled up and took the next table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Shelton! Back? Somebody told me you were goin&rsquo; round the
      world.&rdquo; He scrutinised the menu through his eyeglass. &ldquo;Clear
      soup! . . . Read Jellaby&rsquo;s speech? Amusing the way he squashes all
      those fellows. Best man in the House, he really is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton paused in the assimilation of asparagus; he, too, had been in the
      habit of admiring Jellaby, but now he wondered why. The red and shaven
      face beside him above a broad, pure shirt-front was swollen by good
      humour; his small, very usual, and hard eyes were fixed introspectively on
      the successful process of his eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Success!&rdquo; thought Shelton, suddenly enlightened&mdash;&ldquo;success
      is what we admire in Jellaby. We all want success . . . . Yes,&rdquo; he
      admitted, &ldquo;a successful beast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said his neighbour, &ldquo;I forgot. You&rsquo;re in the
      other camp?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not particularly. Where did you get that idea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His neighbour looked round negligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I somehow thought so&rdquo;; and Shelton
      almost heard him adding, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something not quite sound
      about you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you admire Jellaby?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knows his own mind,&rdquo; replied his neighbour; &ldquo;it &lsquo;s
      more than the others do . . . . This whitebait is n&rsquo;t fit for cats!
      Clever fellow, Jellaby! No nonsense about him! Have you ever heard him
      speak? Awful good sport to watch him sittin&rsquo; on the Opposition. A
      poor lot they are!&rdquo; and he laughed, either from appreciation of
      Jellaby sitting on a small minority, or from appreciation of the champagne
      bubbles in his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minorities are always depressing,&rdquo; said Shelton dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s irritating to look
      at people who have n&rsquo;t a chance of success&mdash;fellows who make a
      mess of things, fanatics, and all that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His neighbour turned his eyes inquisitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;yes, quite,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you take
      mint sauce? It&rsquo;s the best part of lamb, I always think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The great room with its countless little tables, arranged so that every
      man might have the support of the gold walls to his back, began to regain
      its influence on Shelton. How many times had he not sat there, carefully
      nodding to acquaintances, happy if he got the table he was used to, a
      paper with the latest racing, and someone to gossip with who was not a
      bounder; while the sensation of having drunk enough stole over him. Happy!
      That is, happy as a horse is happy who never leaves his stall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at poor little Bing puffin&rsquo; about,&rdquo; said his
      neighbour, pointing to a weazened, hunchy waiter. &ldquo;His asthma&rsquo;s
      awf&rsquo;ly bad; you can hear him wheezin&rsquo; from the street.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There &lsquo;s no such thing as moral asthma, I suppose?&rdquo;
      said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      His neighbour dropped his eyeglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, take this away; it&rsquo;s overdone;&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Bring
      me some lamb.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton pushed his table back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the Stilton&rsquo;s excellent!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His neighbour raised his brows, and dropped his eyes again upon his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall Shelton went from force of habit to the weighing-scales and
      took his weight. &ldquo;Eleven stone!&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;gone up!&rdquo;
      and, clipping a cigar, he sat down in the smoking-room with a novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      After half an hour he dropped the book. There seemed something rather
      fatuous about this story, for though it had a thrilling plot, and was full
      of well-connected people, it had apparently been contrived to throw no
      light on anything whatever. He looked at the author&rsquo;s name; everyone
      was highly recommending it. He began thinking, and staring at the fire....
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking up, he saw Antonia&rsquo;s second brother, a young man in the
      Rifles, bending over him with sunny cheeks and lazy smile, clearly just a
      little drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Congratulate you, old chap! I say, what made you grow that
      b-b-eastly beard?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pillbottle of the Duchess!&rdquo; read young Dennant, taking up the
      book. &ldquo;You been reading that? Rippin&rsquo;, is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ripping!&rdquo; replied Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rippin&rsquo; plot! When you get hold of a novel you don&rsquo;t
      want any rot about&mdash;what d&rsquo;you call it?&mdash;psychology, you
      want to be amused.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; murmured Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an awfully good bit where the President steals her
      diamonds There&rsquo;s old Benjy! Hallo, Benjy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Bill, old man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This Benjy was a young, clean-shaven creature, whose face and voice and
      manner were a perfect blend of steel and geniality.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to this young man who was so smooth and hard and cheery, a
      grey, short-bearded gentleman, with misanthropic eyes, called Stroud, came
      up; together with another man of Shelton&rsquo;s age, with a moustache and
      a bald patch the size of a crown-piece, who might be seen in the club any
      night of the year when there was no racing out of reach of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; began young Dennant, &ldquo;that this bounder&rdquo;&mdash;he
      slapped the young man Benjy on the knee&mdash;&ldquo;is going to be
      spliced to-morrow. Miss Casserol&mdash;you know the Casserols&mdash;Muncaster
      Gate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Shelton, delighted to be able to say something
      they would understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Champion&rsquo;s the best man, and I &lsquo;m the second
      best. I tell you what, old chap, you &lsquo;d better come with me and get
      your eye in; you won&rsquo;t get such another chance of practice. Benjy
      &lsquo;ll give you a card.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted!&rdquo; murmured Benjy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. Briabas; two-thirty. Come and see how they do the trick. I&rsquo;ll
      call for you at one; we&rsquo;ll have some lunch and go together&rdquo;;
      again he patted Benjy&rsquo;s knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton nodded his assent; the piquant callousness of the affair had made
      him shiver, and furtively he eyed the steely Benjy, whose suavity had
      never wavered, and who appeared to take a greater interest in some
      approaching race than in his coming marriage. But Shelton knew from his
      own sensations that this could not really be the case; it was merely a
      question of &ldquo;good form,&rdquo; the conceit of a superior breeding,
      the duty not to give oneself away. And when in turn he marked the eyes of
      Stroud fixed on Benjy, under shaggy brows, and the curious greedy glances
      of the racing man, he felt somehow sorry for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who &lsquo;s that fellow with the game leg&mdash;I&rsquo;m always
      seeing him about?&rdquo; asked the racing man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Shelton saw a sallow man, conspicuous for a want of parting in his
      hair and a certain restlessness of attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is Bayes,&rdquo; said Stroud; &ldquo;spends half his time
      among the Chinese&mdash;must have a grudge against them! And now he
      &lsquo;s got his leg he can&rsquo;t go there any more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chinese? What does he do to them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bibles or guns. Don&rsquo;t ask me! An adventurer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks a bit of a bounder,&rdquo; said the racing man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton gazed at the twitching eyebrows of old Stroud; he saw at once how
      it must annoy a man who had a billet in the &ldquo;Woods and Forests,&rdquo;
      and plenty of time for &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; and gossip at his club, to see
      these people with untidy lives. A minute later the man with the &ldquo;game
      leg&rdquo; passed close behind his chair, and Shelton perceived at once
      how intelligible the resentment of his fellow-members was. He had eyes
      which, not uncommon in this country, looked like fires behind steel bars;
      he seemed the very kind of man to do all sorts of things that were &ldquo;bad
      form,&rdquo; a man who might even go as far as chivalry. He looked
      straight at Shelton, and his uncompromising glance gave an impression of
      fierce loneliness; altogether, an improper person to belong to such a
      club. Shelton remembered the words of an old friend of his father&rsquo;s:
      &ldquo;Yes, Dick, all sorts of fellows belong here, and they come here for
      all sorts o&rsquo; reasons, and a lot of em come because they&rsquo;ve
      nowhere else to go, poor beggars&rdquo;; and, glancing from the man with
      the &ldquo;game leg&rdquo; to Stroud, it occurred to Shelton that even he,
      old Stroud, might be one of these poor beggars. One never knew! A look at
      Benjy, contained and cheery, restored him. Ah, the lucky devil! He would
      not have to come here any more! and the thought of the last evening he
      himself would be spending before long flooded his mind with a sweetness
      that was almost pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benjy, I&rsquo;ll play you a hundred up!&rdquo; said young Bill
      Dennant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stroud and the racing man went to watch the game; Shelton was left once
      more to reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good form!&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;that fellow must be made of
      steel. They&rsquo;ll go on somewhere; stick about half the night playing
      poker, or some such foolery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed over to the window. Rain had begun to fall; the streets looked
      wild and draughty. The cabmen were putting on their coats. Two women
      scurried by, huddled under one umbrella, and a thin-clothed,
      dogged-looking scarecrow lounged past with a surly, desperate step.
      Shelton, returning to his chair, threaded his way amongst his
      fellow-members. A procession of old school and college friends came up
      before his eyes. After all, what had there been in his own education, or
      theirs, to give them any other standard than this &ldquo;good form&rdquo;?
      What had there been to teach them anything of life? Their imbecility was
      incredible when you came to think of it. They had all the air of knowing
      everything, and really they knew nothing&mdash;nothing of Nature, Art, or
      the Emotions; nothing of the bonds that bind all men together. Why, even
      such words were not &ldquo;good form&rdquo;; nothing outside their little
      circle was &ldquo;good form.&rdquo; They had a fixed point of view over
      life because they came of certain schools, and colleges, and regiments!
      And they were those in charge of the state, of laws, and science, of the
      army, and religion. Well, it was their system&mdash;the system not to
      start too young, to form healthy fibre, and let the after-life develop it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Successful!&rdquo; he thought, nearly stumbling over a pair of
      patent-leather boots belonging to a moon-faced, genial-looking member with
      gold nose-nippers; &ldquo;oh, it &lsquo;s successful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody came and picked up from the table the very volume which had
      originally inspired this train of thought, and Shelton could see his
      solemn pleasure as he read. In the white of his eye there was a torpid and
      composed abstraction. There was nothing in that book to startle him or
      make him think.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon-faced member with the patent boots came up and began talking of
      his recent visit to the south of France. He had a scandalous anecdote or
      two to tell, and his broad face beamed behind his gold nose-nippers; he
      was a large man with such a store of easy, worldly humour that it was
      impossible not to appreciate his gossip, he gave so perfect an impression
      of enjoying life, and doing himself well. &ldquo;Well, good-night!&rdquo;
      he murmured&mdash;&ldquo;An engagement!&rdquo;&mdash;and the certainty he
      left behind that his engagement must be charming and illicit was pleasant
      to the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, slowly taking up his glass, Shelton drank; the sense of well-being
      was upon him. His superiority to these his fellow-members soothed him. He
      saw through all the sham of this club life, the meanness of this worship
      of success, the sham of kid-gloved novelists, &ldquo;good form,&rdquo; and
      the terrific decency of our education. It was soothing thus to see through
      things, soothing thus to be superior; and from the soft recesses of his
      chair he puffed out smoke and stretched his limbs toward the fire; and the
      fire burned back at him with a discreet and venerable glow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE WEDDING
    </h3>
    <p>
      Punctual to his word, Bill Dennant called for Shelton at one o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet old Benjy&rsquo;s feeling a bit cheap,&rdquo; said he, as
      they got out of their cab at the church door and passed between the
      crowded files of unelect, whose eyes, so curious and pitiful, devoured
      them from the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ashen face of a woman, with a baby in her arms and two more by her
      side, looked as eager as if she had never experienced the pangs of ragged
      matrimony. Shelton went in inexplicably uneasy; the price of his tie was
      their board and lodging for a week. He followed his future brother-in-law
      to a pew on the bridegroom&rsquo;s side, for, with intuitive perception of
      the sexes&rsquo; endless warfare, each of the opposing parties to this
      contract had its serried battalion, the arrows of whose suspicion kept
      glancing across and across the central aisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill Dennant&rsquo;s eyes began to twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s old Benjy!&rdquo; he whispered; and Shelton looked at
      the hero of the day. A subdued pallor was traceable under the weathered
      uniformity of his shaven face; but the well-bred, artificial smile he bent
      upon the guests had its wonted steely suavity. About his dress and his
      neat figure was that studied ease which lifts men from the ruck of common
      bridegrooms. There were no holes in his armour through which the
      impertinent might pry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old Benjy!&rdquo; whispered young Dennant; &ldquo;I say, they
      look a bit short of class, those Casserols.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton, who was acquainted with this family, smiled. The sensuous
      sanctity all round had begun to influence him. A perfume of flowers and
      dresses fought with the natural odour of the church; the rustle of
      whisperings and skirts struck through the native silence of the aisles,
      and Shelton idly fixed his eyes on a lady in the pew in front; without in
      the least desiring to make a speculation of this sort, he wondered whether
      her face was as charming as the lines of her back in their delicate,
      skin-tight setting of pearl grey; his glance wandered to the chancel with
      its stacks of flowers, to the grave, business faces of the presiding
      priests, till the organ began rolling out the wedding march.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; whispered young Dermant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton was conscious of a shiver running through the audience which
      reminded him of a bullfight he had seen in Spain. The bride came slowly up
      the aisle. &ldquo;Antonia will look like that,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and
      the church will be filled with people like this . . . . She&rsquo;ll be a
      show to them!&rdquo; The bride was opposite him now, and by an instinct of
      common chivalry he turned away his eyes; it seemed to him a shame to look
      at that downcast head above the silver mystery of her perfect raiment; the
      modest head full, doubtless, of devotion and pure yearnings; the stately
      head where no such thought as &ldquo;How am I looking, this day of all
      days, before all London?&rdquo; had ever entered; the proud head, which no
      such fear as &ldquo;How am I carrying it off?&rdquo; could surely be
      besmirching.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw below the surface of this drama played before his eyes, and set his
      face, as a man might who found himself assisting at a sacrifice. The words
      fell, unrelenting, on his ears: &ldquo;For better, for worse, for richer,
      for poorer; in sickness and in health&mdash;&rdquo; and opening the Prayer
      Book he found the Marriage Service, which he had not looked at since he
      was a boy, and as he read he had some very curious sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this would soon be happening to himself! He went on reading in a kind
      of stupor, until aroused by his companion whispering, &ldquo;No luck!&rdquo;
      All around there rose a rustling of skirts; he saw a tall figure mount the
      pulpit and stand motionless. Massive and high-featured, sunken of eye, he
      towered, in snowy cambric and a crimson stole, above the blackness of his
      rostrum; it seemed he had been chosen for his beauty. Shelton was still
      gazing at the stitching of his gloves, when once again the organ played
      the Wedding March. All were smiling, and a few were weeping, craning their
      heads towards the bride. &ldquo;Carnival of second-hand emotions!&rdquo;
      thought Shelton; and he, too, craned his head and brushed his hat. Then,
      smirking at his friends, he made his way towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Casserols&rsquo; house he found himself at last going round the
      presents with the eldest Casserol surviving, a tall girl in pale violet,
      who had been chief bridesmaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t it go off well, Mr. Shelton?&rdquo; she was saying
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, awfully!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always think it&rsquo;s so awkward for the man waiting up there
      for the bride to come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s smart, the bridesmaids having no
      hats?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton had not noticed this improvement, but he agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my idea; I think it &lsquo;s very chic. They &lsquo;ve had
      fifteen tea-sets-so dull, is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; Shelton hastened to remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, its fearfully useful to have a lot of things you don&rsquo;t
      want; of course, you change them for those you do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of London seemed to have disgorged its shops into this room; he
      looked at Miss Casserol&rsquo;s face, and was greatly struck by the shrewd
      acquisitiveness of her small eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your future brother-in-law?&rdquo; she asked, pointing to
      Bill Dennant with a little movement of her chin; &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s
      such a bright boy. I want you both to come to dinner, and help to keep
      things jolly. It&rsquo;s so deadly after a wedding.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Shelton said they would.
    </p>
    <p>
      They adjourned to the hall now, to wait for the bride&rsquo;s departure.
      Her face as she came down the stairs was impassive, gay, with a furtive
      trouble in the eyes, and once more Shelton had the odd sensation of having
      sinned against his manhood. Jammed close to him was her old nurse, whose
      puffy, yellow face was pouting with emotion, while tears rolled from her
      eyes. She was trying to say something, but in the hubbub her farewell was
      lost. There was a scamper to the carriage, a flurry of rice and flowers;
      the shoe was flung against the sharply drawn-up window. Then Benjy&rsquo;s
      shaven face was seen a moment, bland and steely; the footman folded his
      arms, and with a solemn crunch the brougham wheels rolled away. &ldquo;How
      splendidly it went off!&rdquo; said a voice on Shelton&rsquo;s right.
      &ldquo;She looked a little pale,&rdquo; said a voice on Shelton&rsquo;s
      left. He put his hand up to his forehead; behind him the old nurse
      sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; said young Dennant in his ear, &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t
      good enough; I vote we bolt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton assenting, they walked towards the Park; nor could he tell whether
      the slight nausea he experienced was due to afternoon champagne or to the
      ceremony that had gone so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you?&rdquo; asked Dennant; &ldquo;you look as
      glum as any m-monkey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;I was only thinking what
      humbugs we all are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill Dennant stopped in the middle of the crossing, and clapped his future
      brother-in-law upon the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re going to talk shop, I
      &lsquo;m off.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE DINNER
    </h3>
    <p>
      The dinner at the Casserols&rsquo; was given to those of the bride&rsquo;s
      friends who had been conspicuous in the day&rsquo;s festivities. Shelton
      found himself between Miss Casserol and a lady undressed to much the same
      degree. Opposite sat a man with a single diamond stud, a white waistcoat,
      black moustache, and hawk-like face. This was, in fact, one of those
      interesting houses occupied by people of the upper middle class who have
      imbibed a taste for smart society. Its inhabitants, by nature acquisitive
      and cautious, economical, tenacious, had learnt to worship the word
      &ldquo;smart.&rdquo; The result was a kind of heavy froth, an air of
      thoroughly domestic vice. In addition to the conventionally fast, Shelton
      had met there one or two ladies, who, having been divorced, or having yet
      to be, still maintained their position in &ldquo;society.&rdquo; Divorced
      ladies who did not so maintain their place were never to be found, for the
      Casserols had a great respect for marriage. He had also met there American
      ladies who were &ldquo;too amusing&rdquo;&mdash;never, of course, American
      men, Mesopotamians of the financial or the racing type, and several of
      those gentlemen who had been, or were about to be, engaged in a
      transaction which might or again might not, &ldquo;come off,&rdquo; and in
      conduct of an order which might, or again might not be spotted. The line
      he knew, was always drawn at those in any category who were actually found
      out, for the value of these ladies and these gentlemen was not their claim
      to pity&mdash;nothing so sentimental&mdash;but their &ldquo;smartness,&rdquo;
      clothes, jokes, racing tips, their &ldquo;bridge parties,&rdquo; and their
      motors.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sum, the house was one whose fundamental domesticity attracted and
      sheltered those who were too &ldquo;smart&rdquo; to keep their heads for
      long above the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      His host, a grey, clean-shaven city man, with a long upper lip, was trying
      to understand a lady the audacity of whose speech came ringing down the
      table. Shelton himself had given up the effort with his neighbours, and
      made love to his dinner, which, surviving the incoherence of the
      atmosphere, emerged as a work of art. It was with surprise that he found
      Miss Casserol addressing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always say that the great thing is to be jolly. If you can&rsquo;t
      find anything to make you laugh, pretend you do; it&rsquo;s so much
      &lsquo;smarter to be amusin&rsquo;. Now don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosophy seemed excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t all be geniuses, but we can all look jolly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton hastened to look jolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell the governor, when he &lsquo;s glum, that I shall put up the
      shutters and leave him. What&rsquo;s the good of mopin&rsquo; and lookin&rsquo;
      miserable? Are you going to the Four-in-Hand Meet? We&rsquo;re making a
      party. Such fun; all the smart people!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The splendour of her shoulders, her frizzy hair (clearly not two hours out
      of the barber&rsquo;s hands), might have made him doubtful; but the frank
      shrewdness in her eyes, and her carefully clipped tone of voice, were
      guarantees that she was part of the element at the table which was really
      quite respectable. He had never realised before how &ldquo;smart&rdquo;
      she was, and with an effort abandoned himself to a sort of gaiety that
      would have killed a Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when she left him, he reflected upon the expression of her eyes when
      they rested on a lady opposite, who was a true bird-of-prey. &ldquo;What
      is it,&rdquo; their envious, inquisitive glance had seemed to say, &ldquo;that
      makes you so really &lsquo;smart&rsquo;.&rdquo; And while still seeking
      for the reason, he noticed his host pointing out the merits of his port to
      the hawk-like man, with a deferential air quite pitiful to see, for the
      hawk-like man was clearly a &ldquo;bad hat.&rdquo; What in the name of
      goodness did these staid bourgeois mean by making up to vice? Was it a
      craving to be thought distinguished, a dread of being dull, or merely an
      effect of overfeeding? Again he looked at his host, who had not yet
      enumerated all the virtues of his port, and again felt sorry for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going to marry Antonia Dennant?&rdquo; said a voice
      on his right, with that easy coarseness which is a mark of caste. &ldquo;Pretty
      girl! They&rsquo;ve a nice place, the, Dennants. D&rsquo; ye know, you&rsquo;re
      a lucky feller!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker was an old baronet, with small eyes, a dusky, ruddy face, and
      peculiar hail-fellow-well-met expression, at once morose and sly. He was
      always hard up, but being a man of enterprise knew all the best people, as
      well as all the worst, so that he dined out every night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lucky feller,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      got some deuced good shootin&rsquo;, Dennant! They come too high for me,
      though; never touched a feather last time I shot there. She&rsquo;s a
      pretty girl. You &lsquo;re a lucky feller!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said Shelton humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish I were in your shoes. Who was that sittin&rsquo; on the other
      side of you? I&rsquo;m so dashed short-sighted. Mrs. Carruther? Oh, ay!&rdquo;
      An expression which, if he had not been a baronet, would have been a leer,
      came on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton felt that he was referring to the leaf in his mental pocket-book
      covered with the anecdotes, figures, and facts about that lady. &ldquo;The
      old ogre means,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m lucky because his
      leaf is blank about Antonia.&rdquo; But the old baronet had turned, with
      his smile, and his sardonic, well-bred air, to listen to a bit of scandal
      on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men to Shelton&rsquo;s left were talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! You don&rsquo;t collect anything? How&rsquo;s that? Everybody
      collects something. I should be lost without my pictures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t collect anything. Given it up; I was too awfully
      had over my Walkers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton had expected a more lofty reason; he applied himself to the
      Madeira in his glass. That, had been &ldquo;collected&rdquo; by his host,
      and its price was going up! You couldn&rsquo;t get it every day; worth two
      guineas a bottle! How precious the idea that other people couldn&rsquo;t
      get it, made it seem! Liquid delight; the price was going up! Soon there
      would be none left; immense! Absolutely no one, then, could drink it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish I had some of this,&rdquo; said the old baronet, &ldquo;but I
      have drunk all mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old chap!&rdquo; thought Shelton; &ldquo;after all, he&rsquo;s
      not a bad old boy. I wish I had his pluck. His liver must be splendid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawing-room was full of people playing a game concerned with horses
      ridden by jockeys with the latest seat. And Shelton was compelled to help
      in carrying on this sport till early in the morning. At last he left,
      exhausted by his animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of the wedding; he thought over his dinner and the wine that he
      had drunk. His mood of satisfaction fizzled out. These people were
      incapable of being real, even the smartest, even the most respectable;
      they seemed to weigh their pleasures in the scales and to get the most
      that could be gotten for their money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the dark, safe houses stretching for miles and miles, his thoughts
      were of Antonia; and as he reached his rooms he was overtaken by the
      moment when the town is born again. The first new air had stolen down; the
      sky was living, but not yet alight; the trees were quivering faintly; no
      living creature stirred, and nothing spoke except his heart. Suddenly the
      city seemed to breathe, and Shelton saw that he was not alone; an
      unconsidered trifle with inferior boots was asleep upon his doorstep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN ALIEN
    </h3>
    <p>
      The individual on the doorstep had fallen into slumber over his own knees.
      No greater air of prosperity clung about him than is conveyed by a rusty
      overcoat and wisps of cloth in place of socks. Shelton endeavoured to pass
      unseen, but the sleeper woke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s you, monsieur!&rdquo; he said &ldquo;I received your
      letter this evening, and have lost no time.&rdquo; He looked down at
      himself and tittered, as though to say, &ldquo;But what a state I &lsquo;m
      in!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young foreigner&rsquo;s condition was indeed more desperate than on
      the occasion of their first meeting, and Shelton invited him upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can well understand,&rdquo; stammered Ferrand, following his
      host, &ldquo;that I did n&rsquo;t want to miss you this time. When one is
      like this&mdash;&rdquo; and a spasm gripped his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m very glad you came,&rdquo; said Shelton doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      His visitor&rsquo;s face had a week&rsquo;s growth of reddish beard; the
      deep tan of his cheeks gave him a robust appearance at variance with the
      fit of, trembling which had seized on him as soon as he had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down-sit down,&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;you &lsquo;re
      feeling ill!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrand smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;bad
      nourishment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton left him seated on the edge of an armchair, and brought him in
      some whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clothes,&rdquo; said Ferrand, when he had drunk, &ldquo;are what I
      want. These are really not good enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The statement was correct, and Shelton, placing some garments in the
      bath-room, invited his visitor to make himself at home. While the latter,
      then, was doing this, Shelton enjoyed the luxuries of self-denial, hunting
      up things he did not want, and laying them in two portmanteaus. This done,
      he waited for his visitor&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young foreigner at length emerged, unshaved indeed, and innocent of
      boots, but having in other respects an air of gratifying affluence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a little different,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The boots, I
      fear&rdquo;&mdash;and, pulling down his, or rather Shelton&rsquo;s, socks
      he exhibited sores the size of half a crown. &ldquo;One does n&rsquo;t sow
      without reaping some harvest or another. My stomach has shrunk,&rdquo; he
      added simply. &ldquo;To see things one must suffer. &lsquo;Voyager, c&rsquo;est
      plus fort que moi&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton failed to perceive that this was one way of disguising the human
      animal&rsquo;s natural dislike of work&mdash;there was a touch of pathos,
      a suggestion of God-knows-what-might-have-been, about this fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have eaten my illusions,&rdquo; said the young foreigner, smoking
      a cigarette. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve starved a few times, your eyes are
      opened. &lsquo;Savoir, c&rsquo;est mon metier; mais remarquez ceci,
      monsieur&rsquo;. It &lsquo;s not always the intellectuals who succeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you get a job,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;you throw it away,
      I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You accuse me of restlessness? Shall I explain what I think about
      that? I&rsquo;m restless because of ambition; I want to reconquer an
      independent position. I put all my soul into my trials, but as soon as I
      see there&rsquo;s no future for me in that line, I give it up and go
      elsewhere. &lsquo;Je ne veux pas etre rond de cuir,&rsquo; breaking my
      back to economise sixpence a day, and save enough after forty years to
      drag out the remains of an exhausted existence. That&rsquo;s not in my
      character.&rdquo; This ingenious paraphrase of the words &ldquo;I soon get
      tired of things&rdquo; he pronounced with an air of letting Shelton into a
      precious secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it must be hard,&rdquo; agreed the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrand shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not all butter,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;one is obliged
      to do things that are not too delicate. There&rsquo;s nothing I pride
      myself on but frankness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a good chemist, however, he administered what Shelton could stand in
      a judicious way. &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he seemed to say, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d
      like me to think that you have a perfect knowledge of life: no morality,
      no prejudices, no illusions; you&rsquo;d like me to think that you feel
      yourself on an equality with me, one human animal talking to another,
      without any barriers of position, money, clothes, or the rest&mdash;&rsquo;ca
      c&rsquo;est un peu trop fort&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re as good an imitation as
      I &lsquo;ve come across in your class, notwithstanding your unfortunate
      education, and I &lsquo;m grateful to you, but to tell you everything, as
      it passes through my mind would damage my prospects. You can hardly expect
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of Shelton&rsquo;s old frock-coats he was impressive, with his air
      of natural, almost sensitive refinement. The room looked as if it were
      accustomed to him, and more amazing still was the sense of familiarity
      that he inspired, as, though he were a part of Shelton&rsquo;s soul. It
      came as a shock to realise that this young foreign vagabond had taken such
      a place within his thoughts. The pose of his limbs and head, irregular but
      not ungraceful; his disillusioned lips; the rings of smoke that issued
      from them&mdash;all signified rebellion, and the overthrow of law and
      order. His thin, lopsided nose, the rapid glances of his goggling,
      prominent eyes, were subtlety itself; he stood for discontent with the
      accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I live when I am on the tramp?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;well,
      there are the consuls. The system is not delicate, but when it&rsquo;s a
      question of starving, much is permissible; besides, these gentlemen were
      created for the purpose. There&rsquo;s a coterie of German Jews in Paris
      living entirely upon consuls.&rdquo; He hesitated for the fraction of a
      second, and resumed: &ldquo;Yes, monsieur; if you have papers that fit
      you, you can try six or seven consuls in a single town. You must know a
      language or two; but most of these gentlemen are not too well up in the
      tongues of the country they represent. Obtaining money under false
      pretences? Well, it is. But what&rsquo;s the difference at bottom between
      all this honourable crowd of directors, fashionable physicians, employers
      of labour, ferry-builders, military men, country priests, and consuls
      themselves perhaps, who take money and give no value for it, and poor
      devils who do the same at far greater risk? Necessity makes the law. If
      those gentlemen were in my position, do you think that they would
      hesitate?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton&rsquo;s face remaining doubtful, Ferrand went on instantly:
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right; they would, from fear, not principle. One must
      be hard pressed before committing these indelicacies. Look deep enough,
      and you will see what indelicate things are daily done by the respectable
      for not half so good a reason as the want of meals.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton also took a cigarette&mdash;his own income was derived from
      property for which he gave no value in labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give you an instance,&rdquo; said Ferrand, &ldquo;of what can
      be done by resolution. One day in a German town, &lsquo;etant dans la
      misere&rsquo;, I decided to try the French consul. Well, as you know, I am
      a Fleming, but something had to be screwed out somewhere. He refused to
      see me; I sat down to wait. After about two hours a voice bellowed:
      &lsquo;Has n&rsquo;t the brute gone?&rsquo; and my consul appears. &lsquo;I
      &lsquo;ve nothing for fellows like you,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;clear out!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Monsieur,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;I am skin and bone; I
      really must have assistance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Clear out,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;or the police shall throw
      you out!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t budge. Another hour passes, and back he comes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Still here?&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Fetch a sergeant.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sergeant comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sergeant,&rsquo; says the consul, &lsquo;turn this creature
      out.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sergeant,&rsquo; I say, &lsquo;this house is France!&rsquo;
      Naturally, I had calculated upon that. In Germany they&rsquo;re not too
      fond of those who undertake the business of the French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He is right,&rsquo; says the sergeant; &lsquo;I can do
      nothing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You refuse?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Absolutely.&rsquo; And he went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What do you think you&rsquo;ll get by staying?&rsquo; says
      my consul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have nothing to eat or drink, and nowhere to sleep,&rsquo;
      says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What will you go for?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ten marks.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here, then, get out!&rsquo; I can tell you, monsieur, one
      must n&rsquo;t have a thin skin if one wants to exploit consuls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His yellow fingers slowly rolled the stump of his cigarette, his ironical
      lips flickered. Shelton thought of his own ignorance of life. He could not
      recollect ever having gone without a meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said feebly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve often
      starved.&rdquo; For, having always been so well fed, the idea of
      starvation was attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrand smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four days is the longest,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t
      believe that story.... It was in Paris, and I had lost my money on the
      race-course. There was some due from home which didn&rsquo;t come. Four
      days and nights I lived on water. My clothes were excellent, and I had
      jewellery; but I never even thought of pawning them. I suffered most from
      the notion that people might guess my state. You don&rsquo;t recognise me
      now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old were you then?&rdquo; said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventeen; it&rsquo;s curious what one&rsquo;s like at that age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By a flash of insight Shelton saw the well-dressed boy, with sensitive,
      smooth face, always on the move about the streets of Paris, for fear that
      people should observe the condition of his stomach. The story was a
      valuable commentary. His thoughts were brusquely interrupted; looking in
      Ferrand&rsquo;s face, he saw to his dismay tears rolling down his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve suffered too much,&rdquo; he stammered; &ldquo;what do
      I care now what becomes of me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton was disconcerted; he wished &lsquo;to say something sympathetic,&rsquo;
      but, being an Englishman, could only turn away his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your turn &lsquo;s coming,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! when you&rsquo;ve lived my life,&rdquo; broke out his visitor,
      &ldquo;nothing &lsquo;s any good. My heart&rsquo;s in rags. Find me
      anything worth keeping, in this menagerie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved though he was, Shelton wriggled in his chair, a prey to racial
      instinct, to an ingrained over-tenderness, perhaps, of soul that forbade
      him from exposing his emotions, and recoiled from the revelation of other
      people&rsquo;s. He could stand it on the stage, he could stand it in a
      book, but in real life he could not stand it. When Ferrand had gone off
      with a portmanteau in each hand, he sat down and told Antonia:
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . The poor chap broke down and sat crying like a child; and instead of
      making me feel sorry, it turned me into stone. The more sympathetic I
      wanted to be, the gruffer I grew. Is it fear of ridicule, independence, or
      consideration, for others that prevents one from showing one&rsquo;s
      feelings?
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on to tell her of Ferrand&rsquo;s starving four days sooner than
      face a pawnbroker; and, reading the letter over before addressing it, the
      faces of the three ladies round their snowy cloth arose before him&mdash;Antonia&rsquo;s
      face, so fair and calm and wind-fresh; her mother&rsquo;s face, a little
      creased by time and weather; the maiden aunt&rsquo;s somewhat too thin-and
      they seemed to lean at him, alert and decorous, and the words &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      rather nice!&rdquo; rang in his ears. He went out to post the letter, and
      buying a five-shilling order enclosed it to the little barber, Carolan, as
      a reward for delivering his note to Ferrand. He omitted to send his
      address with this donation, but whether from delicacy or from caution he
      could not have said. Beyond doubt, however, on receiving through Ferrand
      the following reply, he felt ashamed and pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      3, BLANK ROW, WESTMINSTER.
    </p>
    <p>
      From every well-born soul humanity is owing. A thousand thanks. I received
      this morning your postal order; your heart henceforth for me will be
      placed beyond all praise.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE VISION
    </h3>
    <p>
      A few days later he received a letter from Antonia which filled him with
      excitement:
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . Aunt Charlotte is ever so much better, so mother thinks we can go
      home-hurrah! But she says that you and I must keep to our arrangement not
      to see each other till July. There will be something fine in being so near
      and having the strength to keep apart . . . All the English are gone. I
      feel it so empty out here; these people are so funny-all foreign and
      shallow. Oh, Dick! how splendid to have an ideal to look up to! Write at
      once to Brewer&rsquo;s Hotel and tell me you think the same.... We arrive
      at Charing Cross on Sunday at half-past seven, stay at Brewer&rsquo;s for
      a couple of nights, and go down on Tuesday to Holm Oaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always your
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTONIA.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s coming tomorrow!&rdquo;
      and, leaving his neglected breakfast, he started out to walk off his
      emotion. His square ran into one of those slums that still rub shoulders
      with the most distinguished situations, and in it he came upon a little
      crowd assembled round a dogfight. One of the dogs was being mauled, but
      the day was muddy, and Shelton, like any well-bred Englishman, had a
      horror of making himself conspicuous even in a decent cause; he looked for
      a policeman. One was standing by, to see fair play, and Shelton made
      appeal to him. The official suggested that he should not have brought out
      a fighting dog, and advised him to throw cold water over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is n &lsquo;t my dog,&rdquo; said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should let &lsquo;em be,&rdquo; remarked the policeman with
      evident surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton appealed indefinitely to the lower orders. The lower orders,
      however, were afraid of being bitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would n&rsquo;t meddle with that there job if I was you,&rdquo;
      said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nasty breed o&rsquo; dawg is that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was therefore obliged to cast away respectability, spoil his trousers
      and his gloves, break his umbrella, drop his hat in the mud, and separate
      the dogs. At the conclusion of the &ldquo;job,&rdquo; the lower orders
      said to him in a rather shamefaced spanner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never thought you&rsquo;d have managed that, sir&rdquo;;
      but, like all men of inaction, Shelton after action was more dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;n it!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one can&rsquo;t let a
      dog be killed&rdquo;; and he marched off, towing the injured dog with his
      pocket-handkerchief, and looking scornfully at harmless passers-by. Having
      satisfied for once the smouldering fires within him, he felt entitled to
      hold a low opinion of these men in the street. &ldquo;The brutes,&rdquo;
      he thought, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t stir a finger to save a poor dumb creature,
      and as for policemen&mdash;&rdquo; But, growing cooler, he began to see
      that people weighted down by &ldquo;honest toil&rdquo; could not afford to
      tear their trousers or get a bitten hand, and that even the policeman,
      though he had looked so like a demi-god, was absolutely made of flesh and
      blood. He took the dog home, and, sending for a vet., had him sewn up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was already tortured by the doubt whether or no he might venture to
      meet Antonia at the station, and, after sending his servant with the dog
      to the address marked on its collar, he formed the resolve to go and see
      his mother, with some vague notion that she might help him to decide. She
      lived in Kensington, and, crossing the Brompton Road, he was soon amongst
      that maze of houses into the fibre of whose structure architects have
      wrought the motto: &ldquo;Keep what you have&mdash;wives, money, a good
      address, and all the blessings of a moral state!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton pondered as he passed house after house of such intense
      respectability that even dogs were known to bark at them. His blood was
      still too hot; it is amazing what incidents will promote the loftiest
      philosophy. He had been reading in his favourite review an article
      eulogising the freedom and expansion which had made the upper middle class
      so fine a body; and with eyes wandering from side to side he nodded his
      head ironically. &ldquo;Expansion and freedom,&rdquo; ran his thoughts:
      &ldquo;Freedom and expansion!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Each house-front was cold and formal, the shell of an owner with from
      three to five thousand pounds a year, and each one was armoured against
      the opinion of its neighbours by a sort of daring regularity. &ldquo;Conscious
      of my rectitude; and by the strict observance of exactly what is necessary
      and no more, I am enabled to hold my head up in the world. The person who
      lives in me has only four thousand two hundred and fifty-five pounds each
      year, after allowing for the income tax.&rdquo; Such seemed the legend of
      these houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton passed ladies in ones and twos and threes going out shopping, or
      to classes of drawing, cooking, ambulance. Hardly any men were seen, and
      they were mostly policemen; but a few disillusioned children were being
      wheeled towards the Park by fresh-cheeked nurses, accompanied by a great
      army of hairy or of hairless dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something of her brother&rsquo;s large liberality about Mrs.
      Shelton, a tiny lady with affectionate eyes, warm cheeks, and chilly feet;
      fond as a cat of a chair by the fire, and full of the sympathy that has no
      insight. She kissed her son at once with rapture, and, as usual, began to
      talk of his engagement. For the first time a tremor of doubt ran through
      her son; his mother&rsquo;s view of it grated on him like the sight of a
      blue-pink dress; it was too rosy. Her splendid optimism, damped him; it
      had too little traffic with the reasoning powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right,&rdquo; he asked himself, &ldquo;has she to be so
      certain? It seems to me a kind of blasphemy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear!&rdquo; she cooed. &ldquo;And she is coming back
      to-morrow? Hurrah! how I long to see her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know, mother, we&rsquo;ve agreed not to meet again until
      July.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Shelton rocked her foot, and, holding her head on one side like a
      little bird, looked at her son with shining eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Dick!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how happy you must be!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a century of sympathy with weddings of all sorts&mdash;good, bad,
      indifferent&mdash;beamed from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Shelton gloomily, &ldquo;I ought not to go
      and see her at the station.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; replied the mother, and her son felt dreadfully
      depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That &ldquo;Cheer-up!&rdquo;&mdash;the panacea which had carried her blind
      and bright through every evil&mdash;was as void of meaning to him as wine
      without a flavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is your sciatica?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pretty bad,&rdquo; returned his mother; &ldquo;I expect it&rsquo;s
      all right, really. Cheer up!&rdquo; She stretched her little figure,
      canting her head still more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful woman!&rdquo; Shelton thought. She had, in fact, like
      many of her fellow-countrymen, mislaid the darker side of things, and,
      enjoying the benefits of orthodoxy with an easy conscience, had kept as
      young in heart as any girl of thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton left her house as doubtful whether he might meet Antonia as when
      he entered it. He spent a restless afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day&mdash;that of her arrival&mdash;was a Sunday. He had made
      Ferrand a promise to go with him to hear a sermon in the slums, and,
      catching at any diversion which might allay excitement, he fulfilled it.
      The preacher in question&mdash;an amateur, so Ferrand told him&mdash;had
      an original method of distributing the funds that he obtained. To male
      sheep he gave nothing, to ugly female sheep a very little, to pretty
      female sheep the rest. Ferrand hazarded an inference, but he was a
      foreigner. The Englishman preferred to look upon the preacher as guided by
      a purely abstract love of beauty. His eloquence, at any rate, was
      unquestionable, and Shelton came out feeling sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not yet seven o&rsquo;clock, so, entering an Italian restaurant to
      kill the half-hour before Antonia&rsquo;s arrival, he ordered a bottle of
      wine for his companion, a cup of coffee for himself, and, lighting a
      cigarette, compressed his lips. There was a strange, sweet sinking in his
      heart. His companion, ignorant of this emotion, drank his wine, crumbled
      his roll, and blew smoke through his nostrils, glancing caustically at the
      rows of little tables, the cheap mirrors, the hot, red velvet, the
      chandeliers. His juicy lips seemed to be murmuring, &ldquo;Ah! if you only
      knew of the dirt behind these feathers!&rdquo; Shelton watched him with
      disgust. Though his clothes were now so nice, his nails were not quite
      clean, and his fingertips seemed yellow to the bone. An anaemic waiter in
      a shirt some four days old, with grease-spots on his garments and a
      crumpled napkin on his arm, stood leaning an elbow amongst doubtful
      fruits, and reading an Italian journal. Resting his tired feet in turn, he
      looked like overwork personified, and when he moved, each limb accused the
      sordid smartness of the walls. In the far corner sat a lady eating, and,
      mirrored opposite, her feathered hat, her short, round face, its coat of
      powder, and dark eyes, gave Shelton a shiver of disgust. His companion&rsquo;s
      gaze rested long and subtly on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, monsieur,&rdquo; he said at length. &ldquo;I think I
      know that lady!&rdquo; And, leaving his host, he crossed the room, bowed,
      accosted her, and sat down. With Pharisaic delicacy, Shelton refrained
      from looking. But presently Ferrand came back; the lady rose and left the
      restaurant; she had been crying. The young foreigner was flushed, his face
      contorted; he did not touch his wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she is the wife of an old
      friend. I used to know her well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was suffering from emotion, but someone less absorbed than Shelton
      might have noticed a kind of relish in his voice, as though he were
      savouring life&rsquo;s dishes, and glad to have something new, and spiced
      with tragic sauce, to set before his patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can find her story by the hundred in your streets, but nothing
      hinders these paragons of virtue&rdquo;&mdash;he nodded at the stream of
      carriages&mdash;&ldquo;from turning up their eyes when they see ladies of
      her sort pass. She came to London&mdash;just three years ago. After a year
      one of her little boys took fever&mdash;the shop was avoided&mdash;her
      husband caught it, and died. There she was, left with two children and
      everything gone to pay the debts. She tried to get work; no one helped
      her. There was no money to pay anyone to stay with the children; all the
      work she could get in the house was not enough to keep them alive. She&rsquo;s
      not a strong woman. Well, she put the children out to nurse, and went to
      the streets. The first week was frightful, but now she&rsquo;s used to it&mdash;one
      gets used to anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can nothing be done?&rdquo; asked Shelton, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned his companion. &ldquo;I know that sort; if they
      once take to it all&rsquo;s over. They get used to luxury. One does n&rsquo;t
      part with luxury, after tasting destitution. She tells me she does very
      nicely; the children are happy; she&rsquo;s able to pay well and see them
      sometimes. She was a girl of good family, too, who loved her husband, and
      gave up much for him. What would you have? Three quarters of your virtuous
      ladies placed in her position would do the same if they had the necessary
      looks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that he felt the shock of this discovery, and Shelton
      understood that personal acquaintance makes a difference, even in a
      vagabond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is her beat,&rdquo; said the young foreigner, as they passed
      the illuminated crescent, where nightly the shadows of hypocrites and
      women fall; and Shelton went from these comments on Christianity to the
      station of Charing Cross. There, as he stood waiting in the shadow, his
      heart was in his mouth; and it struck him as odd that he should have come
      to this meeting fresh from a vagabond&rsquo;s society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, amongst the stream of travellers, he saw Antonia. She was close
      to her mother, who was parleying with a footman; behind them were a maid
      carrying a bandbox and a porter with the travelling-bags. Antonia&rsquo;s
      figure, with its throat settled in the collar of her cape, slender, tall,
      severe, looked impatient and remote amongst the bustle. Her eyes, shadowed
      by the journey, glanced eagerly about, welcoming all she saw; a wisp of
      hair was loose above her ear, her cheeks glowed cold and rosy. She caught
      sight of Shelton, and bending her neck, stag-like, stood looking at him; a
      brilliant smile parted her lips, and Shelton trembled. Here was the
      embodiment of all he had desired for weeks. He could not tell what was
      behind that smile of hers&mdash;passionate aching or only some ideal, some
      chaste and glacial intangibility. It seemed to be shining past him into
      the gloomy station. There was no trembling and uncertainty, no rage of
      possession in that brilliant smile; it had the gleam of fixedness, like
      the smiling of a star. What did it matter? She was there, beautiful as a
      young day, and smiling at him; and she was his, only divided from him by a
      space of time. He took a step; her eyes fell at once, her face regained
      aloofness; he saw her, encircled by mother, footman, maid, and porter,
      take her seat and drive away. It was over; she had seen him, she had
      smiled, but alongside his delight lurked another feeling, and, by a bitter
      freak, not her face came up before him but the face of that lady in the
      restaurant&mdash;short, round, and powdered, with black-circled eyes. What
      right had we to scorn them? Had they mothers, footmen, porters, maids? He
      shivered, but this time with physical disgust; the powdered face with
      dark-fringed eyes had vanished; the fair, remote figure of the
      railway-station came back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat long over dinner, drinking, dreaming; he sat long after, smoking,
      dreaming, and when at length he drove away, wine and dreams fumed in his
      brain. The dance of lamps, the cream-cheese moon, the rays of clean wet
      light on his horse&rsquo;s harness, the jingling of the cab bell, the
      whirring wheels, the night air and the branches&mdash;it was all so good!
      He threw back the hansom doors to feel the touch of the warm breeze. The
      crowds on the pavement gave him strange delight; they were like shadows,
      in some great illusion, happy shadows, thronging, wheeling round the
      single figure of his world.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ROTTEN ROW
    </h3>
    <p>
      With a headache and a sense of restlessness, hopeful and unhappy, Shelton
      mounted his hack next morning for a gallop in the Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sky was mingled all the languor and the violence of the spring. The
      trees and flowers wore an awakened look in the gleams of light that came
      stealing down from behind the purple of the clouds. The air was
      rain-washed, and the passers by seemed to wear an air of tranquil
      carelessness, as if anxiety were paralysed by their responsibility of the
      firmament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thronged by riders, the Row was all astir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near to Hyde Park Corner a figure by the rails caught Shelton&rsquo;s eye.
      Straight and thin, one shoulder humped a little, as if its owner were
      reflecting, clothed in a frock-coat and a brown felt hat pinched up in
      lawless fashion, this figure was so detached from its surroundings that it
      would have been noticeable anywhere. It belonged to Ferrand, obviously
      waiting till it was time to breakfast with his patron. Shelton found
      pleasure in thus observing him unseen, and sat quietly on his horse,
      hidden behind a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just at that spot where riders, unable to get further, are for ever
      wheeling their horses for another turn; and there Ferrand, the bird of
      passage, with his head a little to one side, watched them cantering,
      trotting, wheeling up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three men walking along the rails were snatching off their hats before a
      horsewoman at exactly the same angle and with precisely the same air, as
      though in the modish performance of this ancient rite they were satisfying
      some instinct very dear to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton noted the curl of Ferrand&rsquo;s lip as he watched this sight.
      &ldquo;Many thanks, gentlemen,&rdquo; it seemed to say; &ldquo;in that
      charming little action you have shown me all your souls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What a singular gift the fellow had of divesting things and people of
      their garments, of tearing away their veil of shams, and their
      phylacteries! Shelton turned and cantered on; his thoughts were with
      Antonia, and he did not want the glamour stripped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glancing at the sky, that every moment threatened to discharge a
      violent shower of rain, when suddenly he heard his name called from
      behind, and who should ride up to him on either side but Bill Dennant and&mdash;Antonia
      herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been galloping; and she was flushed&mdash;flushed as when she
      stood on the old tower at Hyeres, but with a joyful radiance different
      from the calm and conquering radiance of that other moment. To Shelton&rsquo;s
      delight they fell into line with him, and all three went galloping along
      the strip between the trees and rails. The look she gave him seemed to
      say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if it is forbidden!&rdquo; but she did not
      speak. He could not take his eyes off her. How lovely she looked, with the
      resolute curve of her figure, the glimpse of gold under her hat, the
      glorious colour in her cheeks, as if she had been kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &lsquo;s so splendid to be at home! Let &lsquo;s go faster,
      faster!&rdquo; she cried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a pull. We shall get run in,&rdquo; grumbled her brother, with
      a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reined in round the bend and jogged more soberly down on the far
      side; still not a word from her to Shelton, and Shelton in his turn spoke
      only to Bill Dennant. He was afraid to speak to her, for he knew that her
      mind was dwelling on this chance forbidden meeting in a way quite
      different from his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching Hyde Park Corner, where Ferrand was still standing against the
      rails, Shelton, who had forgotten his existence, suffered a shock when his
      eyes fell suddenly on that impassive figure. He was about to raise his
      hand, when he saw that the young foreigner, noting his instinctive
      feeling, had at once adapted himself to it. They passed again without a
      greeting, unless that swift inquisition; followed by unconsciousness in
      Ferrand&rsquo;s eyes, could so be called. But the feeling of idiotic
      happiness left Shelton; he grew irritated at this silence. It tantalised
      him more and more, for Bill Dennant had lagged behind to chatter to a
      friend; Shelton and Antonia were alone, walking their horses, without a
      word, not even looking at each other. At one moment he thought of
      galloping ahead and leaving her, then of breaking the vow of muteness she
      seemed to be imposing on him, and he kept thinking: &ldquo;It ought to be
      either one thing or the other. I can&rsquo;t stand this.&rdquo; Her
      calmness was getting on his nerves; she seemed to have determined just how
      far she meant to go, to have fixed cold-bloodedly a limit. In her happy
      young beauty and radiant coolness she summed up that sane consistent
      something existing in nine out of ten of the people Shelton knew. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t stand it long,&rdquo; he thought, and all of a sudden spoke;
      but as he did so she frowned and cantered on. When he caught her she was
      smiling, lifting her face to catch the raindrops which were falling fast.
      She gave him just a nod, and waved her hand as a sign for him to go; and
      when he would not, she frowned. He saw Bill Dennant, posting after them,
      and, seized by a sense of the ridiculous, lifted his hat, and galloped
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain was coming down in torrents now, and every one was scurrying for
      shelter. He looked back from the bend, and could still make out Antonia
      riding leisurely, her face upturned, and revelling in the shower. Why had
      n&rsquo;t she either cut him altogether or taken the sweets the gods had
      sent? It seemed wicked to have wasted such a chance, and, ploughing back
      to Hyde Park Corner, he turned his head to see if by any chance she had
      relented.
    </p>
    <p>
      His irritation was soon gone, but his longing stayed. Was ever anything so
      beautiful as she had looked with her face turned to the rain? She seemed
      to love the rain. It suited her&mdash;suited her ever so much better than
      the sunshine of the South. Yes, she was very English! Puzzling and
      fretting, he reached his rooms. Ferrand had not arrived, in fact did not
      turn up that day. His non-appearance afforded Shelton another proof of the
      delicacy that went hand in hand with the young vagrant&rsquo;s cynicism.
      In the afternoon he received a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . You see, Dick [he read], I ought to have cut you; but I felt too
      crazy&mdash;everything seems so jolly at home, even this stuffy old
      London. Of course, I wanted to talk to you badly&mdash;there are heaps of
      things one can&rsquo;t say by letter&mdash;but I should have been sorry
      afterwards. I told mother. She said I was quite right, but I don&rsquo;t
      think she took it in. Don&rsquo;t you feel that the only thing that really
      matters is to have an ideal, and to keep it so safe that you can always
      look forward and feel that you have been&mdash;I can&rsquo;t exactly
      express my meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton lit a cigarette and frowned. It seemed to him queer that she
      should set more store by an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; than by the fact that they
      had met for the first and only time in many weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she &lsquo;s right,&rdquo; he thought&mdash;&ldquo;I
      suppose she &lsquo;s right. I ought not to have tried to speak to her!&rdquo;
      As a matter of fact, he did not at all feel that she was right.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN &ldquo;AT HOME&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      On Tuesday morning he wandered off to Paddington, hoping for a chance view
      of her on her way down to Holm Oaks; but the sense of the ridiculous, on
      which he had been nurtured, was strong enough to keep him from actually
      entering the station and lurking about until she came. With a pang of
      disappointment he retraced his steps from Praed Street to the Park, and
      once there tried no further to waylay her. He paid a round of calls in the
      afternoon, mostly on her relations; and, seeking out Aunt Charlotte, he
      dolorously related his encounter in the Row. But she found it &ldquo;rather
      nice,&rdquo; and on his pressing her with his views, she murmured that it
      was &ldquo;quite romantic, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, it&rsquo;s very hard,&rdquo; said Shelton; and he went away
      disconsolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was dressing for dinner his eye fell on a card announcing the
      &ldquo;at home&rdquo; of one of his own cousins. Her husband was a
      composer, and he had a vague idea that he would find at the house of a
      composer some quite unusually free kind of atmosphere. After dining at the
      club, therefore, he set out for Chelsea. The party was held in a large
      room on the ground-floor, which was already crowded with people when
      Shelton entered. They stood or sat about in groups with smiles fixed on
      their lips, and the light from balloon-like lamps fell in patches on their
      heads and hands and shoulders. Someone had just finished rendering on the
      piano a composition of his own. An expert could at once have picked out
      from amongst the applauding company those who were musicians by
      profession, for their eyes sparkled, and a certain acidity pervaded their
      enthusiasm. This freemasonry of professional intolerance flew from one to
      the other like a breath of unanimity, and the faint shrugging of shoulders
      was as harmonious as though one of the high windows had been opened
      suddenly, admitting a draught of chill May air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton made his way up to his cousin&mdash;a fragile, grey-haired woman
      in black velvet and Venetian lace, whose starry eyes beamed at him, until
      her duties, after the custom of these social gatherings, obliged her to
      break off conversation just as it began to interest him. He was passed on
      to another lady who was already talking to two gentlemen, and, their
      volubility being greater than his own, he fell into the position of
      observer. Instead of the profound questions he had somehow expected to
      hear raised, everybody seemed gossiping, or searching the heart of such
      topics as where to go this summer, or how to get new servants. Trifling
      with coffee-cups, they dissected their fellow artists in the same way as
      his society friends of the other night had dissected the fellow&mdash;&ldquo;smart&rdquo;;
      and the varnish on the floor, the pictures, and the piano were reflected
      on all the faces around. Shelton moved from group to group disconsolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall, imposing person stood under a Japanese print holding the palm of
      one hand outspread; his unwieldy trunk and thin legs wobbled in concert to
      his ingratiating voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;is not necessary. War is not
      necessary. I hope I make myself clear. War is not necessary; it depends on
      nationality, but nationality is not necessary.&rdquo; He inclined his head
      to one side, &ldquo;Why do we have nationality? Let us do away with
      boundaries&mdash;let us have the warfare of commerce. If I see France
      looking at Brighton&rdquo;&mdash;he laid his head upon one side, and
      beamed at Shelton,&mdash;&ldquo;what do I do? Do I say &lsquo;Hands off&rsquo;.
      No. &lsquo;Take it,&rsquo; I say&mdash;take it!&rsquo;.rdquo; He archly
      smiled. &ldquo;But do you think they would?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the softness of his contours fascinated Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The soldier,&rdquo; the person underneath the print resumed,
      &ldquo;is necessarily on a lower plane&mdash;intellectually&mdash;oh,
      intellectually&mdash;than the philanthropist. His sufferings are less
      acute; he enjoys the compensations of advertisement&mdash;you admit that?&rdquo;
      he breathed persuasively. &ldquo;For instance&mdash;I am quite impersonal&mdash;I
      suffer; but do I talk about it?&rdquo; But, someone gazing at his
      well-filled waistcoat, he put his thesis in another form: &ldquo;I have
      one acre and one cow, my brother has one acre and one cow: do I seek to
      take them away from him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton hazarded, &ldquo;Perhaps you &lsquo;re weaker than your brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come! Take the case of women: now, I consider our marriage
      laws are barbarous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Shelton conceived respect for them; he made a
      comprehensive gesture, and edged himself into the conversation of another
      group, for fear of having all his prejudices overturned. Here an Irish
      sculptor, standing in a curve, was saying furiously, &ldquo;Bees are not
      bhumpkins, d&mdash;-n their sowls!&rdquo; A Scotch painter, who listened
      with a curly smile, seemed trying to compromise this proposition, which
      appeared to have relation to the middle classes; and though agreeing with
      the Irishman, Shelton felt nervous over his discharge of electricity. Next
      to them two American ladies, assembled under the tent of hair belonging to
      a writer of songs, were discussing the emotions aroused in them by Wagner&rsquo;s
      operas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They produce a strange condition of affairs in me,&rdquo; said the
      thinner one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They &lsquo;re just divine,&rdquo; said the fatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you can call the fleshly lusts divine,&rdquo;
      replied the thinner, looking into the eyes of the writer of the songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst all the hum of voices and the fumes of smoke, a sense of formality
      was haunting Shelton. Sandwiched between a Dutchman and a Prussian poet,
      he could understand neither of his neighbours; so, assuming an intelligent
      expression, he fell to thinking that an assemblage of free spirits is as
      much bound by the convention of exchanging their ideas as commonplace
      people are by the convention of having no ideas to traffic in. He could
      not help wondering whether, in the bulk, they were not just as dependent
      on each other as the inhabitants of Kensington; whether, like locomotives,
      they could run at all without these opportunities for blowing off the
      steam, and what would be left when the steam had all escaped. Somebody
      ceased playing the violin, and close to him a group began discussing
      ethics. Aspirations were in the air all round, like a lot of hungry
      ghosts. He realised that, if tongue be given to them, the flavour vanishes
      from ideas which haunt the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the violinist played.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cock gracious!&rdquo; said the Prussian poet, falling into English
      as the fiddle ceased: &ldquo;Colossal! &lsquo;Aber, wie er ist grossartig&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read that thing of Besom&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked shrill
      voice behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear fellow! too horrid for words; he ought to be hanged!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s dreadful,&rdquo; pursued the voice, shriller than
      ever; &ldquo;nothing but a volcanic eruption would cure him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton turned in alarm to look at the authors of these statements. They
      were two men of letters talking of a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;C&rsquo;est un grand naif, vous savez,&rsquo;.rdquo; said
      the second speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These fellows don&rsquo;t exist,&rdquo; resumed the first; his
      small eyes gleamed with a green light, his whole face had a look as if he
      gnawed himself. Though not a man of letters, Shelton could not help
      recognising from those eyes what joy it was to say those words: &ldquo;These
      fellows don&rsquo;t exist!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Besom! You know what Moulter said . . .&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton turned away, as if he had been too close to one whose hair smelt
      of cantharides; and, looking round the room, he frowned. With the
      exception of his cousin, he seemed the only person there of English blood.
      Americans, Mesopotamians, Irish, Italians, Germans, Scotch, and Russians.
      He was not contemptuous of them for being foreigners; it was simply that
      God and the climate had made him different by a skin or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this point his conclusions were denied (as will sometimes happen)
      by his introduction to an Englishman&mdash;a Major Somebody, who, with
      smooth hair and blond moustache, neat eyes and neater clothes, seemed a
      little anxious at his own presence there. Shelton took a liking to him,
      partly from a fellow-feeling, and partly because of the gentle smile with
      which he was looking at his wife. Almost before he had said &ldquo;How do
      you do?&rdquo; he was plunged into a discussion on imperialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admitting all that,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;what I hate is the
      humbug with which we pride ourselves on benefiting the whole world by our
      so-called civilising methods.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier turned his reasonable eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it humbug?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton saw his argument in peril. If we really thought it, was it humbug?
      He replied, however:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we, a small portion of the world&rsquo;s population,
      assume that our standards are the proper ones for every kind of race? If
      it &lsquo;s not humbug, it &lsquo;s sheer stupidity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier, without taking his hands out of his pockets, but by a forward
      movement of his face showing that he was both sincere and just,
      re-replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it must be a good sort of stupidity; it makes us the nation
      that we are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton felt dazed. The conversation buzzed around him; he heard the
      smiling prophet saying, &ldquo;Altruism, altruism,&rdquo; and in his voice
      a something seemed to murmur, &ldquo;Oh, I do so hope I make a good
      impression!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the soldier&rsquo;s clear-cut head with its well-opened eyes,
      the tiny crow&rsquo;s-feet at their corners, the conventional moustache;
      he envied the certainty of the convictions lying under that well-parted
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather we were men first and then Englishmen,&rdquo; he
      muttered; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s all a sort of national illusion, and I
      can&rsquo;t stand illusions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you come to that,&rdquo; said the soldier, &ldquo;the world
      lives by illusions. I mean, if you look at history, you&rsquo;ll see that
      the creation of illusions has always been her business, don&rsquo;t you
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This Shelton was unable to deny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; continued the soldier (who was evidently a highly
      cultivated man), &ldquo;if you admit that movement, labour, progress, and
      all that have been properly given to building up these illusions, that&mdash;er&mdash;in
      fact, they&rsquo;re what you might call&mdash;er&mdash;the outcome of the
      world&rsquo;s crescendo,&rdquo; he rushed his voice over this phrase as if
      ashamed of it&mdash;&ldquo;why do you want to destroy them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton thought a moment, then, squeezing his body with his folded arms,
      replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The past has made us what we are, of course, and cannot be
      destroyed; but how about the future? It &lsquo;s surely time to let in
      air. Cathedrals are very fine, and everybody likes the smell of incense;
      but when they &lsquo;ve been for centuries without ventilation you know
      what the atmosphere gets like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By your own admission,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll only be
      creating a fresh set of illusions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Shelton, &ldquo;but at all events they&rsquo;ll
      be the honest necessities of the present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The pupils of the soldier&rsquo;s eyes contracted; he evidently felt the
      conversation slipping into generalities; he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see how thinking small beer of ourselves is going to
      do us any good!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An &ldquo;At Home!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton felt in danger of being thought unpractical in giving vent to the
      remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must trust one&rsquo;s reason; I never can persuade myself that
      I believe in what I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later, with a cordial handshake, the soldier left, and Shelton
      watched his courteous figure shepherding his wife away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick, may I introduce you to Mr. Wilfrid Curly?&rdquo; said his
      cousin&rsquo;s voice behind, and he found his hand being diffidently
      shaken by a fresh-cheeked youth with a dome-like forehead, who was saying
      nervously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do? Yes, I am very well, thank you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He now remembered that when he had first come in he had watched this
      youth, who had been standing in a corner indulging himself in private
      smiles. He had an uncommon look, as though he were in love with life&mdash;as
      though he regarded it as a creature to whom one could put questions to the
      very end&mdash;interesting, humorous, earnest questions. He looked
      diffident, and amiable, and independent, and he, too, was evidently
      English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you good at argument?&rdquo; said Shelton, at a loss for a
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth smiled, blushed, and, putting back his hair, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know; I think my brain does n&rsquo;t
      work fast enough for argument. You know how many motions of the
      brain-cells go to each remark. It &lsquo;s awfully interesting&rdquo;;
      and, bending from the waist in a mathematical position, he extended the
      palm of one hand, and started to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton stared at the youth&rsquo;s hand, at his frowns and the taps he
      gave his forehead while he found the expression of his meaning; he was
      intensely interested. The youth broke off, looked at his watch, and,
      blushing brightly, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m afraid I have to go; I have to be at the &lsquo;Den&rsquo;
      before eleven.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be off, too,&rdquo; said Shelton. Making their adieux
      together, they sought their hats and coats.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE NIGHT CLUB
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; said Shelton, as he and the youth came out into
      the chilly street, &ldquo;What it is you call the &lsquo;Den&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion smilingly answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the night club. We take it in turns. Thursday is my night.
      Would you like to come? You see a lot of types. It&rsquo;s only round the
      corner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton digested a momentary doubt, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, immensely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the corner house in an angle of a dismal street, through the
      open door of which two men had just gone in. Following, they ascended some
      wooden, fresh-washed stairs, and entered a large boarded room smelling of
      sawdust, gas, stale coffee, and old clothes. It was furnished with a
      bagatelle board, two or three wooden tables, some wooden forms, and a
      wooden bookcase. Seated on these wooden chairs, or standing up, were
      youths, and older men of the working class, who seemed to Shelton to be
      peculiarly dejected. One was reading, one against the wall was drinking
      coffee with a disillusioned air, two were playing chess, and a group of
      four made a ceaseless clatter with the bagatelle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little man in a dark suit, with a pale face, thin lips, and deep-set,
      black-encircled eyes, who was obviously in charge, came up with an anaemic
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;re rather late,&rdquo; he said to Curly, and, looking
      ascetically at Shelton, asked, without waiting for an introduction:
      &ldquo;Do you play chess? There &lsquo;s young Smith wants a game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A youth with a wooden face, already seated before a fly-blown chess-board,
      asked him drearily if he would have black or white. Shelton took white; he
      was oppressed by the virtuous odour of this room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man with the deep blue eyes came up, stood in an uneasy
      attitude, and watched:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your play&rsquo;s improving, young Smith,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I
      should think you&rsquo;d be able to give Banks a knight.&rdquo; His eyes
      rested on Shelton, fanatical and dreary; his monotonous voice was
      suffering and nasal; he was continually sucking in his lips, as though
      determined to subdue &lsquo;the flesh. &ldquo;You should come here often,&rdquo;
      he said to Shelton, as the latter received checkmate; &ldquo;you &lsquo;d
      get some good practice. We&rsquo;ve several very fair players. You&rsquo;re
      not as good as Jones or Bartholomew,&rdquo; he added to Shelton&rsquo;s
      opponent, as though he felt it a duty to put the latter in his place.
      &ldquo;You ought to come here often,&rdquo; he repeated to Shelton;
      &ldquo;we have a lot of very good young fellows&rdquo;; and, with a touch
      of complacence, he glanced around the dismal room. &ldquo;There are not so
      many here tonight as usual. Where are Toombs and Body?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton, too, looked anxiously around. He could not help feeling sympathy
      with Toombs and Body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They &lsquo;re getting slack, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said the
      little deep-eyed man. &ldquo;Our principle is to amuse everyone. Excuse me
      a minute; I see that Carpenter is doing nothing.&rdquo; He crossed over to
      the man who had been drinking coffee, but Shelton had barely time to
      glance at his opponent and try to think of a remark, before the little man
      was back. &ldquo;Do you know anything about astronomy?&rdquo; he asked of
      Shelton. &ldquo;We have several very interested in astronomy; if you could
      talk to them a little it would help.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton made a motion of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please-no,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d come sometimes on Wednesdays; we have most
      interesting talks, and a service afterwards. We&rsquo;re always anxious to
      get new blood&rdquo;; and his eyes searched Shelton&rsquo;s brown, rather
      tough-looking face, as though trying to see how much blood there was in
      it. &ldquo;Young Curly says you &lsquo;ve just been around the world; you
      could describe your travels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;how your club is made up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a look of complacency, and blessed assuagement, visited the little
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we take anybody, unless there &lsquo;s
      anything against them. The Day Society sees to that. Of course, we shouldn&rsquo;t
      take anyone if they were to report against them. You ought to come to our
      committee meetings; they&rsquo;re on Mondays at seven. The women&rsquo;s
      side, too&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;you &lsquo;re very kind&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should be pleased,&rdquo; said the little man; and his face
      seemed to suffer more than ever. &ldquo;They &lsquo;re mostly young
      fellows here to-night, but we have married men, too. Of course, we &lsquo;re
      very careful about that,&rdquo; he added hastily, as though he might have
      injured Shelton&rsquo;s prejudices&mdash;&ldquo;that, and drink, and
      anything criminal, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you give pecuniary assistance, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; replied the little man; &ldquo;if you were to come
      to our committee meetings you would see for yourself. Everything is most
      carefully gone into; we endeavour to sift the wheat from the chaff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;you find a great deal of
      chaff?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man smiled a suffering smile. The twang of his toneless voice
      sounded a trifle shriller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was obliged to refuse a man to-day&mdash;a man and a woman, quite
      young people, with three small children. He was ill and out of work; but
      on inquiry we found that they were not man and wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight pause; the little man&rsquo;s eyes were fastened on his
      nails, and, with an appearance of enjoyment, he began to bite them.
      Shelton&rsquo;s face had grown a trifle red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what becomes of the woman and the children in a case like that?&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man&rsquo;s eyes began to smoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We make a point of not encouraging sin, of course. Excuse me a
      minute; I see they&rsquo;ve finished bagatelle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried off, and in a moment the clack of bagatelle began again. He
      himself was playing with a cold and spurious energy, running after the
      balls and exhorting the other players, upon whom a wooden acquiescence
      seemed to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton crossed the room, and went up to young Curly. He was sitting on a
      bench, smiling to himself his private smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you staying here much longer?&rdquo; Shelton asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Curly rose with nervous haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there &lsquo;s nobody
      very interesting here to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all!&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;on the contrary. Only I
      &lsquo;ve had a rather tiring day, and somehow I don&rsquo;t feel up to
      the standard here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His new acquaintance smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, really! do you think&mdash;that is&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had not time to finish before the clack of bagatelle balls ceased,
      and the voice of the little deep-eyed man was heard saying: &ldquo;Anybody
      who wants a book will put his name down. There will be the usual
      prayer-meeting on Wednesday next. Will you all go quietly? I am going to
      turn the lights out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One gas-jet vanished, and the remaining jet flared suddenly. By its harder
      glare the wooden room looked harder too, and disenchanting. The figures of
      its occupants began filing through the door. The little man was left in
      the centre of the room, his deep eyes smouldering upon the backs of the
      retreating members, his thumb and finger raised to the turncock of the
      metre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know this part?&rdquo; asked young Curly as they emerged
      into the street. &ldquo;It &lsquo;s really jolly; one of the darkest bits
      in London&mdash;it is really. If you care, I can take you through an
      awfully dangerous place where the police never go.&rdquo; He seemed so
      anxious for the honour that Shelton was loath to disappoint him. &ldquo;I
      come here pretty often,&rdquo; he went on, as they ascended a sort of
      alley rambling darkly between a wall and row of houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Shelton; &ldquo;it does n&rsquo;t smell too nice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man threw up his nose and sniffed, as if eager to add any new
      scent that might be about to his knowledge of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s one of the reasons, you know,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;one must find out. The darkness is jolly, too; anything might
      happen here. Last week there was a murder; there &lsquo;s always the
      chance of one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton stared; but the charge of morbidness would not lie against this
      fresh-cheeked stripling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a splendid drain just here,&rdquo; his guide resumed;
      &ldquo;the people are dying like flies of typhoid in those three houses&rdquo;;
      and under the first light he turned his grave, cherubic face to indicate
      the houses. &ldquo;If we were in the East End, I could show you other
      places quite as good. There&rsquo;s a coffee-stall keeper in one that
      knows all the thieves in London; he &lsquo;s a splendid type, but,&rdquo;
      he added, looking a little anxiously at Shelton, &ldquo;it might n&rsquo;t
      be safe for you. With me it&rsquo;s different; they &lsquo;re beginning to
      know me. I&rsquo;ve nothing to take, you see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it can&rsquo;t be to-night,&rdquo; said Shelton;
      &ldquo;I must get back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind if I walk with you? It&rsquo;s so jolly now the stars
      are out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;do you often go to that
      club?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion raised his hat, and ran his fingers through his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They &lsquo;re rather too high-class for me,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I like to go where you can see people eat&mdash;school treats, or
      somewhere in the country. It does one good to see them eat. They don&rsquo;t
      get enough, you see, as a rule, to make bone; it&rsquo;s all used up for
      brain and muscle. There are some places in the winter where they give them
      bread and cocoa; I like to go to those.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went once,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;but I felt ashamed for
      putting my nose in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they don&rsquo;t mind; most of them are half-dead with cold,
      you know. You see splendid types; lots of dipsomaniacs . . . . It &lsquo;s
      useful to me,&rdquo; he went on as they passed a police-station, &ldquo;to
      walk about at night; one can take so much more notice. I had a jolly night
      last week in Hyde Park; a chance to study human nature there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you find it interesting?&rdquo; asked Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I saw a fellow pick three
      pockets.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a jolly talk with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton thought of the little deep-eyed man; who made a point of not
      encouraging sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was one of the professionals from Notting Hill, you know; told
      me his life. Never had a chance, of course. The most interesting part was
      telling him I &lsquo;d seen him pick three pockets&mdash;like creeping
      into a cave, when you can&rsquo;t tell what &lsquo;s inside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He showed me what he &lsquo;d got&mdash;only fivepence halfpenny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what became of your friend?&rdquo; asked Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, went off; he had a splendidly low forehead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached Shelton&rsquo;s rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come in,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;and have a drink?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth smiled, blushed, and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have to walk to
      Whitechapel. I &lsquo;m living on porridge now; splendid stuff for making
      bone. I generally live on porridge for a week at the end of every month.
      It &lsquo;s the best diet if you&rsquo;re hard up&rdquo;; once more
      blushing and smiling, he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton went upstairs and sat down on his bed. He felt a little miserable.
      Sitting there, slowly pulling out the ends of his white tie, disconsolate,
      he had a vision of Antonia with her gaze fixed wonderingly on him. And
      this wonder of hers came as a revelation&mdash;just as that morning, when,
      looking from his window, he had seen a passer-by stop suddenly and scratch
      his leg; and it had come upon him in a flash that that man had thoughts
      and feelings of his own. He would never know what Antonia really felt and
      thought. &ldquo;Till I saw her at the station, I did n&rsquo;t know how
      much I loved her or how little I knew her&rdquo;; and, sighing deeply, he
      hurried into bed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      POLE TO POLE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The waiting in London for July to come was daily more unbearable to
      Shelton, and if it had not been for Ferrand, who still came to breakfast,
      he would have deserted the Metropolis. On June first the latter presented
      himself rather later than was his custom, and announced that, through a
      friend, he had heard of a position as interpreter to an hotel at
      Folkestone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had money to face the first necessities,&rdquo; he said,
      swiftly turning over a collection of smeared papers with his yellow
      fingers, as if searching for his own identity, &ldquo;I &lsquo;d leave
      today. This London blackens my spirit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you certain to get this place,&rdquo; asked Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; the young foreigner replied; &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve
      got some good enough recommendations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton could not help a dubious glance at the papers in his hand. A hurt
      look passed on to Ferrand&rsquo;s curly lips beneath his nascent red
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that to have false papers is as bad as theft. No, no; I
      shall never be a thief&mdash;I &lsquo;ve had too many opportunities,&rdquo;
      said he, with pride and bitterness. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not in my
      character. I never do harm to anyone. This&rdquo;&mdash;he touched the
      papers&mdash;&ldquo;is not delicate, but it does harm to no one. If you
      have no money you must have papers; they stand between you and starvation.
      Society, has an excellent eye for the helpless&mdash;it never treads on
      people unless they &lsquo;re really down.&rdquo; He looked at Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;ve made me what I am, amongst you,&rdquo; he seemed to
      say; &ldquo;now put up with me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are always the workhouses,&rdquo; Shelton remarked at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Workhouses!&rdquo; returned Ferrand; &ldquo;certainly there are&mdash;regular
      palaces: I will tell you one thing: I&rsquo;ve never been in places so
      discouraging as your workhouses; they take one&rsquo;s very heart out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always understood,&rdquo; said Shelton coldly; &ldquo;that our
      system was better than that of other countries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrand leaned over in his chair, an elbow on his knee, his favourite
      attitude when particularly certain of his point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it &lsquo;s always permissible to
      think well of your own country. But, frankly, I&rsquo;ve come out of those
      places here with little strength and no heart at all, and I can tell you
      why.&rdquo; His lips lost their bitterness, and he became an artist
      expressing the result of his experience. &ldquo;You spend your money
      freely, you have fine buildings, self-respecting officers, but you lack
      the spirit of hospitality. The reason is plain; you have a horror of the
      needy. You invite us&mdash;and when we come you treat us justly enough,
      but as if we were numbers, criminals, beneath contempt&mdash;as if we had
      inflicted a personal injury on you; and when we get out again, we are
      naturally degraded.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton bit his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much money will you want for your ticket, and to make a start?&rdquo;
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nervous gesture escaping Ferrand at this juncture betrayed how far the
      most independent thinkers are dependent when they have no money in their
      pockets. He took the note that Shelton proffered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I shall never forget what
      you have done for me&rdquo;; and Shelton could not help feeling that there
      was true emotion behind his titter of farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood at the window watching Ferrand start into the world again; then
      looked back at his own comfortable room, with the number of things that
      had accumulated somehow&mdash;the photographs of countless friends, the
      old arm-chairs, the stock of coloured pipes. Into him restlessness had
      passed with the farewell clasp of the foreigner&rsquo;s damp hand. To wait
      about in London was unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his hat, and, heedless of direction, walked towards the river. It
      was a clear, bright day, with a bleak wind driving showers before it.
      During one of such Shelton found himself in Little Blank Street. &ldquo;I
      wonder how that little Frenchman that I saw is getting on!&rdquo; he
      thought. On a fine day he would probably have passed by on the other side;
      he now entered and tapped upon the wicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 3 Little Blank Street had abated nothing of its stone-flagged
      dreariness; the same blowsy woman answered his inquiry. Yes, Carolan was
      always in; you could never catch him out&mdash;seemed afraid to go into
      the street! To her call the little Frenchman made his appearance as
      punctually as if he had been the rabbit of a conjurer. His face was as
      yellow as a guinea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s you, monsieur!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;and how are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &lsquo;s five days since I came out of hospital,&rdquo; muttered
      the little Frenchman, tapping on his chest; &ldquo;a crisis of this bad
      atmosphere. I live here, shut up in a box; it does me harm, being from the
      South. If there&rsquo;s anything I can do for you, monsieur, it will give
      me pleasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Shelton, &ldquo;I was just passing, and
      thought I should like to hear how you were getting on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into the kitchen,&mdash;monsieur, there is nobody in there.
      &lsquo;Brr! Il fait un froid etonnant&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of customers have you just now?&rdquo; asked Shelton, as
      they passed into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always the same clientele,&rdquo; replied the little man; &ldquo;not
      so numerous, of course, it being summer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could n&rsquo;t you find anything better than this to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The barber&rsquo;s crow&rsquo;s-feet radiated irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I first came to London,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I secured an
      engagement at one of your public institutions. I thought my fortune made.
      Imagine, monsieur, in that sacred place I was obliged to shave at the rate
      of ten a penny! Here, it&rsquo;s true, they don&rsquo;t pay me half the
      time; but when I&rsquo;m paid, I &lsquo;m paid. In this, climate, and
      being &lsquo;poitrinaire&rsquo;, one doesn&rsquo;t make experiments. I
      shall finish my days here. Have you seen that young man who interested
      you? There &lsquo;s another! He has spirit, as I had once&mdash;&rsquo;il
      fait de la philosophie&rsquo;, as I do&mdash;and you will see, monsieur,
      it will finish him. In this world what you want is to have no spirit.
      Spirit ruins you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton looked sideways at the little man with his sardonic, yellow,
      half-dead face, and the incongruity of the word &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; in
      his mouth struck him so sharply that he smiled a smile with more pity in
      it than any burst of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we &lsquo;sit down?&rdquo; he said, offering a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merci, monsieur, it is always a pleasure to smoke a good cigarette.
      You remember, that old actor who gave you a Jeremiad? Well, he&rsquo;s
      dead. I was the only one at his bedside; &lsquo;un vrai drole&rsquo;. He
      was another who had spirit. And you will see, monsieur, that young man in
      whom you take an interest, he&rsquo;ll die in a hospital, or in some hole
      or other, or even on the highroad; having closed his eyes once too often
      some cold night; and all because he has something in him which will not
      accept things as they are, believing always that they should be better.
      &lsquo;Il n&rsquo;y a riens de plus tragique&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to you, then,&rdquo; said Shelton&mdash;and the
      conversation seemed to him of a sudden to have taken too personal a turn&mdash;&ldquo;rebellion
      of any sort is fatal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied the little man, with the eagerness of one whose
      ideal it is to sit under the awning of a cafe, and talk life upside down,
      &ldquo;you pose me a great problem there! If one makes rebellion; it is
      always probable that one will do no good to any one and harm one&rsquo;s
      self. The law of the majority arranges that. But I would draw your
      attention to this&rdquo;&mdash;and he paused; as if it were a real
      discovery to blow smoke through his nose&mdash;&ldquo;if you rebel it is
      in all likelihood because you are forced by your nature to rebel; this is
      one of the most certain things in life. In any case, it is necessary to
      avoid falling between two stools&mdash;which is unpardonable,&rdquo; he
      ended with complacence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton thought he had never seen a man who looked more completely as if
      he had fallen between two stools, and he had inspiration enough to feel
      that the little barber&rsquo;s intellectual rebellion and the action
      logically required by it had no more than a bowing acquaintanceship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By nature,&rdquo; went on the little man, &ldquo;I am an optimist;
      it is in consequence of this that I now make pessimism. I have always had
      ideals; seeing myself cut off from them for ever, I must complain; to
      complain, monsieur, is very sweet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton wondered what these ideals had been, but had no answer ready; so
      he nodded, and again held out his cigarettes, for, like a true Southerner,
      the little man had thrown the first away, half smoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greatest pleasure in life,&rdquo; continued the Frenchman, with
      a bow, &ldquo;is to talk a little to a being who is capable of
      understanding you. At present we have no one here, now that that old actor&rsquo;s
      dead. Ah! there was a man who was rebellion incarnate! He made rebellion
      as other men make money, &lsquo;c&rsquo;etait son metier&rsquo;. when he
      was no longer capable of active revolution, he made it getting drunk. At
      the last this was his only way of protesting against Society. An
      interesting personality, &lsquo;je le regrette beaucoup&rsquo;. But, as
      you see, he died in great distress, without a soul to wave him farewell,
      because as you can well understand, monsieur, I don&rsquo;t count myself.
      He died drunk. &lsquo;C&rsquo;etait un homme&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton had continued staring kindly at the little man; the barber added
      hastily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to make an end like that one has moments of
      weakness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Shelton, &ldquo;one has indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little barber looked at him with cynical discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it &lsquo;s to the destitute that such
      things are important. When one has money, all these matters&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders. A smile had lodged amongst his crow&rsquo;s-feet;
      he waved his hand as though to end the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sense of having been exposed came over Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that discontent is peculiar
      to the destitute?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the little barber, &ldquo;a plutocrat
      knows too well that if he mixes in that &lsquo;galere&rsquo; there &lsquo;s
      not a dog in the streets more lost than he.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rain is over. I hope you &lsquo;ll soon be better; perhaps you
      &lsquo;ll accept this in memory of that old actor,&rdquo; and he slipped a
      sovereign into the little Frenchman&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you are passing, monsieur,&rdquo; he said eagerly, &ldquo;I
      shall be charmed to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Shelton walked away. &ldquo;&lsquo;Not a dog in the streets more lost,&rsquo;.rdquo;
      thought he; &ldquo;now what did he mean by that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of that &ldquo;lost dog&rdquo; feeling had gripped his spirit.
      Another month of waiting would kill all the savour of anticipation, might
      even kill his love. In the excitement of his senses and his nerves, caused
      by this strain of waiting, everything seemed too vivid; all was beyond
      life size; like Art&mdash;whose truths; too strong for daily use, are
      thus, unpopular with healthy people. As will the bones in a worn face, the
      spirit underlying things had reached the surface; the meanness and
      intolerable measure of hard facts, were too apparent. Some craving for
      help, some instinct, drove him into Kensington, for he found himself
      before his, mother&rsquo;s house. Providence seemed bent on flinging him
      from pole to pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Shelton was in town; and, though it was the first of June, sat
      warming her feet before a fire; her face, with its pleasant colour, was
      crow&rsquo;s-footed like the little barber&rsquo;s, but from optimism, not
      rebellion. She, smiled when she saw her son; and the wrinkles round her
      eyes twinkled, with vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear boy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s lovely to see
      you. And how is that sweet girl?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, thank you,&rdquo; replied Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be such a dear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; stammered Shelton, &ldquo;I must give it up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it up? My dear Dick, give what up? You look quite worried.
      Come and sit down, and have a cosy chat. Cheer up!&rdquo; And Mrs.
      Shelton; with her head askew, gazed at her son quite irrepressibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Shelton, who, confronted by her optimism, had
      never, since his time of trial began, felt so wretchedly dejected, &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t go on waiting about like this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, what is the matter?&rdquo;;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is wrong!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Shelton. &ldquo;Come, tell me all, about
      it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Shelton, shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely have not had a quarrel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Shelton stopped; the question seemed so vulgar&mdash;one might have
      asked it of a groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Shelton, and his answer sounded like a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, my dear old Dick,&rdquo; murmured his mother, &ldquo;it
      seems a little mad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it seems mad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Mrs. Shelton, taking his hand between her own;
      &ldquo;you never used to be like this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Shelton, with a laugh; &ldquo;I never used to be
      like this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Shelton snuggled in her Chuda shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, with cheery sympathy, &ldquo;I know exactly
      how you feel!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton, holding his head, stared at the fire, which played and bubbled
      like his mother&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re so fond of each other,&rdquo; she began again.
      &ldquo;Such a sweet girl!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; muttered Shelton gloomily;
      &ldquo;it &lsquo;s not her&mdash;it&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;myself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Shelton again seized his hand, and this time pressed it to her soft,
      warm cheek, that had lost the elasticity of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried again; &ldquo;I understand. I know exactly
      what you &lsquo;re feeling.&rdquo; But Shelton saw from the fixed beam in
      her eyes that she had not an inkling. To do him justice, he was not so
      foolish as to try to give her one. Mrs. Shelton sighed. &ldquo;It would be
      so lovely if you could wake up to-morrow and think differently. If I were
      you, my dear, I would have a good long walk, and then a Turkish bath; and
      then I would just write to her, and tell her all about it, and you&rsquo;ll
      see how beautifully it&rsquo;ll all come straight&rdquo;; and in the
      enthusiasm of advice Mrs. Shelton rose, and, with a faint stretch of her
      tiny figure, still so young, clasped her hands together. &ldquo;Now do,
      that &lsquo;s a dear old Dick! You &lsquo;ll just see how lovely it&rsquo;ll
      be!&rdquo; Shelton smiled; he had not the heart to chase away this vision.
      &ldquo;And give her my warmest love, and tell her I &lsquo;m longing for
      the wedding. Come, now, my dear boy, promise me that&rsquo;s what you
      &lsquo;ll do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Shelton said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Shelton had taken up her stand with one foot on the fender, in spite
      of her sciatica.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; she cried; her eyes beamed as if intoxicated by
      her sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wonderful woman! The uncomplicated optimism that carried her through good
      and ill had not descended to her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      From pole to pole he had been thrown that day, from the French barber,
      whose intellect accepted nothing without carping, and whose little fingers
      worked all day, to save himself from dying out, to his own mother, whose
      intellect accepted anything presented with sufficient glow, but who, until
      she died, would never stir a finger. When Shelton reached his rooms, he
      wrote to Antonia:
    </p>
    <p>
      I can&rsquo;t wait about in London any longer; I am going down to Bideford
      to start a walking tour. I shall work my way to Oxford, and stay there
      till I may come to Holm Oaks. I shall send you my address; do write as
      usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      He collected all the photographs he had of her&mdash;amateur groups, taken
      by Mrs. Dennant&mdash;and packed them in the pocket of his
      shooting-jacket. There was one where she was standing just below her
      little brother, who was perched upon a wall. In her half-closed eyes,
      round throat, and softly tilted chin, there was something cool and
      watchful, protecting the ragamuffin up above her head. This he kept apart
      to be looked at daily, as a man says his prayers.

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE INDIAN CIVILIAN
    </h3>
    <p>
      One morning then, a week later, Shelton found himself at the walls of
      Princetown Prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had seen this lugubrious stone cage before. But the magic of his
      morning walk across the moor, the sight of the pagan tors, the songs of
      the last cuckoo, had unprepared him for that dreary building. He left the
      street, and, entering the fosse, began a circuit, scanning the walls with
      morbid fascination.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, was the system by which men enforced the will of the majority,
      and it was suddenly borne in on him that all the ideas and maxims which
      his Christian countrymen believed themselves to be fulfilling daily were
      stultified in every cellule of the social honeycomb. Such teachings as
      &ldquo;He that is without sin amongst you&rdquo; had been pronounced
      unpractical by peers and judges, bishops, statesmen, merchants, husbands&mdash;in
      fact, by every truly Christian person in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; thought Shelton, as if he had found out something new,
      &ldquo;the more Christian the nation, the less it has to do with the
      Christian spirit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Society was a charitable organisation, giving nothing for nothing, little
      for sixpence; and it was only fear that forced it to give at all!
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a seat on a wall, and began to watch a warder who was slowly
      paring a last year&rsquo;s apple. The expression of his face, the way he
      stood with his solid legs apart, his head poked forward and his lower jaw
      thrust out, all made him a perfect pillar of Society. He was undisturbed
      by Shelton&rsquo;s scrutiny, watching the rind coil down below the apple;
      until in a springing spiral it fell on the path and collapsed like a toy
      snake. He took a bite; his teeth were jagged; and his mouth immense. It
      was obvious that he considered himself a most superior man. Shelton
      frowned, got down slowly, from the wall, and proceeded on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little further down the hill he stopped again to watch a group of
      convicts in a field. They seemed to be dancing in a slow and sad cotillon,
      while behind the hedge on every side were warders armed with guns. Just
      such a sight, substituting spears could have been seen in Roman times.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he thus stood looking, a man, walking, rapidly, stopped beside him,
      and asked how many miles it was to Exeter. His round visage; and long,
      brown eyes, sliding about beneath their brows, his cropped hair and short
      neck, seemed familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is Crocker, is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! it&rsquo;s the Bird!&rdquo; exclaimed the traveller; putting
      out his hand. &ldquo;Have n&rsquo;t seen you since we both went down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton returned his handgrip. Crocker had lived above his head at
      college, and often kept him, sleepless half the night by playing on the
      hautboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you sprung from?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;India. Got my long leave. I say, are you going this way? Let&rsquo;s
      go together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They went, and very fast; faster and faster every minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going at this pace?&rdquo; asked Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;London.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! only as far as London?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve set myself to do it in a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in training?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;ll kill yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker answered with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton noted with alarm the expression of his eye; there was a sort of
      stubborn aspiration in it. &ldquo;Still an idealist!&rdquo; he thought;
      &ldquo;poor fellow!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;what
      sort of a time have you had in India?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Indian civilian absently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve,
      had the plague.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker smiled, and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caught it on famine duty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;plague and famine! I suppose you
      fellows really think you &lsquo;re doing good out there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion looked at him surprised, then answered modestly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We get very good screws.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &lsquo;s the great thing,&rdquo; responded Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, Crocker, looking straight before him,
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we are doing good?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m not an authority; but, as a matter of fact, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker seemed disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he bluntly asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton was not anxious to explain his views, and he did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;re doing good in India?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Shelton gruffly, &ldquo;how can progress be
      imposed on nations from outside?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian civilian, glancing at Shelton in an affectionate and doubtful
      way, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have n&rsquo;t changed a bit, old chap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;you &lsquo;re not going to get
      out of it that way. Give me a single example of a nation, or an
      individual, for that matter, who &lsquo;s ever done any good without
      having worked up to it from within.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker, grunting, muttered, &ldquo;Evils.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &lsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;we take peoples
      entirely different from our own, and stop their natural development by
      substituting a civilisation grown for our own use. Suppose, looking at a
      tropical fern in a hothouse, you were to say: &lsquo;This heat &lsquo;s
      unhealthy for me; therefore it must be bad for the fern, I &lsquo;ll take
      it up and plant it outside in the fresh air.&rsquo;.rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that means giving up India?&rdquo; said the Indian
      civilian shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that; but to talk about doing good to India is&mdash;h&rsquo;m!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker knitted his brows, trying to see the point of view his friend was
      showing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now! Should we go on administering India if it were dead
      loss? No. Well, to talk about administering the country for the purpose of
      pocketing money is cynical, and there &lsquo;s generally some truth in
      cynicism; but to talk about the administration of a country by which we
      profit, as if it were a great and good thing, is cant. I hit you in the
      wind for the benefit of myself&mdash;all right: law of nature; but to say
      it does you good at the same time is beyond me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; returned Crocker, grave and anxious; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t
      persuade me that we &lsquo;re not doing good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit. It&rsquo;s all a question of horizons; you look at it
      from too close. Put the horizon further back. You hit India in the wind,
      and say it&rsquo;s virtuous. Well, now let&rsquo;s see what happens.
      Either the wind never comes back, and India gasps to an untimely death, or
      the wind does come back, and in the pant of reaction your blow&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      to say your labour&mdash;is lost, morally lost labour that you might have
      spent where it would n&rsquo;t have been lost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are n&rsquo;t you an Imperialist?&rdquo; asked Crocker, genuinely
      concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be, but I keep my mouth shut about the benefits we &lsquo;re
      conferring upon other people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can&rsquo;t believe in abstract right, or justice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth have our ideas of justice or right got to do with
      India?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought as you do,&rdquo; sighed the unhappy Crocker, &ldquo;I
      should be all adrift.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. We always think our standards best for the whole world.
      It&rsquo;s a capital belief for us. Read the speeches of our public men.
      Does n&rsquo;t it strike you as amazing how sure they are of being in the
      right? It&rsquo;s so charming to benefit yourself and others at the same
      time, though, when you come to think of it, one man&rsquo;s meat is
      usually another&rsquo;s poison. Look at nature. But in England we never
      look at nature&mdash;there&rsquo;s no necessity. Our national point of
      view has filled our pockets, that&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, old chap, that&rsquo;s awfully bitter,&rdquo; said Crocker,
      with a sort of wondering sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &lsquo;s enough to make any one bitter the way we Pharisees wax
      fat, and at the same time give ourselves the moral airs of a balloon. I
      must stick a pin in sometimes, just to hear the gas escape.&rdquo; Shelton
      was surprised at his own heat, and for some strange reason thought of
      Antonia&mdash;surely, she was not a Pharisee.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion strode along, and Shelton felt sorry for the signs of
      trouble on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To fill your pockets,&rdquo; said Crocker, &ldquo;is n&rsquo;t the
      main thing. One has just got to do things without thinking of why we do
      them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever see the other side to any question?&rdquo; asked
      Shelton. &ldquo;I suppose not. You always begin to act before you stop
      thinking, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Pharisee, too,&rdquo; thought Shelton, &ldquo;without
      a Pharisee&rsquo;s pride. Queer thing that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking some distance, as if thinking deeply, Crocker chuckled out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;re not consistent; you ought to be in favour of giving
      up India.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton smiled uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should n&rsquo;t we fill our pockets? I only object to the
      humbug that we talk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian civilian put his hand shyly through his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought like you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I could n&rsquo;t
      stay another day in India.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And to this Shelton made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind had now begun to drop, and something of the morning&rsquo;s magic
      was stealing again upon the moor. They were nearing the outskirt fields of
      cultivation. It was past five when, dropping from the level of the tors,
      they came into the sunny vale of Monkland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say,&rdquo; said Crocker, reading from his guide-book&mdash;&ldquo;they
      say this place occupies a position of unique isolation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two travellers, in tranquil solitude, took their seats under an old
      lime-tree on the village green. The smoke of their pipes, the sleepy air,
      the warmth from the baked ground, the constant hum, made Shelton drowsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; his companion asked, &ldquo;those &lsquo;jaws&rsquo;
      you used to have with Busgate and old Halidome in my rooms on Sunday
      evenings? How is old Halidome?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married,&rdquo; replied Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker sighed. &ldquo;And are you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Shelton grimly; &ldquo;I &lsquo;m&mdash;engaged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker took hold of his arm above the elbow, and, squeezing it, he
      grunted. Shelton had not received congratulations that pleased him more;
      there was the spice of envy in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to get married while I &lsquo;m home,&rdquo; said the
      civilian after a long pause. His legs were stretched apart, throwing
      shadows on the green, his hands deep thrust into his pockets, his head a
      little to one side. An absent-minded smile played round his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had sunk behind a tor, but the warmth kept rising from the ground,
      and the sweet-briar on a cottage bathed them with its spicy perfume. From
      the converging lanes figures passed now and then, lounged by, staring at
      the strangers, gossiping amongst themselves, and vanished into the
      cottages that headed the incline. A clock struck seven, and round the
      shady lime-tree a chafer or some heavy insect commenced its booming
      rushes. All was marvellously sane and slumbrous. The soft air, the
      drawling voices, the shapes and murmurs, the rising smell of wood-smoke
      from fresh-kindled fires&mdash;were full of the spirit of security and of
      home. The outside world was far indeed. Typical of some island nation was
      this nest of refuge&mdash;where men grew quietly tall, fattened, and
      without fuss dropped off their perches; where contentment flourished, as
      sunflowers flourished in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker&rsquo;s cap slipped off; he was nodding, and Shelton looked at
      him. From a manor house in some such village he had issued; to one of a
      thousand such homes he would find his way at last, untouched by the
      struggles with famines or with plagues, uninfected in his fibre, his
      prejudices, and his principles, unchanged by contact with strange peoples,
      new conditions, odd feelings, or queer points of view!
    </p>
    <p>
      The chafer buzzed against his shoulder, gathered flight again, and boomed
      away. Crocker roused himself, and, turning his amiable face, jogged
      Shelton&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking about, Bird?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A PARSON
    </h3>
    <p>
      Shelton continued to travel with his college friend, and on Wednesday
      night, four days after joining company, they reached the village of
      Dowdenhame. All day long the road had lain through pastureland, with thick
      green hedges and heavily feathered elms. Once or twice they had broken the
      monotony by a stretch along the towing-path of a canal, which, choked with
      water-lily plants and shining weeds, brooded sluggishly beside the fields.
      Nature, in one of her ironic moods, had cast a grey and iron-hard cloak
      over all the country&rsquo;s bland luxuriance. From dawn till darkness
      fell there had been no movement in the steely distant sky; a cold wind
      ruffed in the hedge-tops, and sent shivers through the branches of the
      elms. The cattle, dappled, pied, or bay, or white, continued grazing with
      an air of grumbling at their birthright. In a meadow close to the canal
      Shelton saw five magpies, and about five o&rsquo;clock the rain began, a
      steady, coldly-sneering rain, which Crocker, looking at the sky, declared
      was going to be over in a minute. But it was not over in a minute; they
      were soon drenched. Shelton was tired, and it annoyed him very much that
      his companion, who was also tired, should grow more cheerful. His thoughts
      kept harping upon Ferrand: &ldquo;This must be something like what he
      described to me, tramping on and on when you&rsquo;re dead-beat, until you
      can cadge up supper and a bed.&rdquo; And sulkily he kept on ploughing
      through the mud with glances at the exasperating Crocker, who had skinned
      one heel and was limping horribly. It suddenly came home to him that life
      for three quarters of the world meant physical exhaustion every day,
      without a possibility of alternative, and that as soon as, for some cause
      beyond control, they failed thus to exhaust themselves, they were reduced
      to beg or starve. &ldquo;And then we, who don&rsquo;t know the meaning of
      the word exhaustion, call them &lsquo;idle scamps,&rsquo;.rdquo; he said
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was past nine and dark when they reached Dowdenhame. The street yielded
      no accommodation, and while debating where to go they passed the church,
      with a square tower, and next to it a house which was certainly the
      parsonage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said Crocker, leaning on his arms upon the gate,
      &ldquo;we ask him where to go&rdquo;; and, without waiting for Shelton&rsquo;s
      answer, he rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened by the parson, a bloodless and clean-shaven man, whose
      hollow cheeks and bony hands suggested a perpetual struggle. Ascetically
      benevolent were his grey eyes; a pale and ghostly smile played on the
      curves of his thin lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Inn? yes, there&rsquo;s
      the Blue Chequers, but I &lsquo;m afraid you &lsquo;ll find it shut. They
      &lsquo;re early people, I &lsquo;m glad to say&rdquo;; and his eyes seemed
      to muse over the proper fold for these damp sheep. &ldquo;Are you Oxford
      men, by any chance?&rdquo; he asked, as if that might throw some light
      upon the matter. &ldquo;Of Mary&rsquo;s? Really! I&rsquo;m of Paul&rsquo;s
      myself. Ladyman&mdash;Billington Ladyman; you might remember my youngest
      brother. I could give you a room here if you could manage without sheets.
      My housekeeper has two days&rsquo; holiday; she&rsquo;s foolishly taken
      the keys.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton accepted gladly, feeling that the intonation in the parson&rsquo;s
      voice was necessary unto his calling, and that he did not want to
      patronise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;re hungry, I expect, after your tramp. I&rsquo;m very
      much afraid there &lsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;nothing in the house but bread;
      I could boil you water; hot lemonade is better than nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Conducting them into the kitchen, he made a fire, and put a kettle on to
      boil; then, after leaving them to shed their soaking clothes, returned
      with ancient, greenish coats, some carpet slippers, and some blankets.
      Wrapped in these, and carrying their glasses, the travellers followed to
      the study, where, by doubtful lamp-light, he seemed, from books upon the
      table, to have been working at his sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &lsquo;re giving you a lot of trouble,&rdquo; said Shelton,
      &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really very good of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; the parson answered; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only
      grieved the house is empty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a truly dismal contrast to the fatness of the land they had been
      passing through, and the parson&rsquo;s voice issuing from bloodless lips,
      although complacent, was pathetic. It was peculiar, that voice of his,
      seeming to indicate an intimate acquaintanceship with what was fat and
      fine, to convey contempt for the vulgar need of money, while all the time
      his eyes&mdash;those watery, ascetic eyes&mdash;as plain as speech they
      said, &ldquo;Oh, to know what it must be like to have a pound or two to
      spare just once a year, or so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything in the room had been bought for cheapness; no luxuries were
      there, and necessaries not enough. It was bleak and bare; the ceiling
      cracked, the wall-paper discoloured, and those books&mdash;prim, shining
      books, fat-backed, with arms stamped on them&mdash;glared in the
      surrounding barrenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My predecessor,&rdquo; said the parson, &ldquo;played rather havoc
      with the house. The poor fellow had a dreadful struggle, I was told. You
      can, unfortunately, expect nothing else these days, when livings have come
      down so terribly in value! He was a married man&mdash;large family!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker, who had drunk his steaming lemonade, was smiling and already
      nodding in his chair; with his black garment buttoned closely round his
      throat, his long legs rolled up in a blanket, and stretched towards the
      feeble flame of the newly-lighted fire, he had a rather patchy air.
      Shelton, on the other hand, had lost his feeling of fatigue; the
      strangeness of the place was stimulating his brain; he kept stealing
      glances at the scantiness around; the room, the parson, the furniture, the
      very fire, all gave him the feeling caused by seeing legs that have
      outgrown their trousers. But there was something underlying that leanness
      of the landscape, something superior and academic, which defied all
      sympathy. It was pure nervousness which made him say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! why do they have such families?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint red mounted to the parson&rsquo;s cheeks; its appearance there was
      startling, and Crocker chuckled, as a sleepy man will chuckle who feels
      bound to show that he is not asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very unfortunate,&rdquo; murmured the parson, &ldquo;certainly,
      in many cases.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton would now have changed the subject, but at this moment the unhappy
      Crocker snored. Being a man of action, he had gone to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Shelton hurriedly, as he saw the parson&rsquo;s
      eyebrows rising at the sound, &ldquo;almost what you might call wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, but how can it be wrong?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton now felt that he must justify his saying somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;only one hears of such a
      lot of cases&mdash;clergymen&rsquo;s families; I&rsquo;ve two uncles of my
      own, who&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A new expression gathered on the parson&rsquo;s face; his mouth had
      tightened, and his chin receded slightly. &ldquo;Why, he &lsquo;s like a
      mule!&rdquo; thought Shelton. His eyes, too, had grown harder, greyer, and
      more parroty. Shelton no longer liked his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you and I,&rdquo; the parson said, &ldquo;would not
      understand each other on such matters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Shelton felt ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to ask you a question in turn, however,&rdquo; the
      parson said, as if desirous of meeting Shelton on his low ground: &ldquo;How
      do you justify marriage if it is not to follow the laws of nature?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only tell you what I personally feel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, you forget that a woman&rsquo;s chief delight is in
      her motherhood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought it a pleasure likely to pall with too much
      repetition. Motherhood is motherhood, whether of one or of a dozen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; replied the parson, with impatience,
      though still keeping on his guest&rsquo;s low ground, &ldquo;your theories
      are not calculated to populate the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever lived in London?&rdquo; Shelton asked. &ldquo;It
      always makes me feel a doubt whether we have any right to have children at
      all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said the parson with wonderful restraint, and the
      joints of his fingers cracked with the grip he had upon his chair, &ldquo;you
      are leaving out duty towards the country; national growth is paramount!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two ways of looking at that. It depends on what you want
      your country to become.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the parson&mdash;fanaticism now
      had crept into his smile&mdash;&ldquo;there could be any doubt on such a
      subject.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The more Shelton felt that commands were being given him, the more
      controversial he naturally became&mdash;apart from the merits of this
      subject, to which he had hardly ever given thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say I&rsquo;m wrong,&rdquo; he said, fastening his eyes on
      the blanket in which his legs were wrapped; &ldquo;but it seems to me at
      least an open question whether it&rsquo;s better for the country to be so
      well populated as to be quite incapable of supporting itself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said the parson, whose face regained its pallor,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not a Little Englander?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On Shelton this phrase had a mysterious effect. Resisting an impulse to
      discover what he really was, he answered hastily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson followed up his triumph, and, shifting the ground of the
      discussion from Shelton&rsquo;s to his own, he gravely said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you must see that your theory is founded in immorality. It
      is, if I may say so, extravagant, even wicked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Shelton, suffering from irritation at his own dishonesty, replied with
      heat:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not say at once, sir, &lsquo;hysterical, unhealthy&rsquo;. Any
      opinion which goes contrary to that of the majority is always called so, I
      believe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned the parson, whose eyes seemed trying to bind
      Shelton to his will, &ldquo;I must say your ideas do seem to me both
      extravagant and unhealthy. The propagation of children is enjoined of
      marriage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton bowed above his blanket, but the parson did not smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We live in very dangerous times,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it
      grieves me when a man of your standing panders to these notions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;whom the shoe does n&rsquo;t
      pinch make this rule of morality, and thrust it on to such as the shoe
      does pinch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rule was never made,&rdquo; said the parson; &ldquo;it was
      given us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo; He was in
      danger of forgetting the delicate position he was in. &ldquo;He wants to
      ram his notions down my throat,&rdquo; he thought; and it seemed to him
      that the parson&rsquo;s face had grown more like a mule&rsquo;s, his
      accent more superior, his eyes more dictatorial: To be right in this
      argument seemed now of great importance, whereas, in truth, it was of no
      importance whatsoever. That which, however, was important was the fact
      that in nothing could they ever have agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Crocker had suddenly ceased to snore; his head had fallen so that a
      peculiar whistling arose instead. Both Shelton and the parson looked at
      him, and the sight sobered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend seems very tired,&rdquo; said the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton forgot all his annoyance, for his host seemed suddenly pathetic,
      with those baggy garments, hollow cheeks, and the slightly reddened nose
      that comes from not imbibing quite enough. A kind fellow, after all!
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind fellow rose, and, putting his hands behind his back, placed
      himself before the blackening fire. Whole centuries of authority stood
      behind him. It was an accident that the mantelpiece was chipped and rusty,
      the fire-irons bent and worn, his linen frayed about the cuffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to dictate,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but where it
      seems to me that you are wholly wrong in that your ideas foster in women
      those lax views of the family life that are so prevalent in Society
      nowadays.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughts of Antonia with her candid eyes, the touch of freckling on her
      pink-white skin, the fair hair gathered back, sprang up in Shelton, and
      that word&mdash;&ldquo;lax&rdquo; seemed ridiculous. And the women he was
      wont to see dragging about the streets of London with two or three small
      children, Women bent beneath the weight of babies that they could not
      leave, women going to work with babies still unborn, anaemic-looking
      women, impecunious mothers in his own class, with twelve or fourteen
      children, all the victims of the sanctity of marriage, and again the word
      &ldquo;lax&rdquo; seemed to be ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not put into the world to exercise our wits,&rdquo;&mdash;muttered
      Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our wanton wills,&rdquo; the parson said severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, sir, may have been all right for the last generation, the
      country is more crowded now. I can&rsquo;t see why we should n&rsquo;t
      decide it for ourselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a view of morality,&rdquo; said the parson, looking down at
      Crocker with a ghostly smile, &ldquo;to me is unintelligible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cracker&rsquo;s whistling grew in tone and in variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I hate,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;is the way we men decide
      what women are to bear, and then call them immoral, decadent, or what you
      will, if they don&rsquo;t fall in with our views.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Shelton,&rdquo; said the parson, &ldquo;I think we may safely
      leave it in the hands of God.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The questions of morality,&rdquo; said the parson promptly, &ldquo;have
      always lain through God in the hands of men, not women. We are the
      reasonable sex.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton stubbornly replied
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &lsquo;re certainly the greater humbugs, if that &lsquo;s the
      same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is too bad,&rdquo; exclaimed the parson with some heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m sorry, sir; but how can you expect women nowadays to
      have the same views as our grandmothers? We men, by our commercial
      enterprise, have brought about a different state of things; yet, for the
      sake of our own comfort, we try to keep women where they were. It&rsquo;s
      always those men who are most keen about their comfort&rdquo;&mdash;and in
      his heat the sarcasm of using the word &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; in that room
      was lost on him&mdash;&ldquo;who are so ready to accuse women of deserting
      the old morality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson quivered with impatient irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old morality! new morality!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These are
      strange words.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; explained Shelton; &ldquo;we &lsquo;re talking
      of working morality, I imagine. There&rsquo;s not a man in a million fit
      to talk of true morality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of his host contracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and his voice sounded as if he had
      pinched it in the endeavour to impress his listener&mdash;&ldquo;that any
      well-educated man who honestly tries to serve his God has the right humbly&mdash;I
      say humbly&mdash;to claim morality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton was on the point of saying something bitter, but checked himself.
      &ldquo;Here am I,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;trying to get the last word,
      like an old woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment there was heard a piteous mewing; the parson went towards
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me a moment; I &lsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s one of my cats
      out in the wet.&rdquo; He returned a minute later with a wet cat in his
      arms. &ldquo;They will get out,&rdquo; he said to Shelton, with a smile on
      his thin face, suffused by stooping. And absently he stroked the dripping
      cat, while a drop of wet ran off his nose. &ldquo;Poor pussy, poor pussy!&rdquo;
      The sound of that &ldquo;Poor pussy!&rdquo; like nothing human in its
      cracked superiority, the softness of that smile, like the smile of
      gentleness itself, haunted Shelton till he fell asleep.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ACADEMIC
    </h3>
    <p>
      The last sunlight was playing on the roofs when the travellers entered
      that High Street grave and holy to all Oxford men. The spirit hovering
      above the spires was as different from its concretions in their caps and
      gowns as ever the spirit of Christ was from church dogmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go into Grinnings&rsquo;.&rdquo; asked Shelton, as they
      passed the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      But each looked at his clothes, for two elegant young men in flannel suits
      were coming out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go,&rdquo; said Crocker, with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton shook his head. Never before had he felt such love for this old
      city. It was gone now from out his life, but everything about it seemed so
      good and fine; even its exclusive air was not ignoble. Clothed in the calm
      of history, the golden web of glorious tradition, radiant with the alchemy
      of memories, it bewitched him like the perfume of a woman&rsquo;s dress.
      At the entrance of a college they glanced in at the cool grey patch of
      stone beyond, and the scarlet of a window flowerbox&mdash;secluded,
      mysteriously calm&mdash;a narrow vision of the sacred past. Pale and
      trencher-capped, a youth with pimply face and random nose, grabbing at his
      cloven gown, was gazing at the noticeboard. The college porter&mdash;large
      man, fresh-faced, and small-mouthed&mdash;stood at his lodge door in a
      frank and deferential attitude. An image of routine, he looked like one
      engaged to give a decorous air to multitudes of pecadilloes. His blue eyes
      rested on the travellers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you, sirs, but if you
      want to speak I shall be glad to hear the observations you may have to
      make,&rdquo; they seemed to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against the wall reposed a bicycle with tennis-racquet buckled to its
      handle. A bull-dog bitch, working her snout from side to side, was
      snuffling horribly; the great iron-studded door to which her chain was
      fastened stayed immovable. Through this narrow mouth, human metal had been
      poured for centuries&mdash;poured, moulded, given back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now entered the Bishop&rsquo;s Head, and had their dinner in the room
      where Shelton had given his Derby dinner to four-and-twenty well-bred
      youths; here was the picture of the racehorse that the wineglass, thrown
      by one of them, had missed when it hit the waiter; and there, serving
      Crocker with anchovy sauce, was the very waiter. When they had finished,
      Shelton felt the old desire to rise with difficulty from the table; the
      old longing to patrol the streets with arm hooked in some other arm; the
      old eagerness to dare and do something heroic&mdash;and unlawful; the old
      sense that he was of the forest set, in the forest college, of the forest
      country in the finest world. The streets, all grave and mellow in the
      sunset, seemed to applaud this after-dinner stroll; the entrance quad of
      his old college&mdash;spaciously majestic, monastically modern, for years
      the heart of his universe, the focus of what had gone before it in his
      life, casting the shadow of its grey walls over all that had come
      after-brought him a sense of rest from conflict, and trust in his own
      important safety. The garden-gate, whose lofty spikes he had so often
      crowned with empty water-bottles, failed to rouse him. Nor when they
      passed the staircase where he had flung a leg of lamb at some indelicate
      disturbing tutor, did he feel remorse. High on that staircase were the
      rooms in which he had crammed for his degree, upon the system by which the
      scholar simmers on the fire of cramming, boils over at the moment of
      examination, and is extinct for ever after. His coach&rsquo;s face
      recurred to him, a man with thrusting eyes, who reeled off knowledge all
      the week, and disappeared to town on Sundays.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed their tutor&rsquo;s staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if little Turl would remember us?&rdquo; said Crocker;
      &ldquo;I should like to see him. Shall we go and look him up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Turl?&rdquo; said Shelton dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mounting, they knocked upon a solid door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the voice of Sleep itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little man with a pink face and large red ears was sitting in a fat pink
      chair, as if he had been grown there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he asked of them, blinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless me! Crocker, isn&rsquo;t it? I didn&rsquo;t recognise you
      with a beard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker, who had not been shaved since starting on his travels, chuckled
      feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember Shelton, sir?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shelton? Oh yes! How do you do, Shelton? Sit down; take a cigar&rdquo;;
      and, crossing his fat little legs, the little gentleman looked them up and
      down with drowsy interest, as who should say, &ldquo;Now, after, all you
      know, why come and wake me up like this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton and Crocker took two other chairs; they too seemed thinking,
      &ldquo;Yes, why did we come and wake him up like this?&rdquo; And Shelton,
      who could not tell the reason why, took refuge in the smoke of his cigar.
      The panelled walls were hung with prints of celebrated Greek remains; the
      soft, thick carpet on the floor was grateful to his tired feet; the backs
      of many books gleamed richly in the light of the oil lamps; the culture
      and tobacco smoke stole on his senses; he but vaguely comprehended Crocker&rsquo;s
      amiable talk, vaguely the answers of his little host, whose face, blinking
      behind the bowl of his huge meerschaum pipe, had such a queer resemblance
      to a moon. The door was opened, and a tall creature, whose eyes were large
      and brown, whose face was rosy and ironical, entered with a manly stride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, looking round him with his chin a little in the
      air, &ldquo;am I intruding, Turl?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little host, blinking more than ever, murmured,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, Berryman&mdash;take a pew!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor called Berryman sat down, and gazed up at the wall with his
      fine eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton had a faint remembrance of this don, and bowed; but the newcomer
      sat smiling, and did not notice the salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trimmer and Washer are coming round,&rdquo; he said, and as he
      spoke the door opened to admit these gentlemen. Of the same height, but
      different appearance, their manner was faintly jocular, faintly
      supercilious, as if they tolerated everything. The one whose name was
      Trimmer had patches of red on his large cheek-bones, and on his cheeks a
      bluish tint. His lips were rather full, so that he had a likeness to a
      spider. Washer, who was thin and pale, wore an intellectual smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little fat host moved the hand that held the meerschaum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crocker, Shelton,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      An awkward silence followed. Shelton tried to rouse the cultured portion
      of his wits; but the sense that nothing would be treated seriously
      paralysed his faculties; he stayed silent, staring at the glowing tip of
      his cigar. It seemed to him unfair to have intruded on these gentlemen
      without its having been made quite clear to them beforehand who and what
      he was; he rose to take his leave, but Washer had begun to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Bovary!&rdquo; he said quizzically, reading the title of the
      book on the little fat man&rsquo;s bookrest; and, holding it closer to his
      boiled-looking eyes, he repeated, as though it were a joke, &ldquo;Madame
      Bovary!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say, Turl, that you can stand that stuff?&rdquo;
      said Berryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As might have been expected, this celebrated novel&rsquo;s name had
      galvanised him into life; he strolled over to the bookcase, took down a
      book, opened it, and began to read, wandering in a desultory way about the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Berryman,&rdquo; said a conciliatory voice behind&mdash;it came
      from Trimmer, who had set his back against the hearth, and grasped with
      either hand a fistful of his gown&mdash;&ldquo;the book&rsquo;s a classic!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Classic!&rdquo; exclaimed Berryman, transfixing Shelton with his
      eyes; &ldquo;the fellow ought to have been horsewhipped for writing such
      putridity!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A feeling of hostility instantly sprang up in Shelton; he looked at his
      little host, who, however, merely blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Berryman only means,&rdquo; explains Washer, a certain malice in
      his smile, &ldquo;that the author is n&rsquo;t one of his particular pets.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, you know, don&rsquo;t get Berryman on his
      horse!&rdquo; growled the little fat man suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berryman returned his volume to the shelf and took another down. There was
      something almost godlike in his sarcastic absent-mindedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagine a man writing that stuff,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if he&rsquo;d
      ever been at Eton! What do we want to know about that sort of thing? A
      writer should be a sportsman and a gentleman&rdquo;; and again he looked
      down over his chin at Shelton, as though expecting him to controvert the
      sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you&mdash;&rdquo; began the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Berryman&rsquo;s attention had wandered to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to know what a
      woman feels when she is going to the dogs; it does n&rsquo;t interest me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Trimmer made things pleasant:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Question of moral standards, that, and nothing more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stretched his legs like compasses,&mdash;and the way he grasped his
      gown-wings seemed to turn him to a pair of scales. His lowering smile
      embraced the room, deprecating strong expressions. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo;
      he seemed to say, &ldquo;we are men of the world; we know there &lsquo;s
      not very much in anything. This is the modern spirit; why not give it a
      look in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand you to say, Berryman, that you don&rsquo;t enjoy a
      spicy book?&rdquo; asked Washer with his smile; and at this question the
      little fat man sniggered, blinking tempestuously, as if to say, &ldquo;Nothing
      pleasanter, don&rsquo;t you know, before a hot fire in cold weather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Berryman paid no attention to the impertinent inquiry, continuing to dip
      into his volume and walk up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to say,&rdquo; he remarked, stopping before
      Shelton, and looking down, as if at last aware of him, &ldquo;to those who
      talk of being justified through Art. I call a spade a spade.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton did not answer, because he could not tell whether Berryman was
      addressing him or society at large. And Berryman went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do we want to know about the feelings of a middle-class woman with
      a taste for vice? Tell me the point of it. No man who was in the habit of
      taking baths would choose such a subject.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come to the question of-ah-subjects,&rdquo; the voice of
      Trimmer genially buzzed he had gathered his garments tight across his back&mdash;&ldquo;my
      dear fellow, Art, properly applied, justifies all subjects.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Art,&rdquo; squeaked Berryman, putting back his second volume
      and taking down a third, &ldquo;you have Homer, Cervantes, Shakespeare,
      Ossian; for garbage, a number of unwashed gentlemen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a laugh; Shelton glanced round at all in turn. With the
      exception of Crocker, who was half asleep and smiling idiotically, they
      wore, one and all, a look as if by no chance could they consider any
      subject fit to move their hearts; as if, one and all, they were so
      profoundly anchored on the sea of life that waves could only seem
      impertinent. It may have been some glimmer in this glance of Shelton&rsquo;s
      that brought Trimmer once more to the rescue with his compromising air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The French,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have quite a different standard
      from ourselves in literature, just as they have a different standard in
      regard to honour. All this is purely artificial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What he, meant, however, Shelton found it difficult to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honour,&rdquo; said Washer, &ldquo;&lsquo;l&rsquo;honneur, die Ehre&rsquo;
      duelling, unfaithful wives&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was clearly going to add to this, but it was lost; for the little fat
      man, taking the meerschaum with trembling fingers, and holding it within
      two inches of his chin, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fellows, Berryman&rsquo;s awf&rsquo;ly strong on honour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He blinked twice, and put the meerschaum back between his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without returning the third volume to its shelf, Berryman took down a
      fourth; with chest expanded, he appeared about to use the books as
      dumb-bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Trimmer; &ldquo;the change from duelling to
      law courts is profoundly&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether he were going to say &ldquo;significant&rdquo; or &ldquo;insignificant,&rdquo;
      in Shelton&rsquo;s estimate he did not know himself. Fortunately Berryman
      broke in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law courts or not, when a man runs away with a wife of mine, I
      shall punch his head!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said Turner, spasmodically grasping his two
      wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton had a gleam of inspiration. &ldquo;If your wife deceived you,&rdquo;
      he thought, looking at Trimmer&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;you &lsquo;d keep it
      quiet, and hold it over her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Washer passed his hand over his pale chaps: his smile had never wavered;
      he looked like one for ever lost in the making of an epigram.
    </p>
    <p>
      The punching theorist stretched his body, holding the books level with his
      shoulders, as though to stone his hearers with his point of view. His face
      grew paler, his fine eyes finer, his lips ironical. Almost painful was
      this combination of the &ldquo;strong&rdquo; man and the student who was
      bound to go to pieces if you hit him a smart blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for forgiving faithless wives,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and all
      that sort of thing, I don&rsquo;t believe in sentiment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were high-pitched and sarcastic. Shelton looked hastily around.
      All their faces were complacent. He grew red, and suddenly remarked, in a
      soft; clear voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious that he had never before made an impression of this sort,
      and that he never would again. The cold hostility flashing out all round
      was most enlightening; it instantly gave way to the polite, satirical
      indulgence peculiar to highly-cultivated men. Crocker rose nervously; he
      seemed scared, and was obviously relieved when Shelton, following his
      example, grasped the little fat man&rsquo;s hand, who said good-night in a
      voice shaken by tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are your unshaven friends?&rdquo; he heard as the door was
      closed behind them.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN INCIDENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Crocker, as they went out of
      college. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel sleepy; shall we stroll along the
      &lsquo;High&rsquo; a bit?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton assented; he was too busy thinking of his encounter with the dons
      to heed the soreness of his feet. This, too, was the last day of his
      travels, for he had not altered his intention of waiting at Oxford till
      July.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We call this place the heart of knowledge,&rdquo; he said, passing
      a great building that presided, white and silent, over darkness; &ldquo;it
      seems to me as little that, as Society is the heart of true gentility.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker&rsquo;s answer was a grunt; he was looking at the stars,
      calculating possibly in how long he could walk to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; proceeded Shelton; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve too much
      common-sense up here to strain our minds. We know when it&rsquo;s time to
      stop. We pile up news of Papias and all the verbs in &lsquo;ui&rsquo; but
      as for news of life or of oneself! Real seekers after knowledge are a
      different sort. They fight in the dark&mdash;no quarter given. We don&rsquo;t
      grow that sort up here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How jolly the limes smell!&rdquo; said Crocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had halted opposite a garden, and taken hold of Shelton by a button of
      his coat. His eyes, like a dog&rsquo;s, stared wistfully. It seemed as
      though he wished to speak, but feared to give offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell you,&rdquo; pursued Shelton, &ldquo;that we learn to be
      gentlemen up here. We learn that better through one incident that stirs
      our hearts than we learn it here in all the time we&rsquo;re up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; muttered Crocker, twisting at the button; &ldquo;those
      fellows who seemed the best sorts up here have turned out the best sorts
      afterwards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Shelton gloomily; &ldquo;I was a snob when
      I was up here. I believed all I was told, anything that made things
      pleasant; my &lsquo;set&rsquo; were nothing but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker smiled in the darkness; he had been too &ldquo;cranky&rdquo; to
      belong to Shelton&rsquo;s &ldquo;set.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never were much like your &lsquo;set,&rsquo; old chap,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton turned away, sniffing the perfume of the limes. Images were
      thronging through his mind. The faces of his old friends strangely mixed
      with those of people he had lately met&mdash;the girl in the train,
      Ferrand, the lady with the short, round, powdered face, the little barber;
      others, too, and floating, mysterious,&mdash;connected with them all,
      Antonia&rsquo;s face. The scent of the lime-trees drifted at him with its
      magic sweetness. From the street behind, the footsteps of the passers-by
      sounded muffled, yet exact, and on the breeze was borne the strain:
      &ldquo;For he&rsquo;s a jolly good fellow!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For he&rsquo;s a jolly good fellow! For he&rsquo;s a jolly good
      fe-ellow! And so say all of us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they were good chaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to think,&rdquo; said Crocker dreamily, &ldquo;that some of
      them had too much side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Shelton laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing sickens me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the whole snobbish,
      selfish business. The place sickens me, lined with cotton-wool-made so
      beastly comfortable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a splendid old place,&rdquo; he said, his eyes fastening
      at last on Shelton&rsquo;s boots. &ldquo;You know, old chap,&rdquo; he
      stammered, &ldquo;I think you&mdash;you ought to take care!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care? What of?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker pressed his arm convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be waxy, old boy,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I mean that
      you seem somehow&mdash;to be&mdash;to be losing yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Losing myself! Finding myself, you mean!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker did not answer; his face was disappointed. Of what exactly was he
      thinking? In Shelton&rsquo;s heart there was a bitter pleasure in knowing
      that his friend was uncomfortable on his account, a sort of contempt, a
      sort of aching. Crocker broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall do a bit more walking to-night,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;I feel very fit. Don&rsquo;t you really mean to come any further
      with me, Bird?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was anxiety in his voice, as though Shelton were in danger of
      missing something good. The latter&rsquo;s feet had instantly begun to
      ache and burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;? he said; &ldquo;you know what I&rsquo;m staying here
      for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She lives near here. Well, then, I&rsquo;ll say good-bye. I should
      like to do another ten miles to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you&rsquo;re tired and lame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I want to get on. See you in London.
      Good-bye!&rdquo; and, gripping Shelton&rsquo;s hand, he turned and limped
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton called after him: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an idiot: You &lsquo;ll
      only knock yourself up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sole answer was the pale moon of Crocker&rsquo;s face screwed
      round towards him in the darkness, and the waving of his stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton strolled slowly on; leaning over the bridge, he watched the oily
      gleam of lamps, on the dark water underneath the trees. He felt relieved,
      yet sorry. His thoughts were random, curious, half mutinous, half sweet.
      That afternoon five years ago, when he had walked back from the river with
      Antonia across the Christchurch meadows, was vivid to his mind; the scent
      of that afternoon had never died away from him-the aroma of his love. Soon
      she would be his wife&mdash;his wife! The faces of the dons sprang up
      before him. They had wives, perhaps. Fat, lean, satirical, and
      compromising&mdash;what was it that through diversity they had in common?
      Cultured intolerance! . . . Honour! . . . A queer subject to discuss.
      Honour! The honour that made a fuss, and claimed its rights! And Shelton
      smiled. &ldquo;As if man&rsquo;s honour suffered when he&rsquo;s injured!&rdquo;
      And slowly he walked along the echoing, empty street to his room at the
      Bishop&rsquo;s Head. Next morning he received the following wire:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Thirty miles left eighteen hours heel bad but going
     strong                         CROCKER
</pre>
    <p>
      He passed a fortnight at the Bishop&rsquo;s Head, waiting for the end of
      his probation, and the end seemed long in coming. To be so near Antonia,
      and as far as if he lived upon another planet, was worse than ever. Each
      day he took a sculling skiff, and pulled down to near Holm Oaks, on the
      chance of her being on the river; but the house was two miles off, and the
      chance but slender. She never came. After spending the afternoons like
      this he would return, pulling hard against the stream, with a queer
      feeling of relief, dine heartily, and fall a-dreaming over his cigar. Each
      morning he awoke in an excited mood, devoured his letter if he had one,
      and sat down to write to her. These letters of his were the most amazing
      portion of that fortnight. They were remarkable for failing to express any
      single one of his real thoughts, but they were full of sentiments which
      were not what he was truly feeling; and when he set himself to analyse, he
      had such moments of delirium that he was scared, and shocked, and quite
      unable to write anything. He made the discovery that no two human beings
      ever tell each other what they really feel, except, perhaps, in situations
      with which he could not connect Antonia&rsquo;s ice-blue eyes and
      brilliant smile. All the world was too engaged in planning decency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed by longings, he but vaguely realised the turmoil of
      Commemoration, which had gathered its hundreds for their annual cure of
      salmon mayonnaise and cheap champagne. In preparation for his visit to
      Holm Oaks he shaved his beard and had some clothes sent down from London.
      With them was forwarded a letter from Ferrand, which ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      IMPERIAL PEACOCK HOTEL, FOLKESTONE,
    </p>
    <p>
      June 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgive me for not having written to you before, but I have been so
      bothered that I have felt no taste for writing; when I have the time, I
      have some curious stories to tell you. Once again I have encountered that
      demon of misfortune which dogs my footsteps. Being occupied all day and
      nearly all night upon business which brings me a heap of worries and next
      to no profit, I have no chance to look after my things. Thieves have
      entered my room, stolen everything, and left me an empty box. I am once
      again almost without clothes, and know not where to turn to make that
      figure necessary for the fulfilment of my duties. You see, I am not lucky.
      Since coming to your country, the sole piece of fortune I have had was to
      tumble on a man like you. Excuse me for not writing more at this moment.
      Hoping that you are in good health, and in affectionately pressing your
      hand,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am,
    </p>
    <p>
      Always your devoted
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUIS FERRAND.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon reading this letter Shelton had once more a sense of being exploited,
      of which he was ashamed; he sat down immediately and wrote the following
      reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      BISHOPS HEAD HOTEL, OXFORD,
    </p>
    <p>
      June 25.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR FERRAND,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am grieved to hear of your misfortunes. I was much hoping that you had
      made a better start. I enclose you Post Office Orders for four pounds.
      Always glad to hear from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      RICHARD SHELTON.
    </p>
    <p>
      He posted it with the satisfaction that a man feels who nobly shakes off
      his responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days before July he met with one of those disturbing incidents which
      befall no persons who attend quietly to their property and reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was unbearably hot, and he had wandered out with his cigar; a
      woman came sidling up and spoke to him. He perceived her to be one of
      those made by men into mediums for their pleasure, to feel sympathy with
      whom was sentimental. Her face was flushed, her whisper hoarse; she had no
      attractions but the curves of a tawdry figure. Shelton was repelled by her
      proprietary tone, by her blowzy face, and by the scent of patchouli. Her
      touch on his arm startled him, sending a shiver through his marrow; he
      almost leaped aside, and walked the faster. But her breathing as she
      followed sounded laboured; it suddenly seemed pitiful that a woman should
      be panting after him like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The least I can do,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;is to speak to her.&rdquo;
      He stopped, and, with a mixture of hardness and compassion, said, &ldquo;It
      &lsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her smile, he saw by her disappointed eyes that she accepted
      the impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She muttered something. Shelton shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said once more. &ldquo;Good.-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman bit her lower lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she answered dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner of the street he turned his head. The woman was hurrying
      uneasily; a policeman coming from behind had caught her by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart began to beat. &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;what
      shall I do now?&rdquo; His first impulse was to walk away, and think no
      more about it&mdash;to act, indeed, like any averagely decent man who did
      not care to be concerned in such affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He retraced his steps, however, and halted half a dozen paces from their
      figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the gentleman! He spoke to me,&rdquo; she was saying in her
      brassy voice, through the emphasis of which Shelton could detect her fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; returned the policeman, &ldquo;we
      know all about that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;police!&rdquo; cried the woman tearfully; &ldquo;I
      &lsquo;ve got to get my living, have n&rsquo;t I, the same as you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton hesitated, then, catching the expression in her frightened face,
      stepped forward. The policeman turned, and at the sight of his pale, heavy
      jowl, cut by the cheek-strap, and the bullying eyes, he felt both hate and
      fear, as if brought face to face with all that he despised and loathed,
      yet strangely dreaded. The cold certainty of law and order upholding the
      strong, treading underfoot the weak, the smug front of meanness that only
      the purest spirits may attack, seemed to be facing him. And the odd thing
      was, this man was only carrying out his duty. Shelton moistened his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to charge her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; returned the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here; constable, you &lsquo;re making a mistake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman took out his note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I &lsquo;m making a mistake? I &lsquo;ll take your name and
      address, please; we have to report these things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said Shelton, angrily giving it. &ldquo;I
      spoke to her first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll come up to the court tomorrow morning, and
      repeat that,&rdquo; replied the policeman, with incivility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton looked at him with all the force at his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better be careful, constable,&rdquo; he said; but in the
      act of uttering these words he thought how pitiable they sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &lsquo;re not to be trifled with,&rdquo; returned the policeman
      in a threatening voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton could think of nothing but to repeat:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better be careful, constable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a gentleman,&rdquo; replied the policeman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      only a policeman. You&rsquo;ve got the riches, I&rsquo;ve got the power.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grasping the woman&rsquo;s arm, he began to move along with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton turned, and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to Grinnings&rsquo; Club, and flung himself down upon a sofa. His
      feeling was not one of pity for the woman, nor of peculiar anger with the
      policeman, but rather of dissatisfaction with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ought I to have done?&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;the beggar was
      within his rights.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at the pictures on the wall, and a tide of disgust surged up in
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One or other of us,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;we make these women
      what they are. And when we&rsquo;ve made them, we can&rsquo;t do without
      them; we don&rsquo;t want to; but we give them no proper homes, so that
      they&rsquo;re reduced to prowl about the streets, and then we run them in.
      Ha! that&rsquo;s good&mdash;that&rsquo;s excellent! We run them in! And
      here we sit and carp. But what do we do? Nothing! Our system is the most
      highly moral known. We get the benefit without soiling even the hem of our
      phylacteries&mdash;the women are the only ones that suffer. And why should
      n&rsquo;t they&mdash;inferior things?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lit a cigarette, and ordered the waiter to bring a drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the Court,&rdquo; he thought; but suddenly it
      occurred to him that the case would get into the local papers. The press
      would never miss so nice a little bit of scandal&mdash;&ldquo;Gentleman v.
      Policeman!&rdquo; And he had a vision of Antonia&rsquo;s father, a
      neighbouring and conscientious magistrate, solemnly reading this. Someone,
      at all events, was bound to see his name and make a point of mentioning it
      too good to be missed! And suddenly he saw with horror that to help the
      woman he would have to assert again that he had spoken to her first.
      &ldquo;I must go to the Court!&rdquo; he kept thinking, as if to assure
      himself that he was not a coward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay awake half the night worrying over this dilemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did n&rsquo;t speak to her first,&rdquo; he told himself;
      &ldquo;I shall only be telling a lie, and they &lsquo;ll make me swear it,
      too!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to persuade himself that this was against his principles, but at
      the bottom of his heart he knew that he would not object to telling such a
      lie if only guaranteed immune from consequences; it appeared to him,
      indeed, but obvious humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should I suffer?&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done
      nothing. It&rsquo;s neither reasonable nor just.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He hated the unhappy woman who was causing him these horrors of
      uncertainty. Whenever he decided one way or other, the policeman&rsquo;s
      face, with its tyrannical and muddy eyes, rose before him like a
      nightmare, and forced him to an opposite conviction. He fell asleep at
      last with the full determination to go and see what happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He woke with a sense of odd disturbance. &ldquo;I can do no good by going,&rdquo;
      he thought, remembering, aid lying very still; &ldquo;they &lsquo;re
      certain to believe the policeman; I shall only blacken myself for nothing;&rdquo;
      and the combat began again within him, but with far less fury. It was not
      what other people thought, not even the risk of perjury that mattered (all
      this he made quite clear)&mdash;it was Antonia. It was not fair to her to
      put himself in such a false position; in fact, not decent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He breakfasted. In the room were some Americans, and the face of one young
      girl reminded him a little of Antonia. Fainter and fainter grew the
      incident; it seemed to have its right proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later, looking at the clock, he found that it was lunch-time. He
      had not gone, had not committed perjury; but he wrote to a daily paper,
      pointing out the danger run by the community from the power which a belief
      in their infallibility places in the hands of the police&mdash;how, since
      they are the sworn abettors of right and justice, their word is almost
      necessarily taken to be gospel; how one and all they hang together, from
      mingled interest and esprit de corps. Was it not, he said, reasonable to
      suppose that amongst thousands of human beings invested with such
      opportunities there would be found bullies who would take advantage of
      them, and rise to distinction in the service upon the helplessness of the
      unfortunate and the cowardice of people with anything to lose? Those who
      had in their hands the sacred duties of selecting a practically
      irresponsible body of men were bound, for the sake of freedom and
      humanity, to exercise those duties with the utmost care and thoroughness .
      . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      However true, none of this helped him to think any better of himself at
      heart, and he was haunted by the feeling that a stout and honest bit of
      perjury was worth more than a letter to a daily paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never saw his letter printed, containing, as it did, the germs of an
      unpalatable truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon he hired a horse, and galloped on Port Meadow. The strain
      of his indecision over, he felt like a man recovering from an illness, and
      he carefully abstained from looking at the local papers. There was that
      within him, however, which resented the worsting of his chivalry.

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOLM OAKS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Holm Oaks stood back but little from the road&mdash;an old manor-house,
      not set upon display, but dwelling close to its barns, stables, and walled
      gardens, like a good mother; long, flat-roofed, red, it had Queen Anne
      windows, on whose white-framed diamond panes the sunbeams glinted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of it a fringe of elms, of all trees the tree of most established
      principle, bordered the stretch of turf between the gravel drive and road;
      and these elms were the homes of rooks of all birds the most conventional.
      A huge aspen&mdash;impressionable creature&mdash;shivered and shook
      beyond, apologising for appearance among such imperturbable surroundings.
      It was frequented by a cuckoo, who came once a year to hoot at the rules
      of life, but seldom made long stay; for boys threw stones at it,
      exasperated by the absence of its morals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village which clustered in the dip had not yet lost its dread of
      motor-cars. About this group of flat-faced cottages with gabled roofs the
      scent of hay, manure, and roses clung continually; just now the odour of
      the limes troubled its servile sturdiness. Beyond the dip, again, a
      square-towered church kept within grey walls the record of the village
      flock, births, deaths, and marriages&mdash;even the births of bastards,
      even the deaths of suicides&mdash;and seemed to stretch a hand invisible
      above the heads of common folk to grasp the forgers of the manor-house.
      Decent and discreet, the two roofs caught the eye to the exclusion of all
      meaner dwellings, seeming to have joined in a conspiracy to keep them out
      of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The July sun had burned his face all the way from Oxford, yet pale was
      Shelton when he walked up the drive and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Dennant at home, Dobson?&rdquo; he asked of the grave butler,
      who, old servant that he was, still wore coloured trousers (for it was not
      yet twelve o&rsquo;clock, and he regarded coloured trousers up to noon as
      a sacred distinction between the footmen and himself).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Dennant,&rdquo; replied this personage, raising his round and
      hairless face, while on his mouth appeared that apologetic pout which
      comes of living with good families&mdash;&ldquo;Mrs. Dennant has gone into
      the village, sir; but Miss Antonia is in the morning-room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton crossed the panelled, low-roofed hall, through whose far side the
      lawn was visible, a vision of serenity. He mounted six wide, shallow
      steps, and stopped. From behind a closed door there came the sound of
      scales, and he stood, a prey to his emotions, the notes mingling in his
      ears with the beating of his heart. He softly turned the handle, a fixed
      smile on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia was at the piano; her head was bobbing to the movements of her
      fingers, and pressing down the pedals were her slim monotonously moving
      feet. She had been playing tennis, for a racquet and her tam-o&rsquo;-shanter
      were flung down, and she was dressed in a blue skirt and creamy blouse,
      fitting collarless about her throat. Her face was flushed, and wore a
      little frown; and as her fingers raced along the keys, her neck swayed,
      and the silk clung and shivered on her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton&rsquo;s eyes fastened on the silent, counting lips, on the fair
      hair about her forehead, the darker eyebrows slanting down towards the
      nose, the undimpled cheeks with the faint finger-marks beneath the
      ice-blue eyes, the softly-pouting and undimpled chin, the whole remote,
      sweet, suntouched, glacial face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head, and, springing up, cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick! What fun!&rdquo; She gave him both her hands, but her smiling
      face said very plainly, &ldquo;Oh; don&rsquo;t let us be sentimental!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are n&rsquo;t you glad to see me?&rdquo; muttered Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you! You are funny, Dick!&mdash;as if you did n&rsquo;t
      know! Why, you &lsquo;ve shaved your beard! Mother and Sybil have gone
      into the village to see old Mrs. Hopkins. Shall we go out? Thea and the
      boys are playing tennis. It&rsquo;s so jolly that you &lsquo;ve come!&rdquo;
      She caught up the tam-o&rsquo;-shanter, and pinned it to her hair. Almost
      as tall as Shelton, she looked taller, with arms raised and loose sleeves
      quivering like wings to the movements of her fingers. &ldquo;We might have
      a game before lunch; you can have my other racquet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no things,&rdquo; said Shelton blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her calm glance ran over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have some of old Bernard&rsquo;s; he&rsquo;s got any
      amount. I&rsquo;ll wait for you.&rdquo; She swung her racquet, looked at
      Shelton, cried, &ldquo;Be quick!&rdquo; and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton ran up-stairs, and dressed in the undecided way of men assuming
      other people&rsquo;s clothes. She was in the hall when he descended,
      humming a tune and prodding at her shoe; her smile showed all her pearly
      upper teeth. He caught hold of her sleeve and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antonia!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour rushed into her cheeks; she looked back across her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, old Dick!&rdquo; she cried; and, flinging open the
      glass door, ran into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tennis-ground was divided by tall netting from a paddock. A holm oak
      tree shaded one corner, and its thick dark foliage gave an unexpected
      depth to the green smoothness of the scene. As Shelton and Antonia came
      up, Bernard Dennant stopped and cordially grasped Shelton&rsquo;s hand.
      From the far side of the net Thea, in a shortish skirt, tossed back her
      straight fair hair, and, warding off the sun, came strolling up to them.
      The umpire, a small boy of twelve, was lying on his stomach, squealing and
      tickling a collie. Shelton bent and pulled his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Toddles! you young ruffian!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One and all they stood round Shelton, and there was a frank and pitiless
      inquiry in their eyes, in the angle of their noses something chaffing and
      distrustful, as though about him were some subtle poignant scent exciting
      curiosity and disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the setts were over, and the girls resting in the double hammock
      underneath the holm oak, Shelton went with Bernard to the paddock to hunt
      for the lost balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, old chap,&rdquo; said his old school-fellow, smiling dryly,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;re in for a wigging from the Mater.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wigging?&rdquo; murmured Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about it, but from something she let drop
      it seems you&rsquo;ve been saying some queer things in your letters to
      Antonia&rdquo;; and again he looked at Shelton with his dry smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer things?&rdquo; said the latter angrily. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;
      you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t ask me. The Mater thinks she&rsquo;s in a bad way&mdash;unsettled,
      or what d&rsquo; you call at. You&rsquo;ve been telling her that things
      are not what they seem. That&rsquo;s bad, you know&rdquo;; and still
      smiling he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton dropped his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they are n&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right! But don&rsquo;t bring your philosophy
      down here, old chap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philosophy!&rdquo; said Shelton, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave us a sacred prejudice or two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacred! Nothing&rsquo;s sacred, except&mdash;&rdquo; But Shelton
      did not finish his remark. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ideals, that sort of thing! You&rsquo;ve been diving down below the
      line of &lsquo;practical politics,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s about the size of
      it, my boy&rdquo;; and, stooping suddenly, he picked up the last ball.
      &ldquo;There is the Mater!&rdquo; Shelton saw Mrs. Dennant coming down the
      lawn with her second daughter, Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time they reached the holm oak the three girls had departed towards
      the house, walking arm in arm, and Mrs. Dennant was standing there alone,
      in a grey dress, talking to an undergardener. Her hands, cased in tan
      gauntlets, held a basket which warded off the bearded gardener from the
      severe but ample lines of her useful-looking skirt. The collie, erect upon
      his haunches, looked at their two faces, pricking his ears in his
      endeavour to appreciate how one of these two bipeds differed from the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; that &lsquo;ll do, Bunyan. Ah, Dick! Charmin&rsquo; to
      see you here, at last!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In his intercourse with Mrs. Dennant, Shelton never failed to mark the
      typical nature of her personality. It always seemed to him that he had met
      so many other ladies like her. He felt that her undoubtable quality had a
      non-individual flavour, as if standing for her class. She thought that
      standing for herself was not the thing; yet she was full of character.
      Tall, with nose a trifle beaked, long, sloping chin, and an assured,
      benevolent mouth, showing, perhaps, too many teeth&mdash;though thin, she
      was not unsubstantial. Her accent in speaking showed her heritage; it was
      a kind of drawl which disregarded vulgar merits such as tone; leaned on
      some syllables, and despised the final &lsquo;g&rsquo;&mdash;the peculiar
      accent, in fact, of aristocracy, adding its deliberate joys to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton knew that she had many interests; she was never really idle, from
      the time (7 A.M.) when her maid brought her a little china pot of tea with
      a single biscuit and her pet dog, Tops, till eleven o&rsquo;clock at
      night, when she lighted a wax candle in a silver candlestick, and with
      this in one hand, and in the other a new novel, or, better still, one of
      those charming volumes written by great people about the still greater
      people they have met, she said good-night to her children and her guests.
      No! What with photography, the presidency of a local league, visiting the
      rich, superintending all the poor, gardening, reading, keeping all her
      ideas so tidy that no foreign notions might stray in, she was never idle.
      The information she collected from these sources was both vast and varied,
      but she never let it flavour her opinions, which lacked sauce, and were
      drawn from some sort of dish into which, with all her class, she dipped
      her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked her. No one could help liking her. She was kind, and of such good
      quality, with a suggestion about her of thin, excellent, and useful china;
      and she was scented, too&mdash;not with verbena, violets, or those
      essences which women love, but with nothing, as if she had taken stand
      against all meretricity. In her intercourse with persons not &ldquo;quite
      the thing&rdquo; (she excepted the vicar from this category, though his
      father had dealt in haberdashery), her refinement, gently, unobtrusively,
      and with great practical good sense, seemed continually to murmur, &ldquo;I
      am, and you&mdash;well, are you, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; But there
      was no self-consciousness about this attitude, for she was really not a
      common woman. She simply could not help it; all her people had done this.
      Their nurses breathed above them in their cradles something that, inhaled
      into their systems, ever afterwards prevented them from taking good, clear
      breaths. And her manner! Ah! her manner&mdash;it concealed the inner woman
      so as to leave doubt of her existence!
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton listened to the kindly briskness with which she dwelt upon the
      under-gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Bunyan! he lost his wife six months ago, and was quite
      cheerful just at first, but now he &lsquo;s really too distressin&rsquo;.
      I &lsquo;ve done all I can to rouse him; it&rsquo;s so melancholy to see
      him mopin&rsquo;. And, my dear Dick, the way he mangles the new
      rose-trees! I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; mad; I shall have to
      send him away; poor fellow!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that she sympathised with Bunyan, or, rather, believed him
      entitled to a modicum of wholesome grief, the loss of wives being a
      canonised and legal, sorrow. But excesses! O dear, no!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve told him I shall raise his wages,&rdquo; she sighed.
      &ldquo;He used to be such a splendid gardener! That reminds me, my dear
      Dick; I want to have a talk with you. Shall we go in to lunch?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Consulting the memorandum-book in which she had been noting the case of
      Mrs. Hopkins, she slightly preceded Shelton to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was somewhat late that afternoon when Shelton had his &ldquo;wigging&rdquo;;
      nor did it seem to him, hypnotised by the momentary absence of Antonia,
      such a very serious affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Dick,&rdquo; the Honourable Mrs. Dennant said, in her decisive
      drawl, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it &lsquo;s right to put ideas into
      Antonia&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ideas!&rdquo; murmured Shelton in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all know,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Dennant, &ldquo;that things are
      not always what they ought to be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton looked at her; she was seated at her writing-table, addressing in
      her large, free writing a dinner invitation to a bishop. There was not the
      faintest trace of awkwardness about her, yet Shelton could not help a
      certain sense of shock. If she&mdash;she&mdash;did not think things were
      what they ought to be&mdash;in a bad way things must be indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dennant looked at him firmly but kindly with the eyes that would
      remind him of a hare&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She showed me some of your letters, you know. Well, it &lsquo;s not
      a bit of use denyin&rsquo;, my dear Dick, that you&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo;
      too much lately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton perceived that he had done her an injustice; she handled &ldquo;things&rdquo;
      as she handled under-gardeners&mdash;put them away when they showed signs
      of running to extremes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that, I &lsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy! you&rsquo;ll never get on that way. Now, I want you to
      promise me you won&rsquo;t talk to Antonia about those sort of things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know what I mean!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that to press Mrs. Dennant to say what she meant by &ldquo;things&rdquo;
      would really hurt her sense of form; it would be cruel to force her thus
      below the surface!
    </p>
    <p>
      He therefore said, &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To his extreme surprise, flushing the peculiar and pathetic flush of women
      past their prime, she drawled out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the poor&mdash;and criminals&mdash;and marriages&mdash;there
      was that wedding, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton bowed his head. Motherhood had been too strong for her; in her
      maternal flutter she had committed the solecism of touching in so many
      words on &ldquo;things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does n&rsquo;t she really see the fun,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;in
      one man dining out of gold and another dining in the gutter; or in two
      married people living on together in perfect discord &lsquo;pour
      encourages les autres&rsquo;, or in worshipping Jesus Christ and claiming
      all her rights at the same time; or in despising foreigners because they
      are foreigners; or in war; or in anything that is funny?&rdquo; But he did
      her a certain amount of justice by recognising that this was natural,
      since her whole life had been passed in trying not to see the fun in all
      these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Antonia stood smiling in the doorway. Brilliant and gay she looked,
      yet resentful, as if she knew they had been talking of her. She sat down
      by Shelton&rsquo;s side, and began asking him about the youthful foreigner
      whom he had spoken of; and her eyes made him doubt whether she, too, saw
      the fun that lay in one human being patronising others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I suppose he&rsquo;s really good,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
      mean, all those things he told you about were only&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he answered, fidgeting; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really
      know what the word means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes clouded. &ldquo;Dick, how can you?&rdquo; they seemed to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton stroked her sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us about Mr. Crocker,&rdquo; she said, taking no heed of his
      caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lunatic!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lunatic! Why, in your letters he was splendid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is,&rdquo; said Shelton, half ashamed; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not
      a bit mad, really&mdash;that is, I only wish I were half as mad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that mad?&rdquo; queried Mrs. Dennant from behind the
      urn&mdash;&ldquo;Tom Crocker? Ah, yes! I knew his mother; she was a
      Springer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he do it in the week?&rdquo; said Thea, appearing in the window
      with a kitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Shelton was obliged to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thea shook back her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it awfully slack of you not to have found out,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were very sweet to that young foreigner, Dick,&rdquo; she
      murmured with a smile at Shelton. &ldquo;I wish that we could see him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Shelton shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;that I did about as
      little for him as I could.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again her face grew thoughtful, as though his words had chilled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what more you could have done,&rdquo; she
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A desire to get close to her, half fear, half ache, a sense of futility
      and bafflement, an inner burning, made him feel as though a flame were
      licking at his heart.

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ENGLISH
    </h3>
    <p>
      Just as Shelton was starting to walk back to Oxford he met Mr. Dennant
      coming from a ride. Antonia&rsquo;s father was a spare man of medium
      height, with yellowish face, grey moustache, ironical eyebrows, and some
      tiny crow&rsquo;s-feet. In his old, short grey coat, with a little slit up
      the middle of the back, his drab cord breeches, ancient mahogany leggings,
      and carefully blacked boats, he had a dry, threadbare quality not without
      distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Shelton!&rdquo; he said, in his quietly festive voice; &ldquo;glad
      to see the pilgrim here, at last. You&rsquo;re not off already?&rdquo;
      and, laying his hand on Shelton&rsquo;s arm, he proposed to walk a little
      way with him across the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first time they had met since the engagement; and Shelton
      began to nerve himself to express some sentiment, however bald, about it.
      He squared his shoulders, cleared his throat, and looked askance at Mr.
      Dennant. That gentleman was walking stiffly, his cord breeches faintly
      squeaking. He switched a yellow, jointed cane against his leggings, and
      after each blow looked at his legs satirically. He himself was rather like
      that yellow cane-pale, and slim, and jointed, with features arching just a
      little, like the arching of its handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say it&rsquo;ll be a bad year for fruit,&rdquo; Shelton said
      at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you don&rsquo;t know your farmer, I &lsquo;m
      afraid. We ought to hang some farmers&mdash;do a world of good. Dear
      souls! I&rsquo;ve got some perfect strawberries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Shelton, glad to postpone the evil moment,
      &ldquo;in a climate like this a man must grumble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, quite so! Look at us poor slaves of land-owners; if I
      couldn&rsquo;t abuse the farmers I should be wretched. Did you ever see
      anything finer than this pasture? And they want me to lower their rents!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Dennant&rsquo;s glance satirically wavered, rested on Shelton, and
      whisked back to the ground as though he had seen something that alarmed
      him. There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo; thought the younger man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dennant kept his eyes fixed on his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they&rsquo;d said, now,&rdquo; he remarked jocosely, &ldquo;that
      the frost had nipped the partridges, there &lsquo;d have been some sense
      in it; but what can you expect? They&rsquo;ve no consideration, dear
      souls!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton took a breath, and, with averted eyes, he hurriedly began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully hard, sir, to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dennant switched his cane against his shin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it &lsquo;s awfully hard to put up
      with, but what can a fellow do? One must have farmers. Why, if it was n&rsquo;t
      for the farmers, there &lsquo;d be still a hare or two about the place!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton laughed spasmodically; again he glanced askance at his future
      father-in-law. What did the waggling of his head mean, the deepening of
      his crow&rsquo;s-feet, the odd contraction of the mouth? And his eye
      caught Mr. Dennant&rsquo;s eye; its expression was queer above the fine,
      dry nose (one of the sort that reddens in a wind).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had much to do with farmers,&rdquo; he said at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have n&rsquo;t you? Lucky fellow! The most&mdash;yes, quite the
      most trying portion of the human species&mdash;next to daughters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, you can hardly expect me&mdash;&rdquo; began Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t! D &lsquo;you know, I really
      believe we&rsquo;re in for a ducking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A large black cloud had covered up the sun, and some drops were spattering
      on Mr. Dennant&rsquo;s hard felt hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton welcomed the shower; it appeared to him an intervention on the
      part of Providence. He would have to say something, but not now, later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll go on,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the
      rain. But you&rsquo;d better get back, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! I&rsquo;ve a tenant in this cottage,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Dennant in his, leisurely, dry manner &ldquo;and a beggar he is to poach,
      too. Least we can do &lsquo;s to ask for a little shelter; what do you
      think?&rdquo; and smiling sarcastically, as though deprecating his
      intention to keep dry, he rapped on the door of a prosperous-looking
      cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was opened by a girl of Antonia&rsquo;s age and height.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Phoebe! Your father in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the girl, fluttering; &ldquo;father&rsquo;s out,
      Mr. Dennant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So sorry! Will you let us bide a bit out of the rain?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweet-looking Phoebe dusted them two chairs, and, curtseying, left
      them in the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pretty girl!&rdquo; said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s a pretty girl; half the young fellows are after
      her, but she won&rsquo;t leave her father. Oh, he &lsquo;s a charming
      rascal is that fellow!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This remark suddenly brought home to Shelton the conviction that he was
      further than ever from avoiding the necessity for speaking. He walked over
      to the window. The rain was coming down with fury, though a golden line
      far down the sky promised the shower&rsquo;s quick end. &ldquo;For
      goodness&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;let me say something,
      however idiotic, and get it over!&rdquo; But he did not turn; a kind of
      paralysis had seized on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tremendous heavy rain!&rdquo; he said at last; &ldquo;coming down
      in waterspouts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been just as easy to say: &ldquo;I believe your daughter to
      be the sweetest thing on earth; I love her, and I &lsquo;m going to make
      her happy!&rdquo; Just as easy, just about the same amount of breath
      required; but he couldn&rsquo;t say it! He watched the rain stream and
      hiss against the leaves and churn the dust on the parched road with its
      insistent torrent; and he noticed with precision all the details of the
      process going on outside how the raindrops darted at the leaves like
      spears, and how the leaves shook themselves free a hundred times a minute,
      while little runnels of water, ice-clear, rolled over their edges, soft
      and quick. He noticed, too, the mournful head of a sheltering cow that was
      chewing at the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dennant had not replied to his remark about the rain. So disconcerting
      was this silence that Shelton turned. His future father-in-law, upon his
      wooden chair, was staring at his well-blacked boots, bending forward above
      his parted knees, and prodding at the carpet; a glimpse at his face
      disturbed Shelton&rsquo;s resolution. It was not forbidding, stern,
      discouraging&mdash;not in the least; it had merely for the moment ceased
      to look satirical. This was so startling that Shelton lost his chance of
      speaking. There seemed a heart to Mr. Dennant&rsquo;s gravity; as though
      for once he were looking grave because he felt so. But glancing up at
      Shelton, his dry jocosity reappeared at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a day for ducks!&rdquo; he said; and again there was
      unmistakable alarm about the eye. Was it possible that he, too, dreaded
      something?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t express&mdash;&rdquo; began Shelton hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s beastly to get wet,&rdquo; said Mr. Dennant, and he
      sang&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;For we can wrestle and fight, my boys,
          And jump out anywhere.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;ll be with us for that dinner-party next week, eh?
      Capital! There&rsquo;s the Bishop of Blumenthal and old Sir Jack Buckwell;
      I must get my wife to put you between them&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;For it&rsquo;s my delight of a starry night&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bishop&rsquo;s a great anti-divorce man, and old Buckwell
      &lsquo;s been in the court at least twice&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;In the season of the year!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please to take some tea, gentlemen?&rdquo; said the voice
      of Phoebe in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, Phoebe. That girl ought to get married,&rdquo; went
      on Mr. Dennant, as Phoebe blushingly withdrew. A flush showed queerly on
      his sallow cheeks. &ldquo;A shame to keep her tied like this to her father&rsquo;s
      apron-strings&mdash;selfish fellow, that!&rdquo; He looked up sharply, as
      if he had made a dangerous remark.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          The keeper he was watching us,
          For him we did n&rsquo;t care!
</pre>
    <p>
      Shelton suddenly felt certain that Antonia&rsquo;s father was just as
      anxious to say something expressive of his feelings, and as unable as
      himself. And this was comforting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, sir&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Dennant&rsquo;s eyebrows rose, his crow&rsquo;s-feet twinkled; his
      personality seemed to shrink together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s stopped! Now&rsquo;s our
      chance! Come along, my dear fellow; delays are dangerous!&rdquo; and with
      his bantering courtesy he held the door for Shelton to pass out. &ldquo;I
      think we&rsquo;ll part here,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;I almost think
      so. Good luck to you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his dry, yellow hand. Shelton seized it, wrung it hard, and
      muttered the word:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grateful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr. Dennant&rsquo;s eyebrows quivered as if they had been tweaked;
      he had been found out, and he disliked it. The colour in his face had died
      away; it was calm, wrinkled, dead-looking under the flattened, narrow brim
      of his black hat; his grey moustache drooped thinly; the crow&rsquo;s-feet
      hardened round his eyes; his nostrils were distended by the queerest
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gratitude!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;almost a vice, is n&rsquo;t it?
      Good-night!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton&rsquo;s face quivered; he raised his hat, and, turning as abruptly
      as his senior, proceeded on his way. He had been playing in a comedy that
      could only have been played in England. He could afford to smile now at
      his past discomfort, having no longer the sense of duty unfulfilled.
      Everything had been said that was right and proper to be said, in the way
      that we such things should say. No violence had been done; he could afford
      to smile&mdash;smile at himself, at Mr. Dennant, at to-morrow; smile at
      the sweet aroma of the earth, the shy, unwilling sweetness that only rain
      brings forth.

      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE COUNTRY HOUSE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The luncheon hour at Holm Oaks, was, as in many well-bred country houses&mdash;out
      of the shooting season, be it understood&mdash;the soulful hour. The
      ferment of the daily doings was then at its full height, and the clamour
      of its conversation on the weather, and the dogs, the horses, neighbours,
      cricket, golf, was mingled with a literary murmur; for the Dennants were
      superior, and it was quite usual to hear remarks like these &ldquo;Have
      you read that charmin&rsquo; thing of Poser&rsquo;s?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Yes,
      I&rsquo;ve got the new edition of old Bablington: delightfully bound&mdash;so
      light.&rdquo; And it was in July that Holm Oaks, as a gathering-place of
      the elect, was at its best. For in July it had become customary to welcome
      there many of those poor souls from London who arrived exhausted by the
      season, and than whom no seamstress in a two-pair back could better have
      earned a holiday. The Dennants themselves never went to London for the
      season. It was their good pleasure not to. A week or fortnight of it
      satisfied them. They had a radical weakness for fresh air, and Antonia,
      even after her presentation two seasons back, had insisted on returning
      home, stigmatising London balls as &ldquo;stuffy things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Shelton arrived the stream had only just begun, but every day brought
      fresh, or rather jaded, people to occupy the old, dark, sweet-smelling
      bedrooms. Individually, he liked his fellow-guests, but he found himself
      observing them. He knew that, if a man judged people singly, almost all
      were better than himself; only when judged in bulk were they worthy of the
      sweeping criticisms he felt inclined to pass on them. He knew this just as
      he knew that the conventions, having been invented to prevent man
      following his natural desires, were merely the disapproving sums of
      innumerable individual approvals.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the bulk; then, that he found himself observing. But with his
      amiability and dread of notoriety he remained to all appearance a
      well-bred, docile creature, and he kept his judgments to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the matter of intellect he made a rough division of the guests&mdash;those
      who accepted things without a murmur, those who accepted them with carping
      jocularity; in the matter of morals he found they all accepted things
      without the semblance of a kick. To show sign of private moral judgment
      was to have lost your soul, and, worse, to be a bit of an outsider. He
      gathered this by intuition rather than from conversation; for conversation
      naturally tabooed such questions, and was carried on in the loud and
      cheerful tones peculiar to people of good breeding. Shelton had never been
      able to acquire this tone, and he could not help feeling that the
      inability made him more or less an object of suspicion. The atmosphere
      struck him as it never had before, causing him to feel a doubt of his
      gentility. Could a man suffer from passion, heart-searchings, or
      misgivings, and remain a gentleman? It seemed improbable. One of his
      fellow-guests, a man called Edgbaston, small-eyed and semi-bald, with a
      dark moustache and a distinguished air of meanness, disconcerted him one
      day by remarking of an unknown person, &ldquo;A half-bred lookin&rsquo;
      chap; did n&rsquo;t seem to know his mind.&rdquo; Shelton was harassed by
      a horrid doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything seemed divided into classes, carefully docketed and valued. For
      instance, a Briton was of more value than a man, and wives than women.
      Those things or phases of life with which people had no personal
      acquaintance were regarded with a faint amusement and a certain
      disapproval. The principles of the upper class, in fact, were strictly
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in that hypersenstive and nervous state favourable for recording
      currents foreign to itself. Things he had never before noticed now had
      profound effect on him, such as the tone in which men spoke of women&mdash;not
      precisely with hostility, nor exactly with contempt best, perhaps,
      described as cultured jeering; never, of course, when men spoke of their
      own wives, mothers, sisters, or immediate friends, but merely when they
      spoke of any other women. He reflected upon this, and came to the
      conclusion that, among the upper classes, each man&rsquo;s own property
      was holy, while other women were created to supply him with gossip, jests,
      and spice. Another thing that struck him was the way in which the war then
      going on was made into an affair of class. In their view it was a baddish
      business, because poor hack Blank and Peter Blank-Blank had lost their
      lives, and poor Teddy Blank had now one arm instead of two. Humanity in
      general was omitted, but not the upper classes, nor, incidentally, the
      country which belonged to them. For there they were, all seated in a row,
      with eyes fixed on the horizon of their lawns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late one evening, billiards and music being over and the ladies gone,
      Shelton returned from changing to his smoking-suit, and dropped into one
      of the great arm-chairs that even in summer made a semicircle round the
      fendered hearth. Fresh from his good-night parting with Antonia, he sat
      perhaps ten minutes before he began to take in all the figures in their
      parti-coloured smoking jackets, cross-legged, with glasses in their hands,
      and cigars between their teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the next chair roused him by putting down his tumbler with a
      tap, and seating himself upon the cushioned fender. Through the mist of
      smoke, with shoulders hunched, elbows and knees crooked out, cigar
      protruding, beak-ways, below his nose, and the crimson collar of his
      smoking jacket buttoned close as plumage on his breast, he looked a little
      like a gorgeous bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do you awfully well,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice from the chair on Shelton&rsquo;s right replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do you better at Verado&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Veau d&rsquo;.r &lsquo;s the best place; they give you Turkish
      baths for nothing!&rdquo; drawled a fat man with a tiny mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suavity of this pronouncement enfolded all as with a blessing. And at
      once, as if by magic, in the old, oak-panelled room, the world fell
      naturally into its three departments: that where they do you well; that
      where they do you better; and that where they give you Turkish baths for
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want Turkish baths,&rdquo; said a tall youth with clean red
      face, who had come into the room, and stood, his mouth a little open, and
      long feet jutting with sweet helplessness in front of him, &ldquo;you
      should go, you know, to Buda Pesth; most awfully rippin&rsquo; there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton saw an indescribable appreciation rise on every face, as though
      they had been offered truffles or something equally delicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, Poodles,&rdquo; said the man perched on the fender. &ldquo;A
      Johnny I know tells me they &lsquo;re nothing to Sofia.&rdquo; His face
      was transfigured by the subtle gloating of a man enjoying vice by proxy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; drawled the small-mouthed man, &ldquo;there &lsquo;s
      nothing fit to hold a candle to Baghda-ad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again his utterance enfolded all as with a blessing, and once again
      the world fell into its three departments: that where they do you well;
      that where they do you better; and&mdash;Baghdad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton thought to himself: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I know a place that&rsquo;s
      better than Baghdad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt so insignificant. It seemed that he knew none of these delightful
      spots; that he was of no use to any of his fellow-men; though privately he
      was convinced that all these speakers were as ignorant as himself, and
      merely found it warming to recall such things as they had heard, with that
      peculiar gloating look. Alas! his anecdotes would never earn for him that
      prize of persons in society, the label of a &ldquo;good chap&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;sportsman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever been in Baghdad?&rdquo; he feebly asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat man did not answer; he had begun an anecdote, and in his broad
      expanse of face his tiny mouth writhed like a caterpillar. The anecdote
      was humorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of Antonia, Shelton saw but little of the ladies, for,
      following the well-known custom of the country house, men and women
      avoided each other as much as might be. They met at meals, and
      occasionally joined in tennis and in croquet; otherwise it seemed&mdash;almost
      Orientally&mdash;agreed that they were better kept apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chancing one day to enter the withdrawing room, while searching for
      Antonia, he found that he had lighted on a feminine discussion; he would
      have beaten a retreat, of course, but it seemed too obvious that he was
      merely looking for his fiancee, so, sitting down, he listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable Charlotte Penguin, still knitting a silk tie&mdash;the
      sixth since that she had been knitting at Hyeres&mdash;sat on the low
      window-seat close to a hydrangea, the petals of whose round flowers almost
      kissed her sanguine cheek. Her eyes were fixed with languid aspiration on
      the lady who was speaking. This was a square woman of medium height, with
      grey hair brushed from her low forehead, the expression of whose face was
      brisk and rather cross. She was standing with a book, as if delivering a
      sermon. Had she been a man she might have been described as a bright young
      man of business; for, though grey, she never could be old, nor ever lose
      the power of forming quick decisions. Her features and her eyes were
      prompt and slightly hard, tinged with faith fanatical in the justice of
      her judgments, and she had that fussy simpleness of dress which indicates
      the right to meddle. Not red, not white, neither yellow nor quite blue,
      her complexion was suffused with a certain mixture of these colours,
      adapted to the climate; and her smile had a strange sour sweetness, like
      nothing but the flavour of an apple on the turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what they tell you,&rdquo; she was saying&mdash;not
      offensively, though her voice seemed to imply that she had no time to
      waste in pleasing&mdash;&ldquo;in all my dealings with them I&rsquo;ve
      found it best to treat them quite like children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A lady, behind the Times, smiled; her mouth&mdash;indeed, her whole hard,
      handsome face&mdash;was reminiscent of dappled rocking-horses found in the
      Soho Bazaar. She crossed her feet, and some rich and silk stuff rustled.
      Her whole personality seemed to creak as, without looking, she answered in
      harsh tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find the poor are most delightful persons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil Dennant, seated on the sofa, with a feathery laugh shot a barking
      terrier dog at Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Dick,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well, Dick, what&rsquo;s
      your opinion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton looked around him, scared. The elder ladies who had spoken had
      fixed their eyes on him, and in their gaze he read his utter
      insignificance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that young man!&rdquo; they seemed to say. &ldquo;Expect a
      practical remark from him? Now, come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Opinion,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;of the poor? I haven&rsquo;t
      any.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The person on her feet, whose name was Mrs. Mattock, directing her
      peculiar sweet-sour smile at the distinguished lady with the Times, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you &lsquo;ve not had experience of them in London, Lady
      Bonington?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bonington, in answer, rustled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do tell us about the slums, Mrs. Mattock!&rdquo; cried Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slumming must be splendid! It&rsquo;s so deadly here&mdash;nothing
      but flannel petticoats.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor, my dear,&rdquo; began Mrs. Mattock, &ldquo;are not the
      least bit what you think them&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, d&rsquo; you know, I think they&rsquo;re rather nice!&rdquo;
      broke in Aunt Charlotte close to the hydrangea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; said Mrs. Mattock sharply. &ldquo;I find they
      do nothing but grumble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t grumble at me: they are delightful persons&rdquo;,
      and Lady Bonington gave Shelton a grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not help thinking that to grumble in the presence of that rich,
      despotic personality would require a superhuman courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the most ungrateful people in the world,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Mattock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; thought Shelton, &ldquo;do you go amongst them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued, &ldquo;One must do them good, one, must do one&rsquo;s
      duty, but as to getting thanks&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bonington sardonically said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor things! they have a lot to bear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little children!&rdquo; murmured Aunt Charlotte, with a
      flushing cheek and shining eyes; &ldquo;it &lsquo;s rather pathetic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Children indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Mattock. &ldquo;It puts me out of
      all patience to see the way that they neglect them. People are so
      sentimental about the poor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bonington creaked again. Her splendid shoulders were wedged into her
      chair; her fine dark hair, gleaming with silver, sprang back upon her
      brow; a ruby bracelet glowed on the powerful wrist that held the journal;
      she rocked her copper-slippered foot. She did not appear to be too
      sentimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know they often have a very easy time,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mattock,
      as if some one had injured her severely. And Shelton saw, not without
      pity, that Fate had scored her kind and squashed-up face with wrinkles,
      whose tiny furrows were eloquent of good intentions frustrated by the
      unpractical and discontented poor. &ldquo;Do what you will, they are never
      satisfied; they only resent one&rsquo;s help, or else they take the help
      and never thank you for it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Aunt Charlotte, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s rather
      hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton had been growing, more uneasy. He said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should do the same if I were they.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mattock&rsquo;s brown eyes flew at him; Lady Bonington spoke to the
      Times; her ruby bracelet and a bangle jingled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to put ourselves in their places.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton could not help a smile; Lady Bonington in the places of the poor!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Mattock, &ldquo;I put myself entirely in
      their place. I quite understand their feelings. But ingratitude is a
      repulsive quality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem unable to put themselves in your place,&rdquo; murmured
      Shelton; and in a fit of courage he took the room in with a sweeping
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that room was wonderfully consistent, with its air of perfect
      second-handedness, as if each picture, and each piece of furniture, each
      book, each lady present, had been made from patterns. They were all widely
      different, yet all (like works of art seen in some exhibitions) had the
      look of being after the designs of some original spirit. The whole room
      was chaste, restrained, derived, practical, and comfortable; neither in
      virtue nor in work, neither in manner, speech, appearance, nor in theory,
      could it give itself away.

      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE STAINED-GLASS MAN
    </h3>
    <p>
      Still looking for Antonia, Shelton went up to the morning-room. Thea
      Dennant and another girl were seated in the window, talking. From the look
      they gave him he saw that he had better never have been born; he hastily
      withdrew. Descending to the hall, he came on Mr. Dennant crossing to his
      study, with a handful of official-looking papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Shelton!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you look a little lost. Is the
      shrine invisible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton grinned, said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and went on looking. He was not
      fortunate. In the dining-room sat Mrs. Dennant, making up her list of
      books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do give me your opinion, Dick,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Everybody
      &lsquo;s readin&rsquo; this thing of Katherine Asterick&rsquo;s; I believe
      it&rsquo;s simply because she&rsquo;s got a title.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must read a book for some reason or other,&rdquo; answered
      Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Dennant, &ldquo;I hate doin&rsquo;
      things just because other people do them, and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;. get
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dennant marked the catalogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here &lsquo;s Linseed&rsquo;s last, of course; though I must say I
      don&rsquo;t care for him, but I suppose we ought to have it in the house.
      And there&rsquo;s Quality&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Splendid Diatribes&rsquo;.
      that &lsquo;s sure to be good, he&rsquo;s always so refined. But what am I
      to do about this of Arthur Baal&rsquo;s? They say that he&rsquo;s a
      charlatan, but everybody reads him, don&rsquo;t you know&rdquo;; and over
      the catalogue Shelton caught the gleam of hare-like eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decision had vanished from her face, with its arched nose and slightly
      sloping chin, as though some one had suddenly appealed to her to trust her
      instincts. It was quite pathetic. Still, there was always the book&rsquo;s
      circulation to form her judgment by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I &lsquo;d better mark it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      you? Were you lookin&rsquo; for Antonia? If you come across Bunyan in the
      garden, Dick, do say I want to see him; he&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; to be a
      perfect nuisance. I can understand his feelin&rsquo;s, but really he
      &lsquo;s carryin&rsquo; it too far.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Primed with his message to the under-gardener, Shelton went. He took a
      despairing look into the billiard-room. Antonia was not there. Instead, a
      tall and fat-cheeked gentleman with a neat moustache, called Mabbey, was
      practising the spot-stroke. He paused as Shelton entered, and, pouting
      like a baby, asked in a sleepy voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play me a hundred up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton shook his head, stammered out his sorrow, and was about to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman called Mabbey, plaintively feeling the places where his
      moustaches joined his pink and glossy cheeks, asked with an air of some
      surprise,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your general game, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman called Mabbey chalked his cue, and, moving his round,
      knock-kneed legs in their tight trousers, took up his position for the
      stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What price that?&rdquo; he said, as he regained the perpendicular;
      and his well-fed eyes followed Shelton with sleepy inquisition. &ldquo;Curious
      dark horse, Shelton,&rdquo; they seemed to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton hurried out, and was about to run down the lower lawn, when he was
      accosted by another person walking in the sunshine&mdash;a slight-built
      man in a turned-down collar, with a thin and fair moustache, and a faint
      bluish tint on one side of his high forehead, caused by a network of thin
      veins. His face had something of the youthful, optimistic, stained-glass
      look peculiar to the refined English type. He walked elastically, yet with
      trim precision, as if he had a pleasant taste in furniture and churches,
      and held the Spectator in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Shelton!&rdquo; he said in high-tuned tones, halting his legs
      in such an easy attitude that it was impossible to interrupt it: &ldquo;come
      to take the air?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton&rsquo;s own brown face, nondescript nose, and his amiable but
      dogged chin contrasted strangely with the clear-cut features of the
      stained-glass man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear from Halidome that you&rsquo;re going to stand for
      Parliament,&rdquo; the latter said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton, recalling Halidome&rsquo;s autocratic manner of settling other
      people&rsquo;s business, smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I look like it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyebrows quivered on the stained-glass man. It had never occurred to
      him, perhaps, that to stand for Parliament a man must look like it; he
      examined Shelton with some curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;now you mention it, perhaps not.&rdquo;
      His eyes, so carefully ironical, although they differed from the eyes of
      Mabbey, also seemed to ask of Shelton what sort of a dark horse he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;re still in the Domestic Office, then?&rdquo; asked
      Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stained-glass man stooped to sniff a rosebush. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;it suits me very well. I get lots of time for my art work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be very interesting,&rdquo; said Shelton, whose glance
      was roving for Antonia; &ldquo;I never managed to begin a hobby.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never had a hobby!&rdquo; said the stained-glass man, brushing back
      his hair (he was walking with no hat); &ldquo;why, what the deuce d&rsquo;
      you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton could not answer; the idea had never troubled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, embarrassed; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      always something going on, as far as I can see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stained-glass man placed his hands within his pockets, and his bright
      glance swept over his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fellow must have a hobby to give him an interest in life,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An interest in life?&rdquo; repeated Shelton grimly; &ldquo;life
      itself is good enough for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied the stained-glass man, as though he disapproved
      of regarding life itself as interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, but you want something more than that.
      Why don&rsquo;t you take up woodcarving?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wood-carving?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moment I get fagged with office papers and that sort of thing I
      take up my wood-carving; good as a game of hockey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have n&rsquo;t the enthusiasm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyebrows of the stained-glass man twitched; he twisted his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;ll find not having a hobby does n&rsquo;t pay,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;you &lsquo;ll get old, then where &lsquo;ll you be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It came as a surprise that he should use the words &ldquo;it does n&rsquo;t
      pay,&rdquo; for he had a kind of partially enamelled look, like that
      modern jewellery which really seems unconscious of its market value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given up the Bar? Don&rsquo;t you get awfully bored
      having nothing to do?&rdquo; pursued the stained-glass man, stopping
      before an ancient sundial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton felt a delicacy, as a man naturally would, in explaining that
      being in love was in itself enough to do. To do nothing is unworthy of a
      man! But he had never felt as yet the want of any occupation. His silence
      in no way disconcerted his acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice old article of virtue,&rdquo; he said, pointing
      with his chin; and, walking round the sundial, he made its acquaintance
      from the other side. Its grey profile cast a thin and shortening shadow on
      the turf; tongues of moss were licking at its sides; the daisies clustered
      thick around its base; it had acquired a look of growing from the soil.
      &ldquo;I should like to get hold of that,&rdquo; the stained-glass man
      remarked; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when I &lsquo;ve seen a better
      specimen,&rdquo; and he walked round it once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyebrows were still ironically arched, but below them his eyes were
      almost calculating, and below them, again, his mouth had opened just a
      little. A person with a keener eye would have said his face looked greedy,
      and even Shelton was surprised, as though he had read in the Spectator a
      confession of commercialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could n&rsquo;t uproot a thing like that,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;it would lose all its charm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion turned impatiently, and his countenance looked wonderfully
      genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By Jove! I thought so.
      1690! The best period.&rdquo; He ran his forger round the sundial&rsquo;s
      edge. &ldquo;Splendid line-clean as the day they made it. You don&rsquo;t
      seem to care much about that sort of thing&rdquo;; and once again, as
      though accustomed to the indifference of Vandals, his face regained its
      mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      They strolled on towards the kitchen gardens, Shelton still busy searching
      every patch of shade. He wanted to say &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; and
      hurry off; but there was about the stained-glass man a something that,
      while stinging Shelton&rsquo;s feelings, made the showing of them quite
      impossible. &ldquo;Feelings!&rdquo; that person seemed to say; &ldquo;all
      very well, but you want more than that. Why not take up wood-carving? . .
      . Feelings! I was born in England, and have been at Cambridge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you staying long?&rdquo; he asked Shelton. &ldquo;I go on to
      Halidome&rsquo;s to-morrow; suppose I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;. see you there?
      Good, chap, old Halidome! Collection of etchings very fine!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I &lsquo;m staying on,&rdquo; said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the stained-glass man, &ldquo;charming people, the
      Dennants!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton, reddening slowly, turned his head away; he picked a gooseberry,
      and muttered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The eldest girl especially; no nonsense about her. I thought she
      was a particularly nice girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton heard this praise of Antonia with an odd sensation; it gave him
      the reverse of pleasure, as though the words had cast new light upon her.
      He grunted hastily,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know that we &lsquo;re engaged?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said the stained-glass man, and again his bright,
      clear, iron-committal glance swept over Shelton&mdash;&ldquo;really! I
      didn&rsquo;t know. Congratulate you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if he said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a man of taste; I should say she
      would go well in almost any drawing-room!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;there she&rsquo; is. If you&rsquo;ll
      excuse me, I want to speak to her.&rdquo;

      Antonia, in a sunny angle of the old brick wall, amid the pinks and
      poppies and cornflowers, was humming to herself. Shelton saw the
      stained-glass man pass out of sight, then, unobserved, he watched her
      smelling at the flowers, caressing her face with each in turn, casting
      away spoiled blossoms, and all the time humming that soft tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two months, or three, all barriers between himself and this inscrutable
      young Eve would break; she would be a part of him, and he a part of her;
      he would know all her thoughts, and she all his; together they would be as
      one, and all would think of them, and talk of them, as one; and this would
      come about by standing half an hour together in a church, by the passing
      of a ring, and the signing of their names.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was burnishing her hair&mdash;she wore no hat flushing her cheeks,
      sweetening and making sensuous her limbs; it had warmed her through and
      through, so that, like the flowers and bees, the sunlight and the air, she
      was all motion, light, and colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned and saw Shelton standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dick!&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;Lend me your hand-kerchief to put
      these flowers in, there &lsquo;s a good boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her candid eyes, blue as the flowers in her hands, were clear and cool as
      ice, but in her smile was all the warm profusion of that corner; the
      sweetness had soaked into her, and was welling forth again. The sight of
      those sun-warmed cheeks, and fingers twining round the flower-stalks, her
      pearly teeth, and hair all fragrant, stole the reason out of Shelton. He
      stood before her, weak about the knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Found you at last!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curving back her neck, she cried out, &ldquo;Catch!&rdquo; and with a
      sweep of both her hands flung the flowers into Shelton&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the rain of flowers, all warm and odorous, he dropped down on his
      knees, and put them one by one together, smelling at the pinks, to hide
      the violence of his feelings. Antonia went on picking flowers, and every
      time her hand was full she dropped them on his hat, his shoulder, or his
      arms, and went on plucking more; she smiled, and on her lips a little
      devil danced, that seemed to know what he was suffering. And Shelton felt
      that she did know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you tired?&rdquo; she asked; &ldquo;there are heaps more
      wanted. These are the bedroom-flowers&mdash;fourteen lots. I can&rsquo;t
      think how people can live without flowers, can you?&rdquo; and close above
      his head she buried her face in pinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his eyes on the plucked flowers before him on the grass, and
      forced himself to answer,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can hold out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Dick!&rdquo; She had stepped back. The sun lit the
      clear-cut profile of her cheek, and poured its gold over the bosom of her
      blouse. &ldquo;Poor old Dick! Awfully hard luck, is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
      Burdened with mignonette, she came so close again that now she touched his
      shoulder, but Shelton did not look; breathless, with wildly beating heart,
      he went on sorting out the flowers. The seeds of mignonette rained on his
      neck, and as she let the blossoms fall, their perfume fanned his face.
      &ldquo;You need n&rsquo;t sort them out!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she enticing him? He stole a look; but she was gone again, swaying and
      sniffing at the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m only hindering you,&rdquo; he growled; &ldquo;I
      &lsquo;d better go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to see you on your knees, you look so funny!&rdquo; and as
      she spoke she flung a clove carnation at him. &ldquo;Does n&rsquo;t it
      smell good?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too good Oh, Antonia! why are you doing this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why am I doing what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what you are doing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, picking flowers!&rdquo; and once more she was back, bending
      and sniffing at the blossoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she called; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not not nearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep on putting them together, if you love me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I love you,&rdquo; answered Shelton, in a smothered voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia gazed at him across her shoulder; puzzled and inquiring was her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit like you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What will you
      have for your room?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choose!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cornflowers and clove pinks. Poppies are too frivolous, and pinks
      too&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White,&rdquo; said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mignonette too hard and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet. Why cornflowers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia stood before him with her hands against her sides; her figure was
      so slim and young, her face uncertain and so grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they&rsquo;re dark and deep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why clove pinks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why clove pinks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said, and, flushing, touched a bee that had
      settled on her skirt, &ldquo;because of something in you I don&rsquo;t
      understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! And what flowers shall t give YOU?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her hands behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are all the other flowers for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton snatched from the mass in front of him an Iceland poppy with
      straight stem and a curved neck, white pinks, and sprigs of hard, sweet
      mignonette, and held it out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s you.&rdquo; But Antonia
      did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, it is n&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and behind her back her fingers
      slowly crushed the petals of a blood-red poppy. She shook her head,
      smiling a brilliant smile. The blossoms fell, he flung his arms around
      her, and kissed her on the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his hands dropped; not fear exactly, nor exactly shame, had come to
      him. She had not resisted, but he had kissed the smile away; had kissed a
      strange, cold, frightened look, into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did n&rsquo;t mean to tempt me, then,&rdquo; he thought, in
      surprise and anger. &ldquo;What did she mean?&rdquo; and, like a scolded
      dog, he kept his troubled watch upon her face.

      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE RIDE
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where now?&rdquo; Antonia asked, wheeling her chestnut mare, as
      they turned up High Street, Oxford City. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go back the
      same way, Dick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could have a gallop on Port Meadow, cross the Upper River twice,
      and get home that way; but you &lsquo;ll be tired.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia shook her head. Aslant her cheek the brim of a straw hat threw a
      curve of shade, her ear glowed transparent in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      A difference had come in their relations since that kiss; outwardly she
      was the same good comrade, cool and quick. But as before a change one
      feels the subtle difference in the temper of the wind, so Shelton was
      affected by the inner change in her. He had made a blot upon her candour;
      he had tried to rub it out again, but there was left a mark, and it was
      ineffaceable. Antonia belonged to the most civilised division of the race
      most civilised in all the world, whose creed is &ldquo;Let us love and
      hate, let us work and marry, but let us never give ourselves away; to give
      ourselves away is to leave a mark, and that is past forgive ness. Let our
      lives be like our faces, free from every kind of wrinkle, even those of
      laughter; in this way alone can we be really civilised.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that she was ruffled by a vague discomfort. That he should give
      himself away was natural, perhaps, and only made her wonder, but that he
      should give her the feeling that she had given herself away was a very
      different thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind if I just ask at the Bishop&rsquo;s Head for letters?&rdquo;
      he said, as they passed the old hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dirty and thin envelope was brought to him, addressed &ldquo;Mr. Richard
      Shelton, Esq.,&rdquo; in handwriting that was passionately clear, as
      though the writer had put his soul into securing delivery of the letter.
      It was dated three days back, and, as they rode away, Shelton read as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      IMPERIAL PEACOCK HOTEL, FOLKESTONE. MON CHER MONSIEUR SHELTON,
    </p>
    <p>
      This is already the third time I have taken up pen to write to you, but,
      having nothing but misfortune to recount, I hesitated, awaiting better
      days. Indeed, I have been so profoundly discouraged that if I had not
      thought it my duty to let you know of my fortunes I know not even now if I
      should have found the necessary spirit. &lsquo;Les choses vont de mal en
      mal&rsquo;. From what I hear there has never been so bad a season here.
      Nothing going on. All the same, I am tormented by a mob of little matters
      which bring me not sufficient to support my life. I know not what to do;
      one thing is certain, in no case shall I return here another year. The
      patron of this hotel, my good employer, is one of those innumerable
      specimens who do not forge or steal because they have no need, and if they
      had would lack the courage; who observe the marriage laws because they
      have been brought up to believe in them, and know that breaking them
      brings risk and loss of reputation; who do not gamble because they dare
      not; do not drink because it disagrees with them; go to church because
      their neighbours go, and to procure an appetite for the mid-day meal;
      commit no murder because, not transgressing in any other fashion, they are
      not obliged. What is there to respect in persons of this sort? Yet they
      are highly esteemed, and form three quarters of Society. The rule with
      these good gentlemen is to shut their eyes, never use their thinking
      powers, and close the door on all the dogs of life for fear they should
      get bitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton paused, conscious of Antonia&rsquo;s eyes fixed on him with the
      inquiring look that he had come to dread. In that chilly questioning she
      seemed to say: &ldquo;I am waiting. I am prepared to be told things&mdash;that
      is, useful things&mdash;things that help one to believe without the risk
      of too much thinking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from that young foreigner,&rdquo; he said; and went on
      reading to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have eyes, and here I am; I have a nose &lsquo;pour, flairer le humbug&rsquo;.
      I see that amongst the value of things nothing is the equal of &ldquo;free
      thought.&rdquo; Everything else they can take from me, &lsquo;on ne pent
      pas m&rsquo;oter cela&rsquo;. I see no future for me here, and certainly
      should have departed long ago if I had had the money, but, as I have
      already told you, all that I can do barely suffices to procure me &lsquo;de
      quoi vivre&rsquo;. &lsquo;Je me sens ecceuye&rsquo;. Do not pay too much
      attention to my Jeremiads; you know what a pessimist I am. &lsquo;Je ne
      perds pas courage&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoping that you are well, and in the cordial pressing of your hand, I
      subscribe myself,
    </p>
    <p>
      Your very devoted
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUIS FERRAND.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode with the letter open in his hand, frowning at the curious turmoil
      which Ferrand excited in his heart. It was as though this foreign vagrant
      twanged within him a neglected string, which gave forth moans of a mutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo; Antonia asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should he show it to her? If he might not, what should he do when they
      were married?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know,&rdquo; he said at last; &ldquo;it &lsquo;s
      not particularly cheering.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he like, Dick&mdash;I mean, to look at? Like a gentleman,
      or what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton stifled a desire to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks very well in a frock-coat,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;his
      father was a wine merchant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia flicked her whip against her skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear
      if there&rsquo;s anything I ought not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But instead of soothing Shelton, these words had just the opposite effect.
      His conception of the ideal wife was not that of one from whom the half of
      life must be excluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only,&rdquo; he stammered again, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s
      not cheerful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right!&rdquo; she cried, and, touching her horse, flew off
      in front. &ldquo;I hate dismal things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton bit his lips. It was not his fault that half the world was dark.
      He knew her words were loosed against himself, and, as always at a sign of
      her displeasure, was afraid. He galloped after her on the scorched turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You &lsquo;re angry with me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling, I can&rsquo;t help it if things are n&rsquo;t cheerful. We
      have eyes,&rdquo; he added, quoting from the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia did not look at him; but touched her horse again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to see the gloomy side,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t see why YOU should. It&rsquo;s wicked to be
      discontented;&rdquo; and she galloped off.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not his fault if there were a thousand different kinds of men, a
      thousand different points of view, outside the fence of her experience!
      &ldquo;What business,&rdquo; he thought, digging in his dummy spurs,
      &ldquo;has our class to patronise? We &lsquo;re the only people who have n&rsquo;t
      an idea of what life really means.&rdquo; Chips of dried turf and dust
      came flying back, stinging his face. He gained on her, drew almost within
      reach, then, as though she had been playing with him, was left hopelessly
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stooped under the far hedge, fanning her flushed face with
      dock-leaves:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha, Dick! I knew you&rsquo;d never catch me&rdquo; and she patted
      the chestnut mare, who turned her blowing muzzle with contemptuous humour
      towards Shelton&rsquo;s steed, while her flanks heaved rapturously,
      gradually darkening with sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better take them steadily,&rdquo; grunted Shelton,
      getting off and loosening his girths, &ldquo;if we mean to get home at
      all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross, Dick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We oughtn&rsquo;t to have galloped them like this; they &lsquo;re
      not in condition. We&rsquo;d better go home the way we came.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia dropped the reins, and straightened her back hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There &lsquo;s no fun in that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Out and back
      again; I hate a dog&rsquo;s walk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Shelton; he would have her longer to
      himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      The road led up and up a hill, and from the top a vision of Saxonia lay
      disclosed in waves of wood and pasture. Their way branched down a gateless
      glade, and Shelton sidled closer till his knee touched the mare&rsquo;s
      off-flank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia&rsquo;s profile conjured up visions. She was youth itself; her
      eyes so brilliant, and so innocent, her cheeks so glowing, and her brow
      unruffled; but in her smile and in the setting of her jaw lurked something
      resolute and mischievous. Shelton put his hand out to the mare&rsquo;s
      mane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you promise to marry me?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what made you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; cried Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped her hand over his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dick!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;to be everything to you. Do you
      think I shall?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course! The words seemed very much or very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked down at the river, gleaming below the glade in a curving silver
      line. &ldquo;Dick, there are such a lot of splendid things that we might
      do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Did she mean, amongst those splendid things, that they might understand
      each other; or were they fated to pretend to only, in the old
      time-honoured way?
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the river by a ferry, and rode a long time in silence, while
      the twilight slowly fell behind the aspens. And all the beauty of the
      evening, with its restless leaves, its grave young moon, and lighted
      campion flowers, was but a part of her; the scents, the witchery and
      shadows, the quaint field noises, the yokels&rsquo; whistling, and the
      splash of water-fowl, each seemed to him enchanted. The flighting bats,
      the forms of the dim hayricks, and sweet-brier perfume-she summed them all
      up in herself. The fingermarks had deepened underneath her eyes, a languor
      came upon her; it made her the more sweet and youthful. Her shoulders
      seemed to bear on them the very image of our land&mdash;grave and
      aspiring, eager yet contained&mdash;before there came upon that land the
      grin of greed, the folds of wealth, the simper of content. Fair,
      unconscious, free!
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was silent, with a beating heart.

      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE BIRD &lsquo;OF PASSAGE
    </h3>
    <p>
      That night, after the ride, when Shelton was about to go to bed, his eyes
      fell on Ferrand&rsquo;s letter, and with a sleepy sense of duty he began
      to read it through a second time. In the dark, oak-panelled bedroom, his
      four-post bed, with back of crimson damask and its dainty sheets, was
      lighted by the candle glow; the copper pitcher of hot water in the basin,
      the silver of his brushes, and the line of his well-polished boots all
      shone, and Shelton&rsquo;s face alone was gloomy, staring at the yellowish
      paper in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor chap wants money, of course,&rdquo; he thought. But why go
      on for ever helping one who had no claim on him, a hopeless case,
      incurable&mdash;one whom it was his duty to let sink for the good of the
      community at large? Ferrand&rsquo;s vagabond refinement had beguiled him
      into charity that should have been bestowed on hospitals, or any
      charitable work but foreign missions. To give a helping hand, a bit of
      himself, a nod of fellowship to any fellow-being irrespective of a claim,
      merely because he happened to be down, was sentimental nonsense! The line
      must be drawn! But in the muttering of this conclusion he experienced a
      twinge of honesty. &ldquo;Humbug! You don&rsquo;t want to part with your
      money, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So, sitting down in shirt-sleeves at his writing table, he penned the
      following on paper stamped with the Holm Oaks address and crest:
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR FERRAND,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sorry you are having such a bad spell. You seem to be dead out of
      luck. I hope by the time you get this things will have changed for the
      better. I should very much like to see you again and have a talk, but
      shall be away for some time longer, and doubt even when I get back whether
      I should be able to run down and look you up. Keep me &lsquo;au courant&rsquo;
      as to your movements. I enclose a cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      RICHARD SHELTON.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had written out the cheque, a moth fluttering round the candle
      distracted his attention, and by the time he had caught and put it out he
      had forgotten that the cheque was not enclosed. The letter, removed with
      his clothes before he was awake, was posted in an empty state.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning a week later he was sitting in the smoking-room in the company
      of the gentleman called Mabbey, who was telling him how many grouse he had
      deprived of life on August 12 last year, and how many he intended to
      deprive of life on August 12 this year, when the door was opened, and the
      butler entered, carrying his head as though it held some fatal secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man is asking for you, sir,&rdquo; he said to Shelton,
      bending down discreetly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you would wish to
      see him, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man!&rdquo; repeated Shelton; &ldquo;what sort of a young
      man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say a sort of foreigner, sir,&rdquo; apologetically
      replied the butler. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s wearing a frock-coat, but he looks
      as if he had been walking a good deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton rose with haste; the description sounded to him ominous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put him in the young ladies&rsquo; little room, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll come and see
      him. Now, what the deuce!&rdquo; he thought, running down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a queer commingling of pleasure and vexation that he entered
      the little chamber sacred to the birds, beasts, racquets, golf-clubs, and
      general young ladies&rsquo; litter. Ferrand was standing underneath the
      cage of a canary, his hands folded on his pinched-up hat, a nervous smile
      upon his lips. He was dressed in Shelton&rsquo;s old frock-coat, tightly
      buttoned, and would have cut a stylish figure but far his look of travel.
      He wore a pair of pince-nez, too, which somewhat veiled his cynical blue
      eyes, and clashed a little with the pagan look of him. In the midst of the
      strange surroundings he still preserved that air of knowing, and being
      master of, his fate, which was his chief attraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m glad to see you,&rdquo; said Shelton, holding out his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive this liberty,&rdquo; began Ferrand, &ldquo;but I thought it
      due to you after all you&rsquo;ve done for me not to throw up my efforts
      to get employment in England without letting you know first. I&rsquo;m
      entirely at the end of my resources.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase struck Shelton as one that he had heard before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wrote to you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;did n&rsquo;t you get my
      letter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A flicker passed across the vagrant&rsquo;s face; he drew the letter from
      his pocket and held it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is, monsieur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton stared at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I sent a cheque?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrand did not smile; there was a look about him as though Shelton by
      forgetting to enclose that cheque had done him a real injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton could not quite hide a glance of doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;meant to enclose
      a cheque.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Too subtle to say anything, Ferrand curled his lip. &ldquo;I am capable of
      much, but not of that,&rdquo; he seemed to say; and at once Shelton felt
      the meanness of his doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupid of me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no intention of intruding here,&rdquo; said Ferrand; &ldquo;I
      hoped to see you in the neighbourhood, but I arrive exhausted with
      fatigue. I&rsquo;ve eaten nothing since yesterday at noon, and walked
      thirty miles.&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;You see, I had no
      time to lose before assuring myself whether you were here or not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;&rdquo; began Shelton, but again he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should very much like,&rdquo; the young foreigner went on,
      &ldquo;for one of your good legislators to find himself in these country
      villages with a penny in his pocket. In other countries bakers are obliged
      to sell you an equivalent of bread for a penny; here they won&rsquo;t sell
      you as much as a crust under twopence. You don&rsquo;t encourage poverty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your idea now?&rdquo; asked Shelton, trying to gain time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I told you,&rdquo; replied Ferrand, &ldquo;there &lsquo;s
      nothing to be done at Folkestone, though I should have stayed there if I
      had had the money to defray certain expenses&rdquo;; and again he seemed
      to reproach his patron with the omission of that cheque. &ldquo;They say
      things will certainly be better at the end of the month. Now that I know
      English well, I thought perhaps I could procure a situation for teaching
      languages.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a fact, however, he was far from seeing; he literally did not know what
      to do. It seemed so brutal to give Ferrand money and ask him to clear out;
      besides, he chanced to have none in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It needs philosophy to support what I &lsquo;ve gone through this
      week,&rdquo; said Ferrand, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;On Wednesday
      last, when I received your letter, I had just eighteen-pence, and at once
      I made a resolution to come and see you; on that sum I &lsquo;ve done the
      journey. My strength is nearly at an end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton stroked his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he had just begun, &ldquo;we must think it over,&rdquo;
      when by Ferrand&rsquo;s face he saw that some one had come in. He turned,
      and saw Antonia in the doorway. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he stammered,
      and, going to Antonia, drew her from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a smile she said at once: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the young foreigner; I&rsquo;m
      certain. Oh, what fun!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Shelton slowly; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s come to see
      me about getting some sort of tutorship or other. Do you think your mother
      would mind if I took him up to have a wash? He&rsquo;s had a longish walk.
      And might he have some breakfast? He must be hungry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! I&rsquo;ll tell Dobson. Shall I speak to mother? He
      looks nice, Dick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a grateful, furtive look, and went back to his guest; an
      impulse had made him hide from her the true condition of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrand was standing where he had been left his face still clothed in
      mordant impassivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up to my room!&rdquo; said Shelton; and while his guest was
      washing, brushing, and otherwise embellishing his person, he stood
      reflecting that Ferrand was by no means unpresentable, and he felt quite
      grateful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took an opportunity, when the young man&rsquo;s back was turned, of
      examining his counterfoils. There was no record, naturally, of a cheque
      drawn in Ferrand&rsquo;s favour. Shelton felt more mean than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      A message came from Mrs. Dennant; so he took the traveller to the
      dining-room and left him there, while he himself went to the lady of the
      house. He met Antonia coming down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many days did you say he went without food that time&mdash;you
      know?&rdquo; she asked in passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does n&rsquo;t look a bit common, Dick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton gazed at her dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re surely not going to make a show of him!&rdquo; he
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dennant was writing, in a dark-blue dress starred over with white
      spots, whose fine lawn collar was threaded with black velvet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen the new hybrid Algy&rsquo;s brought me back from
      Kidstone? Is n&rsquo;t it charmin&rsquo;.&rdquo; and she bent her face
      towards this perfect rose. &ldquo;They say unique; I&rsquo;m awfully
      interested to find out if that&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ve told Algy I really
      must have some.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton thought of the unique hybrid breakfasting downstairs; he wished
      that Mrs. Dennant would show in him the interest she had manifested in the
      rose. But this was absurd of him, he knew, for the potent law of hobbies
      controlled the upper classes, forcing them to take more interest in birds,
      and roses, missionaries, or limited and highly-bound editions of old books
      (things, in a word, in treating which you knew exactly where you were)
      than in the manifestations of mere life that came before their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dick, about that young Frenchman. Antonia says he wants a
      tutorship; now, can you really recommend him? There&rsquo;s Mrs. Robinson
      at the Gateways wants someone to teach her boys languages; and, if he were
      quite satisfactory, it&rsquo;s really time Toddles had a few lessons in
      French; he goes to Eton next half.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton stared at the rose; he had suddenly realised why it was that
      people take more interest in roses than in human beings&mdash;one could do
      it with a quiet heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a Frenchman, you know,&rdquo; he said to gain a
      little time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a German, I hope,&rdquo; Mrs. Dennant answered,
      passing her forgers round a petal, to impress its fashion on her brain;
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Germans. Is n&rsquo;t he the one you wrote about&mdash;come
      down in the world? Such a pity with so young a fellow! His father was a
      merchant, I think you told us. Antonia says he &lsquo;s quite refined to
      look at.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Shelton, feeling on safe ground; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      refined enough to look at.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dennant took the rose and put it to her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delicious perfume! That was a very touchin&rsquo; story about his
      goin&rsquo; without food in Paris. Old Mrs. Hopkins has a room to let; I
      should like to do her a good turn. I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s a hole
      in the ceilin&rsquo;, though. Or there&rsquo;s the room here in the left
      wing on the ground-floor where John the footman used to sleep. It&rsquo;s
      quite nice; perhaps he could have that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;re awfully kind,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to do something to restore his self-respect,&rdquo;,
      went on Mrs. Dennant, &ldquo;if, as you say, he &lsquo;s clever and all
      that. Seein&rsquo; a little refined life again might make a world of
      difference to him. It&rsquo;s so sad when a young man loses self-respect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton was much struck by the practical way in which she looked at
      things. Restore his self-respect! It seemed quite a splendid notion! He
      smiled, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too kind. I think&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in doin&rsquo; things by halves,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Dennant; &ldquo;he does n&rsquo;t drink, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Shelton. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s rather a tobacco
      maniac, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a mercy! You would n&rsquo;t believe the trouble
      I &lsquo;ve had with drink, especially over cooks and coachmen. And now
      Bunyan&rsquo;s taken to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;d have no trouble with Ferrand,&rdquo; returned
      Shelton; &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t tell him from a gentleman as far as
      manners go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dennant smiled one of her rather sweet and kindly smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Dick,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not much
      comfort in that. Look at poor Bobby Surcingle, look at Oliver Semples and
      Victor Medallion; you could n&rsquo;t have better families. But if you
      &lsquo;re sure he does n&rsquo;t drink! Algy &lsquo;ll laugh, of course;
      that does n&rsquo;t matter&mdash;he laughs at everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton felt guilty; being quite unprepared for so rapid an adoption of
      his client.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really believe there&rsquo;s a lot of good in him,&rdquo; he
      stammered; &ldquo;but, of course, I know very little, and from what he
      tells me he&rsquo;s had a very curious life. I shouldn&rsquo;t like&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was he educated?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Dennant. &ldquo;They
      have no public schools in France, so I &lsquo;ve been told; but, of
      course, he can&rsquo;t help that, poor young fellow! Oh, and, Dick, there
      &lsquo;s one thing&mdash;has he relations? One has always to be so careful
      about that. It &lsquo;s one thing to help a young fellow, but quite
      another to help his family too. One sees so many cases of that where men
      marry girls without money, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has told me,&rdquo; answered Shelton, &ldquo;his only relations
      are some cousins, and they are rich.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dennant took out her handkerchief, and, bending above the rose,
      removed a tiny insect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These green-fly get in everywhere,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sad story; can&rsquo;t they do anything for him?&rdquo; and
      she made researches in the rose&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quarrelled with them, I believe,&rdquo; said Shelton;
      &ldquo;I have n&rsquo;t liked to press him, about that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Dennant absently&mdash;she
      had found another green-fly &ldquo;I always think it&rsquo;s painful when
      a young man seems so friendless.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton was silent; he was thinking deeply. He had never before felt so
      distrustful of the youthful foreigner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;the best thing would be for
      you to see him for yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dennant. &ldquo;I should be so glad if
      you would tell him to come up. I must say I do think that was a most
      touchin&rsquo; story about Paris. I wonder whether this light&rsquo;s
      strong enough now for me to photograph this rose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton withdrew and went down-stairs. Ferrand was still at breakfast.
      Antonia stood at the sideboard carving beef for him, and in the window sat
      Thea with her Persian kitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both girls were following the traveller&rsquo;s movements with inscrutable
      blue eyes. A shiver ran down Shelton&rsquo;s spine. To speak truth, he
      cursed the young man&rsquo;s coming, as though it affected his relations
      with Antonia.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SUB ROSA
    </h3>
    <p>
      From the interview, which Shelton had the mixed delight of watching,
      between Ferrand and the Honourable Mrs. Dennant, certain definite results
      accrued, the chief of which was the permission accorded the young wanderer
      to occupy the room which had formerly been tenanted by the footman John.
      Shelton was lost in admiration of Ferrand&rsquo;s manner in this scene..
      Its subtle combination of deference and dignity was almost paralysing;
      paralysing, too, the subterranean smile upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charmin&rsquo; young man, Dick,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dennant, when
      Shelton lingered to say once more that he knew but very little of him;
      &ldquo;I shall send a note round to Mrs. Robinson at once. They&rsquo;re
      rather common, you know&mdash;the Robinsons. I think they&rsquo;ll take
      anyone I recommend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m sure they will,&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      why I think you ought to know&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Dennant&rsquo;s eyes, fervent, hare-like, were fixed on something
      far away; turning, he saw the rose in a tall vase on a tall and spindly
      stool. It seemed to nod towards them in the sunshine. Mrs. Dennant dived
      her nose towards her camera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The light&rsquo;s perfect now,&rdquo; she said, in a voice muffled
      by the cloth. &ldquo;I feel sure that livin&rsquo; with decent people will
      do wonders for him. Of course, he understands that his meals will be
      served to him apart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton, doubly anxious, now that his efforts had lodged his client in a
      place of trust, fell, back on hoping for the best; his instinct told him
      that, vagabond as Ferrand was, he had a curious self-respect, that would
      save him from a mean ingratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, as Mrs. Dennant, who was by no means void of common-sense,
      foresaw, the arrangement worked all right. Ferrand entered on his duties
      as French tutor to the little Robinsons. In the Dennants&rsquo; household
      he kept himself to his own room, which, day and night, he perfumed with
      tobacco, emerging at noon into the garden, or, if wet, into the study, to
      teach young Toddles French. After a time it became customary for him to
      lunch with the house-party, partly through a mistake of Toddles, who
      seemed to think that it was natural, and partly through John Noble, one of
      Shelton&rsquo;s friends, who had come to stay, and discovered Ferrand to
      be a most awfully interesting person he was always, indeed, discovering
      the most awfully interesting persons. In his grave and toneless voice,
      brushing his hair from off his brow, he descanted upon Ferrand with
      enthusiasm, to which was joined a kind of shocked amusement, as who should
      say, &ldquo;Of course, I know it&rsquo;s very odd, but really he &lsquo;s
      such an awfully interesting person.&rdquo; For John Noble was a
      politician, belonging to one of those two Peculiar parties, which,
      thoroughly in earnest, of an honesty above suspicion, and always very
      busy, are constitutionally averse to anything peculiar for fear of finding
      they have overstepped the limit of what is practical in politics. As such
      he inspired confidence, not caring for things unless he saw some immediate
      benefit to be had from them, having a perfect sense of decency, and a
      small imagination. He discussed all sorts of things with Ferrand; on one
      occasion Shelton overheard them arguing on anarchism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No Englishman approves of murder,&rdquo; Noble was saying, in the
      gloomy voice that contrasted with the optimistic cast of his fine head,
      &ldquo;but the main principle is right. Equalisation of property is bound
      to come. I sympathise with then, not with their methods.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; struck in Ferrand; &ldquo;do you know any
      anarchists?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Noble; &ldquo;I certainly do not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you sympathise with them, but the first time it comes to
      action&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monsieur! one doesn&rsquo;t make anarchism with the head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton perceived that he had meant to add, &ldquo;but with the heart, the
      lungs, the liver.&rdquo; He drew a deeper meaning from the saying, and
      seemed to see, curling with the smoke from Ferrand&rsquo;s lips, the
      words: &ldquo;What do you, an English gentleman, of excellent position,
      and all the prejudices of your class, know about us outcasts? If you want
      to understand us you must be an outcast too; we are not playing at the
      game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This talk took place upon the lawn, at the end of one of Toddles&rsquo;s
      French lessons, and Shelton left John Noble maintaining to the youthful
      foreigner, with stubborn logic, that he, John Noble, and the anarchists
      had much, in common. He was returning to the house, when someone called
      his name from underneath the holm oak. There, sitting Turkish fashion on
      the grass, a pipe between his teeth, he found a man who had arrived the
      night before, and impressed him by his friendly taciturnity. His name was
      Whyddon, and he had just returned from Central Africa; a brown-faced,
      large-jawed man, with small but good and steady eyes, and strong, spare
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Shelton!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wondered if you could
      tell me what tips I ought to give the servants here; after ten years away
      I &lsquo;ve forgotten all about that sort of thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton sat down beside him; unconsciously assuming, too, a cross-legged
      attitude, which caused him much discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was listening,&rdquo; said his new acquaintance, &ldquo;to the
      little chap learning his French. I&rsquo;ve forgotten mine. One feels a
      hopeless duffer knowing no, languages.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you speak Arabic?&rdquo; said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Arabic, and a dialect or two; they don&rsquo;t count. That
      tutor has a curious face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; said Shelton, interested. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      had a curious life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller spread his hands, palms downwards, on the grass and looked
      at Shelton with, a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say he was a rolling stone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
      &lsquo;s odd, I&rsquo; ve seen white men in Central Africa with a good
      deal of his look about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your diagnosis is a good one,&rdquo; answered Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m always sorry for those fellows. There&rsquo;s generally
      some good in them. They are their own enemies. A bad business to be unable
      to take pride in anything one does!&rdquo; And there was a look of pity on
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly it,&rdquo; said Shelton. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve
      often tried to put it into words. Is it incurable?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whyddon pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather think,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;it must be because
      they have too strong a faculty of criticism. You can&rsquo;t teach a man
      to be proud of his own work; that lies in his blood &ldquo;; folding his
      arms across his breast, he heaved a sigh. Under the dark foliage, his eyes
      on the sunlight, he was the type of all those Englishmen who keep their
      spirits bright and wear their bodies out in the dark places of hard work.
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; he said, showing his teeth in a
      smile, &ldquo;how delightful it is to be at home! You learn to love the
      old country when you&rsquo;re away from it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton often thought, afterwards; of this diagnosis of the vagabond, for
      he was always stumbling on instances of that power of subtle criticism
      which was the young foreigner&rsquo;s prime claim to be &ldquo;a most
      awfully interesting&rdquo; and perhaps a rather shocking person.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old school-fellow of Shelton&rsquo;s and his wife were staying in the
      house, who offered to the eye the picture of a perfect domesticity.
      Passionless and smiling, it was impossible to imagine they could ever have
      a difference. Shelton, whose bedroom was next to theirs, could hear them
      in the mornings talking in exactly the tones they used at lunch, and
      laughing the same laughs. Their life seemed to accord them perfect
      satisfaction; they were supplied with their convictions by Society just
      as, when at home, they were supplied with all the other necessaries of
      life by some co-operative stores. Their fairly handsome faces, with the
      fairly kind expressions, quickly and carefully regulated by a sense of
      compromise, began to worry him so much that when in the same room he would
      even read to avoid the need of looking at them. And yet they were kind&mdash;that
      is, fairly kind&mdash;and clean and quiet in the house, except when they
      laughed, which was often, and at things which made him want to howl as a
      dog howls at music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Shelton,&rdquo; Ferrand said one day, &ldquo;I &lsquo;m not an
      amateur of marriage&mdash;never had the chance, as you may well suppose;
      but, in any case, you have some people in the house who would make me mark
      time before I went committing it. They seem the ideal young married people&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      quarrel, have perfect health, agree with everybody, go to church, have
      children&mdash;but I should like to hear what is beautiful in their life,&rdquo;
      and he grimaced. &ldquo;It seems to me so ugly that I can only gasp. I
      would much rather they ill-treated each other, just to show they had the
      corner of a soul between them. If that is marriage, &lsquo;Dieu m&rsquo;en
      garde!&rsquo;.rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Shelton did not answer; he was thinking deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The saying of John Noble&rsquo;s, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really a most
      interesting person,&rdquo; grew more and more upon his nerves; it seemed
      to describe the Dennant attitude towards this stranger within their gates.
      They treated him with a sort of wonder on the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch&rdquo;
      system, like an object in an exhibition. The restoration, however, of, his
      self-respect proceeded with success. For all the semblance of having grown
      too big for Shelton&rsquo;s clothes, for all his vividly burnt face, and
      the quick but guarded play of cynicism on his lips&mdash;he did much
      credit to his patrons. He had subdued his terror of a razor, and looked
      well in a suit of Shelton&rsquo;s flannels. For, after all, he had only
      been eight years exiled from middle-class gentility, and he had been a
      waiter half that time. But Shelton wished him at the devil. Not for his
      manners&rsquo; sake&mdash;he was never tired of watching how subtly the
      vagabond adapted his conduct to the conduct of his hosts, while keeping up
      his critical detachment&mdash;but because that critical detachment was a
      constant spur to his own vision, compelling him to analyse the life into
      which, he had been born and was about to marry. This process was
      disturbing; and to find out when it had commenced, he had to go back to
      his meeting with Ferrand on the journey up from Dover.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was kindness in a hospitality which opened to so strange a bird;
      admitting the kindness, Shelton fell to analysing it. To himself, to
      people of his class, the use of kindness was a luxury, not significant of
      sacrifice, but productive of a pleasant feeling in the heart, such as
      massage will setup in the legs. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s kind,&rdquo; he
      thought; &ldquo;the question is, What understanding is there, what real
      sympathy?&rdquo; This problem gave him food for thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progress, which Mrs. Dennant not unfrequently remarked upon, in
      Ferrand&rsquo;s conquest of his strange position, seemed to Shelton but a
      sign that he was getting what he could out of his sudden visit to green
      pastures; under the same circumstances, Shelton thought that he himself
      would do the same. He felt that the young foreigner was making a
      convenient bow to property, but he had more respect for the sarcastic
      smile on the lips of Ferrand&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before the inevitable change came in the spirit of the
      situation; more and more was Shelton conscious of a quaint uneasiness in
      the very breathing of the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious fellow you&rsquo;ve got hold of there, Shelton,&rdquo; Mr.
      Dennant said to him during a game of croquet; &ldquo;he &lsquo;ll never do
      any good for himself, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one sense I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; admitted Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know his story? I will bet you sixpence&rdquo;&mdash;and Mr.
      Dennant paused to swing his mallet with a proper accuracy &ldquo;that he&rsquo;s
      been in prison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prison!&rdquo; ejaculated Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Mr. Dennant, with bent knees carefully
      measuring his next shot, &ldquo;that you ought to make inquiries&mdash;ah!
      missed it! Awkward these hoops! One must draw the line somewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never could draw,&rdquo; returned Shelton, nettled and uneasy;
      &ldquo;but I understand&mdash;I &lsquo;ll give him a hint to go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Dennant, moving after his second ball,
      which Shelton had smitten to the farther end, &ldquo;be offended, my dear
      Shelton, and by no means give him a hint; he interests me very much&mdash;a
      very clever, quiet young fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That this was not his private view Shelton inferred by studying Mr.
      Dennant&rsquo;s manner in the presence of the vagabond. Underlying the
      well-bred banter of the tranquil voice, the guarded quizzicality of his
      pale brown face, it could be seen that Algernon Cuffe Dennant, Esq., J.P.,
      accustomed to laugh at other people, suspected that he was being laughed
      at. What more natural than that he should grope about to see how this
      could be? A vagrant alien was making himself felt by an English Justice of
      the Peace&mdash;no small tribute, this, to Ferrand&rsquo;s personality.
      The latter would sit silent through a meal, and yet make his effect. He,
      the object of their kindness, education, patronage, inspired their fear.
      There was no longer any doubt; it was not of Ferrand that they were
      afraid, but of what they did not understand in him; of horrid subtleties
      meandering in the brain under that straight, wet-looking hair; of
      something bizarre popping from the curving lips below that thin, lopsided
      nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to Shelton in this, as in all else, Antonia was what mattered. At
      first, anxious to show her lover that she trusted him, she seemed never
      tired of doing things for his young protege, as though she too had set her
      heart on his salvation; but, watching her eyes when they rested on the
      vagabond, Shelton was perpetually reminded of her saying on the first day
      of his visit to Holm Oaks, &ldquo;I suppose he &lsquo;s really good&mdash;I
      mean all these things you told me about were only....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity never left her glance, nor did that story of his four days&rsquo;
      starving leave her mind; a sentimental picturesqueness clung about that
      incident more valuable by far than this mere human being with whom she had
      so strangely come in contact. She watched Ferrand, and Shelton watched
      her. If he had been told that he was watching her, he would have denied it
      in good faith; but he was bound to watch her, to find out with what eyes
      she viewed this visitor who embodied all the rebellious under-side of
      life, all that was absent in herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; she said to him one day, &ldquo;you never talk to me
      of Monsieur Ferrand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to talk of him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that he&rsquo;s improved?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fatter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia looked grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but really?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t judge
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia turned her face away, and something in her attitude alarmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was once a sort of gentleman,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;why
      shouldn&rsquo;t he become one again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting on the low wall of the kitchen-garden, her head was framed by
      golden plums. The sun lay barred behind the foliage of the holm oak, but a
      little patch filtering through a gap had rested in the plum-tree&rsquo;s
      heart. It crowned the girl. Her raiment, the dark leaves, the red wall,
      the golden plums, were woven by the passing glow to a block of pagan
      colour. And her face above it, chaste, serene, was like the scentless
      summer evening. A bird amongst the currant bushes kept a little chant
      vibrating; and all the plum-tree&rsquo;s shape and colour seemed alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he does n&rsquo;t want to be a gentleman,&rdquo; said
      Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia swung her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can he help wanting to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have a different philosophy of life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia was slow to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about philosophies of life,&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton answered coldly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No two people have the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With the falling sun-glow the charm passed off the tree. Chilled and
      harder, yet less deep, it was no more a block of woven colour, warm and
      impassive, like a southern goddess; it was now a northern tree, with a
      grey light through its leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you in the least,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;everyone
      wishes to be good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And safe?&rdquo; asked Shelton gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to know,
      I only suppose&mdash;what Ferrand really cares for is doing things
      differently from other people? If you were to load him with a character
      and give him money on condition that he acted as we all act, do you think
      he would accept it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are n&rsquo;t cats dogs; or pagans Christians?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia slid down from the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to think there &lsquo;s any use in trying,&rdquo;
      she said, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton made a movement as if he would go after her, and then stood still,
      watching her figure slowly pass, her head outlined above the wall, her
      hands turned back across her narrow hips. She halted at the bend, looked
      back, then, with an impatient gesture, disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia was slipping from him!
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment&rsquo;s vision from without himself would have shown him that it
      was he who moved and she who was standing still, like the figure of one
      watching the passage of a stream with clear, direct, and sullen eyes.

      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE RIVER
    </h3>
    <p>
      One day towards the end of August Shelton took Antonia on the river&mdash;the
      river that, like soft music, soothes the land; the river of the reeds and
      poplars, the silver swan-sails, sun and moon, woods, and the white
      slumbrous clouds; where cuckoos, and the wind, the pigeons, and the weirs
      are always singing; and in the flash of naked bodies, the play of
      waterlily leaves, queer goblin stumps, and the twilight faces of the
      twisted tree-roots, Pan lives once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reach which Shelton chose was innocent of launches, champagne bottles
      and loud laughter; it was uncivilised, and seldom troubled by these
      humanising influences. He paddled slowly, silent and absorbed, watching
      Antonia. An unaccustomed languor clung about her; her eyes had shadows, as
      though she had not slept; colour glowed softly in her cheeks, her frock
      seemed all alight with golden radiance. She made Shelton pull into the
      reeds, and plucked two rounded lilies sailing like ships against
      slow-moving water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull into the shade, please,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too
      hot out here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The brim of her linen hat kept the sun from her face, but her head was
      drooping like a flower&rsquo;s head at noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton saw that the heat was really harming her, as too hot a day will
      dim the icy freshness of a northern plant. He dipped his sculls, the
      ripples started out and swam in grave diminuendo till they touched the
      banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shot the boat into a cleft, and caught the branches of an overhanging
      tree. The skiff rested, balancing with mutinous vibration, like a living
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hate to live in London,&rdquo; said Antonia suddenly;
      &ldquo;the slums must be so awful. What a pity, when there are places like
      this! But it&rsquo;s no good thinking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Shelton slowly! &ldquo;I suppose it is no good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some bad cottages at the lower end of Cross Eaton. I went
      them one day with Miss Truecote. The people won&rsquo;t help themselves.
      It&rsquo;s so discouraging to help people who won&rsquo;t help themselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was leaning her elbows on her knees, and, with her chin resting on her
      hands, gazed up at Shelton. All around them hung a tent of soft, thick
      leaves, and, below, the water was deep-dyed with green refraction. Willow
      boughs, swaying above the boat, caressed Antonia&rsquo;s arms and
      shoulders; her face and hair alone were free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So discouraging,&rdquo; she said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence fell.... Antonia seemed thinking deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubts don&rsquo;t help you,&rdquo; she said suddenly; &ldquo;how
      can you get any good from doubts? The thing is to win victories.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Victories?&rdquo; said Shelton. &ldquo;I &lsquo;d rather understand
      than conquer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had risen to his feet, and grasped stunted branch, canting the boat
      towards the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you let things slide like that, Dick? It&rsquo;s like
      Ferrand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you such a bad opinion of him, then?&rdquo; asked Shelton. He
      felt on the verge of some, discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      She buried her chin deeper in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked him at first,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I thought that he was
      different. I thought he couldn&rsquo;t really be&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really be what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      explain. I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton still stood, holding to the branch, and the oscillation of the
      boat freed an infinity of tiny ripples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought&mdash;what?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ought to have seen her face grow younger, more childish, even timid.
      She said in a voice smooth, round, and young:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Dick, I do think we ought to try. I know I don&rsquo;t
      try half hard enough. It does n&rsquo;t do any good to think; when you
      think, everything seems so mixed, as if there were nothing to lay hold of.
      I do so hate to feel like that. It is n&rsquo;t as if we didn&rsquo;t know
      what&rsquo;s right. Sometimes I think, and think, and it &lsquo;s all no
      good, only a waste of time, and you feel at the end as if you had been
      doing wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has n&rsquo;t been through fire&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; he
      said; and, letting go the branch, sat down. Freed from restraint, the boat
      edged out towards the current. &ldquo;But what about Ferrand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lay awake last night wondering what makes you like him so. He&rsquo;s
      so bitter; he makes me feel unhappy. He never seems content with anything.
      And he despises&rdquo;&mdash;her face hardened&mdash;&ldquo;I mean, he
      hates us all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So should I if I were he,&rdquo; said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat was drifting on, and gleams of sunlight chased across their
      faces. Antonia spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to be always looking at dark things, or else he seems as
      if&mdash;as if he could&mdash;enjoy himself too much. I thought&mdash;I
      thought at first,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;that we could do him good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do him good! Ha, ha!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A startled rat went swimming for its life against the stream; and Shelton
      saw that he had done a dreadful thing: he had let Antonia with a jerk into
      a secret not hitherto admitted even by himself&mdash;the secret that her
      eyes were not his eyes, her way of seeing things not his nor ever would
      be. He quickly muffled up his laughter. Antonia had dropped her gaze; her
      face regained its languor, but the bosom of her dress was heaving. Shelton
      watched her, racking his brains to find excuses for that fatal laugh; none
      could he find. It was a little piece of truth. He paddled slowly on, close
      to the bank, in the long silence of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breeze had died away, not a fish was rising; save for the lost music
      of the larks no birds were piping; alone, a single pigeon at brief
      intervals cooed from the neighbouring wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not stay much longer in the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the homeward journey in the pony-cart, rounding a corner of the road,
      they came on Ferrand in his pince-nez, holding a cigarette between his
      fingers and talking to a tramp, who was squatting on the bank. The young
      foreigner recognised them, and at once removed his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; said Shelton, returning the salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she, cried, when they were out of hearing, &ldquo;I wish
      he &lsquo;d go. I can&rsquo;t bear to see him; it&rsquo;s like looking at
      the dark.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ON THE WING
    </h3>
    <p>
      That night, having gone up to his room, Shelton filled his pipe for his
      unpleasant duty. He had resolved to hint to Ferrand that he had better go.
      He was still debating whether to write or go himself to the young
      foreigner, when there came a knock and Ferrand himself appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be sorry,&rdquo; he said, breaking an awkward silence,
      &ldquo;if you were to think me ungrateful, but I see no future for me
      here. It would be better for me to go. I should never be content to pass
      my life in teaching languages &lsquo;ce n&rsquo;est guere dans mon
      caractre&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as what he had been cudgelling his brains to find a way of saying
      had thus been said for him, Shelton experienced a sense of disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect to get that&rsquo;s better?&rdquo; he said,
      avoiding Ferrand&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to your kindness,&rdquo; replied the latter, &ldquo;I find
      myself restored. I feel that I ought to make some good efforts to dominate
      my social position.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it well over, if I were you!&rdquo; said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, and it seems to me that I&rsquo;m wasting my time. For a
      man with any courage languages are no career; and, though I &lsquo;ve many
      defects, I still have courage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton let his pipe go out, so pathetic seemed to him this young man&rsquo;s
      faith in his career; it was no pretended faith, but neither was it, he
      felt, his true motive for departure. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s tired,&rdquo; he
      thought; &ldquo;that &lsquo;s it. Tired of one place.&rdquo; And having
      the instinctive sense that nothing would keep Ferrand, he redoubled his
      advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you would have
      done better to have held on here and saved a little before going off to
      God knows what.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save,&rdquo; said Ferrand, &ldquo;is impossible for me, but,
      thanks to you and your good friends, I &lsquo;ve enough to make front to
      first necessities. I&rsquo;m in correspondence with a friend; it&rsquo;s
      of great importance for me to reach Paris before all the world returns. I
      &lsquo;ve a chance to get, a post in one of the West African companies.
      One makes fortunes out there&mdash;if one survives, and, as you know, I
      don&rsquo;t set too much store by life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a proverb,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;&lsquo;A bird in the
      hand is worth two birds in the bush!&rsquo;.rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; returned Ferrand, &ldquo;like all proverbs, is just
      half true. This is an affair of temperament. It &lsquo;s not in my
      character to dandle one when I see two waiting to be caught; &lsquo;voyager,
      apprendre, c&rsquo;est plus fort que moi&rsquo;.&rdquo; He paused; then,
      with a nervous goggle of the eyes and an ironic smile he said: &ldquo;Besides,
      &lsquo;mon cher monsieur&rsquo;, it is better that I go. I have never been
      one to hug illusions, and I see pretty clearly that my presence is hardly
      acceptable in this house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo; asked, Shelton, feeling that the
      murder was now out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, all the world has not your understanding and your lack
      of prejudice, and, though your friends have been extremely kind to me, I
      am in a false position; I cause them embarrassment, which is not
      extraordinary when you reflect what I have been, and that they know my
      history.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not through me,&rdquo; said Shelton quickly, &ldquo;for I don&rsquo;t
      know it myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; the vagrant said, &ldquo;that they feel I&rsquo;m
      not a bird of their feather. They cannot change, neither can I. I have
      never wanted to remain where I &lsquo;m not welcome.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton turned to the window, and stared into the darkness; he would never
      quite understand this vagabond, so delicate, so cynical, and he wondered
      if Ferrand had been swallowing down the words, &ldquo;Why, even you won&rsquo;t
      be sorry to see my back!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;if you must go, you must. When
      do you start?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve arranged with a man to carry my things to the early
      train. I think it better not to say good-bye. I &lsquo;ve written a letter
      instead; here it is. I left it open for you to read if you should wish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Shelton, with a curious mingling of relief,
      regret, good-will, &ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;. see you again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrand gave his hand a stealthy rub, and held it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forget what you have done for me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you write,&rdquo; said Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&rdquo;&mdash;the vagrant&rsquo;s face was oddly twisted&mdash;&ldquo;you
      don&rsquo;t know what a difference it makes to have a correspondent; it
      gives one courage. I hope to remain a long time in correspondence with
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you do,&rdquo; thought Shelton grimly, with a certain
      queer emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do me the justice to remember that I have never asked you
      for anything,&rdquo; said Ferrand. &ldquo;Thank you a thousand times.
      Good-bye!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He again wrung his patron&rsquo;s hand in his damp grasp, and, going out,
      left Shelton with an odd sensation in his throat. &ldquo;You will do me
      the justice to remember that I have never asked you for anything.&rdquo;
      The phrase seemed strange, and his mind flew back over all this queer
      acquaintanceship. It was a fact: from the beginning to the end the youth
      had never really asked for anything. Shelton sat down on his bed, and
      began to read the letter in his hand. It was in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR MADAME (it ran),
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be insupportable to me, after your kindness, if you take me for
      ungrateful. Unfortunately, a crisis has arrived which plunges me into the
      necessity of leaving your hospitality. In all lives, as you are well
      aware, there arise occasions that one cannot govern, and I know that you
      will pardon me that I enter into no explanation on an event which gives me
      great chagrin, and, above all, renders me subject to an imputation of
      ingratitude, which, believe me, dear Madame, by no means lies in my
      character. I know well enough that it is a breach of politeness to leave
      you without in person conveying the expression of my profound
      reconnaissance, but if you consider how hard it is for me to be compelled
      to abandon all that is so distinguished in domestic life, you will forgive
      my weakness. People like me, who have gone through existence with their
      eyes open, have remarked that those who are endowed with riches have a
      right to look down on such as are not by wealth and breeding fitted to
      occupy the same position. I shall never dispute a right so natural and
      salutary, seeing that without this distinction, this superiority, which
      makes of the well-born and the well-bred a race apart, the rest of the
      world would have no standard by which to rule their lives, no anchor to
      throw into the depths of that vast sea of fortune and of misfortune on
      which we others drive before the wind. It is because of this, dear Madame,
      that I regard myself so doubly fortunate to have been able for a few
      minutes in this bitter pilgrimage called life, to sit beneath the tree of
      safety. To have been able, if only for an hour, to sit and set the
      pilgrims pass, the pilgrims with the blistered feet and ragged clothes,
      and who yet, dear Madame, guard within their hearts a certain joy in life,
      illegal joy, like the desert air which travellers will tell you fills men
      as with wine to be able thus to sit an hour, and with a smile to watch
      them pass, lame and blind, in all the rags of their deserved misfortunes,
      can you not conceive, dear Madame, how that must be for such as I a
      comfort? Whatever one may say, it is sweet, from a position of security,
      to watch the sufferings of others; it gives one a good sensation in the
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In writing this, I recollect that I myself once had the chance of passing
      all my life in this enviable safety, and as you may suppose, dear Madame,
      I curse myself that I should ever have had the courage to step beyond the
      boundaries of this fine tranquil state. Yet, too, there have been times
      when I have asked myself: &ldquo;Do we really differ from the wealthy&mdash;we
      others, birds of the fields, who have our own philosophy, grown from the
      pains of needing bread&mdash;we who see that the human heart is not always
      an affair of figures, or of those good maxims that one finds in copy-books&mdash;do
      we really differ?&rdquo; It is with shame that I confess to have asked
      myself a question so heretical. But now, when for these four weeks I have
      had the fortune of this rest beneath your roof, I see how wrong I was to
      entertain such doubts. It is a great happiness to have decided once for
      all this point, for it is not in my character to pass through life
      uncertain&mdash;mistaken, perhaps&mdash;on psychological matters such as
      these. No, Madame; rest happily assured that there is a great difference,
      which in the future will be sacred for me. For, believe me, Madame, it
      would be calamity for high Society if by chance there should arise amongst
      them any understanding of all that side of life which&mdash;vast as the
      plains and bitter as the sea, black as the ashes of a corpse, and yet more
      free than any wings of birds who fly away&mdash;is so justly beyond the
      grasp of their philosophy. Yes, believe me, dear Madame, there is no
      danger in the world so much to be avoided by all the members of that
      circle, most illustrious, most respectable, called high Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what I have said you may imagine how hard it is for me to take my
      flight. I shall always keep for you the most distinguished sentiments.
      With the expression of my full regard for you and your good family, and of
      a gratitude as sincere as it is badly worded,
    </p>
    <p>
      Believe me, dear Madame,
    </p>
    <p>
      Your devoted
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUIS FERRAND.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton&rsquo;s first impulse was to tear the letter up, but this he
      reflected he had no right to do. Remembering, too, that Mrs. Dennant&rsquo;s
      French was orthodox, he felt sure she would never understand the young
      foreigner&rsquo;s subtle innuendoes. He closed the envelope and went to
      bed, haunted still by Ferrand&rsquo;s parting look.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with no small feeling of embarrassment, however, that, having sent
      the letter to its destination by an early footman, he made his appearance
      at the breakfast-table. Behind the Austrian coffee-urn, filled with French
      coffee, Mrs. Dennant, who had placed four eggs in a German egg-boiler,
      said &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; with a kindly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick, an egg?&rdquo; she asked him, holding up a fifth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; replied Shelton, greeting the table and
      fitting down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a little late; the buzz of conversation rose hilariously around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; continued Mr. Dennant, who was talking to his
      youngest daughter, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have no chance whatever&mdash;not
      the least little bit of chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, what nonsense! You know we shall beat your heads off!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before it &lsquo;s too late, then, I will eat a muffin. Shelton,
      pass the muffins!&rdquo; But in making this request, Mr. Dennant avoided
      looking in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia, too, seemed to keep her eyes away from him. She was talking to a
      Connoisseur on Art of supernatural appearances, and seemed in the highest
      spirits. Shelton rose, and, going to the sideboard, helped himself to
      grouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the young man I saw yesterday on the lawn?&rdquo; he heard
      the Connoisseur remark. &ldquo;Struck me as having an&mdash;er&mdash;quite
      intelligent physiog.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His own intelligent physiog, raised at a slight slant so that he might
      look the better through his nose-nippers, was the very pattern of
      approval. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s curious how one&rsquo;s always meeting with
      intelligence;&rdquo; it seemed to say. Mrs. Dennant paused in the act of
      adding cream, and Shelton scrutinised her face; it was hare-like, and
      superior as ever. Thank goodness she had smelt no rat! He felt strangely
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Monsieur Ferrand, teachin&rsquo; Toddles French? Dobson,
      the Professor&rsquo;s cup.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I shall see him again,&rdquo; cooed the Connoisseur; &ldquo;he
      was quite interesting on the subject of young German working men. It seems
      they tramp from place to place to learn their trades. What nationality was
      he, may I ask?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dennant, of whom he asked this question, lifted his brows, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Shelton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half Dutch, half French.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very interesting breed; I hope I shall see him again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Thea suddenly; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      gone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton saw that their good breeding alone prevented all from adding,
      &ldquo;And thank goodness, too!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone? Dear me, it&rsquo;s very&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Dennant, &ldquo;very sudden.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Algie,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Dennant, &ldquo;it &lsquo;s quite
      a charmin&rsquo; letter. Must have taken the poor young man an hour to
      write.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo; cried Antonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Shelton felt his face go crimson. He had suddenly remembered that her
      French was better than her mother&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to have had a singular experience,&rdquo; said the
      Connoisseur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; echoed Mr. Dennant; &ldquo;he &lsquo;s had some
      singular experience. If you want to know the details, ask friend Shelton;
      it&rsquo;s quite romantic. In the meantime, my dear; another cup?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Connoisseur, never quite devoid of absent-minded malice, spurred his
      curiosity to a further effort; and, turning his well-defended eyes on
      Shelton, murmured,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Shelton, you are the historian, it seems.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no history,&rdquo; said Shelton, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s very dull,&rdquo; remarked the Connoisseur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Dick,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dennant, &ldquo;that was really a
      most touchin&rsquo; story about his goin&rsquo; without food in Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton shot another look at Antonia; her face was frigid. &ldquo;I hate
      your d&mdash;-d superiority!&rdquo; he thought, staring at the
      Connoisseur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said that gentleman, &ldquo;more
      enthralling than starvation. Come, Mr Shelton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell stories,&rdquo; said Shelton; &ldquo;never
      could.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He cared not a straw for Ferrand, his coming, going, or his history; for,
      looking at Antonia, his heart was heavy.

      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE LADY FROM BEYOND
    </h3>
    <p>
      The morning was sultry, brooding, steamy. Antonia was at her music, and
      from the room where Shelton tried to fix attention on a book he could hear
      her practising her scales with a cold fury that cast an added gloom upon
      his spirit. He did not see her until lunch, and then she again sat next
      the Connoisseur. Her cheeks were pale, but there was something feverish in
      her chatter to her neighbour; she still refused to look at Shelton. He
      felt very miserable. After lunch, when most of them had left the table,
      the rest fell to discussing country neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dennant, &ldquo;there are the Foliots;
      but nobody calls on them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Connoisseur, &ldquo;the Foliots&mdash;the
      Foliots&mdash;the people&mdash;er&mdash;who&mdash;quite so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really distressin&rsquo;. she looks so sweet ridin&rsquo;
      about. Many people with worse stories get called on,&rdquo; continued Mrs.
      Dennant, with that large frankness of intrusion upon doubtful subjects
      which may be made by certain people in a certain way, &ldquo;but, after
      all, one couldn&rsquo;t ask them to meet anybody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Connoisseur assented. &ldquo;I used to know Foliot.
      Thousand pities. They say she was a very pretty woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not pretty!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dennant! &ldquo;more interestin
      than pretty, I should say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton, who knew the lady slightly, noticed that they spoke of her as in
      the past. He did not look towards Antonia; for, though a little troubled
      at her presence while such a subject was discussed, he hated his
      conviction that her face, was as unruffled as though the Foliots had been
      a separate species. There was, in fact, a curiosity about her eyes, a
      faint impatience on her lips; she was rolling little crumbs of bread.
      Suddenly yawning, she muttered some remark, and rose. Shelton stopped her
      at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a walk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May n&rsquo;t I come?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m going to take Toddles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton held the door open, and went back to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Connoisseur said, sipping at his sherry, &ldquo;I
      &lsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s all over with young Foliot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a pity!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Dennant, and her kindly face
      looked quite disturbed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known him ever since he was a
      boy. Of course, I think he made a great mistake to bring her down here.
      Not even bein&rsquo; able to get married makes it doubly awkward. Oh, I
      think he made a great mistake!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Connoisseur, &ldquo;but d&rsquo; you suppose
      that makes much difference? Even if What &lsquo;s&mdash;his-name gave her
      a divorce, I don&rsquo;t think, don&rsquo;t you know, that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it does! So many people would be inclined to look over it in
      time. But as it is it&rsquo;s hopeless, quite. So very awkward for people,
      too, meetin&rsquo; them about. The Telfords and the Butterwicks&mdash;by
      the way, they&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; here to dine to-night&mdash;live near
      them, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever meet her before-er-before the flood?&rdquo; the
      Connoisseur inquired; and his lips parting and unexpectedly revealing
      teeth gave him a shadowy resemblance to a goat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I did meet her once at the Branksomes&rsquo;. I thought her
      quite a charmin&rsquo; person.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said the Connoisseur; &ldquo;they tell me he
      was going to take the hounds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there are his delightful coverts, too. Algie often used to
      shoot there, and now they say he just has his brother down to shoot with
      him. It&rsquo;s really quite too melancholy! Did you know him, Dick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foliot?&rdquo; replied Shelton absently. &ldquo;No; I never met
      him: I&rsquo;ve seen her once or twice at Ascot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the window he could see Antonia in her scarlet Tam-o&rsquo;-shanter,
      swinging her stick, and he got up feigning unconcern. Just then Toddles
      came bounding up against his sister. They went off arm in arm. She had
      seen him at the window, yet she gave no friendly glance; Shelton felt more
      miserable than ever. He stepped out upon the drive. There was a lurid,
      gloomy canopy above; the elm-trees drooped their heavy blackish green, the
      wonted rustle of the aspen-tree was gone, even the rooks were silent. A
      store of force lay heavy on the heart of nature. He started pacing slowly
      up and down, his pride forbidding him to follow her, and presently sat
      down on an old stone seat that faced the road. He stayed a long time
      staring at the elms, asking himself what he had done and what he ought to
      do. And somehow he was frightened. A sense of loneliness was on him, so
      real, so painful, that he shivered in the sweltering heat. He was there,
      perhaps, an hour, alone, and saw nobody pass along the road. Then came the
      sound of horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and at the same time he heard a motor-car
      approaching from the opposite direction. The rider made appearance first,
      riding a grey horse with an Arab&rsquo;s high set head and tail. She was
      holding him with difficulty, for the whirr of the approaching car grew
      every moment louder. Shelton rose; the car flashed by. He saw the horse
      stagger in the gate-way, crushing its rider up against the gatepost.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran, but before he reached the gate the lady was on foot, holding the
      plunging horse&rsquo;s bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; cried Shelton breathlessly, and he, too,
      grabbed the bridle. &ldquo;Those beastly cars!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t; he
      won&rsquo;t let strangers touch him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton let go, and watched her coax the horse. She was rather tall,
      dressed in a grey habit, with a grey Russian cap upon her head, and he
      suddenly recognised the Mrs. Foliot whom they had been talking of at
      lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &lsquo;ll be quiet now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you would n&rsquo;t
      mind holding him a minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave the reins to him, and leaned against the gate. She was very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope he has n&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; Shelton said. He was
      quite close to her, well able to see her face&mdash;a curious face with
      high cheek-bones and a flatfish moulding, enigmatic, yet strangely
      passionate for all its listless pallor. Her smiling, tightened lips were
      pallid; pallid, too, her grey and deep-set eyes with greenish tints; above
      all, pale the ashy mass of hair coiled under her grey cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th-thanks!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I shall be all right directly. I&rsquo;m
      sorry to have made a fuss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She bit her lips and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re hurt; do let me go for&mdash;&rdquo;
      stammered Shelton. &ldquo;I can easily get help.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; she said, with a stony little laugh; &ldquo;oh, no,
      thanks!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She left the gate, and crossed the road to where he held the horse.
      Shelton, to conceal embarrassment, looked at the horse&rsquo;s legs, and
      noticed that the grey was resting one of them. He ran his hand down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your horse has knocked
      his off knee; it&rsquo;s swelling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re both cripples.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be lame when he gets cold. Would n&rsquo;t you like to
      put him in the stable here? I &lsquo;m sure you ought to drive home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks; if I &lsquo;m able to ride him he can carry me. Give me
      a hand up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice sounded as though something had offended her. Rising from
      inspection of the horse&rsquo;s leg, Shelton saw Antonia and Toddles
      standing by. They had come through a wicketgate leading from the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter ran up to him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We saw it,&rdquo; he whispered&mdash;&ldquo;jolly smash-up. Can&rsquo;t
      I help?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold his bridle,&rdquo; answered Shelton, and he looked from one
      lady to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are moments when the expression of a face fixes itself with painful
      clearness; to Shelton this was such a moment. Those two faces close
      together, under their coverings of scarlet and of grey, showed a contrast
      almost cruelly vivid. Antonia was flushed, her eyes had grown deep blue;
      her look of startled doubt had passed and left a question in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to come in and wait? We could send you home, in the
      brougham,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady called Mrs. Foliot stood, one arm across the crupper of her
      saddle, biting her lips and smiling still her enigmatic smile, and it was
      her face that stayed most vividly on Shelton&rsquo;s mind, its ashy hail,
      its pallor, and fixed, scornful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, thanks! You&rsquo;re very kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of Antonia&rsquo;s face the timid, doubting friendliness had fled, and
      was replaced by enmity. With a long, cold look at both of them she turned
      away. Mrs. Foliot gave a little laugh, and raised her foot for Shelton&rsquo;s
      help. He heard a hiss of pain as he swung her up, but when he looked at
      her she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he said impatiently, &ldquo;let me come and see you
      don&rsquo;t break down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;It &lsquo;s only two miles. I&rsquo;m not made
      of sugar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall simply have to follow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders, fixing her resolute eyes on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that boy like to come?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toddles left the horse&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Would n&rsquo;t I just!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think that will be best. You
      &lsquo;ve been so kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She bowed, smiled inscrutably once more, touched the Arab with her whip,
      and started, Toddles trotting at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton was left with Antonia underneath the elms. A sudden puff of tepid
      air blew in their faces, like a warning message from the heavy, purple
      heat clouds; low rumbling thunder travelled slowly from afar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a storm,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonia nodded. She was pale now, and her face still wore its cold look of
      offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve got a headache,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shall go in
      and lie down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton tried to speak, but something kept him silent&mdash;submission to
      what was coming, like the mute submission of the fields and birds to the
      menace of the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her go, and went back to his seat. And the silence seemed to
      grow; the flowers ceased to exude their fragrance, numbed by the weighty
      air. All the long house behind him seemed asleep, deserted. No noise came
      forth, no laughter, the echo of no music, the ringing of no bell; the heat
      had wrapped it round with drowsiness. And the silence added to the
      solitude within him. What an unlucky chance, that woman&rsquo;s accident!
      Designed by Providence to put Antonia further from him than before! Why
      was not the world composed of the immaculate alone? He started pacing up
      and down, tortured by a dreadful heartache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must get rid of this,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll go
      for a good tramp, and chance the storm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the drive he ran on Toddles, returning in the highest spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw her home,&rdquo; he crowed. &ldquo;I say, what a ripper, isn&rsquo;t
      she? She &lsquo;ll be as lame as a tree to-morrow; so will the gee. Jolly
      hot!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This meeting showed Shelton that he had been an hour on the stone seat; he
      had thought it some ten minutes, and the discovery alarmed him. It seemed
      to bring the import of his miserable fear right home to him. He started
      with a swinging stride, keeping his eyes fixed on the road, the
      perspiration streaming down his face.

      CHAPTER XXXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE STORM
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was seven and more when Shelton returned, from his walk; a few heat
      drops had splashed the leaves, but the storm had not yet broken. In
      brooding silence the world seemed pent beneath the purple firmament.
    </p>
    <p>
      By rapid walking in the heat Shelton had got rid of his despondency. He
      felt like one who is to see his mistress after long estrangement. He,
      bathed, and, straightening his tie-ends, stood smiling at the glass. His
      fear, unhappiness, and doubts seemed like an evil dream; how much worse
      off would he not have been, had it all been true?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dinner-party night, and when he reached the drawing-room the guests
      were there already, chattering of the coming storm. Antonia was not yet
      down, and Shelton stood by the piano waiting for her entry. Red faces,
      spotless shirt-fronts, white arms; and freshly-twisted hair were all
      around him. Some one handed him a clove carnation, and, as he held it to
      his nose, Antonia came in, breathless, as though she had rushed
      down-stairs, Her cheeks were pale no longer; her hand kept stealing to her
      throat. The flames of the coming storm seemed to have caught fire within
      her, to be scorching her in her white frock; she passed him close, and her
      fragrance whipped his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never seemed to him so lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never again will Shelton breathe the perfume of melons and pineapples
      without a strange emotion. From where he sat at dinner he could not see
      Antonia, but amidst the chattering of voices, the clink of glass and
      silver, the sights and sounds and scents of feasting, he thought how he
      would go to her and say that nothing mattered but her love. He drank the
      frosted, pale-gold liquid of champagne as if it had been water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows stood wide open in the heat; the garden lay in thick, soft
      shadow, where the pitchy shapes of trees could be discerned. There was not
      a breath of air to fan the candle-flames above the flowers; but two large
      moths, fearful of the heavy dark, flew in and wheeled between the lights
      over the diners&rsquo; heads. One fell scorched into a dish of fruit, and
      was removed; the other, eluding all the swish of napkins and the efforts
      of the footmen, continued to make soft, fluttering rushes till Shelton
      rose and caught it in his hand. He took it to the window and threw it out
      into the darkness, and he noticed that the air was thick and tepid to his
      face. At a sign from Mr. Dennant the muslin curtains were then drawn
      across the windows, and in gratitude, perhaps, for this protection, this
      filmy barrier between them and the muffled threats of Nature, everyone
      broke out in talk. It was such a night as comes in summer after perfect
      weather, frightening in its heat, and silence, which was broken by the
      distant thunder travelling low along the ground like the muttering of all
      dark places on the earth&mdash;such a night as seems, by very
      breathlessness, to smother life, and with its fateful threats to justify
      man&rsquo;s cowardice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies rose at last. The circle of the rosewood dining-table, which
      had no cloth, strewn with flowers and silver gilt, had a likeness to some
      autumn pool whose brown depths of oily water gleam under the sunset with
      red and yellow leaves; above it the smoke of cigarettes was clinging, like
      a mist to water when the sun goes down. Shelton became involved in
      argument with his neighbour on the English character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In England we&rsquo;ve mislaid the recipe of life,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Pleasure&rsquo;s a lost art. We don&rsquo;t get drunk, we&rsquo;re
      ashamed of love, and as to beauty, we&rsquo;ve lost the eye for&rsquo; it.
      In exchange we have got money, but what &lsquo;s the good of money when we
      don&rsquo;t know how to spend it?&rdquo; Excited by his neighbour&rsquo;s
      smile, he added: &ldquo;As to thought, we think so much of what our
      neighbours think that we never think at all.... Have you ever watched a
      foreigner when he&rsquo;s listening to an Englishman? We &lsquo;re in the
      habit of despising foreigners; the scorn we have for them is nothing to
      the scorn they have for us. And they are right! Look at our taste! What is
      the good of owning riches if we don&rsquo;t know how to use them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather new to me,&rdquo; his neighbour said. &ldquo;There
      may be something in it.... Did you see that case in the papers the other
      day of old Hornblower, who left the 1820 port that fetched a guinea a
      bottle? When the purchaser&mdash;poor feller!&mdash;came to drink it he
      found eleven bottles out of twelve completely ullaged&mdash;ha! ha! Well,
      there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with this&rdquo;; and he drained his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they rose to join the ladies, he slipped out on the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once he was enveloped in a bath of heat. A heavy odour, sensual,
      sinister, was in the air, as from a sudden flowering of amorous shrubs. He
      stood and drank it in with greedy nostrils. Putting his hand down, he felt
      the grass; it was dry, and charged with electricity. Then he saw, pale and
      candescent in the blackness, three or four great lilies, the authors of
      that perfume. The blossoms seemed to be rising at him through the
      darkness; as though putting up their faces to be kissed. He straightened
      himself abruptly and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests were leaving when Shelton, who was watching; saw Antonia slip
      through the drawing-room window. He could follow the white glimmer of her
      frock across the lawn, but lost it in the shadow of the trees; casting a
      hasty look to see that he was not observed, he too slipped out. The
      blackness and the heat were stifling he took great breaths of it as if it
      were the purest mountain air, and, treading softly on the grass, stole on
      towards the holm oak. His lips were dry, his heart beat painfully. The
      mutter of the distant thunder had quite ceased; waves of hot air came
      wheeling in his face, and in their midst a sudden rush of cold. He
      thought, &ldquo;The storm is coming now!&rdquo; and stole on towards the
      tree. She was lying in the hammock, her figure a white blur in, the heart
      of the tree&rsquo;s shadow, rocking gently to a little creaking of the
      branch. Shelton held his breath; she had not heard him. He crept up close
      behind the trunk till he stood in touch of her. &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t
      startle her,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Antonia!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a faint stir in the hammock, but no answer. He stood over her,
      but even then he could not see her face; he only, had a sense of something
      breathing and alive within a yard of him&mdash;of something warm and soft.
      He whispered again, &ldquo;Antonia!&rdquo; but again there came no answer,
      and a sort of fear and frenzy seized on him. He could no longer hear her
      breathe; the creaking of the branch had ceased. What was passing in that
      silent, living creature there so close? And then he heard again the sound
      of breathing, quick and scared, like the fluttering of a bird; in a moment
      he was staring in the dark at an empty hammock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed beside the empty hammock till he could bear uncertainty no
      longer. But as he crossed the lawn the sky was rent from end to end by
      jagged lightning, rain spattered him from head to foot, and with a
      deafening crack the thunder broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought the smoking-room, but, recoiling at the door, went to his own
      room, and threw himself down on the bed. The thunder groaned and sputtered
      in long volleys; the lightning showed him the shapes of things within the
      room, with a weird distinctness that rent from them all likeness to the
      purpose they were made for, bereaved them of utility, of their
      matter-of-factness, presented them as skeletons, abstractions, with
      indecency in their appearance, like the naked nerves and sinews of a leg
      preserved in, spirit. The sound of the rain against the house stunned his
      power of thinking, he rose to shut his windows; then, returning to his
      bed, threw himself down again. He stayed there till the storm was over, in
      a kind of stupor; but when the boom of the retreating thunder grew every
      minute less distinct, he rose. Then for the first time he saw something
      white close by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a note:
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made a mistake. Please forgive me, and go away.&mdash;ANTONIA.

      CHAPTER XXXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WILDERNESS
    </h3>
    <p>
      When he had read this note, Shelton put it down beside his sleeve-links on
      his dressing table, stared in the mirror at himself, and laughed. But his
      lips soon stopped him laughing; he threw himself upon his bed and pressed
      his face into the pillows. He lay there half-dressed throughout the night,
      and when he rose, soon after dawn, he had not made his mind up what to do.
      The only thing he knew for certain was that he must not meet Antonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he penned the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had a sleepless night with toothache, and think it best to run up
      to the dentist at once. If a tooth must come out, the sooner the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      He addressed it to Mrs. Dennant, and left it on his table. After doing
      this he threw himself once more upon his bed, and this time fell into a
      doze.
    </p>
    <p>
      He woke with a start, dressed, and let himself quietly out. The likeness
      of his going to that of Ferrand struck him. &ldquo;Both outcasts now,&rdquo;
      he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tramped on till noon without knowing or caring where he went; then,
      entering a field, threw himself down under the hedge, and fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was awakened by a whirr. A covey of partridges, with wings glistening
      in the sun, were straggling out across the adjoining field of mustard.
      They soon settled in the old-maidish way of partridges, and began to call
      upon each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some cattle had approached him in his sleep, and a beautiful bay cow, with
      her head turned sideways, was snuffing at him gently, exhaling her
      peculiar sweetness. She was as fine in legs and coat as any race-horse.
      She dribbled at the corners of her black, moist lips; her eye was soft and
      cynical. Breathing the vague sweetness of the mustard-field, rubbing dry
      grasp-stalks in his fingers, Shelton had a moment&rsquo;s happiness&mdash;the
      happiness of sun and sky, of the eternal quiet, and untold movements of
      the fields. Why could not human beings let their troubles be as this cow
      left the flies that clung about her eyes? He dozed again, and woke up with
      a laugh, for this was what he dreamed:
    </p>
    <p>
      He fancied he was in a room, at once the hall and drawing-room of some
      country house. In the centre of this room a lady stood, who was looking in
      a hand-glass at her face. Beyond a door or window could be seen a garden
      with a row of statues, and through this door people passed without
      apparent object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Shelton saw his mother advancing to the lady with the hand-glass,
      whom now he recognised as Mrs. Foliot. But, as he looked, his mother
      changed to Mrs. Dennant, and began speaking in a voice that was a sort of
      abstract of refinement. &ldquo;Je fais de la philosophic,&rdquo; it said;
      &ldquo;I take the individual for what she&rsquo;s worth. I do not condemn;
      above all, one must have spirit!&rdquo; The lady with the mirror continued
      looking in the glass; and, though he could not see her face, he could see
      its image-pale, with greenish eyes, and a smile like scorn itself. Then,
      by a swift transition, he was walking in the garden talking to Mrs.
      Dennant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was from this talk that he awoke with laughter. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she
      had been saying, &ldquo;Dick, I&rsquo;ve always been accustomed to believe
      what I was told. It was so unkind of her to scorn me just because I happen
      to be second-hand.&rdquo; And her voice awakened Shelton&rsquo;s pity; it
      was like a frightened child&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I
      shall do if I have to form opinions for myself. I was n&rsquo;t brought up
      to it. I &lsquo;ve always had them nice and secondhand. How am I to go to
      work? One must believe what other people do; not that I think much of
      other people, but, you do know what it is&mdash;one feels so much more
      comfortable,&rdquo; and her skirts rustled. &ldquo;But, Dick, whatever
      happens&rdquo;&mdash;her voice entreated&mdash;&ldquo;do let Antonia get
      her judgments secondhand. Never mind for me&mdash;if I must form opinions
      for myself, I must&mdash;but don&rsquo;t let her; any old opinions so long
      as they are old. It &lsquo;s dreadful to have to think out new ones for
      oneself.&rdquo; And he awoke. His dream had had in it the element called
      Art, for, in its gross absurdity, Mrs. Dennant had said things that showed
      her soul more fully than anything she would have said in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said a voice quite close, behind the hedge, &ldquo;not
      many Frenchmen, thank the Lord! A few coveys of Hungarians over from the
      Duke&rsquo;s. Sir James, some pie?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton raised himself with drowsy curiosity&mdash;still half asleep&mdash;and
      applied his face to a gap in the high, thick osiers of the hedge. Four men
      were seated on camp-stools round a folding-table, on which was a pie and
      other things to eat. A game-cart, well-adorned with birds and hares, stood
      at a short distance; the tails of some dogs were seen moving humbly, and a
      valet opening bottles. Shelton had forgotten that it was &ldquo;the first.&rdquo;
      The host was a soldierly and freckled man; an older man sat next him,
      square-jawed, with an absent-looking eye and sharpened nose; next him,
      again, there was a bearded person whom they seemed to call the Commodore;
      in the fourth, to his alarm, Shelton recognised the gentleman called
      Mabbey. It was really no matter for surprise to meet him miles from his
      own place, for he was one of those who wander with a valet and two guns
      from the twelfth of August to the end of January, and are then supposed to
      go to Monte Carlo or to sleep until the twelfth of August comes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear what a bag we made on the twelfth, Sir James?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes; what was that? Have you sold your bay horse, Glennie?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton had not decided whether or no to sneak away, when the Commodore&rsquo;s
      thick voice began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My man tellsh me that Mrs. Foliot&mdash;haw&mdash;has lamed her
      Arab. Does she mean to come out cubbing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton observed the smile that came on all their faces. &ldquo;Foliot
      &lsquo;s paying for his good time now; what a donkey to get caught!&rdquo;
      it seemed to say. He turned his back and shut his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cubbing?&rdquo; replied Glennie; &ldquo;hardly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never could shee anything wonderful in her looks,&rdquo; went on
      the Commodore; &ldquo;so quiet, you never knew that she was in the room. I
      remember sayin&rsquo; to her once, &lsquo;Mrs. Lutheran, now what do you
      like besht in all the world?&rsquo; and what do you think she answered?
      &lsquo;Music!&rsquo; Haw!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Mabbey said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was always a dark horse, Foliot: It &lsquo;s always the dark
      horses that get let in for this kind of thing&rdquo;; and there was a
      sound as though he licked his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say,&rdquo; said the voice of the host, &ldquo;he never gives
      you back a greeting now. Queer fish; they say that she&rsquo;s devoted to
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming so closely on his meeting with this lady, and on the dream from
      which he had awakened, this conversation mesmerised the listener behind
      the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he gives up his huntin&rsquo; and his shootin&rsquo;, I don&rsquo;t
      see what the deuce he &lsquo;ll do; he&rsquo;s resigned his clubs; as to
      his chance of Parliament&mdash;&rdquo; said the voice of Mabbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thousand pities,&rdquo; said Sir James; &ldquo;still, he knew what
      to expect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very queer fellows, those Foliots,&rdquo; said the Commodore.
      &ldquo;There was his father: he &lsquo;d always rather talk to any
      scarecrow he came across than to you or me. Wonder what he&rsquo;ll do
      with all his horses; I should like that chestnut of his.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell what a fellow &lsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said the
      voice of Mabbey&mdash;&ldquo;take to drink or writin&rsquo; books. Old
      Charlie Wayne came to gazin&rsquo; at stars, and twice a week he used to
      go and paddle round in Whitechapel, teachin&rsquo; pothooks&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glennie,&rdquo; said Sir James, &ldquo;what &lsquo;s become of
      Smollett, your old keeper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obliged to get rid of him.&rdquo; Shelton tried again to close his
      ears, but again he listened. &ldquo;Getting a bit too old; lost me a lot
      of eggs last season.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Commodore, &ldquo;when they oncesh begin to
      lose eggsh&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact, his son&mdash;you remember him, Sir James, he
      used to load for you?&mdash;got a girl into trouble; when her people gave
      her the chuck old Smollet took her in; beastly scandal it made, too. The
      girl refused to marry Smollett, and old Smollett backed her up. Naturally,
      the parson and the village cut up rough; my wife offered to get her into
      one of those reformatory what-d&rsquo; you-call-&rsquo;.ms, but the old
      fellow said she should n&rsquo;t go if she did n&rsquo;t want to. Bad
      business altogether; put him quite off his stroke. I only got five hundred
      pheasants last year instead of eight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. Shelton again peeped through the hedge. All were
      eating pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Warwickshire,&rdquo; said the Commodore, &ldquo;they always
      marry&mdash;haw&mdash;and live reshpectable ever after.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; remarked the host; &ldquo;it was a bit too thick,
      her refusing to marry him. She said he took advantage of her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sorry by this time,&rdquo; said Sir James; &ldquo;lucky
      escape for young Smollett. Queer, the obstinacy of some of these old
      fellows!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we doing after lunch?&rdquo; asked the Commodore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next field,&rdquo; said the host, &ldquo;is pasture. We line up
      along the hedge, and drive that mustard towards the roots; there ought to
      be a good few birds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shelton rose, and, crouching, stole softly to the gate:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the twelfth, shootin&rsquo; in two parties,&rdquo; followed the
      voice of Mabbey from the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether from his walk or from his sleepless night, Shelton seemed to ache
      in every limb; but he continued his tramp along the road. He was no nearer
      to deciding what to do. It was late in the afternoon when he reached
      Maidenhead, and, after breaking fast, got into a London train and went to
      sleep. At ten o&rsquo;clock that evening he walked into St. James&rsquo;s
      Park and there sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamplight dappled through the tired foliage on to these benches which
      have rested many vagrants. Darkness has ceased to be the lawful cloak of
      the unhappy; but Mother Night was soft and moonless, and man had not
      despoiled her of her comfort, quite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton was not alone upon the seat, for at the far end was sitting a
      young girl with a red, round, sullen face; and beyond, and further still,
      were dim benches and dim figures sitting on them, as though life&rsquo;s
      institutions had shot them out in an endless line of rubbish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought Shelton, in the dreamy way of tired people;
      &ldquo;the institutions are all right; it&rsquo;s the spirit that&rsquo;s
      all&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong?&rdquo; said a voice behind him; &ldquo;why, of course! You&rsquo;ve
      taken the wrong turn, old man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw a policeman, with a red face shining through the darkness, talking
      to a strange old figure like some aged and dishevelled bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, constable,&rdquo; the old man said, &ldquo;as I&rsquo;ve
      come wrong I&rsquo;ll take a rest.&rdquo; Chewing his gums, he seemed to
      fear to take the liberty of sitting down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton made room, and the old fellow took the vacant place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; he said in
      shaky tones, and snatching at his battered hat; &ldquo;I see you was a
      gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;and lovingly he dwelt upon the word&mdash;&ldquo;would
      n&rsquo;t disturb you for the world. I&rsquo;m not used to being out at
      night, and the seats do get so full. Old age must lean on something; you&rsquo;ll
      excuse me, sir, I &lsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Shelton gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a respectable old man, really,&rdquo; said his neighbour;
      &ldquo;I never took a liberty in my life. But at my age, sir, you get
      nervous; standin&rsquo; about the streets as I been this last week, an&rsquo;
      sleepin&rsquo; in them doss-houses&mdash;Oh, they&rsquo;re dreadful rough
      places&mdash;a dreadful rough lot there! Yes,&rdquo; the old man said
      again, as Shelton turned to look at him, struck by the real self-pity in
      his voice, &ldquo;dreadful rough places!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A movement of his head, which grew on a lean, plucked neck like that of an
      old fowl, had brought his face into the light. It was long, and run to
      seed, and had a large, red nose; its thin, colourless lips were twisted
      sideways and apart, showing his semi-toothless mouth; and his eyes had
      that aged look of eyes in which all colour runs into a thin rim round the
      iris; and over them kept coming films like the films over parrots&rsquo;
      eyes. He was, or should have been, clean-shaven. His hair&mdash;for he had
      taken off his hat was thick and lank, of dusty colour, as far as could be
      seen, without a speck of grey, and parted very beautifully just about the
      middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can put up with that,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;I never
      interferes with nobody, and nobody don&rsquo;t interfere with me; but what
      frightens me&rdquo;&mdash;his voice grew steady, as if too terrified to
      shake, &ldquo;is never knowin&rsquo; day to day what &lsquo;s to become of
      yer. Oh, that &lsquo;a dreadful, that is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; answered Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is,&rdquo; the old man said; &ldquo;and the winter cumin&rsquo;
      on. I never was much used to open air, bein&rsquo; in domestic service all
      my life; but I don&rsquo;t mind that so long as I can see my way to earn a
      livin&rsquo;. Well, thank God! I&rsquo;ve got a job at last&rdquo;; and
      his voice grew cheerful suddenly. &ldquo;Sellin&rsquo; papers is not what
      I been accustomed to; but the Westminister, they tell me that&rsquo;s one
      of the most respectable of the evenin&rsquo; papers&mdash;in fact, I know
      it is. So now I&rsquo;m sure to get on; I try hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get the job?&rdquo; asked Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve got my character,&rdquo; the old fellow said, making a
      gesture with a skinny hand towards his chest, as if it were there he kept
      his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, nobody can&rsquo;t take that away! I never parts from
      that&rdquo;; and fumbling, he produced a packet, holding first one paper
      to the light, and then another, and he looked anxiously at Shelton.
      &ldquo;In that house where I been sleepin&rsquo; they&rsquo;re not honest;
      they &lsquo;ve stolen a parcel of my things&mdash;a lovely shirt an&rsquo;
      a pair of beautiful gloves a gentleman gave me for holdin&rsquo; of his
      horse. Now, would n&rsquo;t you prosecute &lsquo;em, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on what you can prove.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know they had &lsquo;em. A man must stand up for his rights; that&rsquo;s
      only proper. I can&rsquo;t afford to lose beautiful things like them. I
      think I ought to prosecute, now, don&rsquo;t you, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton restrained a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said the old man, smoothing out a piece of paper
      shakily, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Sir George!&rdquo; and his withered
      finger-tips trembled on the middle of the page: &lsquo;Joshua Creed, in my
      service five years as butler, during which time I have found him all that
      a servant should be.&rsquo; And this &lsquo;ere&rsquo;&mdash;he fumbled
      with another&mdash;&ldquo;this &lsquo;ere &lsquo;s Lady Glengow: &lsquo;Joshua
      Creed&mdash;&rsquo; I thought I&rsquo;d like you to read &lsquo;em since
      you&rsquo;ve been so kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have a pipe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank ye, sir,&rdquo; replied the aged butler, filling his clay
      from Shelton&rsquo;s pouch; then, taking a front tooth between his finger
      and his thumb, he began to feel it tenderly, working it to and fro with a
      sort of melancholy pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My teeth&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo; out,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I
      enjoys pretty good health for a man of my age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy-two! Barrin&rsquo; my cough, and my rupture, and this
      &lsquo;ere affliction&rdquo;&mdash;he passed his hand over his face&mdash;&ldquo;I
      &lsquo;ve nothing to complain of; everybody has somethink, it seems. I&rsquo;m
      a wonder for my age, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton, for all his pity, would have given much to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy-two!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;yes, a great age. You remember
      the country when it was very different to what it is now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the old butler, &ldquo;there was gentry then; I
      remember them drivin&rsquo; down to Newmarket (my native place, sir) with
      their own horses. There was n&rsquo;t so much o&rsquo; these here middle
      classes then. There was more, too, what you might call the milk o&rsquo;
      human kindness in people then&mdash;none o&rsquo; them amalgamated stores,
      every man keepin&rsquo; his own little shop; not so eager to cut his
      neighbour&rsquo;s throat, as you might say. And then look at the price of
      bread! O dear! why, it is n&rsquo;t a quarter what it was!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are people happier now than they were then?&rdquo; asked
      Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old butler sucked his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, shaking his old head; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve
      lost the contented spirit. I see people runnin&rsquo; here and runnin&rsquo;
      there, readin&rsquo; books, findin&rsquo; things out; they ain&rsquo;t not
      so self-contented as they were.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that possible?&rdquo; thought Shelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; repeated the old man, again sucking at his pipe, and
      this time blowing out a lot of smoke; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see as much
      happiness about, not the same look on the faces. &lsquo;T isn&rsquo;t
      likely. See these &lsquo;ere motorcars, too; they say &lsquo;orses is goin&rsquo;
      out&rdquo;; and, as if dumbfounded at his own conclusion, he sat silent
      for some time, engaged in the lighting and relighting of his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl at the far end stirred, cleared her throat, and settled down
      again; her movement disengaged a scent of frowsy clothes. The policeman
      had approached and scrutinised these ill-assorted faces; his glance was
      jovially contemptuous till he noticed Shelton, and then was modified by
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s good men in the police,&rdquo; the aged butler said,
      when the policeman had passed on&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s good men in
      the police, as good men as you can see, and there &lsquo;s them that
      treats you like the dirt&mdash;a dreadful low class of man. Oh dear, yes!
      when they see you down in the world, they think they can speak to you as
      they like; I don&rsquo;t give them no chance to worry me; I keeps myself
      to myself, and speak civil to all the world. You have to hold the candle
      to them; for, oh dear! if they &lsquo;re crossed&mdash;some of them&mdash;they
      &lsquo;re a dreadful unscrup&rsquo;lous lot of men!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to spend the night here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice and warm to-night,&rdquo; replied the aged butler.
      &ldquo;I said to the man at that low place I said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      ever speak to me again,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you come near
      me!&rsquo; Straightforward and honest &lsquo;s been my motto all my life;
      I don&rsquo;t want to have nothing to say to them low fellows&rdquo;&mdash;he
      made an annihilating gesture&mdash;&ldquo;after the way they treated me,
      takin&rsquo; my things like that. Tomorrow I shall get a room for three
      shillin&rsquo;s a week, don&rsquo;t you think so, sir? Well, then I shall
      be all right. I &lsquo;m not afraid now; the mind at rest. So long as I
      ran keep myself, that&rsquo;s all I want. I shall do first-rate, I think&rdquo;;
      and he stared at Shelton, but the look in his eyes and the half-scared
      optimism of his voice convinced the latter that he lived in dread. &ldquo;So
      long as I can keep myself,&rdquo; he said again, &ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;.
      need no workhouse nor lose respectability.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; thought Shelton; and for some time sat without a word.
      &ldquo;When you can;&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;come and see me; here&rsquo;s
      my card.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The aged butler became conscious with a jerk, for he was nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank ye, sir; I will,&rdquo; he said, with pitiful alacrity.
      &ldquo;Down by Belgravia? Oh, I know it well; I lived down in them parts
      with a gentleman of the name of Bateson&mdash;perhaps you knew him; he
      &lsquo;s dead now&mdash;the Honourable Bateson. Thank ye, sir; I&rsquo;ll
      be sure to come&rdquo;; and, snatching at his battered hat, he toilsomely
      secreted Shelton&rsquo;s card amongst his character. A minute later he
      began again to nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman passed a second time; his gaze seemed to say, &ldquo;Now,
      what&rsquo;s a toff doing on that seat with those two rotters?&rdquo; And
      Shelton caught his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;exactly! You don&rsquo;t know what to
      make of me&mdash;a man of my position sitting here! Poor devil! to spend
      your days in spying on your fellow-creatures! Poor devil! But you don&rsquo;t
      know that you &lsquo;re a poor devil, and so you &lsquo;re not one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man on the next bench sneezed&mdash;a shrill and disapproving sneeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman passed again, and, seeing that the lower creatures were both
      dozing, he spoke to Shelton:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very safe on these &lsquo;ere benches, sir,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;you never know who you may be sittin&rsquo; next to. If I were you,
      sir, I should be gettin&rsquo; on&mdash;if you &lsquo;re not goin&rsquo;
      to spend the night here, that is&rdquo;; and he laughed, as at an
      admirable joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton looked at him, and itched to say, &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
      but it struck him that it would sound very odd. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he
      thought, &ldquo;I shall only catch a cold&rdquo;; and, without speaking,
      he left the seat, and went along towards his rooms.

    <h3>
      THE END
    </h3>
    <p>
      He reached his rooms at midnight so exhausted that, without waiting to
      light up, he dropped into a chair. The curtains and blinds had been
      removed for cleaning, and the tall windows admitted the night&rsquo;s
      staring gaze. Shelton fixed his eyes on that outside darkness, as one lost
      man might fix his eyes upon another.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unaired, dusty odour clung about the room, but, like some God-sent
      whiff of grass or flowers wafted to one sometimes in the streets, a
      perfume came to him, the spice from the withered clove carnation still
      clinging, to his button-hole; and he suddenly awoke from his queer trance.
      There was a decision to be made. He rose to light a candle; the dust was
      thick on everything he touched. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;how
      wretched!&rdquo; and the loneliness that had seized him on the stone seat
      at Holm Oaks the day before returned with fearful force.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his table, heaped without order, were a pile of bills and circulars. He
      opened them, tearing at their covers with the random haste of men back
      from their holidays. A single long envelope was placed apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR DICK [he read],
    </p>
    <p>
      I enclose you herewith the revised draft of your marriage settlement. It
      is now shipshape. Return it before the end of the week, and I will have it
      engrossed for signature. I go to Scotland next Wednesday for a month;
      shall be back in good time for your wedding. My love to your mother when
      you see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your-affectionate uncle,
    </p>
    <p>
      EDMUND PARAMOR.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelton smiled and took out the draft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Indenture made the &mdash; day of 190-, between Richard
      Paramor Shelton&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put it down and sank back in his chair, the chair in which the foreign
      vagrant had been wont to sit on mornings when he came to preach
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not stay there long, but in sheer unhappiness got up, and, taking
      his candle, roamed about the room, fingering things, and gazing in the
      mirror at his face, which seemed to him repulsive in its wretchedness. He
      went at last into the hall and opened the door, to go downstairs again
      into the street; but the sudden certainty that, in street or house, in
      town or country, he would have to take his trouble with him, made him shut
      it to. He felt in the letterbox, drew forth a letter, and with this he
      went back to the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was from Antonia. And such was his excitement that he was forced to
      take three turns between the window and the wall before he could read;
      then, with a heart beating so that he could hardly hold the paper, he
      began:
    </p>
    <p>
      I was wrong to ask you to go away. I see now that it was breaking my
      promise, and I did n&rsquo;t mean to do that. I don&rsquo;t know why
      things have come to be so different. You never think as I do about
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had better tell you that that letter of Monsieur Ferrand&rsquo;s to
      mother was impudent. Of course you did n&rsquo;t know what was in it; but
      when Professor Brayne was asking you about him at breakfast, I felt that
      you believed that he was right and we were wrong, and I can&rsquo;t
      understand it. And then in the afternoon, when that woman hurt her horse,
      it was all as if you were on her side. How can you feel like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      I must say this, because I don&rsquo;t think I ought to have asked you to
      go away, and I want you to believe that I will keep my promise, or I
      should feel that you and everybody else had a right to condemn me. I was
      awake all last night, and have a bad headache this morning. I can&rsquo;t
      write any more. ANTONIA.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first sensation was a sort of stupefaction of relief that had in it an
      element of anger. He was reprieved! She would not break her promise; she
      considered herself bound! In the midst of the exaltation of this thought
      he smiled, and that smile was strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read it through again, and, like a judge, began to weigh what she had
      written, her thoughts when she was writing, the facts which had led up to
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vagrant&rsquo;s farewell document had done the business. True to his
      fatal gift of divesting things of clothing, Ferrand had not vanished
      without showing up his patron in his proper colours; even to Shelton those
      colours were made plain. Antonia had felt her lover was a traitor.
      Sounding his heart even in his stress of indecision, Shelton knew that
      this was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then in the afternoon, when that woman hurt her horse-&rdquo; That
      woman! &ldquo;It was as if you were on her side!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw too well her mind, its clear rigidity, its intuitive perception of
      that with which it was not safe to sympathise, its instinct for
      self-preservation, its spontaneous contempt for those without that
      instinct. And she had written these words considering herself bound to him&mdash;a
      man of sentiment, of rebellious sympathies, of untidiness of principle!
      Here was the answer to the question he had asked all day: &ldquo;How have
      things come to such a pass?&rdquo; and he began to feel compassion for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor child! She could not jilt him; there was something vulgar in the
      word! Never should it be said that Antonia Dennant had accented him and
      thrown him over. No lady did these things! They were impossible! At the
      bottom of his heart he had a queer, unconscious sympathy with, this
      impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again he read the letter, which seemed now impregnated with fresh
      meaning, and the anger which had mingled with his first sensation of
      relief detached itself and grew in force. In that letter there was
      something tyrannous, a denial of his right to have a separate point of
      view. It was like a finger pointed at him as an unsound person. In
      marrying her he would be marrying not only her, but her class&mdash;his
      class. She would be there always to make him look on her and on himself,
      and all the people that they knew and all the things they did,
      complacently; she would be there to make him feel himself superior to
      everyone whose life was cast in other moral moulds. To feel himself
      superior, not blatantly, not consciously, but with subconscious
      righteousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his anger, which was like the paroxysm that two days before had made
      him mutter at the Connoisseur, &ldquo;I hate your d&mdash;-d superiority,&rdquo;
      struck him all at once as impotent and ludicrous. What was the good of
      being angry? He was on the point of losing her! And the anguish of that
      thought, reacting on his anger, intensified it threefold. She was so
      certain of herself, so superior to her emotions, to her natural impulses&mdash;superior
      to her very longing to be free from him. Of that fact, at all events,
      Shelton had no longer any doubt. It was beyond argument. She did not
      really love him; she wanted to be free of him!
    </p>
    <p>
      A photograph hung in his bedroom at Holm Oaks of a group round the hall
      door; the Honourable Charlotte Penguin, Mrs. Dennant, Lady Bonington,
      Halidome, Mr. Dennant, and the stained-glass man&mdash;all were there; and
      on the left-hand side, looking straight in front of her, Antonia. Her face
      in its youthfulness, more than all those others, expressed their point of
      view: Behind those calm young eyes lay a world of safety and tradition.
      &ldquo;I am not as others are,&rdquo; they seemed to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      And from that photograph Mr. and Mrs. Dennant singled themselves out; he
      could see their faces as they talked&mdash;their faces with a peculiar and
      uneasy look on them; and he could hear their voices, still decisive, but a
      little acid, as if they had been quarrelling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &lsquo;s made a donkey of himself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s too distressin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They, too, thought him unsound, and did n&rsquo;t want him; but to save
      the situation they would be glad to keep him. She did n&rsquo;t want him,
      but she refused to lose her right to say, &ldquo;Commoner girls may break
      their promises; I will not!&rdquo; He sat down at the table between the
      candles, covering his face. His grief and anger grew and grew within him.
      If she would not free herself, the duty was on him! She was ready without
      love to marry him, as a sacrifice to her ideal of what she ought to be!
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had n&rsquo;t, after all, the monopoly of pride!
    </p>
    <p>
      As if she stood before him, he could see the shadows underneath her eyes
      that he had dreamed of kissing, the eager movements of her lips. For
      several minutes he remained, not moving hand or limb. Then once more his
      anger blazed. She was going to sacrifice herself and&mdash;him! All his
      manhood scoffed at such a senseless sacrifice. That was not exactly what
      he wanted!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the bureau, took a piece of paper and an envelope, and wrote as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      There never was, is not, and never would have been any question of being
      bound between us. I refuse to trade on any such thing. You are absolutely
      free. Our engagement is at an end by mutual consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      RICHARD SHELTON.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sealed it, and, sitting with his hands between his knees, he let his
      forehead droop lower and lower to the table, till it rested on his
      marriage settlement. And he had a feeling of relief, like one who drops
      exhausted at his journey&rsquo;s end.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
