      ACT I
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It is Ascension Day in a village of the West. In the low panelled
        hall-sittingroom of the BURLACOMBE'S farmhouse on the village green,
        MICHAEL STRANGWAY, a clerical collar round his throat and a dark Norfolk
        jacket on his back, is playing the flute before a very large framed
        photograph of a woman, which is the only picture on the walls. His age
        is about thirty-five his figure thin and very upright and his
        clean-shorn face thin, upright, narrow, with long and rather pointed
        ears; his dark hair is brushed in a coxcomb off his forehead. A faint
        smile hovers about his lips that Nature has made rather full and he has
        made thin, as though keeping a hard secret; but his bright grey eyes,
        dark round the rim, look out and upwards almost as if he were being
        crucified. There is something about the whole of him that makes him seen
        not quite present. A gentle creature, burnt within. A low broad window
        above a window-seat forms the background to his figure; and through its
        lattice panes are seen the outer gate and yew-trees of a churchyard and
        the porch of a church, bathed in May sunlight. The front door at right
        angles to the window-seat, leads to the village green, and a door on the
        left into the house. It is the third movement of Veracini's violin
        sonata that STRANGWAY plays. His back is turned to the door into the
        house, and he does not hear when it is opened, and IVY BURLACOMBE, the
        farmer's daughter, a girl of fourteen, small and quiet as a mouse, comes
        in, a prayer-book in one hand, and in the other a gloss of water, with
        wild orchis and a bit of deep pink hawthorn. She sits down on the
        window-seat, and having opened her book, sniffs at the flowers. Coming
        to the end of the movement STRANGWAY stops, and looking up at the face
        on the wall, heaves a long sigh.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      IVY. [From the seat] I picked these for yu, Mr. Strangway.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Turning with a start] Ah! Ivy. Thank you. [He puts his flute
      down on a chair against the far wall] Where are the others?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As he speaks, GLADYS FREMAN, a dark gipsyish girl, and CONNIE
        TRUSTAFORD, a fair, stolid, blue-eyed Saxon, both about sixteen, come in
        through the front door, behind which they have evidently been listening.
        They too have prayer-books in their hands. They sidle past Ivy, and also
        sit down under the window.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      GLADYS. Mercy's comin', Mr. Strangway.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Good morning, Gladys; good morning, Connie.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He turns to a book-case on a table against the far wall, and taking out
        a book, finds his place in it. While he stands thus with his back to the
        girls, MERCY JARLAND comes in from the green. She also is about sixteen,
        with fair hair and china-blue eyes. She glides in quickly, hiding
        something behind her, and sits down on the seat next the door. And at
        once there is a whispering.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Turning to them] Good morning, Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      MERCY. Good morning, Mr. Strangway.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Now, yesterday I was telling you what our Lord's coming meant
      to the world. I want you to understand that before He came there wasn't
      really love, as we know it. I don't mean to say that there weren't many
      good people; but there wasn't love for the sake of loving. D'you think you
      understand what I mean?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MERCY fidgets. GLADYS'S eyes are following a fly.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      IVY. Yes, Mr. Strangway.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. It isn't enough to love people because they're good to you, or
      because in some way or other you're going to get something by it. We have
      to love because we love loving. That's the great thing &mdash;without that
      we're nothing but Pagans.
    </p>
    <p>
      GLADYS. Please, what is Pagans?
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. That's what the first Christians called the people who lived in
      the villages and were not yet Christians, Gladys.
    </p>
    <p>
      MERCY. We live in a village, but we're Christians.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [With a smile] Yes, Mercy; and what is a Christian?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MERCY kicks afoot, sideways against her neighbour, frowns over her
        china-blare eyes, is silent; then, as his question passes on, makes a
        quick little face, wriggles, and looks behind her.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Ivy?
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. 'Tis a man&mdash;whu&mdash;whu&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Yes?&mdash;Connie?
    </p>
    <p>
      CONNIE. [Who speaks rather thickly, as if she had a permanent slight cold]
      Please, Mr. Strangway, 'tis a man what goes to church.
    </p>
    <p>
      GLADYS. He 'as to be baptised&mdash;and confirmed; and&mdash;and&mdash;buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. 'Tis a man whu&mdash;whu's gude and&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GLADYS. He don't drink, an' he don't beat his horses, an' he don't hit
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      MERCY. [Whispering] 'Tisn't your turn. [To STRANGWAY] 'Tis a man like us.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. I know what Mrs. Strangway said it was, 'cause I asked her once,
      before she went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Startled] Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. She said it was a man whu forgave everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Ah!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The note of a cuckoo comes travelling. The girls are gazing at
        STRANGWAY, who seems to have gone of into a dream. They begin to fidget
        and whisper.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CONNIE. Please, Mr. Strangway, father says if yu hit a man and he don't
      hit yu back, he's no gude at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      MERCY. When Tommy Morse wouldn't fight, us pinched him&mdash;he did
      squeal! [She giggles] Made me laugh!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Did I ever tell you about St. Francis of Assisi?
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. [Clasping her hands] No.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Well, he was the best Christian, I think, that ever lived&mdash;simply
      full of love and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. I expect he's dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. About seven hundred years, Ivy.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. [Softly] Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Everything to him was brother or sister&mdash;the sun and the
      moon, and all that was poor and weak and sad, and animals and birds, so
      that they even used to follow him about.
    </p>
    <p>
      MERCY. I know! He had crumbs in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. No; he had love in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. 'Tis like about Orpheus, that yu told us.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Ah! But St. Francis was a Christian, and Orpheus was a Pagan.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Orpheus drew everything after him with music; St. Francis by
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. Perhaps it was the same, really.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [looking at his flute] Perhaps it was, Ivy.
    </p>
    <p>
      GLADYS. Did 'e 'ave a flute like yu?
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. The flowers smell sweeter when they 'ear music; they du.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She holds up the glass of flowers.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Touching one of the orchis] What's the name of this one?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The girls cluster; save MERCY, who is taking a stealthy interest in
        what she has behind her.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CONNIE. We call it a cuckoo, Mr. Strangway.
    </p>
    <p>
      GLADYS. 'Tis awful common down by the streams. We've got one medder where
      'tis so thick almost as the goldie cups.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Odd! I've never noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. Please, Mr. Strangway, yu don't notice when yu're walkin'; yu go
      along like this.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She holds up her face as one looking at the sky.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Bad as that, Ivy?
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. Mrs. Strangway often used to pick it last spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Did she? Did she?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He has gone off again into a kind of dream.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MERCY. I like being confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Ah! Yes. Now&mdash;&mdash;What's that behind you, Mercy?
    </p>

    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. That child's got an eye like a hawk.

    <p>
      MRS. BURLACOMBE. 'Tes wonderful how things du spread. 'Tesn't as if us
      gossiped. Du seem to grow-like in the naight.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE [To herself] I never lied her. That Riviera excuse, Mrs.
      Burlacombe&mdash;Very convenient things, sick mothers. Mr. Strangway
      doesn't know?

      MRS. BURLACOMBE. The Lord forbid! 'Twid send un crazy, I think. For all
      he'm so moony an' gentlelike, I think he'm a terrible passionate man
      inside. He've a-got a saint in 'im, for zure; but 'tes only 'alf-baked, in
      a manner of spakin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. I shall go and see Mrs. Freman. There's been too much of
      this gossip all the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BURLACOMBE. 'Tes unfortunate-like 'tes the Fremans. Freman he'm a
      gipsy sort of a feller; and he've never forgiven Mr. Strangway for spakin'
      to 'im about the way he trates 'is 'orses.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. Ah! I'm afraid Mr. Strangway's not too discreet when his
      feelings are touched.

    <p>
      MRS. BURLACOMBE. 'E've a-got an 'eart so big as the full mune. But 'tes no
      yuse espectin' tu much o' this world. 'Tes a funny place, after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. Yes, Mrs. Burlacombe; and I shall give some of these good
      people a rare rap over the knuckles for their want of charity. For all
      they look as if butter wouldn't melt in their mouths, they're an
      un-Christian lot. [Looking very directly at Mrs. BURLACOMBE] It's lucky
      we've some hold over the village. I'm not going to have scandal. I shall
      speak to Sir Herbert, and he and the Rector will take steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BURLACOMBE. [With covert malice] Aw! I du hope 'twon't upset the
      Rector, an' 'is fute so poptious!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. [Grimly] His foot'll be sound enough to come down sharp. By
      the way, will you send me a duck up to the Rectory?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BURLACOMBE. [Glad to get away] Zurely, m'm; at once. I've some luv'ly

        looks round, takes a large sweet out of her mouth, contemplates it, and
        puts it back again. Then, in a perfunctory and very stolid fashion, she
        looks about the floor, as if she had been told to find something. While
        she is finding nothing and sucking her sweet, her sister MERCY comes in
        furtively, still frowning and vindictive.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MERCY. What! Haven't you found it, Tibby? Get along with 'ee, then!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She accelerates the stolid Tissy's departure with a smack, searches
        under the seat, finds and picks up the deserted sixpence. Then very
        quickly she goes to the door: But it is opened before she reaches it,
        and, finding herself caught, she slips behind the chintz window-curtain.
        A woman has entered, who is clearly the original of the large
        photograph. She is not strictly pretty, but there is charm in her pale,
        resolute face, with its mocking lips, flexible brows, and greenish eyes,
        whose lids, square above them, have short, dark lashes. She is dressed
        in blue, and her fair hair is coiled up under a cap and motor-veil. She
        comes in swiftly, and closes the door behind her; becomes irresolute;
        then, suddenly deciding, moves towards the door into the house. MERCY
        slips from behind her curtain to make off, but at that moment the door
        into the house is opened, and she has at once to slip back again into
        covert. It is Ivy who has appeared.]

    <p>
      BEATRICE. Well, Ivy&mdash;you've grown! You didn't expect me, did you?

    <p>
      IVY. No, Mrs. Strangway; but I hoped yu'd be comin' soon.

    <p>
      BEATRICE. Ah! Yes. Is Mr. Strangway in?
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. [Hypnotized by those faintly smiling lips] Yes&mdash;oh, yes! He's
      writin' his sermon in the little room. He will be glad!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. [Going a little closer, and never taking her eyes off the child]
      Yes. Now, Ivy; will you do something for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. [Fluttering] Oh, yes, Mrs. Strangway.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. Quite sure?

      IVY. Oh, yes!

      IVY. [Nodding] I'm fourteen now.

    <p>
      BEATRICE. Well, then&mdash;, I don't want anybody but Mr. Strangway to
      know I've been here; nobody, not even your mother. D'you understand?

    <p>
      IVY. [Troubled] No. Only, I can keep a secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. Mind, if anybody hears, it will hurt Mr. Strangway.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. Oh! I wouldn't&mdash;hurt&mdash;him. Must yu go away again?
      [Trembling towards her] I wish yu wer goin' to stay. And perhaps some one
      has seen yu&mdash;They&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. [Hastily] No, no one. I came motoring; like this. [She moves her
      veil to show how it can conceal her face] And I came straight down the
      little lane, and through the barn, across the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. [Timidly] People du see a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. [Still with that hovering smile] I know, but&mdash;&mdash;Now go
      and tell him quickly and quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. [Stopping at the door] Mother's pluckin' a duck. Only, please, Mrs.
      Strangway, if she comes in even after yu've gone, she'll know, because&mdash;because
      yu always have that particular nice scent.

        cigarette case, she lights a cigarette, and watches the puff's of smoke
        wreathe shout her and die away. The frightened MERCY peers out, spying
        for a chance, to escape. Then from the house STRANGWAY comes in. All his
        dreaminess is gone.]

    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Thank God! [He stops at the look on her face] I don't
      understand, though. I thought you were still out there.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. [Letting her cigarette fall, and putting her foot on it] No.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY: You're staying? Oh! Beatrice; come! We'll get away from here at
      once&mdash;as far, as far&mdash;anywhere you like. Oh! my darling &mdash;only
      come! If you knew&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. It's no good, Michael; I've tried and tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Not! Then, why&mdash;? Beatrice! You said, when you were right
      away&mdash;I've waited&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. I know. It's cruel&mdash;it's horrible. But I told you not to
      hope, Michael. I've done my best. All these months at Mentone, I've been
      wondering why I ever let you marry me&mdash;when that feeling wasn't dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. You can't have come back just to leave me again?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. When you let me go out there with mother I thought&mdash;I did
      think I would be able; and I had begun&mdash;and then&mdash;spring came!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Spring came here too! Never so&mdash;aching! Beatrice, can't
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. I've something to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. No! No! No!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. You see&mdash;I've&mdash;fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Ah! [In a twice sharpened by pain] Why, in the name of mercy,
      come here to tell me that? Was he out there, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. I came straight back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. To Durford?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. To the Crossway Hotel, miles out&mdash;in my own name. They
      don't know me there. I told you not to hope, Michael. I've done my best; I
      swear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. My God!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. It was your God that brought us to live near him!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Why have you come to me like this?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. To know what you're going to do. Are you going to divorce me?
      We're in your power. Don't divorce me&mdash;Doctor and patient&mdash;you
      must know&mdash;it ruins him. He'll lose everything. He'd be disqualified,
      and he hasn't a penny without his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Why should I spare him?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. Michael; I came to beg. It's hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. No; don't beg! I can't stand it.

    <p>
      BEATRICE. [Recovering her pride] What are you going to do, then? Keep us
      apart by the threat of a divorce? Starve us and prison us? Cage me up here
      with you? I'm not brute enough to ruin him.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. I never really stopped loving him. I never&mdash;loved you,
      Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Stunned] Is that true? [BEATRICE bends her head] Never loved
      me? Not&mdash;that night&mdash;on the river&mdash;not&mdash;&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. [Under her breath] No.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Were you lying to me, then? Kissing me, and&mdash;hating me?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. One doesn't hate men like you; but it wasn't love.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Why did you tell me it was?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. Yes. That was the worst thing I've ever done.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Do you think I would have married you? I would have burned
      first! I never dreamed you didn't. I swear it!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. [Very low] Forget it!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Did he try to get you away from me? [BEATRICE gives him a swift
      look] Tell me the truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. No. It was&mdash;I&mdash;alone. But&mdash;he loves me.

    <p>
      BEATRICE. It was cruel to come, I know. For me, too. But I couldn't write.
      I had to know.

      STRANGWAY. Never loved me? Never loved me? That night at Tregaron? [At the
      look on her face] You might have told me before you went away! Why keep me
      all these&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE. I meant to forget him again. I did mean to. I thought I could
      get back to what I was, when I married you; but, you see, what a girl can
      do, a woman that's been married&mdash;can't.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Then it was I&mdash;my kisses that&mdash;&mdash;! [He laughs]
      How did you stand them? [His eyes dart at her face] Imagination helped
      you, perhaps!

    <p>
      BEATRICE. What you feel in the bottom of your heart.

    <p>
      STRANGWAY. You ask me to help you live in sin?

      leaning his forehead against the window. Suddenly his glance falls on the
      little bird cage, still lying on the window-seat] Never cage any wild
      thing! [He gives a laugh that is half a sob; then, turning to the door,
      says in a low voice] Go! Go please, quickly! Do what you will. I won't

        behind the curtain, and watching her chance, slips to the still open
        door; but in her haste and fright she knocks against it, and STRANGWAY

      lips move fast. He is standing motionless when CREMER, a big man in
      labourer's clothes, with a thick, broad face, and tragic, faithful eyes,
      comes in, and stands a little in from the closed door, quite dumb.]

      CREMER. Yes, zurr. [A quiver passes over his face.]

    <p>
      SCENE I
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        About seven o'clock in the taproom of the village inn. The bar, with the
        appurtenances thereof, stretches across one end, and opposite is the
        porch door on to the green. The wall between is nearly all window, with
        leaded panes, one wide-open casement whereof lets in the last of the
        sunlight. A narrow bench runs under this broad window. And this is all
        the furniture, save three spittoons: GODLEIGH, the innkeeper, a smallish
        man with thick ruffled hair, a loquacious nose, and apple-red cheeks
        above a reddish-brown moustache; is reading the paper. To him enters
        TIBBY JARLAND with a shilling in her mouth.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. Well, TIBBY JARLAND, what've yu come for, then? Glass o' beer?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [TIBBY takes the shilling from her mouth and smiles stolidly.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. [Twinkling] I shid zay glass o' 'arf an' 'arf's about yure form.
      [TIBBY smiles more broadly] Yu'm a praaper masterpiece. Well! 'Ave sister
      Mercy borrowed yure tongue? [TIBBY shakes her head] Aw, she 'aven't. Well,
      maid?
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. Father wants six clay pipes, please.
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. 'E du, du 'ee? Yu tell yure father 'e can't 'ave more'n one, not
      this avenin'. And 'ere 'tis. Hand up yure shillin'.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [TIBBY reaches up her hand, parts with the shilling, and receives a long
        clay pipe and eleven pennies. In order to secure the coins in her
        pinafore she places the clay pipe in her mouth. While she is still thus
        engaged, MRS. BRADMERE enters the porch and comes in. TIBBY curtsies
        stolidly.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. Gracious, child! What are you doing here? And what have you
      got in your mouth? Who is it? Tibby Jarland? [TIBBY curtsies again] Take
      that thing out. And tell your father from me that if I ever see you at the
      inn again I shall tread on his toes hard. Godleigh, you know the law about
      children?
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. [Cocking his eye, and not at all abashed] Surely, m'm. But she
      will come. Go away, my dear.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [TIBBY, never taking her eyes off MRS. BRADMERE, or the pipe from her
        mouth, has backed stolidly to the door, and vanished.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. [Eyeing GODLEIGH] Now, Godleigh, I've come to talk to you.
      Half the scandal that goes about the village begins here. [She holds up
      her finger to check expostulation] No, no&mdash;its no good. You know the
      value of scandal to your business far too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. Wi' all respect, m'm, I knows the vally of it to yourn, tu.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. What do you mean by that?
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. If there weren't no Rector's lady there widden' be no notice
      taken o' scandal; an' if there weren't no notice taken, twidden be
      scandal, to my thinkin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. [Winking out a grim little smile] Very well! You've given
      me your views. Now for mine. There's a piece of scandal going about that's
      got to be stopped, Godleigh. You turn the tap of it off here, or we'll
      turn your tap off. You know me. See?
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. I shouldn' never presume, m'm, to know a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. The Rector's quite determined, so is Sir Herbert. Ordinary
      scandal's bad enough, but this touches the Church. While Mr. Strangway
      remains curate here, there must be no talk about him and his affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. [Cocking his eye] I was just thinkin' how to du it, m'm. 'Twid
      be a brave notion to putt the men in chokey, and slit the women's
      tongues-like, same as they du in outlandish places, as I'm told.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. Don't talk nonsense, Godleigh; and mind what I say, because
      I mean it.
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. Make yure mind aisy, m'm there'll be no scandal-monkeyin' here
      wi' my permission.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MRS. BRADMERE gives him a keen stare, but seeing him perfectly grave,
        nods her head with approval.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. Good! You know what's being said, of course?
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. [With respectful gravity] Yu'll pardon me, m'm, but ef an' in
      case yu was goin' to tell me, there's a rule in this 'ouse: "No scandal
      'ere!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. [Twinkling grimly] You're too smart by half, my man.
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. Aw fegs, no, m'm&mdash;child in yure 'ands.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. I wouldn't trust you a yard. Once more, Godleigh! This is a
      Christian village, and we mean it to remain so. You look out for yourself.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The door opens to admit the farmers TRUSTAFORD and BURLACOMBE. They
        doff their hats to MRS. BRADMERE, who, after one more sharp look at
        GODLEIGH, moves towards the door.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. Evening, Mr. Trustaford. [To BURLACOMBE] Burlacombe, tell
      your wife that duck she sent up was in hard training.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [With one of her grim winks, and a nod, she goes.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TRUSTAFORD. [Replacing a hat which is black, hard, and not very new, on
      his long head, above a long face, clean-shaved but for little whiskers]
      What's the old grey mare want, then? [With a horse-laugh] 'Er's lukin'
      awful wise!
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. [Enigmatically] Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      TRUSTAFORD. [Sitting on the bench dose to the bar] Drop o' whisky, an'
      potash.
    </p>
    <p>
      BURLACOMBE. [A taciturn, alien, yellowish man, in a worn soft hat] What's
      wise, Godleigh? Drop o' cider.
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. Nuse? There's never no nuse in this 'ouse. Aw, no! Not wi' my
      permission. [In imitation] This is a Christian village.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRUSTAFORD. Thought the old grey mare seemed mighty busy. [To BURLACOMBE]
      'Tes rather quare about the curate's wife a-cumin' motorin' this mornin'.
      Passed me wi' her face all smothered up in a veil, goggles an' all. Haw,
      haw!
    </p>
    <p>
      BURLACOMBE. Aye!
    </p>
    <p>
      TRUSTAFORD. Off again she was in 'alf an hour. 'Er didn't give poor old
      curate much of a chance, after six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. Havin' an engagement elsewhere&mdash;No scandal, please,
      gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      BURLACOMBE. [Acidly] Never asked to see my missis. Passed me in the yard
      like a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRUSTAFORD. 'Tes a little bit rumoursome lately about 'er doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. Ah! he's the favourite. But 'tes a dead secret; Mr. Trustaford.
      Don't yu never repate it&mdash;there's not a cat don't know it already!
    </p>
    <p>
      BURLACOMBE frowns, and TRUSTAFORD utters his laugh. The door is opened and
      FREMAN, a dark gipsyish man in the dress of a farmer, comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. Don't yu never tell Will Freman what 'e told me!
    </p>
    <p>
      FREMAN. Avenin'!
    </p>
    <p>
      TRUSTAFORD. Avenin', Will; what's yure glass o' trouble?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREMAN. Drop o' eider, clove, an' dash o' gin. There's blood in the sky
      to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      BURLACOMBE. Ah! We'll 'ave fine weather now, with the full o' the mune.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREMAN. Dust o' wind an' a drop or tu, virst, I reckon. 'Earl t' nuse
      about curate an' 'is wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      GODLEIGH. No, indeed; an' don't yu tell us. We'm Christians 'ere in this
      village.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREMAN. 'Tain't no very Christian nuse, neither. He's sent 'er off to th'
      doctor. "Go an' live with un," 'e says; "my blessin' on ye." If 'er'd
      a-been mine, I'd 'a tuk the whip to 'er. Tam Jarland's maid, she yeard it
      all. Christian, indeed! That's brave Christianity! "Goo an' live with un!"
      'e told 'er.
    </p>
    <p>
      BURLACOMBE. No, no; that's, not sense&mdash;a man to say that. I'll not
      'ear that against a man that bides in my 'ouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREMAN. 'Tes sure, I tell 'ee. The maid was hid-up, scared-like, behind
      the curtain. At it they went, and parson 'e says: "Go," 'e says, "I won't
      kape 'ee from 'im," 'e says, "an' I won't divorce 'ee, as yu don't wish
      it!" They was 'is words, same as Jarland's maid told my maid, an' my maid
      told my missis. If that's parson's talk, 'tes funny work goin' to church.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRUSTAFORD. [Brooding] 'Tes wonderful quare, zurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREMAN. Tam Jarland's fair mad wi' curate for makin' free wi' his maid's
      skylark. Parson or no parson, 'e've no call to meddle wi' other people's
      praperty. He cam' pokin' 'is nose into my affairs. I told un I knew a
      sight more 'bout 'orses than 'e ever would!
    </p>
    <p>
      TRUSTAFORD. He'm a bit crazy 'bout bastes an' birds.

        voices singing can be heard.

        frocks of young girls continually flitting up and back in the blackness.

        perfectly dead silence. The figure of STRANGWAY is seen in his dark
        clothes, passing from the vestry to the church porch. He stands plainly
        visible in the lighted porch, locking the door, then steps forward. Just
        as he reaches the edge of the porch, a low hiss breaks the silence. It
        swells very gradually into a long, hissing groan. STRANGWAY stands
        motionless, his hand over his eyes, staring into the darkness. A girl's
        figure can be seen to break out of the darkness and rush away. When at
        last the groaning has died into sheer expectancy, STRANGWAY drops his

        voice.]

    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. [At last] This is most distressing. I'm deeply sorry.
      [Then, as he does not answer, she goes a step closer] I'm an old woman;
      and old women must take liberties, you know, or they couldn't get on at
      all. Come now! Let's try and talk it over calmly and see if we can't put
      things right.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. You were very good to come; but I would rather not.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. I know you're in as grievous trouble as a man can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. [With a little sound of sympathy] What are you&mdash;
      thirty-five? I'm sixty-eight if I'm a day&mdash;old enough to be your
      mother. I can feel what you must have been through all these months, I can
      indeed. But you know you've gone the wrong way to work. We aren't angels
      down here below! And a son of the Church can't act as if for himself
      alone. The eyes of every one are on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Taking the church key from the window.] Take this, please.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. No, no, no! Jarland deserved all he got. You had great
      provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. It's not Jarland. [Holding out the key] Please take it to the
      Rector. I beg his forgiveness. [Touching his breast] There's too much I
      can't speak of&mdash;can't make plain. Take it to him, please.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. Mr. Strangway&mdash;I don't accept this. I am sure my
      husband&mdash;the Church&mdash;will never accept&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Take it!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. [Almost unconsciously taking it] Mind! We don't accept it.
      You must come and talk to the Rector to-morrow. You're overwrought. You'll
      see it all in another light, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [With a strange smile] Perhaps. [Lifting the blind] Beautiful
      night! Couldn't be more beautiful!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. [Startled-softly] Don't turn sway from these who want to
      help you! I'm a grumpy old woman, but I can feel for you. Don't try and
      keep it all back, like this! A woman would cry, and it would all seem
      clearer at once. Now won't you let me&mdash;&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. No one can help, thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. Come! Things haven't gone beyond mending, really, if you'll
      face them. [Pointing to the photograph] You know what I mean. We dare not
      foster immorality.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Quivering as at a jabbed nerve] Don't speak of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. But think what you've done, Mr. Strangway! If you can't
      take your wife back, surely you must divorce her. You can never help her
      to go on like this in secret sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Torture her&mdash;one way or the other?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. No, no; I want you to do as the Church&mdash;as all
      Christian society would wish. Come! You can't let this go on. My dear man,
      do your duty at all costs!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Break her heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. Then you love that woman&mdash;more than God!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [His face quivering] Love!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. They told me&mdash;&mdash;Yes, and I can see you're is a
      bad way. Come, pull yourself together! You can't defend what you're doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. I do not try.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. I must get you to see! My father was a clergyman; I'm
      married to one; I've two sons in the Church. I know what I'm talking
      about. It's a priest's business to guide the people's lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Very low] But not mine! No more!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. [Looking at him shrewdly] There's something very queer
      about you to-night. You ought to see doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [A smile awning and going on his lips] If I am not better soon&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>

      Live it down, man! You can't desert your post&mdash;and let these
      villagers do what they like with us? Do you realize that you're letting a
      woman, who has treated you abominably;&mdash;yes, abominably &mdash;go
      scot-free, to live comfortably with another man? What an example!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Will you, please, not speak of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. I must! This great Church of ours is based on the rightful
      condemnation of wrongdoing. There are times when forgiveness is a sin,
      Michael Strangway. You must keep the whip hand. You must fight!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Fight! [Touching his heart] My fight is here. Have you ever
      been in hell? For months and months&mdash;burned and longed; hoped against
      hope; killed a man in thought day by day? Never rested, for love and hate?
      I&mdash;condemn! I&mdash;judge! No! It's rest I have to find&mdash;somewhere&mdash;somehow-rest!
      And how&mdash;how can I find rest?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BRADMERE. [Who has listened to his outburst in a soft of coma] You
      are a strange man! One of these days you'll go off your head if you don't
      take care.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Smiling] One of these days the flowers will grow out of me;
      and I shall sleep.

      SCENE II
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The BURLACOMBES' high and nearly empty barn. A lantern is hung by a rope
        that lifts the bales of straw, to a long ladder leaning against a
        rafter. This gives all the light there is, save for a slender track of
        moonlight, slanting in from the end, where the two great doors are not
        quite closed. On a rude bench in front of a few remaining, stacked,
        square-cut bundles of last year's hay, sits TIBBY JARLAND, a bit of
        apple in her mouth, sleepily beating on a tambourine. With stockinged
        feet GLADYS, IVY, CONNIE, and MERCY, TIM CLYST, and BOBBIE JARLAND, a
        boy of fifteen, are dancing a truncated "Figure of Eight"; and their
        shadow are dancing alongside on the walls. Shoes and some apples have
        been thrown down close to the side door through which they have come in.
        Now and then IVY, the smallest and best of the dancers, ejaculates words
        of direction, and one of the youths grunts or breathes loudly out of the
        confusion of his mind. Save for this and the dumb beat and jingle of the
        sleepy tambourine, there is no sound. The dance comes to its end, but
        the drowsy TIBBY goes on beating.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MERCY. That'll du, Tibby; we're finished. Ate yore apple. [The stolid
      TIBBY eats her apple.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CLYST. [In his teasing, excitable voice] Yu maids don't dance 'elf's well
      as us du. Bobbie 'e's a great dancer. 'E dance vine. I'm a gude dancer,
      meself.
    </p>
    <p>
      GLADYS. A'n't yu conceited just?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLYST. Aw! Ah! Yu'll give me kiss for that. [He chases, but cannot catch
      that slippery white figure] Can't she glimmer!
    </p>
    <p>
      MERCY. Gladys! Up ladder!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLYST. Yu go up ladder; I'll catch 'ee then. Naw, yu maids, don't yu give
      her succour. That's not vair [Catching hold of MERCY, who gives a little
      squeal.]

      CONNIE. Mercy, don't! Mrs. Burlacombe'll hear. Ivy, go an' peek.

      CONNIE. 'Tes awful difficult, this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVY. [Illustrating] No; yu just jump, an' clap yore 'ands. Lovely, lovely!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLYST. Like ringin' bells! Come ahn!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [TIBBY begins her drowsy beating, IVY hums the tune; they dance, and
        their shadows dance again upon the walls. When she has beaten but a few
        moments on the tambourine, TIBBY is overcome once more by sleep and
        falls back again into her nest of hay, with her little shoed feet just
        visible over the edge of the bench. Ivy catches up the tambourine, and
        to her beating and humming the dancers dance on.] [Suddenly GLADYS stops
        like a wild animal surprised, and cranes her neck towards the aide
        door.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CONNIE. [Whispering] What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      GLADYS. [Whispering] I hear&mdash;some one comin' across the yard.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She leads a noiseless scamper towards the shoes. BOBBIE JARLAND shins
        up the ladder and seizes the lantern. Ivy drops the tambourine. They all
        fly to the big doors, and vanish into the moonlight, pulling the door
        nearly to again after them.] [There is the sound of scrabbling at the
        hitch of the side door, and STRANGWAY comes into the nearly dark barn.
        Out in the night the owl is still hooting. He closes the door, and that
        sound is lost. Like a man walking in his sleep, he goes up to the
        ladder, takes the rope in his hand, and makes a noose. He can be heard
        breathing, and in the darkness the motions of his hands are dimly seen,
        freeing his throat and putting the noose round his neck. He stands
        swaying to and fro at the foot of the ladder; then, with a sigh, sets
        his foot on it to mount. One of the big doors creaks and opens in the
        wind, letting in a broad path of moonlight.] [STRANGWAY stops; freeing
        his neck from the noose, he walks quickly up the track of moonlight,
        whitened from head to foot, to close the doors.] [The sound of his boots
        on the bare floor has awakened TIBBY JARLAND. Struggling out of her hay
        nest she stands staring at his whitened figure, and bursts suddenly into
        a wail.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TIBBY. O-oh! Mercy! Where are yu? I'm frightened! I'm frightened! O-oooo!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Turning&mdash;startled] Who's that? Who is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. O-oh! A ghosty! Oo-ooo!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Going to her quickly] It's me, Tibby&mdash;Tib only me!
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. I seed a ghosty.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Taking her up] No, no, my bird, you didn't! It was me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. [Burying her face against him] I'm frighted. It was a big one. [She
      gives tongue again] O-o-oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. There, there! It's nothing but me. Look!
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. No. [She peeps out all the same.]
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. See! It's the moonlight made me all white. See! You're a brave
      girl now?
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. [Cautiously] I want my apple.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She points towards her nest. STRANGWAY carries her there, picks up an
        apple, and gives it her. TIBBY takes a bite.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TIBBY. I want any tambourine.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Giving her the tambourine, and carrying her back into the'
      track of moonlight] Now we're both ghosties! Isn't it funny?
    </p>
    <p>
      TABBY. [Doubtfully] Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. See! The moon's laughing at us! See? Laugh then!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [TABBY, tambourine in one hand and apple in the other, smiles stolidly.
        He sets her down on the ladder, and stands, holding her level With him.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TABBY. [Solemnly] I'se still frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. No! Full moon, Tibby! Shall we wish for it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TABBY. Full mune.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Moon! We're wishing for you. Moon, moon!
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. Mune, we're wishin' for yu!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. What do, you wish it to be?
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. Bright new shillin'!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. A face.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. Shillin', a shillin'!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Taking out a shilling and spinning it so that it falls into
      her pinafore] See! Your wish comes true.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. Oh! [Putting the shilling in her mouth] Mune's still there!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Wish for me, Tibby!
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. Mune. I'm wishin' for yu!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Not yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. Shall I shake my tambouline?
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Yes, shake your tambouline.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. [Shaking her tambourine] Mune, I'm shaken' at yu.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [STRANGWAY lays his hand suddenly on the rope, and swings it up on to
        the beam.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TIBBY. What d'yu du that for?
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. To put it out of reach. It's better&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. Why is it better? [She stares up at him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Come along, Tibby! [He carries her to the big doors, and sets
      her down] See! All asleep! The birds, and the fields, and the moon!
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. Mune, mune, we're wishing for yu!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Send her your love, and say good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. [Blowing a kiss] Good-night, mune!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [From the barn roof a little white dove's feather comes floating down in
        the wind. TIBBY follows it with her hand, catches it, and holds it up to
        him.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TIBBY. [Chuckling] Luke. The mune's sent a bit o' love!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Taking the feather] Thank you, Tibby! I want that bit o' love.
      [Very faint, comes the sound of music] Listen!
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. It's Miss Willis, playin' on the pianny!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. No; it's Love; walking and talking in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. [Dubiously] Is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Pointing] See! Everything coming out to listen! See them,
      Tibby! All the little things with pointed ears, children, and birds, and
      flowers, and bunnies; and the bright rocks, and&mdash;men! Hear their
      hearts beating! And the wind listening!
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. I can't hear&mdash;nor I can't see!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Beyond&mdash;&mdash;[To himself] They are&mdash;they must be; I
      swear they are! [Then, catching sight of TIBBY'S amazed eyes] And now say
      good-bye to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIBBY. Where yu goin'?
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. I don't know, Tibby.
    </p>
    <p>
      VOICE OF MERCY. [Distant and cautious] Tibby! Tibby! Where are yu?
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Mercy calling; run to her!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [TIBBY starts off, turns back and lifts her face. He bends to kiss her,
        and flinging her arms round his neck, she gives him a good hug. Then,
        knuckling the sleep out of her eyes, she runs.] [STRANGWAY stands,
        uncertain. There is a sound of heavy footsteps; a man clears his throat,
        close by.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Who's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      CREMER. Jack Cremer. [The big man's figure appears out of the shadow of
      the barn] That yu, zurr?
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Yes, Jack. How goes it?
    </p>
    <p>
      CREMER. 'Tes empty, zurr. But I'll get on some'ow.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. You put me to shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      CREMER. No, zurr. I'd be killin' meself, if I didn' feel I must stick it,
      like yu zaid.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [They stand gazing at each other in the moonlight.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Very low] I honour you.
    </p>
    <p>
      CREMER. What's that? [Then, as STRANGWAY does not answer] I'll just be
      walkin'&mdash;I won' be gain' 'ome to-night. 'Tes the full mune&mdash;
      lucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Suddenly] Wait for me at the crossroads, Jack. I'll come with
      you. Will you have me, brother?
    </p>
    <p>
      CREMER. Sure!
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. Wait, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      CREMER. Aye, zurr.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [With his heavy tread CREMER passes on. And STRANGWAY leans against the
        lintel of the door, looking at the moon, that, quite full and golden,
        hangs not far above the straight horizon, where the trees stand small,
        in a row.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      STRANGWAY. [Lifting his hand in the gesture of prayer] God, of the moon
      and the sun; of joy and beauty, of loneliness and sorrow&mdash;give me
      strength to go on, till I love every living thing!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He moves away, following JACK CREMER. The full moon shines; the owl
        hoots; and some one is shaking TIBBY'S tambourine.]

 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 people in all walks of life.

 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 particular state visit http://pglaf.org

 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate.

 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
 donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.

 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

      http://www.gutenberg.net

 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
