    <h2>
      ACT I
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        HILLCRIST'S study. A pleasant room, with books in calf bindings, and
        signs that the HILLCRIST'S have travelled, such as a large photograph of
        the Taj Mahal, of Table Mountain, and the Pyramids of Egypt. A large
        bureau [stage Right], devoted to the business of a country estate. Two
        foxes' masks. Flowers in bowls. Deep armchairs. A large French window
        open [at Back], with a lovely view of a slight rise of fields and trees
        in August sunlight. A fine stone fireplace [stage Left]. A door [Left].
        A door opposite [Right]. General colour effect&mdash;stone, and
        cigar-leaf brown, with spots of bright colour. [HILLCRIST sits in a
        swivel chair at the bureau, busy with papers. He has gout, and his left
        foot is encased accord: He is a thin, dried-up man of about fifty-five,
        with a rather refined, rather kindly, and rather cranky countenance.
        Close to him stands his very upstanding nineteen-year-old daughter JILL,
        with clubbed hair round a pretty, manly face.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JILL. You know, Dodo, it's all pretty good rot in these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Cads are cads, Jill, even in these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. What is a cad?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. A self-assertive fellow, without a sense of other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Well, Old Hornblower I'll give you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. I wouldn't take him.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Well, you've got him. Now, Charlie&mdash;Chearlie&mdash;I say&mdash;the
      importance of not being Charlie&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Good heavens! do you know their Christian names?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. My dear father, they've been here seven years.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. In old days we only knew their Christian names from their
      tombstones.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Charlie Hornblower isn't really half a bad sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. About a quarter of a bad sport I've always thought out hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [Pulling his hair] Now, his wife&mdash;Chloe&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Whimsical] Gad! your mother'd have a fit if she knew you
      called her Chloe.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. It's a ripping name.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Chloe! H'm! I had a spaniel once&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Dodo, you're narrow. Buck up, old darling, it won't do. Chloe has
      seen life, I'm pretty sure; THAT'S attractive, anyway. No, mother's not in
      the room; don't turn your uneasy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Really, my dear, you are getting&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. The limit. Now, Rolf&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. What's Rolf? Another dog?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Rolf Hornblower's a topper; he really is a nice boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [With a sharp look] Oh! He's a nice boy?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Yes, darling. You know what a nice boy is, don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Not in these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Well, I'll tell you. In the first place, he's not amorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. What! Well, that's some comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Just a jolly good companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. To whom?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Well, to anyone&mdash;me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Anywhere. You don't suppose I confine myself to the home paddocks,
      do you? I'm naturally rangey, Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Ironically] You don't say so!
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. In the second place, he doesn't like discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Jupiter! He does seem attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. In the third place, he bars his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Is that essential to nice girls too?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [With a twirl of his hair] Fish not! Fourthly, he's got ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. I knew it!
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. For instance, he thinks&mdash;as I do&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Ah! Good ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [Pulling gently] Careful! He thinks old people run the show too
      much. He says they oughtn't to, because they're so damtouchy. Are you
      damtouchy, darling?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Well, I'm&mdash;&mdash;! I don't know about touchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. He says there'll be no world fit to live in till we get rid of the
      old. We must make them climb a tall tree, and shake them off it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Drily] Oh! he says that!
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Otherwise, with the way they stand on each other's rights, they'll
      spoil the garden for the young.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Does his father agree?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Oh! Rolf doesn't talk to him, his mouth's too large. Have you ever
      seen it, Dodo?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. It's considerable, isn't it? Now yours is&mdash;reticent, darling.
      [Rumpling his hair.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. It won't be in a minute. Do you realise that I've got gout?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Poor ducky! How long have we been here, Dodo?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Since Elizabeth, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [Looking at his foot] It has its drawbacks. D'you think Hornblower
      had a father? I believe he was spontaneous. But, Dodo, why all this&mdash;this
      attitude to the Hornblowers?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She purses her lips and makes a gesture as of pushing persons away.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Because they're pushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. That's only because we are, as mother would say, and they're not&mdash;yet.
      But why not let them be?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. You can't.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. It takes generations to learn to live and let live, Jill.
      People like that take an ell when you give them an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. But if you gave them the ell, they wouldn't want the inch. Why
      should it all be such a skin game?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Skin game? Where do you get your lingo?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Keep to the point, Dodo.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Well, Jill, all life's a struggle between people at different
      stages of development, in different positions, with different amounts of
      social influence and property. And the only thing is to have rules of the
      game and keep them. New people like the Hornblowers haven't learnt those
      rules; their only rule is to get all they can.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Darling, don't prose. They're not half as bad as you think.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Well, when I sold Hornblower Longmeadow and the cottages, I
      certainly found him all right. All the same, he's got the cloven hoof.
      [Warming up] His influence in Deepwater is thoroughly bad; those potteries
      of his are demoralising&mdash;the whole atmosphere of the place is
      changing. It was a thousand pities he ever came here and discovered that
      clay. He's brought in the modern cutthroat spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Cut our throat spirit, you mean. What's your definition of a
      gentleman, Dodo?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Uneasily] Can't describe&mdash;only feel it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Oh! Try!
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Well&mdash;er&mdash;I suppose you might say&mdash;a man who
      keeps his form and doesn't let life scupper him out of his standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. But suppose his standards are low?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [With some earnestness] I assume, of course, that he's honest
      and tolerant, gentle to the weak, and not self-seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Ah! self-seeking? But aren't we all, Dodo? I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [With a smile] You!
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [Scornfully] Oh! yes&mdash;too young to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Nobody knows till they're under pretty heavy fire, Jill.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Except, of course, mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. How do you mean&mdash;mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Mother reminds me of England according to herself&mdash;always right
      whatever she does.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Ye-es. Your mother it perhaps&mdash;the perfect woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. That's what I was saying. Now, no one could call you perfect, Dodo.
      Besides, you've got gout.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Yes; and I want Fellows. Ring that bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [Crossing to the bell] Shall I tell you my definition of a
      gentleman? A man who gives the Hornblower his due. [She rings the bell]
      And I think mother ought to call on them. Rolf says old Hornblower resents
      it fearfully that she's never made a sign to Chloe the three years she's

    <p>
      HILLCRIST. I don't interfere with your mother in such matters. She may go
      and call on the devil himself if she likes.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. I know you're ever so much better than she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. That's respectful.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. You do keep your prejudices out of your phiz. But mother literally
      looks down her nose. And she never forgives an "h." They'd get the "hell"
      from her if they took the "hinch."
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Jill-your language!
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Don't slime out of it, Dodo. I say, mother ought to call on the
      Hornblowers. [No answer.] Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. My dear, I always let people have the last word. It makes them&mdash;feel
      funny. Ugh! My foot![Enter FELLOWS, Left.] Fellows, send into the village
      and get another bottle of this stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. I'll go, darling.

    </p>
    <p>
      JACKMAN. Got to be out this week.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. J. Yes, sir, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Well, but when I sold Longmeadow and the cottages, it was on
      the express understanding that there was to be no disturbance of
      tenancies:
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. J. Yes, sir; but we've all got to go. Mrs. 'Arvey, and the Drews, an'
      us, and there isn't another cottage to be had anywhere in Deepwater.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. I know; I want one for my cowman. This won't do at all. Where
      do you get it from?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACKMAN. Mr. 'Ornblower, 'imself, air. Just an hour ago. He come round and
      said: "I'm sorry; I want the cottages, and you've got to clear."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. J. [Bitterly] He's no gentleman, sir; he put it so brisk. We been
      there thirty years, and now we don't know what to do. So I hope you'll
      excuse us coming round, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. I should think so, indeed! H'm! [He rises and limps across to
      the fireplace on his stick. To himself] The cloven hoof. By George! this
      is a breach of faith. I'll write to him, Jackman. Confound it! I'd
      certainly never have sold if I'd known he was going to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. J. No, sir, I'm sure, sir. They do say it's to do with the potteries.
      He wants the cottages for his workmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Sharply] That's all very well, but he shouldn't have led me to
      suppose that he would make no change.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACKMAN. [Heavily] They talk about his havin' bought the Centry to gut up
      more chimneys there, and that's why he wants the cottages.
    </p>
    <p>
      HINT. The Centry! Impossible!

    <p>
      HILLCRIST. The Centry! [He rings the bell.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. J. [Who has brightened up] I'm glad you're goin' to stop it, sir. It
      does put us about. We don't know where to go. I said to Mr. Hornblower, I
      said, "I'm sure Mr. Hillcrist would never 'eve turned us out." An' 'e
      said: "Mr. Hillcrist be&mdash;&mdash;" beggin' your pardon, sir. "Make no
      mistake," 'e said, "you must go, missis." He don't even know our name; an'
      to come it like this over us! He's a dreadful new man, I think, with his
      overridin notions. And sich a heavyfooted man, to look at. [With a sort of
      indulgent contempt] But he's from the North, they say.

      HILLCRIST. Quite right, Jackman.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. J. I said to Jackman: "Mr. Hillcrist'll stand up for us, I know. He's
      a gentleman," I said. "This man," I said, "don't care for the
      neighbourhood, or the people; he don't care for anything so long as he
      makes his money, and has his importance. You can't expect it, I suppose,"
      I said; [Bitterly] "havin' got rich so sudden." The gentry don't do things
      like that.

      Oh! Amy! Mr. and Mrs. Jackman turned out of their cottage, and Mrs.
      Harvey, and the Drews. When I sold to Hornblower, I stipulated that they
      shouldn't be.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. J. Our week's up on Saturday, ma'am, and I'm sure I don't know where
      we shall turn, because of course Jackman must be near his work, and I
      shall lose me washin' if we have to go far.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [With decision] You leave it to me, Mrs. Jackman. Good morning!
      Morning, Jackman! Sorry I can't move with this gout.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. J. [For them both] I'm sure we're very sorry, sir. Good morning, sir.
      Good morning, ma'am; and thank you kindly. [They go out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Turning people out that have been there thirty years. I won't
      have it. It's a breach of faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Do you suppose this Hornblower will care two straws about that
      Jack?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. He must, when it's put to him, if he's got any decent feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. He hasn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Suddenly] The Jackmans talk of his having bought the Centry to
      put up more chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Never! [At the window, looking out] Impossible! It would ruin the
      place utterly; besides cutting us off from the Duke's. Oh, no! Miss
      Mullins would never sell behind our backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Anyway I must stop his turning these people out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. H. [With a little smile, almost contemptuous] You might have known
      he'd do something of the sort. You will imagine people are like yourself,
      Jack. You always ought to make Dawker have things in black and white.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. I said quite distinctly: "Of course you won't want to disturb
      the tenancies; there's a great shortage of cottages." Hornblower told me
      as distinctly that he wouldn't. What more do you want?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. H. A man like that thinks of nothing but the short cut to his own
      way. [Looking out of the window towards the rise] If he buys the Centry
      and puts up chimneys, we simply couldn't stop here.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. My father would turn in his grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. It would have been more useful if he'd not dipped the estate, and
      sold the Centry. This Hornblower hates us; he thinks we turn up our noses
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. As we do, Amy.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Who wouldn't? A man without traditions, who believes in nothing
      but money and push.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Suppose he won't budge, can we do anything for the Jackmans?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. There are the two rooms Beaver used to have, over the stables.
    </p>

    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Heard anything about the Centry, Dawker?
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. Hornblower wants to buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Miss Mullins would never sell, would she?
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. She wants to.

      DAWKER. He won't stick at the price either.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. What's it worth, Dawker?
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. Depends on what you want it for.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. He wants it for spite; we want it for sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. [Grinning] Worth what you like to give, then; but he's a rich man.

      before he gets at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Pondering] I don't want to buy, unless there's nothing else
      for it. I should have to raise the money on the estate; it won't stand
      much more. I can't believe the fellow would be such a barbarian. Chimneys
      within three hundred yards, right in front of this house! It's a
      nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. You'd much better let Dawker make sure, Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Uncomfortable] Jackman says Hornblower's coming round to see
      me. I shall put it to him.

      have the need when I bought. Thought the Duke would sell me a bit down
      there; but devil a bit he will; and now I must have those cottages for my
      workmen. I've got important works, ye know.

      quite content on what your fathers made for ye. Ye've no ambitions; and ye

      over the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. That's an insult, Mr. Hornblower.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. No; it's a repartee. If ye think so much of these Jackmans,
      build them a cottage yourselves; ye've got the space.

      HILLCRIST. That's beside the point. You promised me, and I sold on that
      understanding.

      HORNBLOWER. And I bought on the understandin' that I'd get some more land
      from the Duke.

    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Look here, Hillcrist, ye've not had occasion to understand men
      like me. I've got the guts, and I've got the money; and I don't sit still
      on it. I'm going ahead because I believe in meself. I've no use for
      sentiment and that sort of thing. Forty of your Jackmans aren't worth me
      little finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Angry] Of all the blatant things I ever heard said!
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Well, as we're speaking plainly, I've been thinkin'. Ye want
      the village run your oldfashioned way, and I want it run mine. I fancy
      there's not room for the two of us here.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. When are you going?
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Never fear, I'm not going.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Look here, Mr. Hornblower&mdash;this infernal gout makes me
      irritable&mdash;puts me at a disadvantage. But I should be glad if you'd
      kindly explain yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [With a great smile] Ca' canny; I'm fra' the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. I'm told you wish to buy the Centry and put more of your
      chimneys up there, regardless of the fact [He Points through the window]
      that it would utterly ruin the house we've had for generations, and all
      our pleasure here.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. How the man talks! Why! Ye'd think he owned the sky, because
      his fathers built him a house with a pretty view, where he's nothing to do
      but live. It's sheer want of something to do that gives ye your fine
      sentiments, Hillcrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Have the goodness not to charge me with idleness. Dawker&mdash;where
      is he?&mdash;&mdash;[He shows the bureau] When you do the drudgery of your
      works as thoroughly as I do that of my estate&mdash;&mdash; Is it true
      about the Centry?
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Gospel true. If ye want to know, my son Chearlie is buyin' it
      this very minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. [Turning with a start] What do you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Ay, he's with the old lady she wants to sell, an' she'll get
      her price, whatever it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [With deep anger] If that isn't a skin game, Mr. Hornblower, I
      don't know what is.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Ah! Ye've got a very nice expression there. "Skin game!" Well,
      bad words break no bones, an' they're wonderful for hardenin' the heart.
      If it wasn't for a lady's presence, I could give ye a specimen or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Oh! Mr. Hornblower, that need not stop you, I'm sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Well, and I don't know that it need. Ye're an obstruction&mdash;the
      like of you&mdash;ye're in my path. And anyone in my path doesn't stay
      there long; or, if he does, he stays there on my terms. And my terms are
      chimneys in the Centry where I need 'em. It'll do ye a power of good, too,
      to know that ye're not almighty.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. And that's being neighbourly!
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. And how have ye tried bein' neighbourly to me? If I haven't a
      wife, I've got a daughter-in-law. Have Ye celled on her, ma'am? I'm new,
      and ye're an old family. Ye don't like me, ye think I'm a pushin' man. I
      go to chapel, an' ye don't like that. I make things and I sell them, and
      ye don't like that. I buy land, and ye don't like that. It threatens the
      view from your windies. Well, I don't lie you, and I'm not goin' to put up
      with your attitude. Ye've had things your own way too long, and now ye're
      not going to have them any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Will you hold to your word over those cottages?
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. I'm goin' to have the cottages. I need them, and more besides,
      now I'm to put up me new works.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. That's a declaration of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Ye never said a truer word. It's one or the other of us, and I
      rather think it's goin' to be me. I'm the risin' and you're the settin'
      sun, as the poet says.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Touching the bell] We shall see if you can ride rough-shod
      like this. We used to have decent ways of going about things here. You
      want to change all that. Well, we shall do our damnedest to stop you. [To
      FELLOWS at the door] Are the Jackmans still in the house? Ask them to be
      good enough to come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [With the first sign of uneasiness] I've seen these people.
      I've nothing more to say to them. I told 'em I'd give 'em five pounds to
      cover their moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. It doesn't occur to you that people, however humble, like to
      have some say in their own fate?
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. I never had any say in mine till I had the brass, and nobody
      ever will. It's all hypocrisy. You county folk are fair awful hypocrites.
      Ye talk about good form and all that sort o' thing. It's just the
      comfortable doctrine of the man in the saddle; sentimental varnish. Ye're
      every bit as hard as I am, underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. [Who had been standing very still all this time] You flatter us.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Not at all. God helps those who 'elp themselves&mdash; that's
      at the bottom of all religion. I'm goin' to help meself, and God's going
      to help me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. I admire your knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. We are in the right, and God helps&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Don't ye believe it; ye 'aven't got the energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Nor perhaps the conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [Throwing out his forefinger] No, no; 'tisn't conceit to
      believe in yourself when ye've got reason to. [The JACKMAN'S have
      entered.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. I'm very sorry, Mrs. Jackman, but I just wanted you to realise
      that I've done my best with this gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. J. [Doubtfully] Yes, sir. I thought if you spoke for us, he'd feel
      different-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. One cottage is the same as another, missis. I made ye a fair
      offer of five pounds for the moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACKMAN. [Slowly] We wouldn't take fifty to go out of that 'ouse. We
      brought up three children there, an' buried two from it.

    <p>
      MRS. J. [To MRS. HILLCRIST] We're attached to it like, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [To HORNBLOWER.] How would you like being turned out of a place
      you were fond of?
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Not a bit. But little considerations have to give way to big
      ones. Now, missis, I'll make it ten pounds, and I'll send a wagon to shift
      your things. If that isn't fair&mdash;! Ye'd better accept, I shan't keep
      it open.

      MRS. J. We won't take it; eh, George?

      JACKMAN. Not a farden. We come there when we was married.

    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [Throwing out his finger] Ye're very improvident folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Don't lecture them, Mr. Hornblower; they come out of this miles
      above you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [Angry] Well, I was going to give ye another week, but ye'll
      go out next Saturday; and take care ye're not late, or your things'll be
      put out in the rain.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      HILLCRIST. And I never met anyone so pachydermatous.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. What's that, in Heaven's name? Ye needn' wrap it up in long
      words now your good lady's gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [With dignity] I'm not going in for a slanging match. I resent
      your conduct much too deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Look here, Hillcrist, I don't object to you personally; ye
      seem to me a poor creature that's bound to get left with your gout and
      your dignity; but of course ye can make yourself very disagreeable before
      ye're done. Now I want to be the movin' spirit here. I'm full of plans.
      I'm goin' to stand for Parliament; I'm goin' to make this a prosperous
      place. I'm a good-matured man if you'll treat me as such. Now, you take me
      on as a neighbour and all that, and I'll manage without chimneys on the
      Centry. Is it a bargain? [He holds out his hand.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Ignoring it] I thought you said you didn't keep your word when
      it suited you to break it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Now, don't get on the high horse. You and me could be very
      good friends; but I can be a very nasty enemy. The chimneys will not look
      nice from that windie, ye know.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Deeply angry] Mr. Hornblower, if you think I'll take your hand
      after this Jackman business, you're greatly mistaken. You are proposing
      that I shall stand in with you while you tyrannise over the neighbourhood.
      Please realise that unless you leave those tenancies undisturbed as you
      said you would, we don't know each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Well, that won't trouble me much. Now, ye'd better think it
      over; ye've got gout and that makes ye hasty. I tell ye again: I'm not the
      man to make an enemy of. Unless ye're friendly, sure as I stand here I'll
      ruin the look of your place.

    <p>
      There's my car. I sent Chearlie and his wife in it to buy the Centry. And
      make no mistake&mdash;he's got it in his packet. It's your last chance,
      Hillcrist. I'm not averse to you as a man; I think ye're the best of the
      fossils round here; at least, I think ye can do me the most harm socially.
      Come now!

      HILLCRIST. Not if you'd bought the Centry ten times over. Your ways are
      not mine, and I'll have nothing to do with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [Very angry] Really! Is that so? Very well. Now ye're goin' to
      learn something, an' it's time ye did. D'ye realise that I'm 'very nearly
      round ye? [He draws a circle slowly in the air] I'm at Uphill, the works
      are here, here's Longmeadow, here's the Centry that I've just bought,
      there's only the Common left to give ye touch with the world. Now between
      you and the Common there's the high road.
    </p>
    <p>
      I come out on the high road here to your north, and I shall come out on it
      there to your west. When I've got me new works up on the Centry, I shall
      be makin' a trolley track between the works up to the road at both ends,
      so any goods will be running right round ye. How'll ye like that for a
      country place?

        enters, preceding CHARLES, his wife CHLOE, and ROLF. CHARLES is a
        goodish-looking, moustached young man of about twenty-eight, with a
        white rim to the collar of his waistcoat, and spats. He has his hand
        behind CHLOE'S back, as if to prevent her turning tail. She is rather a
        handsome young woman, with dark eyes, full red lips, and a suspicion of
        powder, a little under-dressed for the country. ROLF, mho brings up the
        rear, is about twenty, with an open face and stiffish butter-coloured
        hair. JILL runs over to her father at the window. She has a bottle.]

        blocks him off and engages him in conversation. CHARLES has gone up to
        his father, who has remained maliciously still, where he delivered his
        last speech. CHLOE and ROLF stand awkwardly waiting between the

      hundred, when that fellow Dawker turned up.

      her away. What he said I don't know; but she came back looking wiser than
      an owl; said she'd think it over, thought she had other views.

      HORNBLOWER. Did ye tell her she might have her price?

      of those pictures of Fate, don't you know.

      Heaven's sake, let's fight like gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Catchwords&mdash;sneers! No; we'll play what ye call a skin
      game, Hillcrist, without gloves on; we won't spare each other. Ye look out
      for yourselves, for, begod, after this morning I mean business. And as for
      you, Dawker, ye sly dog, ye think yourself very clever; but I'll have the

      DAWKER. [Grinning] Safe for the moment. The old lady'll put it up to
      auction. Couldn't get her to budge from that. Says she don't want to be
      unneighbourly to either. But, if you ask me, it's money she smells!

    <p>
      MRS. H. I think I only asked you to take her out.

      JILL. Why? Even if she is Old Combustion's daughter-in-law?

      to make. [She looks at DAWKER.]

      JILL. She's all right. Lots of women powder and touch up their lips

      MRS. H. Too upset.

      JILL. It's no good, Dodo. It made me ashamed. It's just as&mdash;as

      is to be&mdash;old Hornblower.

    <p>
      JILL. It's something Dawker's told her; I saw them. I don't like Dawker,
      father, he's so common.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. My dear, we can't all be uncommon. He's got lots of go, You
      must apologise to your mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [Shaking-her clubbed hair] They'll make you do things you don't
      approve of, Dodo, if you don't look out. Mother's fearfully bitter when
      she gets her knife in. If old Hornblower's disgusting, it's no reason we
      should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. So you think I'm capable&mdash;that's nice, Jill!
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. No, no, darling! I only want to warn you solemnly that mother'll
      tell you you're fighting fair, no matter what she and Dawker do.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Smiling] Jill, I don't think I ever saw you so serious.

      JILL. No. Because&mdash;[She swallows a lump in her throat] Well&mdash;I
      was just beginning to enjoy, myself; and now&mdash;everything's going to
      be bitter and beastly, with mother in that mood. That horrible old man!

      your gout, ducky?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Better; lot better.

      you, but not for&mdash;us.

      HILLCRIST. Look here, Jill&mdash;is there anything between you and young
      what's-his-name&mdash;Rolf?

    <p>
      JILL. [Biting her lip] No. But&mdash;now it's all spoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. You can't expect me to regret that.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. I don't mean any tosh about love's young dream; but I do like being
      friends. I want to enjoy things, Dodo, and you can't do that when
      everybody's on the hate. You're going to wallow in it, and so shall I&mdash;oh!
      I know I shall!&mdash;we shall all wallow, and think of nothing but "one
      for his nob."

    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Aren't you fond of your home?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Of course. I love it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Well, you won't be able to live in it unless we stop that
      ruffian. Chimneys and smoke, the trees cut down, piles of pots. Every kind
      of abomination. There! [He points] Imagine! [He points through the French
      window, as if he could see those chimneys rising and marring the beauty of
      the fields] I was born here, and my father, and his, and his, and his.
      They loved those fields, and those old trees. And this barbarian, with his
      "improvement" schemes, forsooth! I learned to ride in the Centry meadows&mdash;prettiest
      spring meadows in the world; I've climbed every tree there. Why my father
      ever sold&mdash;&mdash;! But who could have imagined this? And come at a
      bad moment, when money's scarce.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [Cuddling his arm] Dodo!
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Yes. But you don't love the place as I do, Jill. You youngsters
      don't love anything, I sometimes think.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. I do, Dodo, I do!
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. You've got it all before you. But you may live your life and
      never find anything so good and so beautiful as this old home. I'm not
      going to have it spoiled without a fight.

    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. Sins of the fathers.

    <p>
      JILL. Unto the third and fourth generations. What sin has my father
      committed?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. None, in a way; only, I've often told you I don't see why you should
      treat us as outsiders. We don't like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Well, you shouldn't be, then; I mean, he shouldn't be.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. Father's just as human as your father; he's wrapped up in us, and
      all his "getting on" is for us. Would you like to be treated as your
      mother treated Chloe? Your mother's set the stroke for the other big-wigs
      about here; nobody calls on Chloe. And why not? Why not? I think it's
      contemptible to bar people just because they're new, as you call it, and
      have to make their position instead of having it left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. It's not because they're new, it's because&mdash;if your father
      behaved like a gentleman, he'd be treated like one.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. Would he? I don't believe it. My father's a very able man; he thinks
      he's entitled to have influence here. Well, everybody tries to keep him
      down. Oh! yes, they do. That makes him mad and more determined than ever
      to get his way. You ought to be just, Jill.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. I am just.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. No, you're not. Besides, what's it got to do with Charlie and Chloe?
      Chloe's particularly harmless. It's pretty sickening for her. Father
      didn't expect people to call until Charlie married, but since&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. I think it's all very petty.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. It is&mdash;a dog-in-the-manger business; I did think you were above
      it.

      any more proof against change than anything else.

      ACT II
    </h2>
    <p>
      SCENE I
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        A billiard room in a provincial hotel, where things are bought and sold.
        The scene is set well forward, and is not very broad; it represents the
        auctioneer's end of the room, having, rather to stage Left, a narrow
        table with two chairs facing the audience, where the auctioneer will sit
        and stand. The table, which is set forward to the footlights, is
        littered with green-covered particulars of sale. The audience are in
        effect public and bidders. There is a door on the Left, level with the
        table. Along the back wall, behind the table, are two raised benches
        with two steps up to them, such as billiard rooms often have, divided by
        a door in the middle of a wall, which is panelled in oak. Late September
        sunlight is coming from a skylight (not visible) on to these seats. The
        stage is empty when the curtain goes up, but DAWKERS, and MRS. HILLCRIST
        are just entering through the door at the back.
      </p>

      MRS. H. It begins at three, doesn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. They won't be over-punctual; there's only the Centry selling.
      There's young Mrs. Hornblower with the other boy&mdash; [Pointing] over at
      the entrance. I've got that chap I told you of down from town.

      MRS. H. Ah! make sure quite of her, Dawker. Any mistake would be fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. [Nodding] That's right, ma'am. Lot of peopled&mdash;always spare
      time to watch an auction&mdash;ever remark that? The Duke's agent's here;
      shouldn't be surprised if he chipped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Where did you leave my husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. With Miss Jill, in the courtyard. He's coming to you. In case I
      miss him; tell him when I reach his limit to blow his nose if he wants me
      to go on; when he blows it a second time, I'll stop for good. Hope we
      shan't get to that. Old Hornblower doesn't throw his money away.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. What limit did you settle?
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. Six thousand!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. That's a fearful price. Well, good luck to you, Dawker!
    </p>
    <p>

      like to treat me as a human being.

      MRS. H. Really, if you don't mind, I should like to be left alone just
      now.

        short, brown-faced, common looking man, with clipped grey hair fitting
        him like a cap, and a clipped grey moustache. His lids come down over
        his quick eyes, till he can see you very sharply, and you can hardly see
        that he can see you. He can break into a smile at any moment, which has
        no connection with him, as it were. By a certain hurt look, however,
        when bidding is slow, he discloses that he is not merely an auctioneer,
        but has in him elements of the human being. He can wink with anyone, and
        is dressed in a snug-brown suit, with a perfectly unbuttoned waistcoat,
        a low, turned down collar, and small black and white sailor knot tie.
        While he is settling his papers, the HILLCRISTS settle themselves
        tensely. CHLOE has drunk her water and leaned back again, with the
        smelling salts to her nose. ROLF leans forward in the seat beside her,

    <p>
      A VOICE. [From far back in the centre] And five hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      AUCTIONEER. [Surprised and throwing out his arms towards the voice] And
      five hundred. For nine thousand five hundred. May I have yours, sir? [He
      looks at HORNBLOWER. No response.]

    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Passing his hand over his brow] That's stopped him, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      AUCTIONEER. [Looking at HILLCRIST] For nine thousand five hundred?
      [HILLCRIST shakes his head.] Once more. The Centry, Deepwater, for nine
      thousand five hundred. Once&mdash;[Taps] Twice&mdash;[Taps] [He pauses and
      looks again at HORNBLOWER and HILLCRIST] For the last time&mdash;at nine
      thousand five hundred. [Taps] [With a look towards the bidder] Mr.
      Smalley. Well! [With great satisfaction] That's that! No more to-day,
      gen'lemen.

    <p>
      MRS. H. Smalley? Smalley? Is that the Duke's agent? Jack!
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Coming out of a sort of coma, after the excitement he has been
      going through] What! What!
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Oh, Dodo! How splendidly you stuck it!
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Phew! What a squeak! I was clean out of my depth. A mercy the
      Duke chipped in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. [Looking at ROLF and CHLOE, who are standing up as if about to go]
      Take care; they can hear you. Find DAWKER, Jack.

        strain. The door behind is opened, and HORNBLOWER appears.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Ye ran me up a pretty price. Ye bid very pluckily, Hillcrist.
      But ye didn't quite get my measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Oh! It was my nine thousand the Duke capped. Thank God, the
      Centry's gone to a gentleman!
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. The Duke? [He laughs] No, the Gentry's not gone to a
      gentleman, nor to a fool. It's gone to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. What!
    </p>
    <p>
      HOUNBLOWER. I'm sorry for ye; ye're not fit to manage these things. Well,
      it's a monstrous price, and I've had to pay it because of your obstinacy.
      I shan't forget that when I come to build.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. D'you mean to say that bid was for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Of course I do. I told ye I was a bad man to be up against.
      Perhaps ye'll believe me now.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. A dastardly trick!
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [With venom] What did ye call it&mdash;a skin game? Remember
      we're playin' a skin game, Hillcrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Clenching his fists] If we were younger men&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Ay! 'Twouldn't Look pretty for us to be at fisticuffs. We'll
      leave the fightin' to the young ones. [He glances at ROLF and JILL;
      suddenly throwing out his finger at ROLF] No makin' up to that young
      woman! I've watched ye. And as for you, missy, you leave my boy alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [With suppressed passion] Dodo, may I spit in his eye or something?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Sit down.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [JILL sits down. He stands between her and HORNBLOWER.] [Yu've won this
        round, sir, by a foul blow. We shall see whether you can take any
        advantage of it. I believe the law can stop you ruining my property.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Make your mind easy; it can't. I've got ye in a noose, and I'm
      goin' to hang ye.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. [Suddenly] Mr. Hornblower, as you fight foul&mdash;so shall we.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Amy!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. [Paying no attention] And it will not be foul play towards you and
      yours. You are outside the pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. That's just where I am, outside your pale all round ye. Ye're
      not long for Deepwater, ma'am. Make your dispositions to go; ye'll be out
      in six months, I prophesy. And good riddance to the neighbourhood. [They
      are all down on the level now.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Suddenly coming closer to MRS. HILLCRIST] Here are your salts,
      thank you. Father, can't you&mdash;&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [Surprised] Can't I what?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. Can't you come to an arrangement?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Just so, Mr. Hornblower. Can't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [Looking from one to the other] As we're speakin' out, ma'am,
      it's your behaviour to my daughter-in-law&mdash;who's as good as you&mdash;and
      better, to my thinking&mdash;that's more than half the reason why I've
      bought this property. Ye've fair got my dander up. Now it's no use to
      bandy words. It's very forgivin' of ye, Chloe, but come along!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Quite seriously, Mr. Hornblower, you had better come to an
      arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Mrs. Hillcrist, ladies should keep to their own business.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Amy, do leave it to us men. You young man [He speaks to ROLF]
      do you support your father's trick this afternoon?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

        in.]

    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. My trick? And what dye call it, to try and put me own son
      against me?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [To ROLF] Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. I don't, but&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Trick? Ye young cub, be quiet. Mr. Hillcrist had an agent bid
      for him&mdash;I had an agent bid for me. Only his agent bid at the
      beginnin', an' mine bid at the end. What's the trick in that?
    </p>
    <p>
      [He laughs.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Hopeless; we're in different worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. I wish to God we were! Come you, Chloe. And you, Rolf, you
      follow. In six months I'll have those chimneys up, and me lorries runnin'
      round ye.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Mr. Hornblower, if you build&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [Looking at MRS. HILLCRIST] Ye know&mdash;it's laughable. Ye
      make me pay nine thousand five hundred for a bit o' land not worth four,
      and ye think I'm not to get back on ye. I'm goin' on with as little
      consideration as if ye were a family of blackbeetles. Good afternoon!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. Father!
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Oh, Dodo! He's obscene.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Mr. Hornblower, my compliments.

        opened doorway, are standing DAWKER and a STRANGER. They move just out
        of the way of the exit, looking at CHLOE, who sways and very nearly
        falls.]

    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Why! Chloe! What's the matter?
    </p>

    <p>
      MRS. H. [Who has exchanged a nod with DAWKER and the STRANGER] Mr.
      Hornblower, you build at your peril. I warn you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [Turning round to speak] Ye think yourself very cool and very
      smart. But I doubt this is the first time ye've been up against realities.
      Now, I've been up against them all my life. Don't talk to me, ma'am, about
      peril and that sort of nonsense; it makes no impression. Your husband
      called me pachydermatous. I don't know Greek, and Latin, and all that, but
      I've looked it out in the dictionary, and I find it means thick-skinned.
      And I'm none the worse for that when I have to deal with folk like you.
      Good afternoon.

      old home! It shall be his wash-pot. Over the Centry will he cast his shoe.
      By Gad, Jill, I could cry!
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [Pointing] Look! Chloe's sitting down. She nearly fainted just now.
      It's something to do with Dawker, Dodo, and that man with him. Look at

    <p>
      DAWKER. No mystery.

    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Well, what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. You'd better not ask.

      HILLCRIST. I wish to know.

      MRS. H. Jill, go out and wait for us.

    <p>
      MRS. H. It's not for a girl to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Bosh! I read the papers every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. It's nothin' worse than you get there, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Do you wish your daughter&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. It's ridiculous, Dodo; you'd think I was mother at my age.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. I was not so proud of my knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. No, but you had it, dear.

      MRS. H. It's what's coming after that matters; luckily.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. How do you know this?
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. My friend here [He points to the STRANGER] was one of the agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. It's shocking. I'm sorry I heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. I told you not to.

      STRANGER. Perfectly. I remember her quite well; her name then was&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. I don't want to know, thank you. I'm truly sorry. I wouldn't
      wish the knowledge of that about his womenfolk to my worst enemy. This
      mustn't be spoken of. [JILL hugs his arm.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. It will not be if Mr. Hornblower is wise. If he is not wise, it
      must be spoken of.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. I say no, Amy. I won't have it. It's a dirty weapon. Who
      touches pitch shall be defiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Well, what weapons does he use against us? Don't be quixotic. For
      all we can tell, they know it quite well already, and if they don't they
      ought to. Anyway, to know this is our salvation, and we must use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL: [Sotto voce] Pitch! Dodo! Pitch!
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. The threat's enough! J.P.&mdash;Chapel&mdash;Future member for the
      constituency&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [A little more doubtfully] To use a piece of knowledge about a
      woman&mdash;it's repugnant. I&mdash;I won't do it.

      thought it necessary?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Well&mdash;that perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Then you agree that Mr. Hornblower at least should be told. What
      he does with the knowledge is not our affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Half to the STRANGER and half to DAWKER] Do you realise that
      an imputation of that kind may be ground for a criminal libel action?
    </p>
    <p>
      STRANGER. Quite. But there's no shadow of doubt; not the faintest. You saw
      her just now?

    <p>
      HILLCRIST. I can't bear bringing a woman into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. We don't. If anyone brings her in; it will be Hornblower himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. We use her secret as a lever.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. I tell you quite plainly: I will only consent to holding my tongue
      about her, if you agree to Hornblower being told. It's a scandal to have a
      woman like that in the neighbourhood.

      what to do.

      MRS. H. You must use this knowledge. You owe it to me&mdash;to us all.
      You'll see that when you've thought it over.

    <p>
      JILL. [Softly] Pitch, Dodo, pitch!

    <p>
      MRS. H. [Furiously] Jill, be quiet!

      HILLCRIST. I was brought up never to hurt a woman. I can't do it, Amy&mdash;I
      can't do it. I should never feel like a gentleman again.

      MRS. H. [Coldly] Oh! Very well.

    <p>
      HILLCRIST. What d'you mean by that?

    <p>
      MRS. H. I shall use the knowledge in my own way.

    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Staring at her] You would&mdash;against my wishes?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. I consider it my duty.

    <p>
      HILLCRIST. If I agree to Hornblower being told&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. That's all I want.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. It's the utmost I'll consent to, Amy; and don't let's have any
      humbug about its being, morally necessary. We do it to save our skins.

      MRS. H. I don't know what you mean by humbug?

      DAWKER. [To the STRANGER, with a wink] The Squire's squeamish&mdash;too
      much of a gentleman. But he don't count. The grey mare's all right. You
      wire to Henry. I'm off to our solicitors. We'll make that old rhinoceros

      SCENE II
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        CHLOE's boudoir at half-past seven the same evening. A pretty room. No
        pictures on the walls, but two mirrors. A screen and a luxurious couch
        an the fireplace side, stage Left. A door rather Right of Centre Back;
        opening inwards. A French window, Right forward: A writing table, Right
        Back. Electric light burning. CHLOE, in a tea-gown, is standing by the
        forward end of the sofa, very still, and very pale. Her lips are parted,
        and her large eyes stare straight before them as if seeing ghosts: The
        door is opened noiselessly and a WOMAN'S face is seen. It peers at
        CHLOE, vanishes, and the door is closed. CHLOE raises her hands, covers
        her eyes with them, drops them with a quick gesture, and looks round
        her. A knock. With a swift movement she slides on to the sofa, and lies
        prostrate, with eyes closed.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Feebly] Come in!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Her Maid enters; a trim, contained figure of uncertain years, in a
        black dress, with the face which was peering in.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Yes, Anna?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNA. Aren't you going in to dinner, ma'am?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [With closed eyes] No.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNA. Will you take anything here, ma'am?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. I'd like a biscuit and a glass of champagne.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The MAID, who is standing between sofa and door, smiles. CHLOE, with a
        swift look, catches the smile.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Why do you smile?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNA. Was I, ma'am?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. You know you were. [Fiercely] Are you paid to smile at me?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNA. [Immovable] No, ma'am, Would you like some eau de Cologne on your
      forehead?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. Yes.&mdash;No.&mdash;What's the good? [Clasping her forehead] My
      headache won't go.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNA. To keep lying down's the best thing for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. I have been&mdash;hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNA. [With the smile] Yes, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Gathering herself up on the sofa] Anna! Why do you do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNA. Do what, ma'am?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. Spy on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNA. I&mdash;never! I&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. To spy! You're a fool, too. What is there to spy on?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNA. Nothing, ma'am. Of course, if you're not satisfied with me, I must
      give notice. Only&mdash;if I were spying, I should expect to have notice
      given me. I've been accustomed to ladies who wouldn't stand such a thing
      for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE: [Intently] Well, you'll take a month's wages and go tomorrow. And
      that's all, now.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        again opened stealthily, an inch or too.]

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ROLF. How's the head?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. Beastly, thanks. I'm not going into dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. Is there anything I can do for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. No, dear boy. [Suddenly looking at him] You don't want this quarrel
      with the Hillcrists to go on, do you, Rolf?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. No; I hate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. Well, I think I might be able to stop it. Will you slip round to
      Dawker's&mdash;it's not five minutes&mdash;and ask him to come and see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. Father and Charlie wouldn't&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. I know. But if he comes to the window here while you're at dinner,
      I'll let him in, and out, and nobody'd know.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. [Astonished] Yes, but what I mean how&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. Don't ask me. It's worth the shot that's all. [Looking at her
      wrist-watch] To this window at eight o'clock exactly. First long window on
      the terrace, tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. It's nothing Charlie would mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. No; only I can't tell him&mdash;he and father are so mad about it
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. If there's a real chance&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Going to the window and opening it] This way, Rolf. If you don't
      come back I shall know he's coming. Put your watch by mine. [Looking at
      his watch] It's a minute fast, see!
    </p>
    <p>

        takes out a chemist's prescription.] [ANNA comes in.]

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CHLOE. I don't want that champagne. Take this to the chemist and get him
      to make up some of these cachets quick, and bring them back yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNA. Yes, ma'am; but you have some.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. They're too old; I've taken two&mdash;the strength's out of them.
      Quick, please; I can't stand this head.

      ANNA. [Taking the prescription&mdash;with her smile] Yes, ma'am. It'll
      take some time&mdash;you don't want me?

        her, dives at the secret drawer, takes out a roll of notes and a tissue
        paper parcel. She counts the notes: "Three hundred." Slips them into her
        breast and unwraps the little parcel. It contains pears. She slips them,
        too, into her dress, looks round startled, replaces the drawer, and
        regains her place on the sofa, lying prostrate as the door opens, and
        HORNBLOWER comes in. She does not open her ages, and he stands looking
        at her a moment before speaking.]

    <p>
      CHLOE. Awful head!

      HORNBLOWER: Can ye attend a moment? I've had a note from that woman.

      HORNBLOWER. [Reading] "I have something of the utmost importance to tell
      you in regard to your daughter-in-law. I shall be waiting to see you at
      eleven o'clock to-morrow morning. The matter is so utterly vital to the
      happiness of all your family, that I cannot imagine you will fail to
      come." Now, what's the meaning of it? Is it sheer impudence, or lunacy, or
      what?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [Not unkindly] Chloe, if there's anything&mdash;ye'd better
      tell me. Forewarned's forearmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. There's nothing; unless it's&mdash;[With a quick took at him,]&mdash;
      Unless it's that my father was a&mdash;a bankrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Hech! Many a man's been that. Ye've never told us much about
      your family.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. I wasn't very proud of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Well, ye're not responsible for your father. If that's all,
      it's a relief. The bitter snobs! I'll remember it in the account I've got
      with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. Father, don't say anything to Charlie; it'll only worry him for
      nothing.

    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. No, no, I'll not. If I went bankrupt, it'd upset Chearlie,

      Ye're sure?

    <p>
      CHLOE. [With an effort] She may invent things, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [Lost in his feud feeling] Ah! but there's such a thing as the
      laws o' slander. If they play pranks, I'll have them up for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Timidly] Couldn't you stop this quarrel; father? You said it was
      on my account. But I don't want to know them. And they do love their old
      home. I like the girl. You don't really need to build just there, do you?
      Couldn't you stop it? Do!
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Stop it? Now I've bought? Na, no! The snobs defied me, and I'm
      going to show them. I hate the lot of them, and I hate that little Dawker
      worst of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. He's only their agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. He's a part of the whole dog-in-the-manger system that stands
      in my way. Ye're a woman, and ye don't understand these things. Ye
      wouldn't believe the struggle I've had to make my money and get my
      position. These county folk talk soft sawder, but to get anything from
      them's like gettin' butter out of a dog's mouth. If they could drive me
      out of here by fair means or foul, would they hesitate a moment? Not they!
      See what they've made me pay; and look at this letter. Selfish, mean lot
      o' hypocrites!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. But they didn't begin the quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Not openly; but underneath they did&mdash;that's their way.
      They began it by thwartin' me here and there and everywhere, just because
      I've come into me own a bit later than they did. I gave 'em their chance,
      and they wouldn't take it. Well, I'll show 'em what a man like me can do
      when he sets his mind to it. I'll not leave much skin on them.

      DAWKER. So they don't know about you. That's all right. Now, look here, I
      serve my employer. But I'm flesh and blood, too, and I always give as good
      as I get. I hate this family of yours. There's no name too bad for 'em to
      call me this last month, and no looks too black to give me. I tell you
      frankly, I hate.

      through hell for nothing. Women like me can bite, I tell you.

      because you happen to have a quarrel with a man?

      on my track. I hope they'll know what fear means. I hope they'll love and
      find out that it's hanging on a thread, and&mdash;and&mdash; Oh! you
      coward, you persecuting coward! Call yourself a man!

      DAWKER. [With his grin] Ah! You look quite pretty like that. By George!
      you're a handsome woman when you're roused.

        him.]

    <p>
      CHLOE. Is there anything you'll take, not to spoil my life? [Clasping her
      hands on her breast; under her breath] Me?
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. [Wiping his brow] By God! That's an offer. [He recoils towards the
      window] You&mdash;you touched me there. Look here! I've got to use you and
      I'm going to use you, but I'll do my best to let you down as easy as I
      can. No, I don't want anything you can give me&mdash;that is&mdash;[He
      wipes his brow again] I'd like it&mdash;but I won't take it.

        eyes.]

    <p>
      CHARLES. Well, Clo! Had a sleep, old girl?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. Ye-es.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. [Sitting on the arm of the sofa and caressing her] Feel better,
      dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. Yes, better, Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. That's right. Would you like some soup?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [With a shudder] No.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. I say-what gives you these heads? You've been very on and off all
      this last month.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. I don't know. Except that&mdash;except that I am going to have a
      child, Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. After all! By Jove! Sure?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Nodding] Are you glad?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Well&mdash;I suppose I am. The guv'nor will be mighty pleased,
      anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. Don't tell him&mdash;yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. All right! [Bending over and drawing her to him] My poor girl,
      I'm so sorry you're seedy. Give us a kiss.

      I say, you're like fire. You're not feverish?

    <p>
      CHLOE. [With a laugh] It's a wonder if I'm not. Charlie, are you happy
      with me?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. What do you think?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Leaning against him] You wouldn't easily believe things against
      me, would you?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. What! Thinking of those Hillcrists? What the hell that woman
      means by her attitude towards you&mdash;When I saw her there to-day, I had
      all my work cut out not to go up and give her a bit of my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Watching him stealthily] It's not good for me, now I'm like this.
      It's upsetting me, Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Yes; and we won't forget. We'll make 'em pay for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. It's wretched in a little place like this. I say, must you go on
      spoiling their home?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. The woman cuts you and insults you. That's enough for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Timidly] Let her. I don't care; I can't bear feeling enemies
      about, Charlie, I&mdash;get nervous&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      CHARLES. My dear girl! What is it?

    <p>
      CHLOE. I suppose it's&mdash;being like this. [Suddenly] But, Charlie, do
      stop it for my sake. Do, do!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. [Patting her arm] Come, come; I say, Chloe! You're making
      mountains. See things in proportion. Father's paid nine thousand five
      hundred to get the better of those people, and you want him to chuck it
      away to save a woman who's insulted you. That's not sense, and it's not
      business. Have some pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Breathless] I've got no pride, Charlie. I want to be quiet&mdash;that's
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Well, if the row gets on your nerves, I can take you to the sea.
      But you ought to enjoy a fight with people like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [With calculated bitterness] No, it's nothing, of course&mdash;
      what I want.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Hello! Hello! You are on the jump!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. If you want me to be a good wife to you, make father stop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. [Standing up] Now, look here, Chloe, what's behind this?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Faintly] Behind?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. You're carrying on as if&mdash;as if you were really scared!
      We've got these people: We'll have them out of Deepwater in six months.
      It's absolute ruination to their beastly old house; we'll put the chimneys
      on the very edge, not three hundred yards off, and our smoke'll be
      drifting over them half the time. You won't have this confounded stuck-up
      woman here much longer. And then we can really go ahead and take our
      proper place. So long as she's here, we shall never do that. We've only to
      drive on now as fast as we can.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [With a gesture] I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. [Again looking at her] If you go on like this, you know, I shall
      begin to think there's something you&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE [softly] Charlie! [He comes to her.] Love me!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. [Embracing her] There, old girl! I know women are funny at these
      times. You want a good night, that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. You haven't finished dinner, have you? Go back, and I'll go to bed
      quite soon. Charlie, don't stop loving me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Stop? Not much.

      CHLOE. [Looking round with a little laugh] I don't know. Go on, Charlie.
      I'll be all right when this head's gone.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        HILLCRIST'S study next morning. JILL coming from Left, looks in at the
        open French window.

    <p>
      JILL. [Speaking to ROLF, invisible] Come in here. There's no one.

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [JILL. nodes.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Seeing you yesterday&mdash;it did seem rotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. We didn't begin it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. No; but you don't understand. If you'd made yourself, as father has&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. I hope I should be sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. [Reproachfully] That isn't like you. Really he can't help thinking
      he's a public benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. And we can't help thinking he's a pig. Sorry!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. If the survival of the fittest is right&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. He may be fitter, but he's not going to survive.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. [Distracted] It looks like it, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Is that all you came to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. Suppose we joined, couldn't we stop it?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. I don't feel like joining.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. We did shake hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. One can't fight and not grow bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. I don't feel bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Wait; you'll feel it soon enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. Why? [Attentively] About Chloe? I do think your mother's manner to
      her is&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. Snobbish. [JILL laughs.] She may not be your class; and that's just
      why it's snobbish.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. I think you'd better shut up.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. What my father said was true; your mother's rudeness to her that day
      she came here, has made both him and Charlie ever so much more bitter.

        angrily]

    <p>
      Is it a whistling matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. I suppose you want me to go?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. All right. Aren't we ever going to be friends again?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [Looking steadily at him] I don't expect so.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. That's very-horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Lots of horrible things in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. It's our business to make them fewer, Jill.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [Fiercely] Don't be moral.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. [Hurt] That's the last thing I want to be.&mdash;I only want to be
      friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Better be real first.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. From the big point of view&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. There isn't any. We're all out, for our own. And why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLF. By jove, you have got&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>

      JILL. Cynical? Your father's motto&mdash;"Every man for himself." That's
      the winner&mdash;hands down. Goodbye!

      DAWKER. Now this may come into Court, you know. If there's a screw loose
      anywhere, better mention it. [To SECOND STRANGE] You knew her personally?
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND S. What do you think? I don't, take girls on trust for that sort of
      job. She came to us highly recommended, too; and did her work very well.
      It was a double stunt&mdash;to make sure&mdash;wasn't it, George?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST S. Yes; we paid her for the two visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND S. I should know her in a minute; striking looking girl; had
      something in her face. Daresay she'd seen hard times.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST S. We don't want publicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. Not Likely. The threat'll do it; but the stakes are heavy &mdash;and
      the man's a slugger; we must be able to push it home. If you can both
      swear to her, it'll do the trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND S. And about&mdash;I mean, we're losing time, you know, coming down
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. [With a nod at FIRST STRANGER] George here knows me. That'll be
      all right. I'll guarantee it well worth your while.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND S. I don't want to do the girl harm, if she's married.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. No, no; nobody wants to hurt her. We just want a cinch on this
      fellow till he squeals.

      DAWKER. [Showing document] I've had this drawn and engrossed. Pretty sharp
      work. Conveys the Centry, and Longmeadow; to the Squire at four thousand
      five hundred: Now, ma'am, suppose Hornblower puts his hand to that, hell
      have been done in the eye, and six thousand all told out o' pocket.&mdash;You'll
      have a very nasty neighbour here.

      MRS. H. But we shall still have the power to disclose that secret at any
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. Yeh! But things might happen here you could never bring home to
      him. You can't trust a man like that. He isn't goin' to forgive me, I
      know.

      a hurt. I just mention it because, of course, you can't guarantee that it
      doesn't get out.

      to do as little harm as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [Stopping] Oh! ye do! Well, what lies have ye been hearin'? Or
      what have ye made up? You and Mr. Dawker? Of course ye know there's a law
      of libel and slander. I'm, not the man to stop at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. [Calmly] Are you familiar with the law of divorce, Mr. Hornblower?
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [Taken aback] No, I'm not. That is&mdash;&mdash;-.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Well, you know that misconduct is required. And I suppose you've
      heard that cases are arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. I know it's all very shocking&mdash;what about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. When cases are arranged, Mr. Hornblower, the man who is to be
      divorced often visits an hotel with a strange woman. I am extremely sorry
      to say that your daughter-in-law, before her marriage, was in the habit of
      being employed as such a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Ye dreadful creature!
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. [Quickly] All proved, up to the hilt!
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. I don't believe a word of it. Ye're lyin' to save your skins.
      How dare ye tell me such monstrosities? Dawker, I'll have ye in a criminal
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. Rats! You saw a gent with me yesterday? Well, he's employed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. A put-up job! Conspiracy!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Go and get your daughter-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [With the first sensation of being in a net] It's a foul shame&mdash;a
      lying slander!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. If so, it's easily disproved. Go and fetch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [Seeing them unmoved] I will. I don't believe a word of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. I hope you are right.

    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. That lady [Sneering] there, and her bull-terrier here.

      CHLOE. [Facing MRS. HILLCRIST] That's a charitable thing to say, isn't it?

      got it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. No, Mr. Hornblower. On second thoughts, you must sell. You broke
      your word over the Jackmans. We can't trust you. We would rather have our
      place here ruined at once, than leave you the power to ruin it as and when
      you like. You will sell us the Centry and Longmeadow now, or you know what
      will happen.

        past, comes bank, hesitatingly enters. The cloak, fallen back, reveals a
        white evening dress; and that magpie figure stands poised watchfully in

    <p>
      JILL. There isn't much, Dodo. I was in an awful funk for fear I should
      meet any of the others, and of course I did meet Rolf, but I told him some
      lie, and he took me to her room-boudoir, they call it &mdash;isn't boudoir
      a "dug-out" word?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Meditatively] The sulking room. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. She was sitting like this. [She buries her chin in her hands, wide
      her elbows on her knees] And she said in a sort of fierce way: "What do
      you want?" And I said: "I'm awfully sorry, but I thought you might like
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. She looked at me hard, and said: "I suppose you know all about it."
      And I Said: "Only vaguely," because of course I don't. And she said:
      "Well, it was decent of you to come." Dodo, she looks like a lost soul.
      What has she done?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. She committed her real crime when she married young Hornblower
      without telling him. She came out of a certain world to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Oh! [Staring in front of her] Is it very awful in that world, Dodo?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Uneasy] I don't know, Jill. Some can stand it, I suppose; some
      can't. I don't know which sort she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. One thing I'm sure of: she's awfully fond of Chearlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. That's bad; that's very bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. And she's frightened, horribly. I think she's desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Women like that are pretty tough, Jill; don't judge her too
      much by your own feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. No; only&mdash;&mdash;Oh! it was beastly; and of course I dried up.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Feelingly] H'm! One always does. But perhaps it was as well;
      you'd have been blundering in a dark passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. I just said: "Father and I feel awfully sorry; if there's anything
      we can do&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. That was risky, Jill.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. (Disconsolately) I had to say something. I'm glad I went, anyway. I
      feel more human.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. We had to fight for our home. I should have felt like a traitor
      if I hadn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. I'm not enjoying home tonight, Dodo.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. I never could hate proper; it's a confounded nuisance.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Mother's fearfully' bucked, and Dawker's simply oozing triumph. I
      don't trust him. Dodo; he's too&mdash;not pugilistic&mdash;the other one
      with a pug-naceous.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. He is rather.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. I'm sure he wouldn't care tuppence if Chloe committed suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Rising uneasily] Nonsense! Nonsense!
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. I wonder if mother would.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Turning his face towards the window] What's that? I thought I
      heard&mdash;[Louder]&mdash;Is these anybody out there?

    <p>
      HILLCRIST. [Awkward and expectant] Can I do anything for you?

      CHLOE. I couldn't bear it he's coming to ask you&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Who?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. My husband. [She draws in her breath with a long shudder, then seem
      to seize her courage in her hands] I've got to be quick. He keeps on
      asking&mdash;he knows there's something.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Make your mind easy. We shan't tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Appealing] Oh! that's not enough. Can't you tell him something to
      put him back to thinking it's all right? I've done him such a wrong. I
      didn't realise till after&mdash;I thought meeting him was just a piece of
      wonderful good luck, after what I'd been through. I'm not such a bad lot&mdash;not
      really.

      You see, my father went bankrupt, and I was in a shop&mdash;&mdash;

    </p>

      CHLOE. I never gave a man away or did anything I was ashamed of&mdash;at
      least&mdash;I mean, I had to make my living in all sorts of ways, and then
      I met Charlie.

    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. He thought I was respectable, and that was such a relief, you can't
      think, so&mdash;so I let him.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Dodo! It's awful
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. It is!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. And after I married him, you see, I fell in love. If I had before,
      perhaps I wouldn't have dared only, I don't know&mdash;you never know, do
      you? When there's a straw going, you catch at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Of course you do.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. And now, you see, I'm going to have a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [Aghast] Oh! Are you?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Good God!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Dully] I've been on hot bricks all this month, ever since that day
      here. I knew it was in the wind. What gets in the wind never gets out.
      [She rises and throws out her arms] Never! It just blows here and there
      [Desolately] and then&mdash;blows home. [Her voice changes to resentment]
      But I've paid for being a fool&mdash; 'tisn't fun, that sort of life, I
      can tell you. I'm not ashamed and repentant, and all that. If it wasn't
      for him! I'm afraid he'll never forgive me; it's such a disgrace for him&mdash;and
      then, to have his child! Being fond of him, I feel it much worse than
      anything I ever felt, and that's saying a good bit. It is.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. [Energetically] Look here! He simply mustn't find out.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. That's it; but it's started, and he's bound to keep on because he
      knows there's something. A man isn't going to be satisfied when there's
      something he suspects about his wife, Charlie wouldn't never. He's clever,
      and he's jealous; and he's coming here.

    <p>
      JILL. Dodo, what can we say to put him clean off the scent?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Anything&mdash;in reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Catching at this straw] You will! You see, I don't know what I'll
      do. I've got soft, being looked after&mdash;he does love me. And if he
      throws me off, I'll go under&mdash;that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Have you any suggestion?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Eagerly] The only thing is to tell him something positive,
      something he'll believe, that's not too bad&mdash;like my having been a
      lady clerk with those people who came here, and having been dismissed on
      suspicion of taking money. I could get him to believe that wasn't true.
    </p>
    <p>
      JILL. Yes; and it isn't&mdash;that's splendid! You'd be able to put such
      conviction into it. Don't you think so, Dodo?
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Anything I can. I'm deeply sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. Thank you. And don't say I've been here, will you? He's very
      suspicious. You see, he knows that his father has re-sold that land to
      you; that's what he can't make out&mdash;that, and my coming here this
      morning; he knows something's being kept from him; and he noticed that man
      with Dawker yesterday. And my maid's been spying on me. It's in the air.
      He puts two and two together. But I've told him there's nothing he need
      worry about; nothing that's true.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. What a coil!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. I'm very honest and careful about money. So he won't believe that
      about me, and the old man wants to keep it from Charlie, I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. That does seem the best way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [With a touch of defiance] I'm a true wife to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. Of course we know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. It's all unspeakably sad. Deception's horribly against the
      grain&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHLOE. [Eagerly] When I deceived him, I'd have deceived God Himself&mdash;I
      was so desperate. You've never been right down in the mud. You can't
      understand what I've been through.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Yes, Yes. I daresay I'd have done the same. I should be the
      last to judge.

      MRS. H. Charles Hornblower&mdash;how did it happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. He came to me. I said I knew nothing. He wouldn't take it; went
      for me, abused me up hill and down dale; said he knew everything, and then
      he began to threaten me. Well, I lost my temper, and I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. That's very serious, Dawker, after our promise. My husband is most
      upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. [Sullenly] It's not my fault, ma'am; he shouldn't have threatened
      and goaded me on. Besides, it's got out that there's a scandal; common
      talk in the village&mdash;not the facts, but quite enough to cook their
      goose here. They'll have to go. Better have done with it, anyway, than
      have enemies at your door.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Perhaps; but&mdash;Oh! Dawker, take charge of this. [She hands him
      the deed] These people are desperate&mdash;and&mdash;I'm sot sure of my
      husband when his feelings are worked on.

    <p>
      DAWKER. [At the window, looking to the Left] Hornblower's, I think. Yes,
      he's getting out.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. [Bracing herself] You'd better wait, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. He mustn't give me any of his sauce; I've had enough.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        FELLOWS that the announcement of his name is lost.]

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Give me that deed! Ye got it out of me by false pretences and
      treachery. Ye swore that nothing should be heard of this. Why! me own
      servants know.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. That has nothing to do with us. Your son came and wrenched the
      knowledge out of Mr. DAWKER by abuse and threats; that is all. You will
      kindly behave yourself here, or I shall ask that you be shown out.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Give me that deed, I say! [He suddenly turns on DAWKER] Ye
      little ruffian, I see it in your pocket.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      DAWKER. [Seeing red] Now, look 'ere, 'Ornblower, I stood a deal from your
      son, and I'll stand no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. [To MRS. HILLCRIST] I'll ruin your place yet! [To DAWKER] Ye
      give me that deed, or I'll throttle ye.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He closes on DAWKER, and makes a snatch at the deed. DAWKER, springs at
        him, and the two stand swaying, trying for a grip at each other's
        throats. MRS. HILLCRIST tries to cross and reach the bell, but is shut
        off by their swaying struggle.] [Suddenly ROLF appears in the window,
        looks wildly at the struggle, and seizes DAWKER'S hands, which have
        reached HORNBLOWER'S throat. JILL, who is following, rushes up to him
        and clutches his arm.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JILL. Rolf! All of you! Stop! Look!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [DAWKER'S hand relaxes, and he is swung round. HORNBLOWER staggers and
        recovers himself, gasping for breath. All turn to the window, outside
        which in the moonlight HILLCRIST and CHARLES HORNBLOWER have CHLOE'S
        motionless body in their arms.]

    <p>
      In the gravel pit. She's just breathing; that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. H. Bring her in. The brandy, Jill!
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. No. Take her to the car. Stand back, young woman! I want no
      help from any of ye. Rolf&mdash;Chearlie&mdash;take her up.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      Hillcrist, ye've got me beaten and disgraced hereabouts, ye've destroyed
      my son's married life, and ye've killed my grandchild. I'm not staying in
      this cursed spot, but if ever I can do you or yours a hurt, I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAWKER. [Muttering] That's right. Squeal and threaten. You began it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HILLCRIST. Dawker, have the goodness! Hornblower, in the presence of what
      may be death, with all my heart I'm sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      HORNBLOWER. Ye hypocrite!

      MRS. H. Dawker, please tell Fellows to telephone to Dr. Robinson to go
      round to the Hornblowers at once.

 one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
 (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
 permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
 set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
 copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
 protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

 charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

 rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
 such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
 research.  They may be modified and printed and given away&mdash;you may do
 practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic works

 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
 States.

 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
 copied or distributed:

 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
 1.E.9.

 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm License.

 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
 that

 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
      License.  You must require such a user to return or
      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
      Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
      of receipt of the work.

 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
 Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

 1.F.

 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 your equipment.

 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 people in all walks of life.

 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 particular state visit http://pglaf.org

 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate.

 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
 donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.

 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

      http://www.gutenberg.net

 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
