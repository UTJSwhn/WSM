<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A wish</span> has often been expressed to me that the History
of Rome might be continued, and I have a desire to meet
it, although it is difficult for me, after an interval of thirty
years, to take up again the thread at the point where I
had to let it drop. That the present portion does not
attach itself immediately to the preceding, is a matter of
little moment; the fifth volume would be just as much a
fragment without the sixth as the sixth now is without
the fifth. Besides, I am of opinion that, for the purposes
of the cultured public, in whose minds this History is
intended to promote an intelligent conception of Roman
antiquity, other works may take the place of the Two
Books, which are still wanting between this &#40;the Eighth&#41;
and the earlier ones, more readily than a substitute can be
found for that now issued. The struggle of the Republicans
in opposition to the monarchy erected by Caesar,
and the definitive establishment of the latter, are so well
presented in the accounts handed down to us from
antiquity that every delineation amounts essentially to a
reproduction of their narrative. The distinctive character
of the monarchical rule and the fluctuations of the
monarchy, as well as the general relations of government
influenced by the personality of the individual rulers, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
which the Seventh Book is destined to exhibit, have been
at least subjected to frequent handling. Of what is here
furnished&mdash;the history of the several provinces from the
time of Caesar to that of Diocletian,&mdash;there is, if I am not
mistaken, no comprehensive survey anywhere accessible to
the public to which this work addresses itself; and it is
owing, as it seems to me, to the want of such a survey
that the judgment of that public as to the Roman imperial
period is frequently incorrect and unfair. No doubt such
a separation of these special histories from the general
history of the empire, as is in my opinion a preliminary
requisite to the right understanding of the history of the
imperial period, cannot be carried out completely as
regards various sections, especially for the period from
Gallienus to Diocletian; and in these cases the general
picture, which still remains to be given, will have to supply
what is wanting.</p>

<p>If an historical work in most cases acquires a more
vivid clearness by an accompanying map, this holds in an
especial degree true of our survey of the Empire of three
Continents according to its provinces, and but few of its
readers can have in their hands maps adequate for the purpose.
These will accordingly be grateful, along with me,
to my friend Dr. Kiepert, for having, in the manner and
with the limits suggested by the contents of these volumes,
annexed to them, first of all, a sheet presenting a general
outline of the <em>Orbis Romanus</em>, which serves moreover in
various respects to supply gaps in those that follow, and,
in succession, nine special maps of the several portions of
the empire drawn&mdash;with the exception of sheets 5, 7, 8, 9&mdash;on
the same scale. The ancient geographical names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
occurring in the volumes, and the more important modern
ones, are entered upon the maps; names not mentioned
in the volumes are appended only, in exceptional cases, as
landmarks for the reader&#8217;s benefit. The mode of writing
Greek names followed in the book itself has been displaced
by the Latinising spelling&mdash;for the sake of uniformity&mdash;in
several maps in which Latin names preponderate.
The sequence of the maps corresponds on the whole to
that of the book; only it seemed, out of regard for space,
desirable to present on the same sheet several provinces
such as, <em>e.g.</em> Spain and Africa.</p>

<h2 id="PREFATORY_NOTE">PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the fifth volume of his <cite>Roman History</cite>, issued in 1885,
Mommsen described the Roman provinces as they were
during the first three centuries of our era. It has been
called, by one specially qualified to judge, Otto Hirschfeld,
the best volume of the whole work. It is indeed a
wonderful book. Here Mommsen summed up with
supreme mastery a vast and multifarious mass of detail.
Thousands of inscriptions yielded up their secrets; all
scattered archaeological discoveries found recognition;
the vast and dim areas of the provinces took definite
shape and colour. Now at length it became easy to
discern the true character of the Roman Empire. Our
horizon broadened beyond the backstairs of the Palatine
and the benches of the Curia to the wide lands north and
east and south of the Mediterranean, and we began to
realise the achievements of the Empire&mdash;its long and
peaceable government of dominions extending into three
continents, its gifts of civilisation, language, and citizenship
to almost all its subjects, its creation of a stable and
coherent order out of which rose the Europe of to&ndash;day.
The old theory of an age of despotism and decay was
overthrown. The believer in human nature could now
feel confident that, whatever their limitations and defects,
the men of the Empire wrought for the progress and
happiness of the world.</p>

<p>The book was at once translated into English by, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
at least under the supervision of, the late Dr. W. P.
Dickson, Professor of Divinity in the University of Glasgow.
Twenty&ndash;five years before, the same translator had
rendered the earlier volumes of the history into English,
and rendered them to the satisfaction of all readers. The
translation of the fifth volume was less happy. Its style
was difficult, and its errors&mdash;at least in some chapters&mdash;were
numerous and surprising. The ideal remedy for the
evil would be a fresh version. But the ideal is seldom
attainable in published literature, and good prose translations
are particularly rare. When, therefore, the time
came to reprint the book, it seemed best not to let it again
appear as it was, but to attempt some revision, even though
the existence of stereotyped plates confined that revision
within very narrow limits. I have accordingly altered a
large number of passages where Dr. Dickson&#8217;s rendering
was unintelligible or inaccurate, and I have tried to take
account of the few changes which Mommsen himself
introduced into the original German down to the fifth and
last edition of 1904. In doing this I have had valuable
help, which I desire to acknowledge, from Dr. George
Macdonald. That I have left many defects, both by
accident and by the exigencies of the stereotyped plates,
is inevitable. But the alterations run into several
hundreds, and at any rate &#8220;the government which prohibited
voluntary fireworks&#8221; &#40;freiwillige Feuerwehren&#41;,
the &#8220;tribes who dwelt in hurdles&#8221; &#40;H&uuml;rden&#41;, and the
&#8220;crescents which gave the signal to run away&#8221; &#40;H&ouml;rner&#41;,
and some similar blots have vanished. As the translation
is intended for English readers, I have added some notes
on the chapter relating to Britain. It was far too large a
task to do the same for other chapters. But a few references
may be added here on two general questions. The
results obtained by recent excavations on the Germano&ndash;Raetian
Limes &#40;Chapter IV., pp.&nbsp;152 foll.&#41; have been well <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
summarised in E. Fabricius&#8217; <cite>Die Besitznahme Badens durch
die R&ouml;mer</cite> &#40;Heidelberg, 1905&#41;, in an article by G. Lachenmaier
in the <cite>W&uuml;rttembergische Vierteljahreshefte f&uuml;r Landesgeschichte</cite>
for 1906, and in one by the late Professor
Pelham in the <cite>Transactions</cite> of the Royal Historical
Society, reprinted as Chapter IX. in his collected papers
&#40;Clarendon Press, 1909&#41;. The student should also consult
the excellent <cite>Berichte &uuml;ber die &#8230; r&ouml;misch&ndash;germ. Forschung</cite>
for 1905&ndash;8, edited by Dr. H. Dragendorff &#40;Frankfurt,
1905&ndash;9&#41;. The problem of the Hellenisation of
Syria &#40;Chapter X.&#41; has been treated, with a solution unfavourable
to the Hellenic element, by Theodor N&ouml;ldeke
in the <cite>Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenl&auml;ndischen Gesellschaft</cite>
for 1885 &#40;xxxix. 332&#41;, and the two views have
been compared by Mitteis in his <cite>Reichsrecht und Volksrecht</cite>
&#40;Leipzig, 1891, pp.&nbsp;25 foll.&#41;.</p>

<p>The maps are those prepared by the late Dr. Kiepert
for the original German. Modern and medieval names
are printed in letters slanting backwards; in Maps VIII.
and IX. old Oriental names are included in square
brackets. The presence of a few German terminations
or words on some of the maps will, I hope, cause little
trouble.</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> history of Rome under the Empire presents problems
similar to those encountered in the history of the earlier
Republic.</p>

<p>Such information as may be directly obtained from
literary tradition is not merely without form and colour,
but in fact for the most part without substance. The list of
the Roman monarchs is just about as trustworthy and just
about as instructive as that of the consuls of the republic.
The great crises that convulsed the state may be discerned
in outline; but we are not much better informed
as to the Germanic wars under the emperors Augustus
and Marcus, than as to the wars with the Samnites. The
republican store of anecdote is very much more decorous
than its counterpart under the empire; but the tales
told of Fabricius and of the emperor Gaius are almost
equally insipid and equally mendacious. The internal
development of the commonwealth is perhaps exhibited
in the traditional accounts more fully for the earlier
republic than for the imperial period; in the former
case there is preserved a picture&mdash;however bedimmed and
falsified&mdash;of the changes of political order that were
brought at least to their ultimate issue in the open Forum
of Rome; in the latter case the arrangements are settled
in the imperial cabinet, and come before the public, as a
rule, merely in unimportant matters of form. We must
take into account, moreover, the vast extension of the
sphere of rule, and the shifting of the vital development
from the centre to the circumference. The history of the
city of Rome widens out into that of the country of Italy,
and the latter into that of the Mediterranean world; and
of what we are most concerned to know, we learn the
least. The Roman state of this epoch resembles a mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
tree, the main stem of which, in the course of its decay,
is surrounded by vigorous offshoots pushing their way
upwards. The Roman senate and the Roman rulers soon
came to be drawn from any other region of the empire just
as much as from Italy; the Quirites of this epoch, who have
become the nominal heirs of the world&ndash;subduing legionaries,
have nearly the same relation to the memories of the
olden time as our Knights of St. John have to Rhodes and
Malta; and they look upon their heritage as a right capable
of being turned to profitable account&mdash;as an endowment
provided for the benefit of the poor that shrink from work.</p>

<p>Any one who has recourse to the so&ndash;called authorities
for the history of this period&mdash;even the better among them&mdash;finds
difficulty in controlling his indignation at the telling
of what deserved to be suppressed, and at the suppression
of what there was need to tell. For this epoch was also
one productive of great conceptions and far&ndash;reaching
action. Seldom has the government of the world been
conducted for so long a term in an orderly sequence;
and the firm rules of administration, which Caesar and
Augustus traced out for their successors, maintained their
ground, on the whole, with remarkable steadfastness notwithstanding
all those changes of dynasties and of dynasts,
which assume more than due prominence in a tradition
that looks merely to such things, and dwindles erelong into
mere biographies of the emperors. The sharply&ndash;defined
sections, which&mdash;under the current conception, misled by
the superficial character of such a basis&mdash;are constituted
by the change of rulers, pertain far more to the doings of
the court than to the history of the empire. The carrying
out of the Latin&ndash;Greek civilising process in the form of
perfecting the constitution of the urban community, and
the gradual bringing of the barbarian or at any rate alien
elements into this circle, were tasks, which, from their very
nature, required centuries of steady activity and calm self&ndash;development;
and it constitutes the very grandeur of
these centuries that the work once planned and initiated
found this long period of time, and this prevalence of
peace by land and sea, to facilitate its progress. Old age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
has not the power to develop new thoughts and display
creative activity, nor has the government of the Roman
empire done so; but in its sphere, which those who
belonged to it were not far wrong in regarding as the
world, it fostered the peace and prosperity of the many
nations united under its sway longer and more completely
than any other leading power has ever succeeded in doing.
It is in the agricultural towns of Africa, in the homes of the
vine&ndash;dressers on the Moselle, in the flourishing townships
of the Lycian mountains, and on the margin of the Syrian
desert that the work of the imperial period is to be sought
and to be found. Even now there are various regions of
the East, as of the West, as regards which the imperial
period marks a climax of good government, very modest
in itself, but never withal attained before or since; and,
if an angel of the Lord were to strike the balance whether
the domain ruled by Severus Antoninus was governed with
the greater intelligence and the greater humanity at that
time or in the present day, whether civilisation and national
prosperity generally have since that time advanced or retrograded,
it is very doubtful whether the decision would prove
in favour of the present. But, if we find that this was the
case, we ask of our surviving books for the most part in vain
how it came to be so. They no more give an answer to this
question than the traditional accounts of the earlier republic
explain the mighty phenomenon of the Rome, which, in
the footsteps of Alexander, subdued and civilised the world.</p>

<p>The one void as little admits of being filled up as the
other. But it seemed worth our making the attempt for
once to turn away our eyes from the pictures of the rulers
with their bright or faded, and but too often falsified,
colours, as well as from the task of linking into a semblance
of chronological order fragments that do not fit
each other; and, instead of this, to collect and arrange such
materials as tradition and the monuments furnish for a description
of the Roman provincial government. It seemed
worth while to collate the accounts accidentally preserved
by the one or by the other, to note traces of the process of
growth embedded in its results, and to view the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
institutions in their relation to the individual provinces,
along with the conditions given for each by the nature of
the soil and of the inhabitants, so as to work out by the imagination&mdash;which
is the author of all history as of all poetry&mdash;if
not a complete picture, at any rate a substitute for it.</p>

<p>In this attempt I have not sought to go beyond the
epoch of Diocletian. A summary glance, at the utmost,
into the new government which was then created may
fitly form the keystone of this narrative; to estimate it
fully would require a separate narration and another frame
for its setting&mdash;an independent historical work, carried
out in the large spirit and with the comprehensive glance
of Gibbon, but with a more accurate understanding of
details. Italy and its islands have been excluded; for
the account of these cannot be dissociated from that of
the general government of the empire. The external
history, as it is called, of the imperial period is dealt with
as an integral part of the provincial administration; what
we should call imperial wars were not carried on under
the empire against those outside of its pale, although the
conflicts called forth by the rounding off, or the defence,
of the frontier sometimes assumed such proportions as
to make them seem wars between two powers similar in
kind, and the collapse of the Roman rule in the middle of
the third century, which for some decades seemed as
though it were to become its definitive end, grew out of
the unhappy conduct of frontier&ndash;defence at several places
simultaneously. Our narrative opens with the great work
of pushing forward, and of regulating the frontier towards
the north, which was partly carried out and partly failed
under Augustus. At other points we bring together the
events that occurred on each of the three chief arenas for
frontier&ndash;defence&mdash;the Rhine, the Danube, the Euphrates.
The remainder of the narrative is arranged according to
provinces. Charms of detail, pictures of feeling, sketches
of character, it has none to offer; it is allowable for the
artist, but not for the historian, to reproduce the features
of Arminius. With self&ndash;denial this book has been written;
and with self&ndash;denial let it be read.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="head3">THE NORTHERN FRONTIER OF ITALY.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Northern
boundary
of the
empire. </span><span class="smcap">The</span> Roman Republic extended its territory chiefly by
means of the sea towards the west, south, and east: little
was done towards extending it in the direction, in which
Italy and the two peninsulas dependent upon it to the
west and east are connected with the great mainland of
Europe. The region which lay behind Macedonia was not
subject to the Romans, nor yet even the northern slope of
the Alps; only the inland region behind the south coast
of Gaul had been annexed by Caesar to the empire.
Looking to the position occupied by the empire in general,
this state of things could not be allowed to continue; the
fact that the inert and unstable rule of the aristocracy had
been superseded could not but tell with preeminent effect
in this sphere of action. Caesar had not charged the
heirs of his dictatorial power with the extension of Roman
territory on the north slope of the Alps and on the right
bank of the Rhine so directly as with the conquest of
Britain; but in reality such an enlargement of the bounds
suggested itself far more naturally, and was more necessary,
than the subduing of the transmarine Celts, and we can
readily understand why Augustus took in hand the former
and omitted the latter. The task was divided into three
great sections&mdash;the operations on the northern frontier of
the Graeco&ndash;Macedonian peninsula, in the region of the
middle and lower Danube, in Illyricum; those on the
northern frontier of Italy itself, in the region of the upper
Danube, in Raetia and Noricum; lastly, those on the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
bank of the Rhine, in Germany. Though conducted for
the most part independently, the military political measures
in these regions had yet an inward connection; and,
as they all had their origin from the free initiative of the
Roman government, they can only be understood in their
success or in their partial failure, when they are looked at
from a military and political point of view as a whole.
We shall, therefore, in our account of them, follow the
connection of place rather than the order of time; the
structure, of which they are but parts, is better viewed in
its internal compactness than according to the succession
of the several buildings composing it.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Dalmatian
war. </span>The prelude to this great aggregate of action was
formed by the measures which Caesar the Younger, so
soon as he had his hands free in Italy and Spain, undertook
on the upper coasts of the Adriatic and in the inland
region adjacent to them. In the hundred and fifty years
that had elapsed since the founding of Aquileia, the
Roman merchant had doubtless from that centre possessed
himself more and more of the traffic; yet the state,
directly as such, had made little progress. Considerable
trading settlements had been formed at the chief ports of
the Dalmatian coast, and also, on the road leading from
Aquileia into the valley of the Save, at Nauportus &#40;Upper
Laybach&#41;; Dalmatia, Bosnia, Istria, and Carniola were
deemed Roman territory, and the region along the coast
at least was actually subject; but the founding of towns
in a legal sense still remained to be done, quite as much
as the subduing of the inhospitable interior.</p>

<p>Here, however, another element had to be taken into
account. In the war between Caesar and Pompeius the
native Dalmatians had as decidedly taken part for the
latter as the Roman settlers there had taken the side of
Caesar; even after the defeat of Pompeius at Pharsalus,
and after the Pompeian fleet had been driven from the
Illyrian waters &#40;iv.&nbsp;456&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;434.</span>, the natives continued their
resistance with energy and success. The brave and able
Publius Vatinius, who had formerly taken a very effective
part in these conflicts, was sent with a strong army to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Illyricum, apparently in the year before Caesar&#8217;s death, and
that merely as the vanguard of the main army, with which
the Dictator himself intended to follow in order to overthrow
the Dacians, who just then were putting forth their
rising power &#40;iv.&nbsp;305&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;291.</span>, and to regulate the state of affairs
in the whole domain of the Danube. The execution of
this plan was precluded by the daggers of the assassins.
It was fortunate that the Dacians did not on their part
penetrate into Macedonia; Vatinius himself fought
against the Dalmatians unsuccessfully, and sustained
severe losses. Thereafter, when the republicans took up
arms in the East, the Illyrian army joined that of Brutus,
and for a considerable time the Dalmatians remained free
from attack. After the overthrow of the republicans,
Antonius, to whom, in the partition of the empire, Macedonia
had fallen, caused the insubordinate Dardani in the
north&ndash;west and the Parthini on the coast &#40;eastward from
Durazzo&#41; to be put to rout in the year 715,<span class="sidenote2">39.</span> when the
celebrated orator Gaius Asinius Pollio gained triumphal
honours. In Illyricum, which was under Caesar, nothing
could be done so long as the latter had to direct his whole
power to the Sicilian war against Sextus Pompeius; but
after its successful termination Caesar personally threw
himself with vigour into this task. The small tribes from
Doclea &#40;Cernagora&#41;, as far as the Iapydes &#40;near Fiume&#41;,
were in the first campaign &#40;719&#41;<span class="sidenote2">35.</span> either brought back to
subjection or now for the first time subdued. It was not
a great war with pitched battles of note, but the mountain&ndash;conflicts
with the brave and desperate tribes, and the capture
of the strongholds furnished in part with Roman
appliances of war, formed no easy task; in none of his
wars did Caesar display to an equal extent his own energy
and personal valour. After the toilsome subjugation of
the territory of the Iapydes, he marched in the very same
year along the valley of the Kulpa to the point where it
joins the Save; the strong place Siscia &#40;Sziszek&#41; situated
at that point, the chief place of arms of the Pannonians,
against which the Romans had never hitherto advanced
with success, was now occupied and destined as a basis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
for the war against the Dacians, which Caesar purposed next
to undertake. In the two following years &#40;720, 721&#41;<span class="sidenote2">34,&nbsp;33.</span>, the
Dalmatians, who had for a number of years been in arms
against the Romans, were forced to submit after the fall
of their fortress Promona &#40;Promina, near Dernis, above
Sebenico&#41;. Still more important than these military successes
was the work of peace, which was carried on about
the same time, and which they were intended to secure.
It was doubtless in these years that the ports along the
Istrian and Dalmatian coast, so far as they lay within the
field of Caesar&#8217;s rule, Tergeste &#40;Trieste&#41;, Pola, Iader
&#40;Zara&#41;, Salonae &#40;near Spalato&#41;, Narona &#40;at the mouth of
the Narenta&#41;, as well as Emona &#40;Laybach&#41;, beyond the
Alps, on the route from Aquileia over the Julian Alps
to the Save, obtained, through Caesar&#8217;s successor, some
of them town&ndash;walls, all of them town&ndash;rights. The places
themselves had probably all been already long in existence
as Roman villages; but it was at any rate of essential
importance that they were now inserted on a footing of
equal privilege among the Italian <em>municipia</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Preparation
for the
Dacian
war. </span>The Dacian war was intended to follow; but the civil
war stepped in before it a second time. It summoned the
ruler not to Illyricum, but to the East, and the heavings of the
great decisive struggle between Caesar and Antonius reached
even to the distant region of the Danube. The people of
the Dacians, united and purified by king Burebista
&#40;Boerebistas, iv.&nbsp;305&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;291.</span>, now under king Cotiso, found itself
courted by the two antagonists&mdash;Caesar was even accused
of having sought the king&#8217;s daughter in marriage, and
having offered to him in turn the hand of his five&ndash;year&ndash;old
daughter Julia. It is easy to understand how the Dacian
should, in view of the invasion planned by the father and
ushered in by the son with the fortification of Siscia, have
attached himself to the side of Antonius; and had he done
what people in Rome feared&mdash;had he, while Caesar was
fighting in the East, penetrated from the north into defenceless
Italy; or had Antonius, in accordance with the
proposal of the Dacians, sought the decision of the struggle
not in Epirus but in Macedonia, and drawn thither the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Dacian bands to help him, the fortunes of the war might
perhaps have ended otherwise. But neither the one nor
the other took place; moreover, at that very time the
Dacian state, created by the vigorous hand of Burebista,
again went to pieces; internal troubles, perhaps also the
attacks from the north by the Germanic Bastarnae and by
the Sarmatian tribes that subsequently environed Dacia
on all sides, prevented the Dacians from interfering in the
Roman civil war, in the decision of which their future also
was at stake.</p>

<p>Immediately after that war was decided, Caesar set
himself to regulate the state of things on the lower
Danube. But, partly because the Dacians themselves
were no longer so much to be dreaded as formerly, partly
because Caesar now ruled no longer merely over Illyricum,
but over the whole Graeco&ndash;Macedonian peninsula, the latter
became the primary basis of the Roman operations. Let
us picture to ourselves the peoples, and the relations of
the ruling powers, which Augustus found there.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Macedonian
frontier.</span>Macedonia had been for centuries a Roman province.
As such, it did not reach beyond Stobi to the north and
the Rhodope mountains to the east; but the range of
Rome&#8217;s power stretched far beyond the frontier proper of
the country, although varying in compass and not fixed
in point of form. Approximately the Romans seem to
have been the leading power at that time as far as the
Haemus &#40;Balkan&#41;, while the region beyond the Balkan as
far as the Danube had been possibly trodden by Roman
troops, but was by no means dependent on Rome.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Beyond
the Rhodope mountains the Thracian dynasts, who
were neighbours to Macedonia, especially those of the
Odrysians &#40;ii.&nbsp;309&#41;<span class="sidenote2">ii.&nbsp;290.</span>, to whom the greatest portion of the
south coast and a part of the coast of the Black Sea were
subject, had been brought by the expedition of Lucullus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
&#40;iv.&nbsp;41&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;39.</span> under the Roman protectorate; while the inhabitants
of the more inland territories, especially the Bessi on
the upper Maritza, were perhaps called subjects, but were not
so, and their incursions into the settled territory as well as
retaliatory expeditions into theirs were of constant occurrence.
Thus, about the year 694 <span class="sidenote2">60.</span>, Augustus&#8217; own father,
Gaius Octavius, and in the year 711,<span class="sidenote2">43.</span> during the preparations
for the war against the triumvirs, Marcus Brutus had
fought against them. Another Thracian tribe, the Dentheletae
&#40;in the district of Sofia&#41;, had, even in Cicero&#8217;s time,
on an incursion into Macedonia, threatened to besiege its
capital Thessalonica. With the Dardani, the western
neighbours of the Thracians, a branch of the Illyrian
family, who inhabited southern Servia and the district of
Prisrend, Curio, the predecessor in office of Lucullus, had
fought successfully; and ten years later Cicero&#8217;s colleague
in the consulate, Gaius Antonius, unsuccessfully in the
year 692 <span class="sidenote2">62.</span>. Below the Dardanian territory, again, there
were settled close to the Danube Thracian tribes, the once
powerful but now reduced Triballi in the valley of the
Oescus &#40;in the region of Plewna&#41;, and farther on, along
both banks of the Danube to its mouth, Dacians, or, as on
the right bank of the river they were usually called by the
old national name which was retained also by their Asiatic
kinsmen, Mysians or Moesians, probably in Burebista&#8217;s
time a part of his kingdom, now once more split up into
different principalities. But the most powerful people
between the Balkan and the Danube at that time were the
Bastarnae. We have already on several occasions met
with this brave and numerous race, the eastmost branch of
the great Germanic family &#40;ii.&nbsp;308&#41;<span class="sidenote2">ii.&nbsp;290.</span>. Settled, strictly
speaking, behind the Transdanubian Dacians beyond the
mountains which separate Transylvania from Moldavia, at
the mouths of the Danube and in the wide region from
these to the Dniester, they were themselves outside of the
Roman sphere; but from their ranks especially had both
king Philip of Macedonia and king Mithridates of Pontus
formed their armies, and in this way the Romans had
often already fought with them. Now they had crossed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Danube in great masses, and established themselves north
of the Haemus; in so far as the Dacian war, as planned
by C&aelig;sar the father and then by the son, had doubtless
for its object to gain the right bank of the lower Danube,
it was not less directed against them than against the
Dacian Moesians on the right bank. The Greek coast
towns in the barbarian land, Odessus &#40;near Varna&#41;, Tomis,
Istropolis, hard pressed by these movements of the nations
surging around them, were here as everywhere from the
outset clients of the Romans.</p>

<p>At the time of Caesar&#8217;s dictatorship, when Burebista
was at the height of his power, the Dacians had executed
that fearful devastating raid along the coast as far down
as Apollonia, the traces of which were not yet obliterated
after a century and a half. It may probably have been
this invasion that at first induced Caesar the elder to undertake
the Dacian war; and after that the son now ruled
also over Macedonia, he could not but feel himself under
obligation to interfere here at once and with energy. The
defeat which Cicero&#8217;s colleague, Antonius, had sustained
near Istropolis at the hands of the Bastarnae may be
taken as a proof that these Greeks needed once more the
aid of the Romans.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Subjugation
of
Moesia by
Crassus.</span>In fact soon after the battle of Actium &#40;725&#41;<span class="sidenote2">29.</span> Marcus
Licinius Crassus, the grandson of him who had fallen
at Carrhae, was sent by Caesar to Macedonia as
governor, and charged now to carry out the campaign
that had twice been hindered. The Bastarnae,
who just then had invaded Thrace, submitted without
resistance, when Crassus had them summoned to leave
the Roman territory; but their retreat was not sufficient
for the Roman. He, on his part, crossed the
Haemus,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> at the confluence of the Cibrus &#40;Tzibritza&#41; with
the Danube, defeated the enemy, whose king, Deldo, was
left on the field of battle; and, with the help of a Dacian
prince adhering to the Romans, took prisoners all that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
escaped from the battle and sought shelter in a neighbouring
stronghold. Without offering further resistance the
whole Moesian territory submitted to the conqueror of the
Bastarnae. These returned next year to avenge the
defeat which they had suffered; but they once more succumbed,
and, with them, such of the Moesian tribes as had
again taken up arms. Thus these enemies were once for
all expelled from the right bank of the Danube, and the
latter was entirely subjected to the Roman rule. At the
same time the Thracians not hitherto subject were
chastised, the national shrine of Dionysos was taken from
the Bessi, and the administration of it was entrusted to the
princes of the Odrysians, who generally from that time,
under the protection of the Roman supreme power, exercised,
or were assumed to exercise, supremacy over the
Thracian tribes south of the Haemus. The Greek towns,
moreover, on the coast of the Black Sea were placed
under its protection, and the rest of the conquered territory
was assigned to various vassal&ndash;princes, on whom devolved
accordingly, in the first instance, the protection of the frontier
of the empire;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Rome had no legions of her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
left for these distant regions. Macedonia thereby became
an inland province, which had no further need of military
administration. The goal, which had been contemplated
in those plans of Dacian warfare, was attained.</p>

<p>Certainly this goal was merely a provisional one.
But before Augustus took in hand the definitive regulation
of the northern frontier he applied himself to reorganise
the provinces already belonging to the empire;
more than ten years elapsed over the arrangement of
things in Spain, Gaul, Asia, and Syria. How, when what
was needful in these quarters was done, he set to work on
his comprehensive task, we have now to tell.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Subjugation
of the
Alps.</span>Italy, which bore sway over three continents, was still,
we have said, by no means absolutely master in her
own house. The Alps, which sheltered her on the north,
were in all their extent, from one end to the other, filled
with small and but little civilised tribes of Illyrian, Raetian,
or Celtic nationality, whose territories in part bordered
closely on those of the great towns of the Transpadana&mdash;that
of the Trumpilini &#40;Val Trompia&#41; on the town of Brixia;
that of the Camunni &#40;Val Camonica above the Lago d&#8217;Iseo&#41;
on the town of Bergomum; that of the Salassi &#40;Val d&#8217;Aosta&#41;
on Eporedia &#40;Ivrea&#41;&mdash;and whose neighbourhood was by no
means wont to be peaceful. Often enough conquered and
proclaimed at the Capitol as vanquished, these tribes, in
spite of the laurels of the men of note that triumphed over
them, were constantly plundering the farmers and the
merchants of Upper Italy. The mischief was not to
be checked in earnest until the government resolved to
cross the Alpine chain and bring its northern slope also
under their power; for beyond doubt numbers of these
depredators were constantly streaming over the mountains
to pillage the rich adjoining country. In the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
of Gaul also similar work had to be done; the tribes
in the upper valley of the Rhone &#40;Valais and Vaud&#41;
had indeed been subdued by Caesar, but are also named
among those that gave trouble to the generals of
his son. On the other side, the peaceful border&ndash;districts
of Gaul complained of the constant incursions of the
Raeti. The numerous expeditions arranged by Augustus
on account of these evils do not admit, or require, historical
recital; they are not recorded in the triumphal Fasti and
do not fall under that head, but they gave to Italy for
the first time settled life in the north. We may mention
the subjugation of the already named Camunni in 738<span class="sidenote2">16.</span>
by the governor of Illyria, and that of certain Ligurian
tribes in the region of Nice in 740<span class="sidenote2">14.</span>, because they show
how, even about the middle of the Augustan age, these
insubordinate tribes pressed directly upon Italy. If the
emperor subsequently, in the collective report on his imperial
administration, declared that violence had not been
wrongfully employed by him against any of these small
tribes, this must be understood to the effect that cessions of
territory and change of abode were demanded of them,
and they resisted the demand; only the petty cantonal
union formed under king Cottius of Segusio &#40;Susa&#41; submitted
without a struggle to the new arrangement.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Subjugation
of the
Raeti. </span>The southern slopes and the valleys of the Alps
formed the arena of these conflicts. The establishment of
the Romans on the north slope of the mountains and in
the adjoining country to the northward followed in 739<span class="sidenote2">15.</span>.
The two step&ndash;sons of Augustus reckoned as belonging to
the imperial house, Tiberius the subsequent emperor, and
his brother Drusus, were thereby introduced into the career
of generalship for which they were destined; very secure and
very grateful were the laurels put before them in prospect.
Drusus penetrated from Italy up the valley of the Adige
into the Raetian mountains, and achieved here a first
victory; for the farther advance his brother, then governor
of Gaul, lent him a helping hand from Helvetia; on the
lake of Constance itself the Roman triremes defeated the
boats of the Vindelici; on the emperor&#8217;s day, the 1st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
August 739 <span class="sidenote2">15.</span>, in the vicinity of the sources of the Danube,
fought the last battle, whereby Raetia and the land
of the Vindelici&mdash;that is, the Tyrol, East Switzerland, and
Bavaria&mdash;became thenceforth constituent parts of the
Roman empire. The emperor Augustus had gone in
person to Gaul to superintend the war and the organisation
of the new province. At the point where the Alps
abut on the Gulf of Genoa, on the height above Monaco,
a monument commanding a wide prospect of the Tyrrhene
Sea, and not even yet wholly effaced, was erected some
years later by grateful Italy to the emperor Augustus,
because under his government all the Alpine tribes from
the Upper to the Lower Sea&mdash;the inscription enumerates
forty&ndash;six of them&mdash;had been brought under the power
of the Roman people. It was no more than the simple
truth; and this war was what war ought to be&mdash;the
guardian and the guarantee of peace.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Organisation
of
Raetia.</span>A task more difficult doubtless than that of the war
proper was the organisation of the new territory; the more
especially as considerations of internal policy exerted to
some extent a very disturbing influence on it. Since, as
things stood, the preponderance of military power might not
be located in Italy, the government had to take care that the
great military commands were removed as far as possible
from its immediate vicinity; indeed one of the motives
that conduced to the occupation of Raetia itself was the
desire to remove the command, which probably up to this
time could not have been dispensed with in Upper Italy
itself, definitively away from that region, as was thereupon
actually done. It might most naturally have been expected
that there would be created on the north slope of the
Alps a great centre for the military posts indispensable in
the newly acquired territory; but a course the very opposite
of this was followed. Between Italy on the one hand, and
the great commands on the Rhine and Danube on the
other, there was drawn a girdle of small governorships,
which were not merely all filled up by the emperor, but
were also filled up throughout with men not belonging to
the senate. Italy and the province of southern Gaul were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
separated by the three small military districts of the
Maritime Alps &#40;department of the Maritime Alps and the
province of Cuneo&#41;, the Cottian Alps with Segusio &#40;Susa&#41;
as its chief town, and probably the Graian Alps &#40;East
Savoy&#41;. Among these the second, administered by the
already named cantonal prince, Cottius, and his descendants
for a time under the form of clientship,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> was of most
importance, but they all possessed a certain military
power, and were primarily destined to maintain public
safety in the territory concerned, and above all on the important
imperial highways traversing it. The upper valley
of the Rhone again&mdash;that is, the Valais, and the newly
conquered Raetia&mdash;were placed under a commander of
higher standing not in rank, but doubtless in power;
a corps, relatively speaking, considerable was here for
the time being indispensably requisite. In order, however,
to provide for its being diminished as far as possible,
Raetia was in great measure depopulated by the removal
of its inhabitants. The circuit was closed by the similarly
organised province of Noricum, embracing the largest
part of what is now German Austria. This wide and
fertile region had submitted without substantial resistance
to the Roman rule, probably in the form of a dependent
principality established in the first instance, but with its
prince erelong giving place to the imperial procurator, from
whom, for that matter, he did not essentially differ. Some,
at all events, of the Rhenish and Danubian legions had
their fixed quarters in the immediate neighbourhood, on
the one hand of the Raetian frontier at Vindonissa, on the
other of the Norican frontier at Poetovio, obviously to keep
in check the adjoining province; but in that intermediate
region as little were there armies of the first rank with
legions under senatorial generals, as there were senatorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
governors. The distrust towards the corporation governing
the state alongside of the emperor finds very forcible
expression in this arrangement.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Roads and
colonies in
the Alps.</span>Next to the protection of the peace of Italy the chief
aim of this organisation was to secure its communications
with the north, which were of not less urgent importance
for traffic than in a military point of view. With special
energy Augustus took up this task; and he doubtless
deserved that his name should still live at the present day
in those of Aosta and Augsburg, perhaps also in that of the
Julian Alps. The old coast&ndash;road, which Augustus partly
renewed, partly constructed, from the Ligurian coast
through Gaul and Spain to the Atlantic Ocean, can only
have served purposes of traffic. The road also over the
Cottian Alps, already opened up by Pompeius &#40;iv.&nbsp;28&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;27.</span>,
was finished under Augustus by the already mentioned
prince of Susa, and named after him; in like manner a
trading route, it connects Italy, by way of Turin and Susa,
with the commercial capital of south Gaul, Arelate. But
the military line proper&mdash;the direct connection between
Italy and the camps on the Rhine&mdash;led through the valley
of the Dora Baltea from Italy partly to Lyons the capital
of Gaul, partly to the Rhine. While the republic had confined
itself to bringing into its power the entrance of that
valley by founding Eporedia &#40;Ivrea&#41;, Augustus possessed
himself of it entirely by not merely subjugating its inhabitants&mdash;the
still restless Salassi, with whom he had already
fought during the Dalmatian war&mdash;but extirpating them
outright; 36,000 of them, including 8000 fighting men,
were sold under the hammer into slavery in the market&ndash;place
of Eporedia, and the purchasers were bound not to
grant freedom to any of them within twenty years. The
camp itself, from which his general Varro Murena had
achieved their final defeat in 729<span class="sidenote2">25.</span>, became the fortress,
which, occupied by 3000 settlers taken from the imperial
guard, was to secure the communications&mdash;the town
Augusta Praetoria, the modern Aosta, whose walls and
gates then erected are still standing. It commanded
subsequently two Alpine routes, as well that which led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
over the Graian Alps or Little St. Bernard, along the
upper Is&egrave;re and the Rhone to Lyons, as that which ran
over the Poenine Alps, the Great St. Bernard, to the valley
of the Rhone and to the Lake of Geneva, and thence into
the valleys of the Aar and the Rhine. But it was for the
first of these roads that the town was designed, as it
originally had only gates leading east and west; nor
could this be otherwise, for the fortress was built ten years
before the occupation of Raetia; in those years, moreover,
the later organisation of the camps on the Rhine was not
yet in existence, and the direct connection between the
capitals of Italy and Gaul was altogether of the foremost
importance. In the direction of the Danube we have
already mentioned the laying out of Emona on the upper
Save, on the old trade&ndash;road from Aquileia over the Julian
Alps into the Pannonian territory. This road was at
the same time the chief artery for the military communication
of Italy with the region of the Danube. Lastly,
with the conquest of Raetia was connected the opening of
the route which led from the last Italian town Tridentum
&#40;Trent&#41;, up the Adige valley, to the newly established
Augusta in the land of the Vindelici, the modern Augsburg,
and onward to the upper Danube. Subsequently,
when the son of the general who had first opened up
this region came to reign, this road received the name
of the Claudian highway.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> It furnished the means of
connection, indispensable from a military point of view,
between Raetia and Italy; but in consequence of the
comparatively small importance of the Raetian army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
and doubtless also in consequence of the more difficult
communication, it never had the same importance as the
route of Aosta.</p>

<p>The Alpine passes and the north slope of the Alps
were thus in secure possession of the Romans. Beyond
the Alps there stretched to the east of the Rhine the land
of the Germans; to the south of the Danube that of the
Pannonians and the Moesians. Here, too, soon after the
occupation of Raetia, the offensive was taken, and nearly
contemporaneously in both directions. Let us look first
at what occurred on the Danube.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Erection of
Illyricum. </span>The Danubian region, to all appearance up to 727<span class="sidenote2">27.</span>
administered along with Upper Italy, became then, on the
reorganisation of the empire, an independent administrative
district, Illyricum, under a governor of its own. It
consisted of Dalmatia, with the country behind it, as far as
the Drin&mdash;while the coast farther to the south had for
long belonged to the province of Macedonia&mdash;and of the
Roman possessions in the land of the Pannonians on the
Save. The region between the Haemus and the Danube
as far as the Black Sea, which Crassus had shortly before
brought into dependence on the empire, as well as Noricum
and Raetia, stood in a relation of clientship to Rome, and
so did not belong as such to this province, but withal were
primarily dependent on the governor of Illyricum. Thrace,
north of the Haemus, still by no means pacified, fell, from
a military point of view, to the same district. It was a
continued effect of the original organisation, and one
which subsisted down to a late period, that the whole
region of the Danube from Raetia to Moesia was comprehended
as a customs&ndash;district under the name Illyricum in
the wider sense. Legions were stationed only in Illyricum
proper, in the other districts there were probably no imperial
troops at all, or at the utmost small detachments;
the chief command was held by the proconsul of the new
province coming from the senate; while the soldiers and
officers were, as a matter of course, imperial. It attests
the serious character of the offensive beginning after the
conquest of Raetia, that in the first instance the co&ndash;ruler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Agrippa took over the command in the region of the
Danube, to whom the proconsul of Illyricum had to
become <em>de iure</em> subordinate; and then, when Agrippa&#8217;s
sudden death in the spring of 742<span class="sidenote2">12.</span> broke down this combination,
Illyricum in the following year passed into imperial
administration, and the imperial generals obtained
the chief commands in it. Soon three military centres
were here formed, which thereupon brought about the
administrative division of the Danubian region into three
parts. The small principalities in the territory conquered
by Crassus gave place to the province of Moesia, the
governor of which henceforth, in what is now Servia and
Bulgaria, guarded the frontier against the Dacians and
Bastarnae. In what had hitherto been the province of
Illyricum, a part of the legionaries was posted on the
Kerka and the Cettina, to keep in check the still troublesome
Dalmatians. The chief force was stationed in Pannonia,
on what was then the boundary of the empire, the Save.
This distribution of the legions and organisation of the
provinces cannot be fixed with chronological precision;
probably the serious wars which were waged simultaneously
against the Pannonians and the Thracians, of
which we have immediately to speak, led in the first
instance to the institution of the governorship of Moesia,
and it was not till some time later that the Dalmatian
legions and those on the Save obtained commanders&ndash;in&ndash;chief
of their own.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">First Pannonian
war
of Tiberius.</span>As the expeditions against the Pannonians and the
Germans were, as it were, a repetition of the Raetian
campaign on a more extended scale, so the leaders, who
were put at their head with the title of imperial legates,
were the same&mdash;once more the two princes of the imperial
house, Tiberius, who, in the place of Agrippa, took up the
command in Illyricum, and Drusus, who went to the Rhine,
both now no longer inexperienced youths, but men in the
prime of their years, and well fitted to take in hand severe
work.</p>

<p>Immediate pretexts for the waging of war in the
region of the Danube were not wanting. Marauders from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Pannonia, and even from the peaceful Noricum, carried
pillage in the year 738<span class="sidenote2">16.</span> as far as Istria. Two years thereafter
the Illyrian provincials took up arms against their
masters, and, although they returned to obedience without
offering opposition when Agrippa took over the command
in the autumn of 741<span class="sidenote2">13.</span>, yet immediately after his
death the disturbances are alleged to have begun afresh.
We cannot say how far these Roman accounts correspond
to the truth; certainly the pushing forward of the Roman
frontier, required by the general political situation, formed
the real motive and aim of the war. As to the three
campaigns of Tiberius in Pannonia from 742 to 744<span class="sidenote2">12&nbsp;to&nbsp;10.</span> we
are very imperfectly informed. Their result was stated
by the government as the establishment of the Danube as
the boundary for the province of Illyricum. That this
river was thenceforth looked upon in its whole course as
the boundary of Roman territory, is doubtless correct;
but a subjugation in the proper sense, or even an occupation,
of the whole of this wide domain by no means took
place at that time. The chief resistance to Tiberius was
offered by the tribes already at an earlier date declared
Roman, especially by the Dalmatians; among those first
effectively subdued at that time, the most noted was that
of the Pannonian Breuci on the lower Save. The Roman
armies, during these campaigns, probably did not cross
the Drave, and did not in any case transfer their standing
camp to the Danube. The region between the Save and
Drave was at all events occupied, and the headquarters of
the Illyrian northern army were transferred from Siscia
on the Save to Poetovio &#40;Pettau&#41; on the middle Drave,
while in the Norican region recently occupied the Roman
garrisons reached as far as the Danube at Carnuntum
&#40;Petronell, near Vienna&#41;, at that time the last Norican
town towards the east. The wide and vast region between
the Drave and the Danube, which now forms western
Hungary, was to all appearance at that time not even
militarily occupied. This was in keeping with the whole
plan of the offensive operations that were begun; the
object sought was to be in touch with the Gallic army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
and for the new imperial frontier in the north&ndash;east the
natural base was not Buda, but Vienna.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Thracian
war of Piso.</span>Complementary in some measure to this Pannonian
expedition of Tiberius was that which was simultaneously
undertaken against the Thracians by Lucius Piso, perhaps
the first governor that Moesia had of its own. The
two great neighbouring nations, the Illyrians and the
Thracians, of whom we shall treat more fully in a subsequent
chapter, stood alike at that time in need of
subjugation. The tribes of inland Thrace showed themselves
still more obstinate than the Illyrians, and far from subordinate
to the kings set over them by Rome; in 738<span class="sidenote2">16.</span> a
Roman army had to advance thither and come to the
help of the princes against the Bessi. If we had more
exact accounts of the conflicts waged in the one quarter
as in the other in the years 741 to 743<span class="sidenote2">13&nbsp;to&nbsp;11.</span>, the contemporary
action of the Thracians and Illyrians would perhaps appear
as concerted. Certain it is that the mass of the Thracian
tribes south of the Haemus and presumably also those
settled in Moesia took part in this national war, and that
the resistance of the Thracians was not less obstinate than
that of the Illyrians. It was for them at the same time a
religious war; the shrine of Dionysos,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> taken from the
Bessi and assigned to the Odrysian princes well disposed
to Rome, was not forgotten; a priest of this Dionysos
stood at the head of the insurrection, and it was directed
in the first instance against those Odrysian princes. One
of them was taken and put to death, the other was driven
away; the insurgents, in part armed and disciplined after
the Roman model, were victors in the first engagement
over Piso, and penetrated as far as Macedonia and into the
Thracian Chersonese; fears were entertained for Asia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Ultimately, however, Roman discipline gained the superiority
over these brave opponents; in several campaigns
Piso mastered the resistance, and the command of Moesia,
instituted either already on this occasion or soon afterwards
on &#8220;the Thracian shore,&#8221; broke up the connection
of the Daco&ndash;Thracian peoples, by separating the tribes on
the left bank of the Danube and their kinsmen south of
the Haemus from each other, and permanently secured
the Roman rule in the region of the lower Danube.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Attack of
the Germans. </span>The Germans still more than the Pannonians and
the Thracians gave the Romans occasion to feel that the
existing state of things could not permanently continue.
The boundary of the empire since Caesar&#8217;s time had been
the Rhine from the lake of Constance to its mouth
&#40;iv.&nbsp;258&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;247.</span>. It was not a demarcation of peoples, for already
of old in the north&ndash;east of Gaul the Celts had on various
occasions mingled with Germans, the Treveri and Nervii
would at least gladly have been Germans &#40;iv.&nbsp;244&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;233.</span>, and on
the middle Rhine Caesar himself had provided settlements
for the remnant of the hosts of Ariovistus&mdash;Triboci &#40;in
Alsace&#41; Nemetes &#40;about Spires&#41;, Vangiones &#40;about
Worms&#41;. Those Germans on the left of the Rhine indeed
adhered more firmly to the Roman rule than the Celtic
cantons, and it was not they that opened the gates
of Gaul to their countrymen on the right bank. But
these, long accustomed to predatory raids over the river
and by no means forgetting the half successful attempts
on several occasions to settle there, came unbidden. The
only Germanic tribe beyond the Rhine, which already in
Caesar&#8217;s time had separated from their countrymen and
placed themselves under Roman protection, the Ubii, had
to give way before the hatred of their exasperated
kinsmen and to seek protection and new abodes on the
Roman bank &#40;716&#41;<span class="sidenote2">38.</span>; Agrippa, although personally present
in Gaul, had not been able, amidst the pressure of the
Sicilian war then impending, to help them otherwise, and
had crossed the Rhine merely to effect their transference.
From this settlement of theirs our Cologne subsequently
grew up. Not merely were the Romans trading on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
right bank of the Rhine subjected to various injuries by
the Germans, so that even in 729<span class="sidenote2">25.</span> an advance over the
Rhine was executed, and Agrippa in 734<span class="sidenote2">20.</span> had to expel
from Gaul Germanic hordes that had come thither from
the Rhine; but in 738<span class="sidenote2">16.</span> the further bank was affected by a
more general movement, which terminated in an invasion
on a great scale. The Sugambri on the Ruhr took the
lead, and with them their neighbours the Usipes on the
north in the valley of the Lippe, and the Tencteri on the
south; they attacked the Roman traders sojourning
among them and nailed them to the cross, then crossed
the Rhine, pillaged the Gallic cantons far and wide, and,
when the governor of Germany sent the legate Marcus
<span class="sidenote">Defeat of
Lollius.</span>Lollius with the fifth legion against them, they first cut
off its cavalry and then put the legion itself to disgraceful
flight, on which occasion even its eagle fell into their
hands. After all this they returned unassailed to their
homes. This miscarriage of the Roman army, though
not of importance in itself, was not to be despised in
presence of the Germanic movement and even of the
troublesome feeling in Gaul; Augustus himself went to
the province attacked, and this occurrence may possibly
have been the immediate occasion for the adoption of that
great movement of offence, which, beginning with the
Raetian war in 739<span class="sidenote2">15.</span>, led on to the campaigns of Tiberius
in Illyricum and of Drusus in Germany.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">German
war of
Drusus.</span>Nero Claudius Drusus, born in 716<span class="sidenote2">38.</span> by Livia in the
house of her new husband, afterwards Augustus, and loved
and treated by the latter like a son&mdash;evil tongues said,
as his son&mdash;the very image of manly beauty and of winning
grace in converse, a brave soldier and an able general, a
pronounced panegyrist, moreover, of the old republican
system, and in every respect the most popular prince of the
imperial house, took up, on the return of Augustus to
Italy &#40;741&#41;<span class="sidenote2">13.</span>, the administration of Gaul and the chief
command against the Germans, whose subjugation was
now contemplated in earnest. We have no adequate
means of knowing either the strength of the army then
stationed on the Rhine, or how matters stood with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Germans; this much only is clear that the latter were
not in a position suitably to meet the compact attack.
The region of the Neckar formerly possessed by the Helvetii
&#40;iii.&nbsp;182&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;173.</span>, then for long a debateable border&ndash;land between
them and the Germans, lay desolate and dominated on
the one side by the recently subdued district of the
Vindelici, on the other side by the Germans friendly to
Rome about Strassburg, Spires, and Worms. Farther
northward, in the region of the upper Main, were settled
the Marcomani, perhaps the most powerful of the Suebian
tribes, but from of old at enmity with the Germans of the
middle Rhine. Northward of the Main followed first in
the Taunus the Chatti, farther down the Rhine the already
named Tencteri, Sugambri, and Usipes; behind them
the powerful Cherusci on the Weser, besides a number of
tribes of secondary rank. As it was these tribes on the
middle Rhine, with the Sugambri at their head, that had
carried out that attack on Roman Gaul, the retaliatory
expedition of Drusus was directed mainly against them,
and they too combined for joint resistance to Drusus and
for the institution of a national army to be formed from
the contingents of all these cantons. The Frisian tribes,
however, on the coast of the North Sea did not join the
movement, but persevered in their peculiar isolation.</p>

<p>It was the Germans who assumed the offensive. The
Sugambri and their allies again seized all the Romans
whom they could lay hold of on their bank, and nailed to
the cross the centurions among them, twenty in number.
The allied tribes resolved once more to invade Gaul, and
even divided the spoil beforehand&mdash;the Sugambri were to
obtain the people, the Cherusci the horses, the Suebian
tribes the gold and silver. So they attempted in the
beginning of 742<span class="sidenote2">12.</span> again to cross the Rhine, and hoped for
the support of the Germans on the left bank of the river,
and even for an insurrection of the Gallic cantons just at
that time excited by the unwonted matter of the census.
But the young general took his measures well; he nipped
the movement in the Roman territory before it was well
set agoing, drove back the invaders even as they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
crossing the river, and then crossed the stream on his own
part, in order to lay waste the territory of the Usipes and
Sugambri. This was a repulse for the time; the plan of
the war proper, designed on a grander scale, started from
the acquisition of the North Sea coast and of the mouths
of the Ems and the Elbe. The numerous and valiant tribe
of the Batavi in the delta of the Rhine was soon incorporated&mdash;to
all appearance, at that time and by amicable
concert&mdash;in the Roman empire; with its help a communication
by water was established from the Rhine to the
Zuyder See, and from the latter to the North Sea, which
opened up for the Rhine&ndash;fleet a safer and shorter way to
the mouths of the Ems and Elbe. The Frisians on the
north coast followed the example of the Batavi and likewise
submitted to the foreign rule. It was doubtless still more
the moderate policy than the military preponderance of
the Romans, which paved the way for them here; these
tribes remained almost wholly exempt from tribute, and were
drawn upon for war&ndash;service in a way which did not alarm,
but allured them. From this basis the expedition proceeded
along the coast of the North Sea; in the open sea the
island of Burchanis &#40;perhaps Borchum off East Friesland&#41;
was taken by assault; on the Ems the fleet of boats of
the Bructeri was vanquished by the Roman fleet; Drusus
reached as far as the Chauci at the mouth of the Weser.
The fleet indeed on its return homewards encountered
dangerous and unknown shallows, and, but for the Frisians
affording a safe escort to the shipwrecked army, it would
have been in a very critical position. Nevertheless, by
this first campaign the coast from the mouth of the Rhine
to that of the Weser had been gained for Rome.</p>

<p>After the coast was thus acquired, the subjugation of
the interior began in the next year &#40;743&#41;<span class="sidenote2">11.</span>. It was
materially facilitated by the dissensions among the Germans
of the middle Rhine. For the attack on Gaul attempted
in the previous year the Chatti had not furnished the
promised contingent; in natural, but still far from politic,
anger the Sugambri had suddenly assailed the land of the
Chatti with all their force, and so their own territory as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
well as that of their next neighbours on the Rhine was
occupied without difficulty by the Romans. The Chatti
thereupon submitted to the enemies of their enemies
without resistance; nevertheless, they were directed to
evacuate the bank of the Rhine and to occupy instead of
it that district which the Sugambri had hitherto possessed.
Not less did the powerful Cherusci farther inland on the
middle Weser succumb. The Chauci settled on the lower
stream were now assailed by land as they had been before
by sea; and thus the whole territory between the Rhine
and Weser was taken possession of, at least at the places
of decisive military importance. The return was, indeed,
just as in the previous year, on the point of being almost
fatal; at Arbalo &#40;site unknown&#41; the Romans found themselves
surrounded on all sides in a narrow defile by the
Germans and deprived of their communications; but the
firm discipline of the legions, and the arrogant confidence
of success withal on the part of the Germans, changed
the threatened defeat into a brilliant victory.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> In the
next year &#40;744&#41;<span class="sidenote2">10.</span> the Chatti revolted, indignant at the loss
of their old beautiful home; but now they for their part
remained alone, and were, after an obstinate resistance,
and not without considerable loss, subdued by the Romans
&#40;745&#41;<span class="sidenote2">9.</span>. The Marcomani on the upper Main, who after
the occupation of the territory of the Chatti were next
exposed to the attack, gave way before it, and retired into
the land of the Boii, the modern Bohemia, without interfering
from this point, where they were removed beyond
the immediate sphere of the Roman power, in the conflicts
on the Rhine. In the whole region between the Rhine
and Weser the war was at an end. Drusus was able
in 745<span class="sidenote2">9.</span> to set foot on the right bank of the Weser in
the canton of the Cherusci, and to advance thence to the
Elbe, which he did not cross, and presumably was instructed
not to do so. Several severe combats took
place; successful resistance was nowhere offered.<span class="sidenote">Death of
Drusus.</span> But on
the return&ndash;march, which led apparently up the Saale and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
thence to the Weser, a severe blow befell the Romans, not
through the enemy but through an incalculable misfortune.
The general fell with his horse and broke his
thigh&ndash;bone; after thirty days of suffering he expired in
the distant land between the Saale and Weser,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> which had
never before been trodden by a Roman army, in the arms
of his brother who had hastened thither from Rome, in
the thirtieth year of his age and in the full consciousness of
his vigour and of his successes, long and deeply lamented
by his adherents and the whole people&mdash;perhaps to be
pronounced fortunate, because the gods granted to him to
depart from life young, and to escape the disillusions and
embitterments which tell most painfully on those highest
in station, while his brilliant and heroic figure continues
still to live in the remembrance of the world.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Continuance
of the
war by
Tiberius.</span>In the course of things, as a whole, the death of the
able general made&mdash;as might be expected&mdash;no change.
His brother Tiberius arrived early enough not merely to
close his eyes, but also with his firm hand to bring the
army back and to carry on the conquest of Germany.
He commanded there during the two following years
&#40;746, 747&#41;<span class="sidenote2">8,&nbsp;7.</span>, in the course of which there were no conflicts
on a larger scale, but the Roman troops showed
themselves far and wide between the Rhine and Elbe, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
when Tiberius made the demand that all the countries
should formally acknowledge the Roman rule, and at
the same time declared that he could only accept that
acknowledgment from all the cantons simultaneously,
they complied without exception; last of all the Sugambri,
for whom indeed there was no real peace. What progress
in a military point of view had been made, is
shown by the expedition, falling a little later, of Lucius
Domitius Ahenobarbus. The latter was able, as governor
of Illyricum, probably from Vindelicia as a basis, to assign
to a restless horde of Hermunduri settlements in the land
of the Marcomani itself; and on this expedition he reached
as far as, and beyond, the upper Elbe, without meeting
with resistance.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> The Marcomani in Bohemia were
completely isolated, and the rest of Germany between the
Rhine and Elbe was a Roman province&mdash;though still by
no means reduced to tranquillity.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Camp on
the left
bank of the
Rhine.</span>Of the military&ndash;political organisation of Germany, as
at that time planned, we have but a very imperfect
knowledge, because, on the one hand, there is an utter
want of accurate information as to the arrangements made
in earlier times to protect the Gallic eastern frontier,
and, on the other hand, those made by the two brothers
were in great part destroyed by the subsequent development
of affairs. There was no attempt to move the
Roman frontier&ndash;guard away from the Rhine; to this
matters might perhaps come, but they had not yet done
so. Just as was the case in Illyricum at that time with
the Danube, the Elbe was doubtless the political boundary
of the empire, but the Rhine was the line of frontier&ndash;defence,
and from the camps on the Rhine the connections
in rear ran to the great towns of Gaul and to its ports.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
The great headquarters during these campaigns was what
was afterwards named the &#8220;Old Camp,&#8221; Castra vetera,
&#40;Birten near Xanten&#41;, the first considerable height
below Bonn on the left bank of the Rhine, from a military
point of view corresponding nearly to the modern Wesel
on the right. This place, occupied perhaps since the
beginning of the Roman rule on the Rhine, had been
instituted by Augustus as a stronghold for curbing
Germany; and, if the fortress was at all times the basis
for the Roman defensive on the left bank of the Rhine,
it was not less well chosen for the invasion of the right,
situated, as it was, opposite to the mouth of the Lippe
which was navigable far up, and connected with the right
bank by a strong bridge. The counterpart to this &#8220;Old
Camp,&#8221; at the mouth of the Lippe was probably formed
by that at the mouth of the Main, Mogontiacum, the
modern Mentz, to all appearance a creation of Drusus;
at least the already mentioned cessions of territory imposed
on the Chatti, as well as the constructions in the Taunus
to be mentioned further on, show that Drusus clearly
perceived the military importance of the line of the Main,
and thus also that of its key on the left bank of the
Rhine. If the legionary camp on the Aar was, as it
would seem, instituted to keep the Raeti and Vindelici to
their obedience &#40;<a href="#Page_18">p.&nbsp;18</a>&#41;, it may be presumed to have been
laid out about this time; but then it had merely an outward
connection with the Gallico&ndash;German military arrangements.
The legionary camp at Strassburg hardly reaches
back to so early a time. The line from Mentz to Wesel
formed the basis of the Roman military dispositions.
That Drusus and Tiberius had&mdash;apart from the Narbonese
province which was then no longer imperial&mdash;the governorship
of all Gaul as well as the command of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Rhenish legions, is an ascertained point; apart from
these princes, the civil administration of Gaul may at
that time perhaps have been separated from the command
of the troops on the Rhine, but scarcely
was the latter thus early divided into two co&ndash;ordinate
commands.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Positions
on the right
bank of the
Rhine.</span>Correlative to these military arrangements on the left
bank of the Rhine were those adopted on the right. In
the first place the Romans took possession of the right
bank itself. This step affected above all the Sugambri,
in whose case certainly retaliation for the captured eagle and
the crucified centurions contributed to it. The envoys sent
to declare their submission, the most eminent men of the
nation, were, at variance with the law of nations, treated
as prisoners of war, and perished miserably in the Italian
fortresses. Of the mass of the people, 40,000 were
removed from their homes and settled in the north of
Gaul, where they subsequently, perhaps, meet us under
the name of the Cugerni. Only a small and harmless
remnant of the powerful tribe was allowed to remain in
their old abodes. Suebian bands were also transferred
to Gaul, other tribes were pushed farther into the interior,
such as the Marsi and doubtless also the Chatti; on the
middle Rhine the native population of the right bank was
everywhere dislodged or at any rate weakened. Along
this bank of the Rhine, moreover, fortified posts, fifty in
number, were instituted. In front of Mogontiacum the
territory taken from the Chatti, thenceforth the canton of
the Mattiaci near the modern Wiesbaden, was brought
within the Roman lines, and the height of Taunus strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
fortified.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> But above all the line of the Lippe was taken
possession of from Vetera; of the two military roads
furnished at intervals of a day&#8217;s march with forts, on the
two banks of the river, the one on the right bank at
least is as certainly the work of Drusus as the fortress of
Aliso in the district of the sources of the Lippe, probably
the present village of Elsen, not far from Paderborn,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
is attested to have been so. Moreover, there was the
already mentioned canal from the mouth of the Rhine to
the Zuider See, and a dyke drawn by Lucius Domitius
Ahenobarbus through the marshy flat country between the
Ems and the lower Rhine&mdash;the so&ndash;called &#8220;long bridges.&#8221;
Besides, there were detached Roman posts scattered through
the whole region; such are subsequently mentioned among
the Frisians and the Chauci, and in this sense it may be
correct that the Roman garrisons reached as far as the
Weser and the Elbe. Lastly, the army encamped in winter,
no doubt, on the Rhine; but in summer, even though no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
expeditions properly so called were undertaken, uniformly
in the conquered country, as a rule near Aliso.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Organisation
of the
province
Germany. </span>The Romans, however, did not make mere military
arrangements in the newly acquired domain. The Germans
were urged, like other provincials, to have law
administered to them by the Roman governor, and the
summer expeditions of the general gradually developed
into the usual judicial circuits of the governor. The
accusation and defence of the accused took place in the
Latin language; the Roman advocates and legal assessors
began, on the right as on the left side of the Rhine, their
operations, sorely felt everywhere, but here deeply exasperating
to the barbarians, who were unaccustomed to such
things. Much was lacking to the full carrying out of
the provincial organisation; a formal assessment of taxation,
a regulated levy for the Roman army, were not yet
thought of. But as the new cantonal union had just
been instituted in Gaul in connection with the divine
adoration of the monarch there introduced, a similar
arrangement was made also in the new Germany. When
Drusus consecrated for Gaul the altar of Augustus at
Lyons, the Germans last settled on the left bank of the
Rhine, the Ubii, were not received into this union; but
in their chief place, which, as regards position, was for
Germany nearly what Lyons was for the three Gauls, a
similar altar for the Germanic cantons was erected, the
priesthood of which was, in the year 9, administered by
the young Cheruscan prince Segimundus, son of Segestes.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Retirement
of Tiberius
from the
chief command.</span>Political differences, however, in the imperial family
broke down or interrupted the full military success. The
discord between Tiberius and his stepfather led to the
former resigning the command in the beginning of 748<span class="sidenote2">6.</span>.
The dynastic interest did not allow comprehensive military
operations to be entrusted to other generals than princes
of the imperial house; and after the death of Agrippa
and Drusus, and the retirement of Tiberius, there were
no able generals in that house. Certainly in the ten
years, when governors with the ordinary powers bore
sway in Illyricum and in Germany, the military operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
there may not have undergone so complete an interruption
as they appear to us to have done, seeing that
tradition, with its courtly colouring, does not in its report
deal out equal measure to campaigns conducted by, and
to those conducted without, princes; but the arrest laid
on them was unmistakable, and this itself was a retrogression.
Ahenobarbus, who, in consequence of his alliance
by marriage with the imperial house&mdash;his wife was the
daughter of a sister of Augustus&mdash;had greater freedom
of action than other officers, and who in his Illyrian
governorship had crossed the Elbe without encountering
resistance, afterwards as governor of Germany reaped no
laurels there. Not merely the exasperation, but the
courage also, of the Germans was again rising, and in the
year 2 the country appears again in revolt, the Cherusci
and the Chauci under arms. Meanwhile at the imperial
court death had interposed, and the removal of the young
sons of Augustus had reconciled the latter and Tiberius.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Tiberius
once more
commander
in chief.</span>Scarcely was this reconciliation sealed by his adoption
as a son and proclaimed &#40;4&#41;, when Tiberius resumed
the work where it had been broken off, and once more
in this and in the two following summers &#40;5&ndash;6&#41; led the
armies over the Rhine. It was a repetition of, and an
advance upon, the earlier campaigns. The Cherusci were
brought back to allegiance in the first campaign, the
Chauci in the second; the Cannenefates, adjoining the
Batavi, and not inferior in bravery, the Bructeri, settled
in the region of the sources of the Lippe and on the
Ems, and various other cantons, submitted, as did also
the powerful Langobardi, here first mentioned, dwelling
at that time between the Weser and Elbe. The first
campaign led over the Weser into the interior; in the
second at the Elbe itself the Roman legions confronted
the Germanic general levy on the other bank. From
the year 4 to 5 the Roman army took up, apparently for
the first time, its winter quarters on German soil at Aliso.
All this was attained without any considerable conflicts;
the circumspect conduct of the war did not break resistance,
but made it impossible. This general aimed, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
at unfruitful laurels, but at lasting success. The naval
expedition, too, was repeated; like the first campaign
of Drusus, the last of Tiberius was distinguished by the
navigating of the North Sea. But the Roman fleet
this time advanced farther; the whole coast of the
North Sea, as far as the promontory of the Cimbri, that
is, the extremity of Jutland, was explored by it, and it
then, sailing up the Elbe, joined the land&ndash;army stationed
on the latter. The emperor had expressly forbidden the
crossing of the river; but the tribes beyond the Elbe&mdash;the
Cimbri just named, in what is now Jutland, the Charudes
to the south of them, the powerful Semnones between
the Elbe and the Oder&mdash;were brought at least into relation
to the new neighbours.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Campaign
against
Maroboduus.</span>It might have been thought that the goal was reached.
But one thing was still wanting to the establishment of
the iron ring which was to surround the Great Germany;
it was the establishment of a connection between the
middle Danube and the upper Elbe&mdash;the occupation of the
old home of the Boii, which with its mountain&ndash;cincture
planted itself like a gigantic fortress between Noricum
and Germany. The king Maroboduus, of noble Marcomanian
lineage, but in his youth by prolonged residence
in Rome introduced to its firmer military and political
organisation, had after his return home&mdash;perhaps during
the first campaign of Drusus and the transmigration,
thereby brought about, of the Marcomani from the Main
to the upper Elbe&mdash;not merely raised himself to be prince
of his people, but had also moulded his rule not after the
loose fashion of the Germanic kings, but, one might say,
after the model of the Augustan. Besides his own
people, he ruled over the powerful tribe of the Lugii
&#40;in what is now Silesia&#41;, and the body of his clients must
have extended over the whole region of the Elbe, as the
Langobardi and the Semnones are described as subject
to him. Hitherto he had observed entire neutrality in
presence of the other Germans as of the Romans. He
gave perhaps to the fugitive enemies of the Romans an
asylum in his country, but he did not actively mingle in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
the strife, not even when the Hermunduri had settlements
assigned to them by the Roman governor on Marcomanian
territory &#40;<a href="#Page_31">p.&nbsp;31</a>&#41;, and when the left bank of the Elbe
became subject to the Romans. He did not submit to
them, but he bore all these occurrences without interrupting,
on that account, his friendly relations with the
Romans. By this certainly not magnanimous and scarce
even so much as prudent policy, he had gained this much,
that he was the last to be attacked; after the completely
successful Germanic campaigns in the years 4 and 5 his
turn came. From two sides&mdash;from Germany and Noricum&mdash;the
Roman armies advanced against the Bohemian
mountain&ndash;circle; Gaius Sentius Saturninus, advanced up
the Main, clearing the dense forests from Spessart to
the Fichtelgebirge with axe and fire; while Tiberius in
person, starting from Carnuntum, where the Illyrian
legions had encamped during the winter of the years 5&ndash;6,
advanced against the Marcomani. The two armies,
amounting together to twelve legions, were even in
number so superior as almost to double that of their
opponents, whose fighting force was estimated at 70,000
infantry and 4000 horsemen. The cautious strategy of
the general seemed on this occasion also to have quite
ensured success, when a sudden incident interrupted the
farther advance of the Romans.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Dalmato&ndash;Pannonian
insurrection. </span>The Dalmatian tribes and the Pannonians, at least
of the region of the Save, for a short time obeyed the
Roman governors; but they bore the new rule with an
ever increasing grudge, above all on account of the taxes,
to which they were unaccustomed, and which were relentlessly
exacted. When Tiberius subsequently asked one
of the leaders as to the grounds of the revolt, he answered
that it had taken place because the Romans set not dogs
and shepherds, but wolves, to guard their flocks. Now
the legions from Dalmatia were brought to the Danube,
and the men capable of arms were called out, in order to
be sent thither to reinforce the armies. These troops
made a beginning, and took up arms not for, but against,
Rome. Their leader was one of the Daesitiatae &#40;around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Serajevo&#41;, Bato. The example was followed by the
Pannonians, under the leadership of two Breuci, another
Bato and Pinnes. All Illyricum rose with unheard of
rapidity and unanimity. The number of the insurgent
forces was estimated at 200,000 infantry and 9000
horsemen. The levy for the auxiliary troops, which
had taken place more especially among the Pannonians
to a considerable extent, had diffused more widely a
knowledge of Roman warfare, along with the Roman
language and even Roman culture. Those who had
served as Roman soldiers formed now the nucleus of the
insurrection.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> The Roman citizens settled or sojourning
in large number in the insurgent regions, the merchants,
and above all, the soldiers, were everywhere seized and
slain. The independent tribes, as well as those of the
provinces, entered into the movement. The princes of
the Thracians, entirely devoted to the Romans, certainly
brought their considerable and brave bands to the aid of
the Roman generals; but from the other bank of the
Danube the Dacians, and with them the Sarmatae, broke
into Moesia. The whole wide region of the Danube
seemed to have conspired to put an abrupt end to the
foreign rule.</p>

<p>The insurgents were not disposed to await attack, but
planned an invasion of Macedonia, and even of Italy.
The danger was serious; the insurgents might, by crossing
the Julian Alps, stand in a few days once more before
Aquileia and Tergeste&mdash;they had not yet forgotten the
way thither&mdash;and in ten days before Rome, as the
emperor himself expressed it in the senate, to make
sure at all events of its assent to the comprehensive and
urgent military preparations. In the utmost haste new
forces were raised, and the towns more immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
threatened were provided with garrisons; in like manner
whatever troops could be dispensed with were despatched
to the threatened points. The first to arrive at the spot
was the governor of Moesia, Aulus Caecina Severus, and
with him the Thracian king Rhoemetalces; soon other
troops followed from the transmarine provinces. But above
all Tiberius was obliged, instead of penetrating into
Bohemia, to return to Illyricum. Had the insurgents
waited till the Romans were engaged in the struggle
with Maroboduus, or had the latter made common cause
with them, the position might have been a very critical
one for the Romans. But the former broke loose too
early, and the latter, faithful to his system of neutrality,
condescended just at this time to conclude peace with the
Romans on the basis of the <em>status quo</em>. Thus Tiberius
had, no doubt, to send back the Rhine&ndash;legions, because
Germany could not possibly be denuded of troops, but
he could unite his Illyrian army with the troops arriving
from Moesia, Italy, and Syria, and employ it against the
insurgents. In fact the alarm was greater than the
danger. The Dalmatians, indeed, broke repeatedly into
Macedonia and pillaged the coast as far as Apollonia;
but there was no invasion of Italy, and the fire was soon
confined to its original hearth.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the work of the war was not easy; here,
as everywhere, the renewed overthrow of the subjects was
more laborious than the subjugation itself. Never in the
Augustan period was such a body of troops ever united
under the same command; already in the first year of
the war the army of Tiberius consisted of ten legions
along with the corresponding auxiliary forces, and in
addition numerous veterans who had again joined of their
own accord and other volunteers, together about 120,000
men; later he had fifteen legions united under his
banners.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> In the first campaign &#40;6 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&#41; the contest was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
waged with very varying fortune; the large places, like
Siscia and Sirmium, were successfully protected against
the insurgents, but the Dalmatian Bato fought as obstinately
and in part successfully against the governor of
Pannonia, Marcus Valerius Messalla, the orator&#8217;s son, as
his Pannonian namesake against Aulus Caecina governor
of Moesia. The petty warfare above all gave much
trouble to the Roman troops. Nor did the following
year &#40;7&#41;, in which along with Tiberius his nephew the
young Germanicus appeared on the scene of war, put an
end to the ceaseless conflicts. It was not till the third
campaign &#40;8&#41; that the Romans succeeded in subduing in
the first instance the Pannonians, chiefly, as it would seem,
through the circumstance that their leader, gained over by
the Romans, induced his troops all and sundry to lay
down their arms at the river Bathinus, and surrendered his
colleague in the supreme command, Pinnes, to the Romans,
for which he was recognised by them as prince of the
Breuci. Punishment indeed soon befell the traitor; his
Dalmatian namesake caught him and had him executed,
and once more the revolt blazed up among the Breuci;
but it was speedily extinguished again, and the Dalmatian
was confined to the defence of his own home. There
Germanicus and other leaders of division had in this, as in
the following year &#40;9&#41;, to sustain vehement conflicts in the
several cantons; in the latter year the Pirustae &#40;on the
borders of Epirus&#41; and the canton to which the leader
himself belonged, the Daesitiatae, were subdued, one bravely
defended stronghold being reduced after another. Once
more in the course of the summer Tiberius himself took
the field, and set in motion all his fighting force against
the remains of the insurrection. Even Bato, shut up by
the Roman army in the strong Andetrium &#40;Much, above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Salonae&#41;, his last place of refuge, gave up the cause as
lost. He left the town, when he could not induce the
desperadoes to submit, and yielded himself to the victor,
with whom he found honourable treatment; he was
relegated as a political prisoner to Ravenna, where he
died. Without their leader the troops still for a time
continued the vain struggle, till the Romans captured the
fort by assault&mdash;it is probably this day, the 3d August, that
is recorded in the Roman calendar as the anniversary of
the victory achieved by Tiberius in Illyricum.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Dacian war
of Lentulus.</span>Retribution fell also on the Dacians beyond the
Danube. Probably at this time, after the Illyrian war was
decided in favour of Rome, Gnaeus Lentulus led a strong
Roman army across the Danube, reached as far as the
Marisus &#40;Marosch&#41; and emphatically defeated them in
their own country, which was then for the first time
trodden by a Roman army. Fifty thousand captive
Dacians were made to settle in Thrace.</p>

<p>Men of later times termed the &#8220;Batonian war&#8221; of the
years 6&ndash;9 the most severe which Rome had to sustain
against an external foe since that of Hannibal. It
inflicted severe wounds on the Illyrian land; in Italy
the joy over the victory was boundless when the young
Germanicus brought the news of the decisive success to
the capital. The exultation did not last long; almost
simultaneously with the news of this success there came
to Rome accounts of a defeat, such as reached the ears
of Augustus but once in his reign of fifty years&mdash;a defeat
which was still more significant in its consequences than
in itself.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Germanic
rising. </span>The state of things in the province of Germany has
been already set forth. The recoil which follows on any
foreign rule with the inevitableness of a natural event,
and which had just set in in the Illyrian land, was in
preparation also among the cantons of the middle Rhine.
The remnants of the tribes settled immediately on the
Rhine were indeed quite discouraged; but those dwelling
farther back, especially the Cherusci, Chatti, Bructeri,
Marsi, were less injuriously affected and by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
powerless. As always in such cases, there was formed in
every canton a party of the compliant friends of the
Romans, and a national party preparing in secret a
renewed rising. The soul of the latter was a young man
of twenty&ndash;six years, of the Cheruscan princely house,
Arminius son of Sigimer; he and his brother Flavus had
received from the emperor Augustus the gifts of Roman
citizenship and of equestrian rank,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> and both had fought
with distinction as officers in the last Roman campaigns
under Tiberius; the brother was still serving in the
Roman army and had established a home for himself in
Italy. Naturally Arminius also was regarded by the
Romans as a man specially to be trusted; the accusations,
which his better informed countryman Segestes brought
forward against him, availed not to shake this confidence
in view of the well&ndash;known hostility subsisting between the
two. Of the further preparations we have no knowledge;
that the nobility and especially the noble youth took the
side of the patriots, was a matter of course, and found
clear expression in the fact that Segestes&#8217;s own daughter,
Thusnelda, in spite of the prohibition of her father,
married Arminius, while her brother Segimundus and
Segestes&#8217;s brother Segimer, as well as his nephew Sesithacus,
played a prominent part in the insurrection. It
had not a wide range, far less than that of the Illyrian
rising; it can scarcely in strictness be called a Germanic
revolt; the Batavi, the Frisii, the Chauci on the coast took
no part in it, as little such of the Suebian tribes as were
under Roman rule, still less king Maroboduus; in reality
only those Germans rose who had some years previously
leagued themselves against Rome, and against whom the
offensive of Drusus was primarily directed. The Illyrian
rising doubtless promoted the ferment in Germany, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
there is no trace of any thread of connection between
the two similar and almost contemporary insurrections;
had such a connection subsisted the Germans would
hardly have waited to strike till the Pannonian rising
had been overpowered and the very last strongholds in
Dalmatia were surrendering. Arminius was the brave
and shrewd, and above all things fortunate, leader in the
conflict of despair over the lost national independence&mdash;nothing
less, but also nothing more.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Varus.</span>It was more the fault of the Romans than the merit
of the insurgents, if the plan of the latter succeeded.
So far, certainly, the Illyrian war had an effect on Germany.
The able generals, and to all appearance also the
experienced troops, had been moved from the Rhine to
the Danube. The Germanic army was apparently not
diminished, but the greatest part of it consisted of new
legions formed during the war. Still worse was its position
as to leaders. The governor, Publius Quinctilius
Varus,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> was, no doubt, the husband of a niece of the
emperor, and a man of ill&ndash;acquired, but princely, wealth
and of princely arrogance, but inert in body and obtuse
in mind, and without any military gifts or experience&mdash;one
of those many Romans in high station who, in consequence
of an adherence to the old mixture of administrative
functions with those of higher command, wore
the general&#8217;s scarf after the model of Cicero. He knew
not how to spare nor yet to see through the new subjects;
oppression and exaction were practised, as had been the
wont of his earlier governorship over the patient Syria;
the headquarters swarmed with advocates and clients; and
in grateful humility the conspirators especially received
judgment and justice at his hands, while the net was being
drawn more and more closely around the arrogant praetor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>The position of the army was what was then the
normal one. There were at least five legions in the province,
two of which had their winter&ndash;quarters at Mogontiacum,
three in Vetera or else in Aliso. The latter had
taken up their summer encampment in the year 9 on the
Weser. The natural route of communication from the
upper Lippe to the Weser leads over the low chain of
heights of the Osning and of the Lippe Forest, which
separates the valley of the Ems from that of the Weser,
through the D&ouml;ren defile into the valley of the Werra,
which falls into the Weser at Rehme, not far from Minden.
Here therefore, approximately, the legions of Varus at
that time were encamped. As a matter of course this
summer camp was connected with Aliso, the base of the
Roman position on the right bank of the Rhine, by a
road supplied with depots. The good season of the year
came to its close, and they were making ready for the
return march, when the news came that a neighbouring
canton was in revolt; and Varus resolved, instead of leading
back the army by that depot&ndash;route, to take a circuit
and by the way to bring back the rebels to allegiance.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> So
they set out; the army consisted, after numerous reductions,
of three legions and nine divisions of troops of the
second class, together about 20,000 men.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
army had removed to a sufficient distance from its line of
communication, and penetrated far enough into the pathless
country, the confederates in the neighbouring cantons
rose, cut down the small divisions of troops stationed
among them, and broke forth on all sides from the defiles
and woods against the army of Varus on its march.
Arminius and the most notable leaders of the patriots had
remained to the last moment at the Roman headquarters
to make Varus secure. On the very evening before
the day on which the insurrection burst forth they had
supped in the general&#8217;s tent with Varus; and Segestes,
when announcing the impending outbreak of the revolt,
had adjured the general to order the immediate arrest
of himself as well as of the accused, and to await the justification
of his charge by the facts. The confidence of
Varus was not to be shaken. Arminius rode away from
table to the insurgents, and was next day before the
ramparts of the Roman camp. The military situation
was neither better nor worse than that of the army of
Drusus before the battle at Arbalo, and than had, under
similar circumstances, often been the plight of Roman
armies. The communications were for the moment lost;
the army, encumbered with heavy baggage in a pathless
country and at a bad rainy season in autumn, was separated
by several days&#8217; march from Aliso; the assailants were
beyond doubt far superior in number to the Romans. In
such cases it is the solid quality of the troops that is decisive;
and, if the decision here for once was unfavourable
to the Romans, the result was doubtless mostly due to
the inexperience of the young soldiers, and especially to
the want of head and of courage in the general. After
the attack took place the Roman army continued its
march, now beyond doubt in the direction of Aliso, amidst
constantly increasing pressure and increasing demoralisation.
Even the higher officers failed in part to do their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
duty; one of them rode away from the field of battle
with all the cavalry, and left the infantry to sustain the
conflict alone. The first to despair utterly was the general
himself; wounded in the struggle, he put himself to death
before the matter was finally decided, so early indeed, that
his followers still made an attempt to burn the dead body
and to withdraw it from being dishonoured by the enemy.
A number of the superior officers followed his example.
Then, when all was lost, the leader that was left surrendered,
and thereby put out of his own power what remained
open to these last&mdash;an honourable soldier&#8217;s death.
Thus perished the Germanic army in one of the valleys of
the mountain&ndash;range that bounds the region of M&uuml;nster, in
the autumn of the year 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> The eagles fell&mdash;all three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
of them&mdash;into the enemy&#8217;s hand. Not a division cut its
way through, not even those horsemen who had left their
comrades in the lurch; only a few who were isolated and
dispersed were able to effect their escape. The captives,
especially the officers and the advocates, were fastened to
the cross, or buried alive, or bled under the sacrificial knife
of the German priests. The heads cut off were nailed as a
token of victory to the trees of the sacred grove. Far and
wide the land rose against the foreign rule; it was hoped
that Maroboduus would join the movement; the Roman
posts and roads on the whole right bank of the Rhine
fell without further trouble into the power of the victors.
Only in Aliso, the brave commandant Lucius Caedicius,
not an officer, but a veteran soldier, offered a resolute resistance,
and his archers were enabled to make the encampment
before the walls so annoying to the Germans,
who possessed no weapons for distant fighting, that they
converted the siege into a blockade. When the last
stores of the besieged were exhausted, and still no relief
came, Caedicius broke out one dark night; and this remnant
of the army, though burdened with numerous women and
children, and suffering severe losses through the assaults
of the Germans, in reality ultimately reached the camp at
Vetera. Thither also the two legions stationed in Mentz
under Lucius Nonius Asprenas had gone on the news of the
disaster. The resolute defence of Aliso, and the rapid
intervention of Asprenas, hindered the Germans from
following up the victory on the left bank of the Rhine,
and perhaps the Gauls from rising against Rome.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Tiberius
again on the
Rhine. </span>The defeat was soon compensated, in so far as the
Rhine army was immediately not simply made up to its
strength, but considerably reinforced. Tiberius once more
took up the supreme command, and though for the year
following on the battle of Varus &#40;10&#41; the history of the
war had no combats to record, it is probable that arrangements
were then made for the occupation of the Rhine&ndash;frontier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
by eight legions, and simultaneously for the division
of this command into that of the upper army, with Mentz
as its headquarters, and that of the lower with the headquarters
at Vetera, an arrangement, as a whole, which
thereupon remained normal for centuries. It could not
but be expected that this increase of the army of the
Rhine would be followed by the energetic resumption of
operations on the right bank. The Romano&ndash;German
conflict was not a conflict between two powers equal in
the political balance, in which the defeat of the one might
justify the conclusion of an unfavourable peace; it was
the conflict of a great civilised and organised state against
a brave but, in a political and military aspect, barbarous
nation, in which the ultimate result was settled from the
first, and an isolated failure in the plan as sketched might
as little produce any change as the ship gives up its voyage
because a gust of wind drives it out of its course. But it
was otherwise. Tiberius, doubtless, went across the Rhine
in the following year &#40;11&#41;, but this expedition did not
resemble the former one. He remained during the
summer on that side, and celebrated the emperor&#8217;s birthday
there, but the army kept to the immediate neighbourhood
of the Rhine, and of expeditions on the Weser and
on the Elbe there was nothing said. Evidently the object
was only to show to the Germans that the Romans still
knew how to find the way into their country, and perhaps
also to make such arrangements on the right bank of
the Rhine as the change of policy required.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Germanicus
on the
Rhine. </span>The great command embracing both armies was retained,
and retained accordingly in the imperial house.
Germanicus had already exercised it in the year 11 along
with Tiberius; in the following year &#40;12&#41;, when the
administration of the consulate detained him in Rome,
Tiberius commanded alone on the Rhine; with the beginning
of the year 13 Germanicus took up the sole
command. The state of things was regarded as one of
war with the Germans; but these were years of inaction.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
The fiery and ambitious hereditary prince bore with
reluctance the constraint imposed on him, and we can
understand how, as an officer, he should not forget the
three eagles in the hands of the enemy, and how, as
the son of Drusus, he should wish to re&ndash;erect his structure
that had been destroyed. Soon the opportunity presented
itself, and he took it. On the 19th August of the year
14, the emperor Augustus died. The first change in
the throne of the new monarchy did not pass over without
a crisis, and Germanicus had opportunity of proving by
deeds to his father that he was disposed to maintain
allegiance to him. But at the same time he found in it
warrant for resuming, even unbidden, the long&ndash;wished&ndash;for
invasion of Germany; he declared that he had by this
fresh campaign to repress the not inconsiderable ferment
that had been called forth among the legions upon the
change of sovereign. Whether this was a real reason or
a pretext we know not, and perhaps he did not himself
know. The commandant of the Rhine army could not
be debarred from crossing the frontier anywhere, and it
always to a certain degree depended on himself how far
he should proceed against the Germans. Perhaps too, he
believed that he was acting in the spirit of the new ruler,
who had at least as much claim as his brother to the
name of conqueror of Germany, and whose announced
appearance in the camp on the Rhine might, doubtless, be
conceived of, as though he were coming to resume the conquest
of Germany broken off at the bidding of Augustus.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Renewed
offensive.</span>However this may be, the offensive beyond the
Rhine began anew. Even in the autumn of the year 14,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Germanicus in person led detachments of all the legions
at Vetera over the Rhine, and penetrated up the Lippe
pretty far into the interior, laying waste the country far
and wide, putting to death the natives, and destroying
the temples, such as that of Tanfana held in high honour.
Those assailed&mdash;chiefly Bructeri, Tubantes, and Usipes,&mdash;sought
to prepare the fate of Varus for the crown&ndash;prince
on his way home; but the attack recoiled before the
energetic bearing of the legions. As this advance met
with no censure, but on the contrary, thanks and marks
of honour were decreed to the general for it, he went
farther. In the opening of the year 15 he assembled
his main force, in the first instance on the middle Rhine,
and advanced in person from Mentz against the Chatti
as far as the upper confluents of the Weser, while the
lower army, farther to the north, attacked the Cherusci
and the Marsi. There was a certain justification for this
proceeding in the fact that the Cherusci favourably
disposed towards Rome, who had, under the immediate
impression of the disaster of Varus, been obliged to join
the patriots, were now again at open variance with the
much stronger national party, and invoked the intervention
of Germanicus. He was actually successful in liberating
Segestes, the friend of the Romans, when hard pressed by
his countrymen, and at the same time in getting possession
of his daughter, the wife of Arminius. Segestes&#8217;
brother Segimerus, once the leader of the patriots by the
side of Arminius, submitted. The internal dissensions of
the Germans once more paved the way for the foreign
rule. In the very same year Germanicus undertook his
main expedition to the region of the Ems; Caecina
marched from Vetera to the upper Ems, while he in
person went thither with the fleet from the mouth of the
Rhine; the cavalry moved along the coast through the
territory of the faithful Frisians. When reunited the
Romans laid waste the country of the Bructeri and the
whole territory between the Ems and Lippe, and thence
made an expedition to the disastrous spot where, six
years before, the army of Varus had perished, to erect a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
monument to their fallen comrades. On their farther
advance the Roman cavalry were allured by Arminius and
the exasperated hosts of the patriots into an ambush, and
would have been destroyed had not the infantry come up
and prevented greater mischief. More serious dangers
attended the return homeward from the Ems, which
followed at first the same routes as the march thither.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Retreat of
Caecina.</span>The cavalry arrived at the winter camp uninjured. Seeing
that the fleet was not sufficient for conveying the infantry
of four legions, owing to the difficulty of navigation&mdash;it
was about the time of the autumnal equinox&mdash;Germanicus
disembarked two of them and made them return along
the shore; but inadequately acquainted with the ebbing
and flowing of the tide at this season of the year, they
lost their baggage and ran the risk of being drowned <em>en
masse</em>. The retreat of the four legions of Caecina from
the Ems to the Rhine resembled exactly that of Varus;
indeed, the difficult, marshy country offered perhaps still
greater difficulties than the defiles of the wooded hills.
The whole mass of natives, with the two princes of
the Cherusci, Arminius and his highly esteemed uncle
Inguiomerus, at their head, threw themselves on the
retreating troops in the sure hope of preparing for them
the same fate, and filled the morasses and woods all
around. But the old general, experienced in forty years&#8217;
of war service, remained cool even in the utmost peril,
and kept his despairing and famishing men firmly in
hand. Yet even he might not perhaps have been able
to avert the mischief but for the circumstance that, after
a successful attack during the march, in which the
Romans lost a great part of their cavalry and almost the
whole baggage, the Germans, sure of victory and eager
for spoil, in opposition to Arminius&#8217; advice, followed the
other leader, and instead of further surrounding the enemy,
attempted directly to storm the camp. Caecina allowed
the Germans to come up to the ramparts, but then burst
forth from all posterns and gates with such vehemence
upon the assailants that they suffered a severe defeat, and
in consequence of it the further retreat took place without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
material hindrance. Those at the Rhine had already
given up the army as lost, and were on the point of
casting off the bridge at Vetera, to prevent the Germans
at least from penetrating into Gaul; it was only the
resolute remonstrance of a woman, the wife of Germanicus
and daughter of Agrippa, which frustrated the desperate
and disgraceful resolve.</p>

<p>The resumption of the subjugation of Germany thus
began not quite successfully. The territory between the
Rhine and Weser had indeed been again trodden and
traversed, but the Romans had no decisive results to
show, and the enormous loss in material, particularly in
horses, was sorely felt, so that, as in the times of Scipio,
the towns of Italy and of the western provinces took part
in patriotic contributions to make up for what was lost.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Campaign
of the year
16.</span>For the next campaign &#40;16&#41; Germanicus changed his
plan of warfare. He attempted the subjugation of Germany
on the basis of the North Sea and the fleet, partly because
the tribes on the coast, the Batavi, Frisians, and Chauci,
adhered more or less to the Romans, partly in order to
shorten the marches&mdash;in which much time was spent and
much loss incurred&mdash;from the Rhine to the Weser and
Elbe and back again. After he had employed this
spring, like the previous one, for rapid advances on the
Main and on the Lippe, he, in the beginning of summer,
embarked his whole army at the mouth of the Rhine in
the powerful transport&ndash;fleet of 1000 sail which had meanwhile
been made ready, and actually arrived without loss
at the mouth of the Ems, where the fleet remained.
Thence he advanced, as may be conjectured, up the Ems
as far as the mouth of the Haase, and then along the
latter as far up as the Werra&ndash;valley, and through this to
the Weser. By this means the carrying of the army,
80,000 strong, through the Teutoburg Forest, which was
attended with great difficulties, particularly as to provisions,
was avoided. A secure reserve for supplies was furnished
in the camp beside the fleet, and the Cherusci on the
right bank of the Weser were assailed in flank instead
of in front. Here the Romans encountered the levy <em>en masse</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
of the Germans, again led by the two chiefs of the
patriot party, Arminius and Inguiomerus. What warlike
resources were at their disposal is shown by the fact that
on two occasions, one shortly after the other, in the
Cheruscan country&mdash;first on the Weser itself and then
somewhat farther inland<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>&mdash;they fought in the open field
against the whole Roman army, and in both hardly
contested the victory. The latter certainly fell to the
Romans, and of the German patriots a considerable
number were left on the fields of battle. No prisoners
were taken, and both sides fought with extreme exasperation.
The second tropaeum of Germanicus spoke of
the overthrow of all the Germanic tribes between the
Rhine and Elbe; the son placed this campaign of his
alongside of the brilliant campaigns of his father, and
reported to Rome that in the next campaign he should
have the subjugation of Germany complete. But Arminius
escaped, although wounded, and continued still at the
head of the patriots; and an unforeseen mischief marred
the success won by arms. On the return home, which
the greater part of the legions made by sea, the transport&ndash;fleet
encountered the autumn storms of the North Sea.
The vessels were dashed on all sides upon the islands of
the North Sea, and as far as the British coasts. A great
portion were destroyed, and those that escaped had for
the most part to throw horses and baggage overboard,
and to be glad of saving their bare life. The loss of
vessels was, as in the times of the Punic war, equivalent
to a defeat. Germanicus himself, cast adrift alone with
the admiral&#8217;s ship on the desolate shore of the Chauci,
was in despair at this misfortune, and on the point of
seeking his death in that ocean the assistance of which
he had at the beginning of this campaign invoked so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
earnestly and so vainly. Doubtless afterwards the loss
of men proved not to be quite so great as it had at first
appeared, and some effective blows which the general, on
his return to the Rhine, inflicted on the nearest barbarians,
raised the sunken courage of the troops. But, taken as
a whole, the campaign of the year 16, as compared with
that of the preceding year, ended in more brilliant victories
doubtless, but also in much more serious loss.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The altered
situation.</span>The recall of Germanicus was at the same time the
abolition of the command&ndash;in&ndash;chief of the Rhenish army.
The mere division of the command put an end to the
conduct of the war as heretofore pursued; the circumstance
that Germanicus was not merely recalled, but
obtained no successor, was tantamount to ordaining the
defensive on the Rhine. Thus the campaign of the year 16
was the last which the Romans waged in order to subdue
Germany and to transfer the boundary of the empire from
the Rhine to the Elbe. That this was the aim of the
campaigns of Germanicus is shown by their very course,
and by the trophy that celebrated the frontier of the
Elbe. The re&ndash;establishment, too, of the military works on
the right bank of the Rhine, of the forts of the Taunus,
as well as of the stronghold of Aliso and the line connecting
it with Vetera, belonged only in part to such an
occupation of the right bank as was in keeping with the
restricted plan of operations after the battle of Varus; in
fact it had a far wider scope. But the designs of the
general were not, or not quite, those of the emperor. It is
more than probable that Tiberius from the outset allowed
rather than sanctioned the enterprises of Germanicus on
the Rhine, and it is certain that he wished to put an end
to them by recalling him in the winter of 16&ndash;17. Beyond
doubt, at the same time, a good part of what had been attained
was given up, and in particular the garrison was withdrawn
from Aliso. As Germanicus, even in the following
year, found not a stone left of the memorial of victory erected
in the Teutoburg Forest, so the results of his victories disappeared
like a flash of lightning into the water, and none
of his successors continued the building on this basis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Motives for
the change
of policy.</span>If Augustus gave up the conquered Germany as lost
after the battle of Varus, and if Tiberius now, when the
conquest had once more been taken in hand, ordered it
to be broken off, we are well entitled to ask, What
motives guided the two notable rulers in this course,
and what was the significance of these important events
for the general policy of the empire?</p>

<p>The battle of Varus is an enigma, not in a military
but in a political point of view&mdash;not in its course, but in
its consequences. Augustus was not wrong when he
demanded back his lost legions, not from the enemy nor
from fate, but from the general; it was a disaster such as
unskilled leaders of division from time to time bring about
for every state. We have difficulty in conceiving that
the destruction of an army of 20,000 men without further
direct military consequences should have given a decisive
turn to the policy at large of a judiciously governed universal
empire. And yet the two rulers bore that defeat
with a patience as unexampled as it was critical and
hazardous for the position of the government in relation
to the army and to its neighbours; they allowed the
conclusion of peace with Maroboduus, which, beyond
doubt, was meant to be in strictness a mere armistice, to
become withal definitive, and made no further attempt
to get the upper valley of the Elbe into their hands. It
must have been no easy thing for Tiberius to see the
collapse of the great structure begun in concert with his
brother, and after the latter&#8217;s death almost completed by
himself; the energetic zeal with which, as soon as he had
again entered on the government, he took up the Germanic
war which he had begun ten years ago, enables us
to measure what this self&ndash;denial must have cost him. If,
nevertheless, the self&ndash;denial was persevered in not merely
by Augustus, but also after his death by Tiberius himself,
there is no other reason to be found for it than
that they recognised the plans pursued by them for
twenty years for the changing of the boundary to the
north as incapable of execution, and the subjugation
and mastery of the region between the Rhine and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Elbe appeared to them to transcend the resources of
the empire.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Elbe
frontier.</span>If the previous boundary of the empire ran from the
middle Danube up to its source and to the upper Rhine,
and thence down that river, it was, at all events, materially
shortened and improved by being shifted to the
Elbe, which in its head&ndash;waters approaches the middle
Danube, and to its course throughout; in which case,
probably, besides the evident military gain, there came
into view also the political consideration that the keeping
of the great commands as far as possible remote from
Rome and Italy was one of the leading maxims of the
Augustan policy, and an army of the Elbe would hardly
have played such a part in the further development of
Rome as the armies of the Rhine but too soon undertook.
The preliminary conditions to this end, the overthrow of
the Germanic patriot&ndash;party and of the Suebian king in
Bohemia, were no easy tasks; nevertheless they had
already once stood on the verge of succeeding, and with
a right conduct of the war these results could not fail to
be reached. But it was another question whether, after the
institution of the Elbe frontier, the troops could be withdrawn
from the intervening region; this question had
been raised in a very serious way for the Roman government
by the Dalmato&ndash;Pannonian war. If the mere impending
movement of the Roman Danube&ndash;army into
Bohemia had called forth a popular rising in Illyricum,
that was only put down by the exertion of all their military
resources after a four years&#8217; conflict, this wide region
might not be left to itself either at the time or for many
years to come. Similar, doubtless, was the state of the
case on the Rhine. The Roman public was wont, indeed,
to boast that the state held all Gaul in subjection by
means of the garrison at Lyons 1200 strong; but the
government could not forget that the two great armies on
the Rhine not merely warded off the Germans, but also
had a very material bearing on the Gallic cantons that were
not at all distinguished by submissiveness. Stationed on
the Weser or even on the Elbe, they would not have rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
this service in equal measure; and to keep both
the Rhine and the Elbe occupied was beyond their power.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">And its
abandonment.</span>Thus Augustus might well come to the conclusion
that with the strength of the army as it then stood&mdash;considerably
increased indeed of late, but still far below the
measure of what was really requisite&mdash;that great regulation
of the frontier was not practicable; the question was thus
converted from a military one into one of internal policy,
and especially into one of finance. Neither Augustus nor
Tiberius ventured to increase still further the expense of
the army. We may blame them for not doing so. The
paralysing double blow of the Illyrian and the Germanic
insurrections with their grave disasters, the great age and
the enfeebled vigour of the ruler, the increasing disinclination
of Tiberius for initiating any fresh and great undertaking,
and above all any deviation from the policy of
Augustus, doubtless co&ndash;operated to induce this result, and
did so, perhaps, to the injury of the state. By the demeanour
of Germanicus, not to be approved but easily to
be explained, we perceive how keenly the soldiers and the
youth felt the abandonment of the new province of Germany.
In the poor attempt to retain, at least nominally,
the lost Germany with the help of the two German cantons
on the left of the Rhine, and in the ambiguous
and uncertain words with which Augustus himself in his
account of the case lays or forgoes claim to Germany as
Roman, we discern how perplexed was the attitude of the
government towards public opinion in this matter. The
grasping at the frontier of the Elbe was a mighty, perhaps
a too bold stroke, undertaken possibly by Augustus&mdash;who
did not generally soar so high&mdash;only after years of hesitation,
and doubtless not without the determining influence
of the younger stepson who was in closest intercourse
with him. But to retrace too bold a step is, as a rule,
not a mending of the mistake, but a second mistake.
The monarchy had need of warlike honour unstained and
of unconditional warlike success, in quite another way than
the former burgomaster&ndash;government; the absence of the
numbers 17, 18, and 19&mdash;never filled up since the battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
of Varus&mdash;in the roll of regiments, was little in keeping
with military prestige, and the peace with Maroboduus,
on the basis of the <em>status quo</em>, could not be construed by
the most loyal rhetoric into a success. The assumption
that Germanicus began those far&ndash;reaching enterprises in
opposition to the strict orders of his government is forbidden
by his whole political position; but the reproach that
he made use of his double position, as supreme commander
of the first army of the Rhine and as future successor
to the throne, in order to carry out at his own hand his
politico&ndash;military plans, is one from which he can as little
be exempted as the emperor from the no less grave reproach
of having started back perhaps from the forming, or perhaps
only from the clear expression and the sharp execution,
of his own resolves. If Tiberius at least allowed the
resumption of the offensive, he must have felt how much
was to be said for a more vigorous policy; he may perhaps,
as over&ndash;considerate people do, have left the decision,
so to speak, to destiny, till at length the repeated and
severe misfortunes of the crown&ndash;prince once more justified
the policy of despair. It was not easy for the government
to bid an army halt which had brought back two of the
three lost eagles; but it was done. Whatever may have
been the real and the personal motives, we stand here at
a turning&ndash;point in national destinies. History, too, has its
flow and its ebb; here, after the tide of Roman sway over
the world has attained its height, the ebb sets in. Northward
of Italy the Roman rule had for a few years reached
as far as the Elbe; since the battle of Varus its bounds
were the Rhine and the Danube. A legend&mdash;but an old
one&mdash;relates that the first conqueror of Germany, Drusus,
on his last campaign at the Elbe, saw a vision of a
gigantic female figure of Germanic mould, that called
to him in his own language the word &#8220;Back!&#8221; The word
was not spoken, but it was fulfilled.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Germans
against
Germans.</span>Nevertheless the defeat of the Augustan policy, as
the peace with Maroboduus and the sufferance of the
Teutoburg disaster may well be termed, was hardly a victory
of the Germans. After the battle with Varus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
hope must doubtless have passed through the minds of
the best, that a certain union of the nation would accrue
from the glorious victory of the Cherusci and their allies,
and from the retiring of the enemy in the west as in the
south. Perhaps in these very crises the feeling of unity
may have dawned on the Saxons and Suebians formerly
confronting each other as strangers. The fact that the
Saxons sent from the battle&ndash;field the head of Varus to
the king of the Suebians, can be nothing but the savage
expression of the thought that the hour had come for all
Germans to throw themselves in joint onset upon the
Roman empire, and thus to secure the frontier and the
freedom of their land, as they could alone be secured, by
striking down the hereditary foe in his own home. But
the cultured man and the politic king accepted the gift of
the insurgents only in order to forward the head to the
emperor Augustus for burial; he did nothing for, but also
nothing against, the Romans, and persevered unshaken in
his neutrality. Immediately after the death of Augustus
there were fears at Rome of the Marcomani invading
Raetia, but apparently without cause; and when Germanicus
thereupon resumed the offensive against the
Germans from the Rhine, the mighty king of the Marcomani
looked on inactive. This policy of finesse or of
cowardice dug its own grave amidst a Germanic world
fiercely excited, and drunk with patriotic successes and
hopes. The more remote Suebian tribes but loosely connected
with the empire, the Semnones, Langobardi, and
Gothones, declared off from the king, and made common
cause with the Saxon patriots; it is not improbable that
the considerable forces, which were evidently at the disposal
of Arminius and Inguiomerus in the conflicts with Germanicus,
flowed to them in great part from these quarters.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Fall of
Maroboduus.</span>Soon afterwards, when the Roman attack was suddenly
broken off, the patriots turned &#40;17&#41; to assail Maroboduus,
perhaps to assail the kingly office in general, at
least as the latter administered it on the Roman model.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
But even among themselves divisions had set in; the
two nearly related Cheruscan princes, who in the last
struggles had led the patriots, if not victoriously, at any
rate bravely and honourably, and had hitherto constantly
fought shoulder to shoulder, no longer stood together in
this war. The uncle Inguiomerus no longer tolerated his
being second to his nephew, and at the outbreak of the
war passed to the side of Maroboduus. Thus matters
came to a decisive battle between Germans and Germans,
nay, between the same tribes; for Suebi as well as Cherusci
fought in both armies. Long the conflict wavered; both
armies had learned from the Roman tactics, and on both
sides the passion and the exasperation were alike. Arminius
did not achieve a victory properly so called, but his
antagonist left to him the field of battle; and, as Maroboduus
seemed to have fared the worst, those who
had hitherto adhered to him left him, and he found himself
confined to his own kingdom. When he asked for
Roman aid against his overpowerful countrymen, Tiberius
reminded him of his attitude after the battle of Varus,
and replied that now the Romans in turn would remain
neutral. His fate was rapidly decided. In the very
following year &#40;18&#41; he was surprised in his royal abode
itself by a prince of the Gothones, Catualda, to whom he
had formerly given personal offence, and who had thereupon
revolted from him with the other non&ndash;Bohemian
Suebi; and, abandoned by his own people, he with difficulty
made his escape to the Romans, who granted to him
the asylum which he sought&mdash;he died many years afterwards,
as a Roman pensioner, at Ravenna.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">End of
Arminius.</span>Thus the opponents as well as the rivals of Arminius
had become refugees, and the Germanic nation looked to
none else than to him. But this greatness was his danger
and his destruction. His own countrymen, especially his
own clan, accused him of going the way of Maroboduus
and of desiring to be not merely the first, but also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
lord and the king of the Germans&mdash;whether with reason or
not, and whether, if he wished this, he did not perhaps wish
what was right, who can say? The result was a civil war
between him and these representatives of popular freedom;
two years after the banishment of Maroboduus he too,
like Caesar, fell by the dagger of nobles of republican
sentiments near to his person. His wife Thusnelda and
his son born in captivity, Thumelicus, on whom he had
never set eyes, marched at the triumph of Germanicus
&#40;26th May, 17&#41; among the other Germans of rank, in
chains to the Capitol; the old Segestes was for his fidelity
to the Romans provided with a place of honour, whence
he might look on at the public entry of his daughter and
his grandson. They all died within the Roman empire;
with Maroboduus the wife and son of his antagonist met
in the exile of Ravenna. When Tiberius remarked at
the recall of Germanicus that there was no need to wage
war against the Germans, and that they would of themselves
take care to do what was requisite for Rome, he
knew his adversaries; in this, at all events, history has
pronounced him right. But to the high&ndash;spirited man
who, at the age of six&ndash;and&ndash;twenty, had released his Saxon
home from the Italian foreign rule, who thereafter had
been general as well as soldier in a seven years&#8217; struggle
for that freedom regained, who had staked not merely
person and life, but also wife and child for his nation,
to fall at the age of thirty&ndash;seven by an assassin&#8217;s hand&mdash;to
this man his people gave, what it was in their power
to give, an eternal monument in heroic song.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="head3">SPAIN.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Conclusion
of the conquest.</span><span class="smcap">The</span> accidents of external policy caused the Romans to
establish themselves on the Pyrenaean peninsula earlier
than in any other part of the transmarine mainland, and
to institute there two standing commands. There, too,
the republic had not, as in Gaul and Illyricum, confined
itself to subduing the coasts of the Italian sea, but had
rather from the outset, after the precedent of the Barcides,
contemplated the conquest of the whole peninsula. With
the Lusitanians &#40;in Portugal and Estremadura&#41; the Romans
had fought from the time that they called themselves
masters of Spain; the &#8220;more remote province&#8221; had been
instituted, strictly speaking, against these tribes and
simultaneously with the &#8220;nearer&#8221; one; the Callaeci
&#40;Gallicia&#41; became subject to the Romans a century before
the battle of Actium; shortly before that battle the subsequent
dictator Caesar had, in his first campaign, carried
the Roman arms as far as Brigantium &#40;Corunna&#41;, and consolidated
afresh the annexation of this region to the more
remote province. Then, in the years between the death
of Caesar and the sole rule of Augustus, there was unceasing
warfare in the north of Spain; no fewer than six
governors in this short time won triumphs there, and perhaps
the subjugation of the northern slope of the Pyrenees
was effected chiefly in this epoch.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> The wars with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
cognate Aquitanians on the north side of the mountains,
which fall within the same epoch, and the last of which
was victoriously ended in the year 727<span class="sidenote2">27.</span>, must stand in
connection with these events. On the reorganising of the
administrative arrangements in 727<span class="sidenote2">27.</span> the peninsula went
to Augustus, because there was a prospect of extensive
military operations there, and it needed a permanent garrison.
Although the southern third of the more remote
province, thenceforth named from the river Baetis &#40;Guadalquivir&#41;
was soon given back to the government of the
senate,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> by far the greater portion of the peninsula
remained constantly under imperial administration, including
the greater part of the more remote province, Lusitania
and Callaecia,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> and the whole of the large nearer one.
Immediately after the institution of the new supreme control
Augustus resorted in person to Spain, with a view, in
his two years&#8217; stay &#40;728, 729&#41;<span class="sidenote2">26,&nbsp;25.</span>, to organise the new administration,
and to direct the occupation of the portions
of the country not yet subject. This he did from Tarraco
as his headquarters, and it was at that time that the
seat of government of the nearer province was transferred
from New Carthage to Tarraco, after which town this
province is thenceforth usually named. While it appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
necessary on the one hand not to remove the seat of administration
from the coast, the new capital on the other
hand commanded the region of the Ebro and the communications
with the north&ndash;west and the Pyrenees. Against
the Astures &#40;in the provinces of Asturias and Leon&#41;, and
above all, the Cantabri &#40;in the Basque country and the
province of Santander&#41;, who obstinately held out in these
mountains and overran the neighbouring cantons, a warfare
attended by difficulties and heavy losses was prolonged&mdash;with
interruptions, which the Romans called
victories&mdash;for eight years, till at length Agrippa succeeded
in breaking down the open resistance by destroying the
mountain towns and transplanting their inhabitants to the
valleys.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Military organisation
in the
North&ndash;west.</span>If, as the emperor Augustus says, from his time the
coast of the ocean from Cadiz to the mouth of the Elbe
obeyed the Romans, the obedience in this corner of it was
far from voluntary and little to be trusted. Matters were
still apparently far from having reached a proper pacification
in north&ndash;western Spain. There is still mention in
Nero&#8217;s time of war&ndash;expeditions against the Asturians. A
still clearer tale is told by the occupation of the country,
as Augustus arranged it. Callaecia was separated from
Lusitania and united with the Tarraconensian province, to
concentrate in one hand the chief command in northern
Spain. Not merely was this province then the only one
which, without bordering on an enemy&#8217;s country, obtained
a legionary military command, but no fewer than three
legions<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> were directed thither by Augustus&mdash;two to Asturia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
one to Cantabria; and, in spite of the military pressure in
Germany and in Illyricum, this occupying force was not
diminished. The headquarters were established between
the old metropolis of Asturia, Lancia, and the new Asturica
Augusta &#40;Astorga&#41; in Leon that still at present bears its
name. With this strong occupation of the north&ndash;west is
probably connected the construction of roads undertaken
there to a considerable extent in the earlier imperial period,
although we are not able to demonstrate the connection
in detail, seeing that the allocation of these troops in the
Augustan age is unknown to us. Thus there was established
by Augustus and Tiberius for the capital of Collaecia,
Bracara &#40;Braga&#41;, a connection with Asturica, that is,
with the great headquarters, and not less with the neighbouring
towns to the north, north&ndash;east, and south.
Tiberius made similar constructions in the territory of the
Vascones and in Cantabria.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Gradually the occupying
force could be diminished, and under Claudius one legion,
under Nero a second, could be employed elsewhere. But
these were regarded only as drafted off, and still at the
beginning of the reign of Vespasian the Spanish garrison
had resumed its earlier strength; it was reduced, in the
strict sense, only by the Flavian emperors, by Vespasian
to two, by Domitian to one legion. From thence down
to the time of Diocletian a single legion, the Seventh
Gemina, and a certain number of auxiliary contingents
garrisoned Leon.</p>

<p>No province under the monarchy was less affected by
outward or by inward wars than this land of the far west.
While at this epoch the commanderships of the troops
assumed, as it were, the positions of competing parties, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Spanish army played throughout a secondary part in
that respect; it was only as helper of his colleague that
Galba entered into the civil war, and mere accident carried
him to the first place. The force holding the north&ndash;west
of the Peninsula, which even after its reduction still
strikes us as comparatively strong, leads us to infer that
this region had not been completely obedient even in the
second and third centuries; but we are unable to state
anything definite as to the employment of the Spanish
legion within the province which it held in occupation.
The struggle against the Cantabrians had been waged with
the help of vessels of war; subsequently the Romans had
no occasion to institute a permanent naval station there.
It is not till the period after Diocletian that we find the
Pyrenaean peninsula, like the Italian and the Graeco&ndash;Macedonian,
without a standing garrison.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Incursions
of the
Moors.</span>That the province of Baetica was, at least after the
beginning of the second century, visited on various
occasions from the opposite coast by the Moors&mdash;the
pirates of R&icirc;f&mdash;we shall have to set forth in detail when
we survey the affairs of Africa. We may presume that
this serves to explain why, although in the senatorial
provinces elsewhere imperial troops were not wont to be
stationed, by way of exception Italica &#40;near Seville&#41; was
provided with a division of the legion of Leon.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> But it
chiefly devolved on the command stationed in the province
of Tingi &#40;Tangier&#41; to protect the rich south of Spain from
these incursions. Still it happened that towns like Italica
and Singili &#40;not far from Antequera&#41; were besieged by
the pirates.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Introduction
of
Italian
municipal
law.</span>If preparation was anywhere made by the republic
for the great all&ndash;significant work of the imperial period&mdash;the
Romanising of the West&mdash;it was in Spain. Peaceful
intercourse carried forward what the sword had begun;
Roman silver money was paramount in Spain long before
it circulated elsewhere outside of Italy; and the mines,
the culture of the vine and olive, and the relations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
traffic produced a constant influx of Italian elements to
the coast, particularly in the south&ndash;west. New Carthage,
the creation of the Barcides, and from its origin down to
the Augustan age the capital of the Hither province and
the first trading port of Spain, embraced already in the
seventh century a numerous Roman population; Carteia,
opposite to the present Gibraltar, founded a generation
before the age of the Gracchi, was the first transmarine
civic community with a population of Roman origin
&#40;iii.&nbsp;4&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;4.</span>; the old and renowned sister&ndash;town of Carthage,
Gades, the modern Cadiz, was the first foreign town out
of Italy, that adopted Roman law and Roman language
&#40;iv.&nbsp;573&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;543.</span>. While thus along the greatest part of the
coast of the Mediterranean the old indigenous as well as
the Phoenician civilisation had already, under the republic,
conformed to the ways and habits of the ruling people,
in no province under the imperial period was Romanising
so energetically promoted on the part of the ruling power
as in Spain. First of all the southern half of Baetica,
between the Baetis and the Mediterranean, obtained,
partly already under the republic or through Caesar,
partly in the years 739 and 740<span class="sidenote2">15,&nbsp;14.</span> through Augustus, a
stately series of communities with full Roman citizenship,
which here occupy not the coast especially, but above all
the interior, headed by Hispalis &#40;Seville&#41; and Corduba
&#40;Cordova&#41; with colonial rights, Italica &#40;near Seville&#41;
and Gades &#40;Cadiz&#41; with municipal rights. In southern
Lusitania, too, we meet with a series of equally privileged
towns, particularly Olisipo &#40;Lisbon&#41;, Pax Julia &#40;Beja&#41;,
and the colony of veterans founded by Augustus during
his abode in Spain and made the capital of this province,
Emerita &#40;Merida&#41;. In the Tarraconensis the
burgess&ndash;towns are found predominantly on the coast&mdash;Carthago
Nova, Ilici &#40;Elche&#41;, Valentia, Dertosa &#40;Tortosa&#41;,
Tarraco, Barcino &#40;Barcelona&#41;; in the interior only the
colony in the Ebro valley, Caesaraugusta &#40;Saragossa&#41;, is
conspicuous. In all Spain under Augustus there were
numbered fifty communities with full citizenship; nearly
fifty others had up to this time received Latin rights,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
and stood as to inward organisation on a par with the
burgess&ndash;communities. Among the rest the emperor
Vespasian likewise introduced the Latin municipal
organisation on occasion of the general imperial census
instituted by him in the year 74. The bestowal of
burgess&ndash;rights was neither then, nor generally in the
better imperial period, extended much further than it had
been carried in the time of Augustus;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> as to which
probably the chief regulative consideration was the
restricted right of levy in regard to those who were citizens
of the empire.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Romanising
of the
Iberians.</span>The indigenous population of Spain, which thus
became partly mixed up with Italian settlers, partly led
towards Italian habits and language, nowhere emerges so
as to be clearly recognised in the history of the imperial
period. Probably that stock, whose remains and whose
language maintain their ground up to the present day in
the mountains of Biscay, Guipuscoa, and Navarre, once
filled the whole peninsula, as the Berbers filled the region
of north Africa. Their language, different from the
Indo&ndash;Germanic, and destitute of flexion like that of the
Finns and Mongols, proves their original independence;
and their most important memorials, the coins, in the
first century of the Roman rule in Spain embrace the
peninsula, with the exception of the south coast from
Cadiz to Granada, where the Phoenician language then
prevailed, and of the region northward of the mouth of
the Tagus and westward of the sources of the Ebro,
which was then probably to a large extent practically
independent, and certainly was utterly uncivilised. In
this Iberian territory the south&ndash;Spanish writing is clearly
distinguished from that of the north province; but not
less clearly both are branches of one stock. The
Phoenician immigration here confined itself to still
narrower bounds than in Africa, and the Celtic mixture
did not modify the general uniformity of the national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
development in a way that we can recognise. But the
conflicts of the Romans with the Iberians belong mainly to
the republican epoch, and have been formerly described
&#40;ii.&nbsp;221 f.&#41;<span class="sidenote2">ii.&nbsp;209&nbsp;f.</span>. After the already mentioned last passages
of arms under the first dynasty, the Iberians vanish
wholly out of sight. To the question, how far they became
Romanised in the imperial period, the information that
has come to us gives no satisfactory answer. That in
the intercourse with their former masters they would
have always occasion to make use of the Roman language,
needs no proof; but under the influence of Rome the
national language and the national writing disappear even
from public use within their own communities. Already
in the last century of the republic the native coinage,
which at first was to a large extent allowed, had become
in the main set aside; from the imperial period there
is no Spanish civic coin with other than a Latin legend.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Language.</span>Like the Roman dress, the Roman language was largely
diffused even among those Spaniards who had not Italian
burgess&ndash;rights, and the government favoured the <em>de facto</em>
Romanising of the land.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> When Augustus died the
Roman language and habits prevailed in Andalusia,
Granada, Murcia, Valencia, Catalonia, Aragon; and a
good part of this is to be accounted for not by colonising
but by Romanising. By the ordinance of Vespasian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
previously mentioned the native language was restricted
<em>de jure</em> to private intercourse. That it held its ground
in this, is proved by its existence at the present day;
what is now confined to the mountains, which neither
the Goths nor the Arabs ever occupied, must in the
Roman period certainly have extended over a great
part of Spain, especially the north&ndash;west. Nevertheless
Romanising certainly set in very much earlier and more
strongly in Spain than in Africa; monuments with
native writing from the imperial period can be pointed
to in Africa in fair number, hardly at all in Spain; and
the Berber language at present still prevails over half of
north Africa, the Iberian only in the narrow valleys of
the Basques. It could not be otherwise, partly because
in Spain Roman civilisation emerged much earlier and
much more vigorously than in Africa, partly because the
natives had not in the former as in the latter the free
tribes to fall back upon.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Spanish
community.</span>The native communal constitution of the Iberians
was not perceptibly to our view different from the Gallic.
From the first Spain, like the Celtic country on either
side of the Alps, was broken up into cantonal districts;
the Vaccaei and the Cantabri were hardly in any essential
respect distinguished from the Cenomani of the Transpadana
and the Remi of Belgica. The fact that on the
Spanish coins struck in the earlier epoch of the Roman
rule it is predominantly not the towns that are named, but
the cantons,&mdash;not Tarraco but the Cassetani, not Saguntum
but the Arsenses&mdash;shows, still more clearly than the history
of the wars of the time, that in Spain too there once
subsisted larger cantonal unions. But the conquering
Romans did not treat these unions everywhere in like
fashion. The Transalpine cantons remained even under
Roman rule political commonwealths; the Spanish were,
like the Cisalpine, simply geographical conceptions. As
the district of the Cenomani is nothing but a collective
expression for the territories of Brixia, Bergomum, and so
forth, so the Asturians consist of twenty&ndash;two politically
independent communities, which to all appearance do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
legally concern each other more than the towns of Brixia
and Bergomum.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> Of these communities the Tarraconensian
province numbered in the Augustan age 293, in
the middle of the second century 275. Here, therefore,
the old canton&ndash;unions were broken up. This course was
hardly determined by the consideration that the compactness
of the Vettones and the Cantabri seemed more
hazardous for the unity of the empire than that of the
Sequani and the Treveri; the distinction doubtless was
chiefly based on the diversity of the time and of the form
of conquest. The region on the Guadalquivir became
Roman a century and a half earlier than the banks of the
Loire and the Seine; the time when the foundation of
the Spanish organisation was laid was not so very far
from the epoch at which the Samnite confederacy was
dissolved. There the spirit of the old republic prevailed;
in Gaul the freer and gentler view of Caesar. The
smaller and powerless districts, which after the dissolution
of the unions became the pillars of political unity&mdash;the
small cantons or clans&mdash;became changed in course of
time, here as everywhere into towns. The beginnings
of urban development, even outside of the communities
that attained Italian rights, go far back into the republican,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
perhaps into the pre&ndash;Roman, time; subsequently the general
bestowal of Latin rights by Vespasian must have made
this conversion general or very nearly so.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> In reality
there were among the 293 Augustan communities of the
province of Tarraco 114, and among the 275 of the
second century only twenty&ndash;seven, that were not urban
communities.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Levy.</span>Of the position of Spain in the imperial administration
little is to be said. In the levy the Spanish provinces
played a prominent part. The legions doing garrison&ndash;duty
there were probably from the beginning of the principate
raised chiefly in the country itself; when afterwards
on the one hand the occupying force was diminished, and
on the other hand the levy was more and more restricted
to the garrison&ndash;district proper, Baetica, sharing in this
respect the lot of Italy, enjoyed the dubious blessing
of being totally excluded from military service. The
auxiliary levy, to which especially the districts that lagged
behind as regards urban development were subjected,
was carried out on a great scale in Lusitania, Callaecia,
Asturia, and not less in the whole of northern and inland
Spain; Augustus, whose father had formed even his bodyguard
of Spaniards, recruited in none of the territories
subject to him &#40;setting aside Belgica&#41; so largely as in Spain.</p>

<p>For the finances of the state this rich country was
beyond doubt one of the most secure and most productive
sources; but we have no detailed information transmitted
to us.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Trade and
commerce.</span>The importance of the traffic of these provinces admits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
of being inferred in some measure from the careful provision
of the government for the Spanish roads. Between
the Pyrenees and Tarraco there have been found Roman
milestones even from the last times of the republic, such
as no other province of the West exhibits. We have
already remarked that Augustus and Tiberius promoted
road&ndash;making in Spain mainly for military reasons; but the
road formed by Augustus at Carthago Nova can only have
been constructed on account of traffic, and it was traffic
mainly that was served by the imperial highway named
after him, and partly regulated, partly constructed anew
by him. This road, continuing the Italo&ndash;Gallic coast&ndash;road
and crossing the Pyrenees at the Pass of Puycerda, went
thence to Tarraco, then pretty closely followed the coast
by way of Valentia as far as the mouth of the Jucar, but
thence made right across the interior for the valley of the
Baetis,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> then ran from the arch of Augustus&mdash;which marked
the boundary of the two provinces, and with which a new
numbering of the miles began&mdash;through the province Baetica
to the mouth of the river, and thus connected Rome with the
ocean. This was certainly the only imperial highway in
Spain. Afterwards the government did not do much for
the roads of Spain; the communes, to which these were soon
in the main entrusted, appear, so far as we see, to have provided
everywhere&mdash;apart from the tableland of the interior&mdash;communications
to such an extent as was required by the
state of culture in the province. For, mountainous as Spain
is and not without steppes and waste land, it is yet one
of the most productive countries of the earth, both through
the abundance of the fruits of the soil and through its
riches of wine and oil and metals. To this were early
added manufactures, especially in iron wares and in woollen
and linen fabrics. In the valuations under Augustus no
Roman burgess&ndash;community, Patavium excepted, had such
a number of rich people to show as the Spanish Gades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
with its great merchants spread throughout the world; and
in keeping with this was the refined luxury of manners,
the castanet&ndash;players who were here at home, and the
Gaditanian songs, which circulated, like those of Alexandria,
among the elegant Romans. The nearness of
Italy, and the easy and cheap intercourse by sea, gave at
this epoch, especially to the Spanish south and east coasts,
the opportunity of bringing their rich produce to the first
market of the world, and probably with no country in the
world did Rome pursue so extensive and constant a traffic
on a great scale as with Spain.</p>

<p>That Roman civilisation pervaded Spain earlier and
more powerfully than any other province, is confirmed by
evidence on various sides, especially in respect to religion
and to literature.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Religious
rites.</span>It is true that in the territory that was still at a later
period Iberian, and remained tolerably free from immigration&mdash;in
Lusitania, Callaecia, Asturia&mdash;the native gods,
with their singular names, ending mostly in &ndash;icus and &ndash;ecus,
such as Endovellicus, Eaecus, Vagodonnaegus, and the like,
maintained their ground still even under the principate
at the old seats. But not a single votive stone has been
found in all Baetica, which might not quite as well have
been set up in Italy. And the same holds true of

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Spaniards
in
Latin
literature.</span>Cicero mentions the Latin poets at Corduba only to
censure them; and the Augustan age of literature was
still in the main the work of Italians, though individual
provincials helped in it, and among others the learned
librarian of the emperor, the philologue Hyginus, was
born as a bondsman in Spain. But thenceforward the
Spaniards undertook in it almost the part, if not of leader,
at any rate of schoolmaster. The natives of Corduba, Marcus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Porcius Latro, the teacher and the model of Ovid, and
his countryman and friend in youth, Annaeus Seneca,&mdash;both
only about a decade younger than Horace, but for a
considerable time employed in their native town as teachers
of eloquence, before they transferred their activity in that
character to Rome&mdash;were the true and proper representatives
of the school&ndash;rhetoric that took the place of the
republican freedom and sauciness of speech. Once, when
the former could not avoid appearing in a real process, he
came to a stand&ndash;still in his address, and only recovered
his fluency when, to please the famous man, the court was
transferred from the tribunal to the school&ndash;hall. Seneca&#8217;s
son, the minister of Nero and the fashionable philosopher
of the epoch, and his grandson, the poet of the sentimental
opposition to the principate, Lucanus, have an importance,
as doubtful in literature as it is indisputable in history,
which may in a certain sense be put to the account of
Spain. In the early times of the empire, likewise, two
other provincials from Baetica, Mela under Claudius,
Columella under Nero, gained a place among the recognised
didactic authors who cultivated style&mdash;the former by
his short description of the earth, the latter by a thorough,
in part poetical, picture of agriculture. If, in the time of
Domitian, the poet Canius Rufus from Gades, the philosopher
Decianus from Emerita, and the orator Valerius
Licinianus from Bilbilis &#40;Calatayud not far from Saragossa&#41;
are celebrated as literary notabilities by the side of
Virgil and Catullus and by the side of the three stars of
Corduba, this is certainly the fortune also of one likewise
a native of Bilbilis, Valerius Martialis,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> who himself yields
to none among the poets of this epoch in elegance and
plastic power, or yet in venality and emptiness, and we
are justified in taking into account withal the fact of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
their being fellow&ndash;countrymen; yet the mere possibility
of weaving such a garland of poets shows the importance
of the Spanish element in the literature of the time. But
the pearl of Spanish&ndash;Latin authorship is Marcus Fabius
Quintilianus &#40;35&ndash;95&#41; from Calagurris on the Ebro. His
father had already acted as a teacher of eloquence in
Rome; he himself was brought to Rome by Galba, and
occupied, especially under Domitian, a distinguished
position as tutor of the emperor&#8217;s nephews. His textbook
of rhetoric and, in some degree, of the history of
Roman literature, is one of the most excellent which we
possess from Roman antiquity, pervaded by fine taste and
sure judgment, simple in feeling as in presentation, instructive
without weariness, pleasing without effort, contrasting
sharply and designedly with the fashionable literature
that was so rich in phrases and so empty of ideas. It
was in no small degree due to him that the tendency became
changed at any rate, if not improved. Subsequently,
amidst the general emptiness the influence of the Spaniards
comes no further into prominence. What is, historically,
of special moment in their Latin authorship is the complete
clinging of these provincials to the literary development
of the mother&ndash;country. Cicero, indeed, scoffs
at the clumsiness and the provincialisms of the Spanish
votaries of poetry; and even Latro&#8217;s Latin did not meet
the approval of the equally genteel and correct Roman
by birth, Messalla Corvinus. But after the Augustan age
nothing similar is again heard of. The Gallic rhetors, the
great African ecclesiastical authors have, as Latin writers,
retained in some measure a foreign complexion; no one
would recognise the Senecas and Martial by their manner
and style as belonging to one or to another land; in hearty
love to his own literature and in subtle understanding of
it never has any Italian surpassed the teacher of languages
from Calagurris.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="head3">THE GALLIC PROVINCES.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Like</span> Spain, southern Gaul had already in the time of the
republic become a part of the Roman empire, yet neither
so early nor so completely as the former country. The
two Spanish provinces were instituted in the age of
Hannibal, the province Narbo in that of the Gracchi; and,
while in the former case Rome took to itself the whole
Peninsula, in the latter it was not merely content, down
to the last age of the republic, with the possession of the
coast, but even of this it directly took only the smaller
and the more remote half. The republic was not wrong
in designating what it so possessed as the town&ndash;domain of
Narbo &#40;Narbonne&#41;; the greater part of the coast, nearly
from Montpellier to Nice, belonged to the city of Massilia.
This Greek community was more a state than a city, and
through its powerful position the equal alliance subsisting
from of old with Rome obtained a real significance, such
as had no parallel in any second allied city. It is true,
nevertheless, that the Romans were for these neighbouring
Greeks, still more than for the more remote Greeks of the
East, shield as well as sword. The Massaliots had probably
the lower Rhone as far up as Avignon in their possession;
but the Ligurian and the Celtic cantons of
the interior were by no means subject to them, and the
Roman standing camp at Aquae Sextiae &#40;Aix&#41; a day&#8217;s
march to the north of Massilia, was, quite in the true and
proper sense, instituted for the permanent protection of
the wealthy Greek mercantile city. It was one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
most momentous consequences of the Roman civil war,
that along with the legitimate republic its most faithful
ally, the city of Massilia, was politically annihilated, was
converted from a state sharing rule into a community
which continued free of the empire and Greek, but preserved
its independence and its Hellenism in the modest
proportions of a provincial middle&ndash;sized town. In a political
aspect there is nothing more to be said of Massilia
after its capture in the civil war; the town was thenceforth
for Gaul only what Neapolis was for Italy&mdash;the
centre of Greek culture and Greek learning. Inasmuch
as the greater part of the later province of Narbo only at
that time came under direct Roman administration, it is to
this epoch in particular that the erection of it in a certain
measure belongs.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Last conflicts
in the
three Gauls.</span>How the rest of Gaul came into the power of Rome
has been already narrated &#40;iv.&nbsp;240 ff.&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;230&nbsp;f.</span> Before Caesar&#8217;s
Gallic war the rule of the Romans extended approximately
as far as Toulouse, Vienne, and Geneva; after it, as far as
the Rhine throughout its course, and the coasts of the
Atlantic Ocean on the north as on the west. This subjugation,
it is true, was probably not complete, in the
north&ndash;west perhaps not much less superficial than that of
Britain &#40;iv.&nbsp;296&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;283.</span>. Yet we are informed of supplemental
wars, in the main, merely as regards the districts of
Iberian nationality. To the Iberians belonged not merely
the southern but also the northern slope of the Pyrenees,
with the country lying in front, Bearn, Gascony, and
western Languedoc<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>; and it has already been mentioned
&#40;<a href="#Page_63">p.&nbsp;63</a>&#41; that when north&ndash;western Spain was sustaining the
last conflicts with the Romans, there was also on the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
side of the Pyrenees, and beyond doubt in connection
therewith, serious fighting, at first on the part of Agrippa
in the year 716<span class="sidenote2">38.</span>, then on the part of Marcus Valerius
Messalla, the well&ndash;known patron of the Roman poets, who
in the year 726 or 727<span class="sidenote2">28&nbsp;or&nbsp;27.</span>, and thus nearly at the same time
with the Cantabrian war, vanquished the Aquitanians in
a pitched battle in the old Roman territory not far from
Narbonne. In respect of the Celts nothing further is
mentioned than that, shortly before the battle of Actium,
the Morini in Picardy were overthrown; and, although
during the twenty years of almost uninterrupted civil war
our reporters may have lost sight of the comparatively
insignificant affairs of Gaul, the silence of the list of
triumphs&mdash;here complete&mdash;shows at any rate that no
further military undertakings of importance took place in
the land of the Celts during this period.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Insurrections.</span>Subsequently, during the long reign of Augustus,
and amidst all the crises&mdash;some of them very hazardous&mdash;of
the Germanic wars, the Gallic provinces remained
obedient. No doubt the Roman government, as well as
the Germanic patriot party, as we have seen, constantly
had it in view that a decisive success of the Germans
and their advance into Gaul would be followed by a
rising of the Gauls against Rome; the foreign rule cannot
therefore at that time have stood by any means secure.
Matters came to a real insurrection in the year 21 under
Tiberius. There was formed among the Celtic nobility
a widely&ndash;ramified conspiracy to overthrow the Roman
government.<span class="sidenote">Under
Tiberius.</span>It broke out prematurely in the far from
important cantons of the Turones and the Andecavi on
the lower Loire, and not merely the small garrison of
Lyons, but also a part of the army of the Rhine at once
took the field against the insurgents. Nevertheless the
most noted districts joined; the Treveri, under the
guidance of Julius Florus, threw themselves in masses
into the Ardennes; in the immediate neighbourhood of
Lyons the Haedui and Sequani rose under the leadership
of Julius Sacrovir. The compact legions, it is true,
gained the mastery over the rebels without much trouble;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
but the rising, in which the Germans in no way took
part, shows at any rate the hatred towards the foreign
rulers, which still at that time prevailed in the land and
particularly among the nobility&mdash;a hatred which was
certainly strengthened, but was not at first produced, by
the pressure of taxes and the financial distress that are
designated as causes of the insurrection.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Gradual
pacification
of Gaul.</span>It was a greater feat of Roman policy than that
which enabled it to become master of Gaul, that it knew
how to retain the mastery, and that Vercingetorix found
no successor, although, as we see, there were not entirely
wanting men who would gladly have walked in the
same path. This result was attained by a shrewd combination
of terrifying and of winning&mdash;we may add, of
sharing. The strength and the proximity of the Rhine
army was beyond question the first and the most effective
means of preserving the Gauls in the fear of their master.
If this army was maintained throughout the century at the
same level, as will be set forth in the following section,
it was so probably quite as much on account of their
own subjects, as on account of neighbours who afterwards
were by no means specially formidable. That even the
temporary withdrawal of these troops imperilled the
continuance of the Roman rule, not because the Germans
might then cross the Rhine, but because the Gauls might
renounce allegiance to the Romans, is shown by the
rising after Nero&#8217;s death, in spite of all its weakness; after
the troops had marched off to Italy to make their general
emperor, an independent Gallic empire was proclaimed
in Treves, and those soldiers who were left were made
bound to allegiance towards it. But although this foreign
rule, like every such rule, rested primarily and mainly on
superior power&mdash;on the ascendancy of compact and
trained troops over the multitude&mdash;it by no means
rested on this exclusively. The art of partition was
here successfully applied. Gaul did not belong to the
Celts alone; not merely were the Iberians strongly represented
in the south, but Germanic tribes were settled
in considerable numbers on the Rhine, and were of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
importance still more by their conspicuous aptitude for
war, than by their number. Skilfully the government
knew how to foster and to turn to useful account the
antagonism between the Celts and the Germans on the
left of the Rhine. But the policy of amalgamation and
of reconciliation operated still more powerfully.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Policy of
amalgamation.</span>What measures were taken with this view we shall explain
in the sequel. Seeing that the cantonal constitution
was spared, and even a sort of national representation was
conceded, and the measures directed against the national
priesthood were taken gradually, while the Latin language
was from the beginning obligatory, and with that national
representation there was associated the new worship of
the emperor; seeing that, on the whole, the Romanising
was not undertaken in an abrupt way, but was cautiously
and patiently pursued, the Roman foreign rule in the
Celtic land ceased to be such, because the Celts themselves
became, and desired to be, Romans. The extent to which
the work had already advanced after the expiry of the
first century of the Roman rule in Gaul is shown by the
just mentioned occurrences after Nero&#8217;s death, which, in
their course as a whole, belong partly to the history of
the Roman commonwealth, partly to its relations with
the Germans, but must also be mentioned, at least by
way of slight glance, in this connection. The overthrow
of the Julio&ndash;Claudian dynasty emanated from a Celtic
noble and began with a Celtic insurrection; but this
was not a revolt against the foreign rule like that of
Vercingetorix or even of Sacrovir; its aim was not the
setting aside, but the transforming, of the Roman government.
The fact that its leader reckoned descent from a
bastard of Caesar one of the patents of nobility of his
house, clearly expresses the half&ndash;national, half&ndash;Roman
character of this movement. Some months later certainly,
after the revolted Roman troops of Germanic descent
and the free Germans had for the moment overpowered
the Roman army, some Celtic tribes proclaimed the
independence of their nation; but this attempt proved
a sad failure, not through the eventual interference of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the government, but from the very opposition of the
great majority of the Celtic cantons themselves, which
could not, and did not, desire to fall away from Rome.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Roman
rule no
longer felt
as foreign.</span>The Roman names of the leading nobles, the Latin
legend on the coins of the insurrection, the travesty
throughout of Roman arrangements, show most clearly as
that the deliverance of the Celtic nation from the yoke
of the foreigners in the year 70 was no longer possible,
just because there was such a nation no longer; and the
Roman rule might be felt, according to circumstances,
as a yoke, but no longer as a foreign rule. Had such an
opportunity been offered to the Celts at the time of the
battle of Philippi, or even under Tiberius, the insurrection
would have run its course, not perhaps to another issue,
but in streams of blood; now it ran off into the sand.
When, some decades after these severe crises, the Rhine
army was considerably reduced, these crises had given the
proof that the great majority of the Gauls were no longer
thinking of separation from the Italians, and the four
generations that had followed since the conquest had
done their work. Subsequent occurrences here were crises
within the Roman world. When that world threatened
to fall asunder, the West as well as the East separated
itself for some time from the centre of the empire;
but the separate state of Postumus was the work of
necessity, not of choice, and the separation was merely
<em>de facto</em>; the emperors who bore sway over Gaul,
Britain, and Spain, laid claim to the dominion of the
whole empire quite as much as their Italian rival
emperors. Certainly traces enough remained of the old
Celtic habits and also of the old Celtic unruliness. As
bishop Hilary of Poitiers, himself a Gaul, complains of
the overbearing character of his countrymen, so the
Gauls are, even in the biographies of the later Caesars,
designated as stubborn and ungovernable and inclined
to insubordination, so that in dealing with them tenacity
and sternness of government appear specially requisite.
But a separation from the Roman empire, or even a
renouncing of the Roman nationality, so far as there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
any such at the time, was in these later centuries nowhere
less thought of than in Gaul; on the contrary, the development
of the Romano&ndash;Gallic culture, of which Caesar and
Augustus had laid the foundation, fills the later Roman
period just as it fills the Middle Ages and more recent times.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Organisation
of the
three Gauls.</span>The regulation of Gaul was the work of Augustus.
In the adjustment of imperial affairs after the close of
the civil wars the whole of Gaul, as it had been entrusted
to Caesar or had been further acquired by him, came&mdash;with
the exception merely of the region on the Roman
side of the Alps, which had meanwhile been joined to
Italy&mdash;under imperial administration. Immediately afterwards
Augustus resorted to Gaul, and in the year 727<span class="sidenote2">27.</span>
completed in the capital Lugudunum the census of the
Gallic province, whereby the portions of the country
brought to the empire by Caesar first obtained an
organised land&ndash;register, and the payment of tribute was
regulated for them. He did not stay long at that time,
for Spanish affairs demanded his presence. But the
carrying out of the new arrangement encountered great
difficulties and, in various cases, resistance. It was not
mere military affairs that gave occasion to Agrippa&#8217;s
stay in Gaul in the year 735<span class="sidenote2">19.</span>, and that of the emperor
himself during the years 738&ndash;741<span class="sidenote2">16&ndash;13.</span>; and the governors
or commanders on the Rhine belonging to the imperial
house, Tiberius, stepson of Augustus, in 738<span class="sidenote2">16.</span>, his brother
Drusus, 742&ndash;745<span class="sidenote2">12&ndash;9,&nbsp;9&ndash;7,&nbsp;
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;3&ndash;5,&nbsp;
9&ndash;11.</span>, Tiberius again, 745&ndash;747, 757&ndash;759,
763&ndash;765, his son Germanicus, 766&ndash;769, <span class="sidenote2"><span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;12&ndash;15.</span> had all of them
the task of carrying on the organisation of Gaul. The
work of peace was certainly no less difficult and no less
important than the passages of arms on the Rhine; we
perceive this in the fact that the emperor took in hand
personally the laying of the foundation, and entrusted
the carrying it out to the men in the empire who were
most closely related to him and highest in station. It
was only in those years that the arrangements, established
by Caesar amidst the pressure of the civil wars, received
the shape which they thereafter in the main retained.
They extended over the old as over the new province;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
but Augustus gave up the old Roman territory, along
with that of Massilia, from the Mediterranean as far as
the Cevennes, as early as the year 732,<span class="sidenote2">22.</span> to the senatorial
government, and retained only New Gaul in his own
administration. This territory, still in itself very extensive,
was then broken up into three administrative
districts, over each of which was placed an independent
imperial governor. This division attached itself to the
threefold partition of the Celtic country&mdash;already found
in existence by the dictator Caesar, and based on national
distinctions&mdash;into Aquitania inhabited by Iberians, the
purely Celtic Gaul, and the Celto&ndash;Germanic territory
of the Belgae; doubtless too it was intended in this
administrative partition to lay some measure of stress on
these distinctions, which tended to favour the progress of
the Roman rule. This, however, was only approximately
carried out, and could not be practically realised otherwise.
The purely Celtic region between the Garonne and Loire
was attached to the too small Iberian Aquitania; the
whole left bank of the Rhine, from the Lake of Geneva
to the Moselle, was joined with Belgica, although most
of these cantons were Celtic; in general the Celtic
stock so preponderated that the united provinces could
be called &#8220;the three Gauls.&#8221; Of the formation of the
two so&ndash;called &#8220;Germanies,&#8221;&mdash;nominally the compensation
for the loss or abeyance of a really Germanic province,
in reality the military frontier of Gaul&mdash;we shall speak in
the following section.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Law and
justice.</span>Matters of law and justice were arranged in an altogether
different way for the old province of Gaul and for
the three new ones; the former was Latinised at once and
completely, in the latter the subsisting national state of
things was in the first instance merely regulated. This
contrast of administration, which reaches far deeper than
the formal diversity of the senatorial and imperial administration,
was doubtless the primary and main occasion of
the diversity, still continuing at the present day in its
effects, between the regions of the Langue d&#8217;oc and
Provence and those of the Langue d&#8217;oui.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Romanising
of the
southern
province.</span>The Romanising of the south of Gaul had not in the republican
period advanced so far as that of the south of Spain.
The eighty years lying between the two conquests were
not to be rapidly overtaken; the military camps in Spain
were far stronger and more permanent than the Gallic;
the towns of Latin type were more numerous in the
former than in the latter. Here doubtless in the time of
the Gracchi and under their influence Narbo had been
founded, the first burgess&ndash;colony proper beyond the sea;
but it remained isolated, and, though a rival of Massilia
in commercial intercourse, to all appearance by no means
equal to it in importance. But when Caesar began to
guide the destinies of Rome, here above all&mdash;in this land
of his choice and of his star&mdash;neglect was retrieved. The
colony of Narbo was strengthened, and was under Tiberius
the most populous city in all Gaul. Thereupon four new
burgess&ndash;communities were laid out, chiefly in the domain
ceded by Massilia &#40;iv.&nbsp;572&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;542.</span>, the most important among
them being, from a military point of view, Forum Julii
&#40;Fr&eacute;jus&#41;, the chief station of the new imperial fleet, and for
trade Arelate &#40;Arles&#41;, at the mouth of the Rhone, which
soon&mdash;when Lyons rose and trade was tending more and
more towards the Rhone&mdash;outstripping Narbo, became the
true heir of Massilia and the great emporium of Gallo&ndash;Italic
commerce. What further he himself did, and what
his son did in the same sense, cannot be definitely distinguished,
and historically little depends on the distinction;
here, if anywhere, Augustus was nothing but the
executor of Caesar&#8217;s testament. Everywhere the Celtic
cantonal constitution gave way before the Italian community.
The canton of the Volcae in the coast region,
formerly subject to the Massaliots, received through Caesar
a Latin municipal constitution on such a footing, that the
 &#8220;praetors&#8221; of the Volcae presided over the whole district
embracing twenty&ndash;four townships,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> until not long thereafter
the old arrangement disappeared even in name, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
instead of the canton of the Volcae came the Latin town
of Nemausus &#40;N&icirc;mes&#41;. In a similar way the most considerable
of all the cantons of this province, that of the
Allobroges, who had possession of the country northward
of the Is&eacute;re and eastward of the middle Rhone, from
Valence and Lyons to the mountains of Savoy and to
the lake of Geneva, obtained, probably already through
Caesar, a like urban organisation and Italian rights, till at
length the emperor Gaius granted the Roman franchise to
the town of Vienna. So in the province as a whole the
larger centres were organised by Caesar, or in the first
age of the empire, on the basis of Latin rights, such as
Ruscino &#40;Roussillon&#41;, Avennio &#40;Avignon&#41;, Aquae Sextiae
&#40;Aix&#41;, Apta &#40;Apt&#41;. Already at the close of the Augustan
age the country along both banks of the lower Rhone
was completely Romanised in language and manners; the
cantonal constitution throughout the province was probably
set aside with the exception of slight remnants. The
burgesses of the communities on whom the imperial franchise
was conferred, and no less the burgesses in those of
Latin rights, who had acquired for themselves and for
their descendants the imperial franchise by entering the
imperial army or by the holding of offices in their native
towns, stood in law on a footing of complete equality with
the Italians, and, like them, attained to offices and honours
in the imperial service.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Lugudunum.</span>In the three Gauls, on the other hand, there were no
towns of Roman and Latin rights, or rather there was only
one such town<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> there, which on that account belonged to
none of the three provinces or belonged to all&mdash;the town
of Lugudunum &#40;Lyons&#41;. On the extreme southern verge
of imperial Gaul, immediately on the border of the municipally&ndash;organised
province, at the confluence of the Rhone
and the Saone, on a site equally well chosen from a military
and from a commercial point of view, this settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
had arisen in the year 711<span class="sidenote2">43.</span> during the civil wars, primarily
in consequence of the expulsion of a number of Italians
settled in Vienna.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Not having originated out of a Celtic
canton,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> and hence always with a territory of narrow
limits, but from the outset composed of Italians and in
possession of the full Roman franchise, it stood forth
unique in its kind among the communities of the three
Gauls&mdash;as respects its legal relations, in some measure
resembling Washington in the North American Federation.
This unique town of the three Gauls was at the
same time the Gallic capital. The three provinces had
not any common chief authority, and, of high imperial
officials, only the governor of the middle or Lugudunensian
province had his seat there; but when emperors or
princes stayed in Gaul they as a rule resided in Lyons.
Lyons was, alongside of Carthage, the only city of the Latin
half of the empire which obtained a standing garrison
after the model of that of the capital.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> The only mint
for imperial money, which we can point to with certainty
in the West for the earlier period of the empire, is that of
Lyons. Here was the headquarters of the transit&ndash;dues
which embraced all Gaul; and to this as a centre
the Gallic network of roads converged. But not merely
had all government institutions, which were common
to Gaul, their native seat in Lyons; this Roman town
became also, as we shall see further on, the seat of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Celtic diet of the three provinces, and of all the political
and religious institutions associated with it&mdash;of its
temples and its yearly festivals. Thus Lugudunum
rapidly rose into prosperity, helped onward by the rich
endowment combined with its metropolitan position and
by a site uncommonly favourable for commerce. An
author of the time of Tiberius describes it as the second
in Gaul after Narbo; subsequently it takes a place there
by the side of, or before, its sister on the Rhone, Arelate.
On occasion of the fire, which in the year 64 laid a great
part of Rome in ashes, the Lugudunenses sent to those
burnt out a subsidy of 4,000,000 sesterces &#40;&#163;43,500&#41;, and
when the same fate befel their own town next year in a
still harder way, the whole empire paid its contribution to
them, and the emperor sent a like sum from his privy
purse. The town rose out of its ruins with more splendour
than before; and it has for almost two thousand years
remained amidst all vicissitudes a great city up to the
present day. In the later period of the empire, no doubt,
it fell behind Treves. The town of the Treveri, named
Augusta probably from the first emperor, soon gained
the first place in the Belgic province; if still in the time
of Tiberius Durocortorum of the Remi &#40;Rheims&#41; is named
the most populous place of the province and the seat of
the governors, an author from the time of Claudius
already assigns the primacy there to the chief place of the
Treveri. But Treves became the capital of Gaul<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>&mdash;we
may even say of the West&mdash;only through the remodelling
of the imperial administration under Diocletian.
After Gaul, Britain, and Spain were placed under one
supreme administration, the latter had its seat in Treves;
and thenceforth Treves was also, when the emperors
stayed in Gaul, their regular residence, and, as a Greek
of the fifth century says, the greatest city beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Alps. But the epoch when this Rome of the north
received its walls and its hot baths, which might well be
named by the side of the city walls of the Roman kings
and of the baths of the imperial capital, lies beyond the
limits of our narrative. Through the first three centuries
of the empire Lyons remained the Roman centre of the
Celtic land, and that not merely because it occupied the
first place in population and wealth, but because it was,
like no other in the Gallic north and but few in the south,
a town founded from Italy, and Roman not merely as
regards rights, but as regards its origin and its character.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The cantonal
organisation
of the three
Gauls.</span>As the Italic town was the basis for the organisation
of the south province, so the canton was for the northern,
and predominantly indeed the canton of the Celtic formerly
political, now communal, organisation. The
importance of the distinction between town and canton
is not primarily dependent on its intrinsic nature; even
if it had been one of mere legal form, it would have
separated the nationalities, and would have awakened and
whetted, on the one hand, the feeling of their belonging
to Rome, on the other hand, that of their being foreign
to it. The practical diversity of the two organisations
may not be estimated as of much account for this period,
since the elements of the communal organisation&mdash;the
officials, the council, the burgess&ndash;assembly&mdash;were the same
in the one case as in the other, and distinctions going
deeper, such as perhaps formally subsisted, would hardly
be tolerated long by Roman supremacy. Hence the
transition from the cantonal organisation to the urban was
frequently effected of itself and without hindrance&mdash;we
may even say, with a certain necessity, in the course of
development. In consequence of this the qualitative distinctions
of the two legal forms come into little prominence
in our traditional accounts. Nevertheless, the
contrast was certainly not a mere nominal one, but as
regards the competence of the different authorities, judicature,
taxation, levy, there subsisted diversities which were
of importance, or at any rate seemed important, for administration,
partly of themselves, partly in consequence of custom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Character
of the
cantons.</span>The quantitative distinction is definitely recognisable.
The cantons, at least as they present themselves among the
Celts and the Germans, are throughout tribes more than
townships; this very essential element was peculiar to all
Celtic territories, and was often covered over rather than
obliterated even by the subsequent Romanising. Mediolanum
and Brixia were indebted for their wide bounds and
their lasting power essentially to the fact that they were,
properly speaking, nothing but the cantons of the Insubres
and the Cenomani. The facts, that the territory of the
town of Vienna embraced Dauphin&eacute; and Western Savoy,
and that the equally old and almost equally considerable
townships of Cularo &#40;Grenoble&#41; and Genava &#40;Geneva&#41; were
down to late imperial times in point of law villages of the
colony of Vienna, are likewise to be explained from the
circumstance that this was the later name of the tribe of
the Allobroges. In most of the Celtic cantons one township
so thoroughly preponderates that it is one and the
same thing whether we name the Remi or Durocortorum,
the Bituriges or Burdigala; but the converse also occurs,
as <em>e.g.</em> among the Vocontii Vasio &#40;Vaison&#41; and Lucus,
among the Carnutes Autricum &#40;Chartres&#41; and Cenabum
&#40;Orleans&#41; balance each other; and it is more than questionable
whether the privileges which, according to Italic
and Greek organisation, attached as a matter of course to
the ring&ndash;wall in contrast to the open field, stood <em>de jure</em>,
or even merely <em>de facto</em>, on a similar footing among the
Celts. The counterpart to this canton in the Graeco&ndash;Italic
system was much less the town than the tribe; we have
to liken the Carnutes to the Boeotians, Autricum and
Cenabum to Tanagra and Thespiae. The specialty of
the position of the Celts under the Roman rule as compared
with other nations&mdash;the Iberians, for example, and
the Hellenes&mdash;turns on this, that these larger unions continued
to subsist as communities in the former case, while
in the latter those constituent elements, of which they
were composed, formed the communities. Older diversities
of national development belonging to the pre&ndash;Roman
epoch may have co&ndash;operated in the matter; it may possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
have been more easily practicable to take from the
Boeotians the joint diet of their towns than to break up
the Helvetii into three or four districts; political unions
maintain their ground even after subjugation under a
central power, in cases where their dissolution would bring
about disorganisation. Yet what was done in Gaul by
Augustus or, if it be preferred, by Caesar, was brought about
not by the force of circumstances, but chiefly by the free
resolution of the government, as it alone was in keeping
with the forbearance otherwise exercised towards the
Celts. For there was, in fact, in the pre&ndash;Roman time and
even at the time of Caesar&#8217;s conquest a far greater number
of cantons than we find later; in particular, it is
remarkable that the numerous smaller cantons attached
by clientship to a larger one did not in the imperial
period become independent, but disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> If subsequently
the Celtic land appears divided into a moderate
number of considerable, and some of them even very large,
canton&ndash;districts, within which dependent cantons nowhere
make their appearance, this arrangement had the way no
doubt paved for it by the pre&ndash;Roman system of clientship,
but was completely carried out only under the
Roman reorganisation.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Influence
of the
cantonal
constitution.</span>This continued subsistence and this enlargement of
the cantonal constitution must have been above all influential
in determining the further political development of
Gaul. While the Tarraconensian province was split up
into two hundred and ninety&ndash;three independent communities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
&#40;<a href="#Page_72">p.&nbsp;72</a>&#41;, the three Gauls numbered together, as we
shall see, not more than sixty&ndash;four of them. Their
unity and their recollections remained unbroken; the
zealous adoration, which throughout the imperial period
was paid among the Volcae to the fountain&ndash;god Nemausus,
shows how even here, in the south of the land and in
a canton transformed into a town, there was still a vivid
sense of the traditional tie that bound them together.
Communities with wide bounds, firmly knit in this way
by inward ties, were a power. Such as Caesar found the
Gallic communities, with the mass of the people held in
entire political as well as economic dependence, and an
overpowerful nobility, they substantially remained under
Roman rule; exactly as in pre&ndash;Roman times the great
nobles, with their train of dependents and bondsmen to
be counted by thousands, played the part of masters each
in his own home, so Tacitus describes the state of
things in Tiberius&#8217;s time among the Treveri. The Roman
government gave to the community comprehensive rights,
even a certain military power, so that they under certain
circumstances were entitled to erect fortresses and keep
them garrisoned, as was the case among the Helvetii; the
magistrates could call out the militia, and had in that case
the rights and the rank of officers. This prerogative was
not the same in the hands of the president of a small
town of Andalusia, and of the president of a district on
the Loire or the Moselle of the size of a small province.
The large&ndash;hearted policy of Caesar the elder, to whom
the outlines of this system must necessarily be traced
back, here presents itself in all its grand extent.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Diet of the
three Gauls.</span>But the government did not confine itself to leaving
with the Celts their cantonal organisation; it left, or
rather gave, to them also a national constitution, so far
as such a constitution was compatible with Roman
supremacy. As on the Hellenic nation, so Augustus
conferred on the Gallic an organised collective representation,
such as they in the epoch of freedom and of
disorganisation had striven after, but had never attained.
Under the hill crowned by the capital of Gaul, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
the Saone mingles its waters with those of the Rhone,
on the 1st August of the year 742<span class="sidenote2">12.</span>, the imperial prince
Drusus, as representative of the government in Gaul,
consecrated to Roma and to the Genius of the ruler the
altar, at which thenceforth every year on this day the
festival of these gods was to be celebrated by the joint
action of the Gauls. The representatives of all the
cantons chose from their midst year by year the &#8220;priest
of the three Gauls,&#8221; who on the emperor&#8217;s day presented
sacrifice to the emperor and conducted the festal games
in connection with it. This representative council had
not only a power of administering its own property by
means of officials, who belonged to the chief circles of the
provincial nobility, but also a certain share in the general
affairs of the country. Of its immediate interference in
politics there is, it is true, no other trace than that, in the
serious crisis of the year 70, the diet of the three Gauls
dissuaded the Treveri from rising against Rome; but it
had and used the right of bringing complaints as to the
imperial and domestic officials acting in Gaul; and it co&ndash;operated,
moreover, if not in the imposition, at any rate
in the apportionment of the taxes,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> especially seeing that
these were laid on not according to the several provinces
but for Gaul in general. The imperial government
certainly called into existence similar institutions in all
the provinces, and not merely introduced in each of them
the centralisation of sacred rites, but also&mdash;what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
republic had not done&mdash;conferred on each one an organ
for bringing requests and complaints before the government.
Yet Gaul had in this respect, as compared with
all other parts of the empire, at least a privilege <em>de facto</em>,
as indeed this institution is here alone found fully
developed.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> For one thing, the united diet of the three
provinces necessarily had a more independent position
in presence of the legates and procurators of each of them,
than, for example, the diet of Thessalonica in presence
of the governor of Macedonia. But then, in the case of
institutions of this nature, far less depends on the measure
of the rights conferred than on the weight of the bodies
therein represented; and the strength of the individual
Gallic communities was transferred to the diet of Lyons,
just as the weakness of the individual Hellenic communities
to that of Argos. In the development of Gaul
under the emperors the diet of Lyons to all appearance
promoted essentially that general Gallic homogeneity,
which went there hand in hand with the Latinising.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Composition
of the
diet.</span>The composition of the diet, which is known to us
with tolerable accuracy,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> shows in what way the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
of nationalities was treated by the government. Of the
sixty, afterwards sixty&ndash;four, cantons represented at the
diet, only four fall to the Iberian inhabitants of Aquitania&mdash;although
this region between the Garonne and the
Pyrenees was divided among a very much larger number
of, as a rule, small tribes&mdash;whether it was that the others
were excluded altogether from representation, or that
those four represented cantons were the meeting&ndash;places
of canton&ndash;unions.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> Afterwards, probably in the time
of Trajan, the Iberian district was separated from the
Lyons diet, and had an independent representation
given to it.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> On the other hand, the Celtic cantons in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
that organisation, with which we have formerly become
acquainted, were substantially all represented at the diet,
and likewise the half or wholly Germanic,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> so far as at
the time of the institution of the altar they belonged
to the empire. That there was no place in this cantonal
representation for the capital of Gaul was a matter of
course. Moreover, the Ubii do not appear at the diet
of Lyons, but sacrifice at their own altar of Augustus:
this was, as we saw &#40;<a href="#Page_35">p.&nbsp;35</a>&#41;, a remnant, which was
allowed to subsist, of the intended province of Germany.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Restricted
Roman
franchise of
the Gauls
admitted to
citizenship.</span>While the Celtic nation in imperial Gaul was thus consolidated
in itself, it was also guaranteed in some measure
against Roman influences by the course pursued as regards
the conferring of the imperial franchise for this domain.
The capital of Gaul no doubt was, and continued to be, a
Roman burgess&ndash;colony, and this was essentially bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
up with the peculiar position which it occupied and was
intended to occupy in contradistinction to the rest of Gaul.
But while the south province was covered with colonies
and organised throughout according to Italian municipal
law, Augustus did not institute in the three Gauls a single
burgess&ndash;colony; and probably even that municipal <em>ius</em>,
which under the name of &#8220;Latin&#8221; formed an intervening
stage between burgesses and non&ndash;burgesses, and afforded
to its more notable holders burgess&ndash;rights in law for their
persons and their descendants, was for a considerable time
withheld from Gaul. The personal bestowal of the franchise,
partly, according to general enactments, on the
soldiers sometimes at their entering on, sometimes at their
leaving, service, partly out of special favour on individuals,
might certainly fall to the lot also of the Gaul; Augustus
did not go so far as the republic went in prohibiting the
Helvetian, for example, once for all from acquiring the
Roman franchise, nor could he do so, after Caesar had in
many cases given the franchise in this way to native
Gauls. But he took at least from burgesses proceeding
from the three Gauls&mdash;with the exception always of the
Lugudunenses&mdash;the right of candidature for magistracies,
and therewith at the same time excluded them from the
imperial senate. Whether this enactment was made
primarily in the interest of Rome or primarily in that of
the Gauls, we cannot tell; certainly Augustus wished to
secure both points&mdash;to check on the one hand the intrusion
of the alien element into the Roman system, and thereby
to purify and elevate the latter, and on the other hand to
guarantee the continued subsistence of the Gallic idiosyncrasy
after a fashion, which precisely by its judicious
reserve promoted the ultimate blending with the Roman
character more surely than an abrupt obtrusion of foreign
institutions would have done.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Admission
of individual
communities
to
Latin
rights.</span>The emperor Claudius, himself born in Lyons and, as
those who scoffed at him said, a true Gaul, set aside in
great part these restrictions. The first town in Gaul
which certainly received Italian rights was that of the
Ubii, where the altar of Roman Germany was constructed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
there Agrippina, the subsequent wife of Claudius, was born
in the camp of her father Germanicus, and she procured
in the year 50 colonial rights, probably Latin, for her
native place, the modern Cologne. Perhaps at the same
time, perhaps even earlier, the same privilege was procured
for the town of the Treveri Augusta, the modern
Treves. Some other Gallic cantons, moreover, were in
this way brought nearer to the Roman type, such as that
of the Helvetii by Vespasian, and also that of the Sequani
&#40;Besan&#231;on&#41;; but Latin rights do not seem to have met
with great extension in these regions. Still less in the
time of the earlier emperors was the full right of citizenship
conferred in imperial Gaul on whole communities.
<span class="sidenote">Setting
aside of the
restricted
franchise.</span>But Claudius probably made a beginning by cancelling
the legal restriction which excluded the Gauls that had
attained to personal citizenship of the empire from the
career of imperial officials; this barrier was set aside in
the first instance for the oldest allies of Rome, the Haedui,
and soon perhaps generally. By this step equality of
position was essentially obtained. For, according to the
circumstances of this epoch, the imperial citizenship had
hardly any special practical value for the circles that were
by their position in life excluded from an official career,
and was of easy attainment for wealthy <em>peregrini</em> of good
descent, who wished to enter on this career and on that
account had need of it; but it was doubtless a slight
keenly felt, when the official career remained in law
closed against the Roman burgess from Gaul and his
descendants.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Celtic and
Latin
language.</span>While in the organising of administration the national
character of the Celts was respected so far as was at all
compatible with the unity of the empire, this was not the
case as regards language. Even if it had been practicable
to allow the communities to conduct their administration
in a language, of which the controlling imperial officials
could only in exceptional cases be masters, it undoubtedly
was not the design of the Roman government to erect
this barrier between the rulers and the ruled. Accordingly,
among the coins struck in Gaul under Roman rule,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
and monuments erected on behalf of any community, there
has been found no demonstrably Celtic inscription. The
use of the language of the country otherwise was not
hindered; we find as well in the southern province as in
the northern monuments with Celtic inscription, written
in the former case always with the Greek,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> in the latter
always with the Latin<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> alphabet; and probably at least
several of the former, certainly all of the latter, belong to
the epoch of Roman rule. The fact that in Gaul, outside
of the towns having Italian rights and the Roman camps,
inscribed monuments occur at all in but small number, is
in all probability to be accounted for mainly by supposing
that the language of the country, treated as dialect,
appeared just as unsuited for such employment as the
unfamiliar imperial language, and hence the erection of
memorial&ndash;stones did not become generally adopted here as
in the Latinised regions; the Latin probably may at that
time in the greater part of Gaul have had nearly the same
position, as it had subsequently in the earlier Middle ages
overagainst the popular language of the time. The
vigorous survival of the national language is most distinctly
shown by the reproduction of the Gallic proper
names in Latin, not seldom with the retention of non&ndash;Latin
forms of sound. The facts that spellings like
<em>Lousonna</em> and <em>Boudicca</em> with the non&ndash;Latin diphthong <em>ou</em>
found their way even into Latin literature, that for the
aspirated dental, the English <em>th</em>, there was even employed
in Roman writing a special sign &#40;<del>D</del>&#41;, that Epadatextorigus
is written alongside of Epasnactus, and &#208;irona alongside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
of Sirona&mdash;make it almost a certainty that the Celtic
language, whether in the Roman territory or beyond it,
had in or before this epoch undergone a certain regulation
in the matter of writing, and could already at that time
be written as it is written in the present day.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Evidences
of continued
use
of Celtic.</span>Nor are evidences wanting of its continued use in Gaul.
When the names of towns Augustodunum &#40;Autun&#41;, Augustonem&#275;tum
&#40;Clermont&#41;, Augustobona &#40;Troyes&#41;, and various
similar ones arose, Celtic was necessarily still spoken even
in middle Gaul. Arrian, under Hadrian, gives in his disquisition
on cavalry, the Celtic expression for particular
man&oelig;uvres borrowed from the Celts. Irenaeus, a Greek
by birth, who towards the end of the second century
acted as a clergyman in Lyons, excuses the defects of his
style by saying that he lives in the country of the Celts,
and is compelled constantly to speak in a barbarian
language. In a juristic treatise from the beginning of the
third century, in contrast to the rule of law that testamentary
directions in general are to be drawn up in Latin
or Greek, any other language, <em>e.g.</em>, Punic or Gallic, is
allowed for <em>fidei commissa</em>. The emperor Alexander had
his end announced to him by a Gallic fortune&ndash;teller in the
Gallic language. Further, the church father Jerome,
who had been himself in Ancyra as well as in Treves,
assures us that the Galatians of Asia Minor and the
Treveri of his time spoke nearly the same language, and
compares the corrupt Gallic of the Asiatic with the corrupt
Punic of the African. The Celtic language has maintained
itself in Brittany, just as in Wales, to the present
day; but while the province no doubt obtained its present
name from the insular Britons who, in the fifth century
fled thither before the Saxons, the language was hardly
imported for the first time with these, but was to all
appearance handed down from one generation to another
there for thousands of years. In the rest of Gaul naturally
during the course of the imperial period Roman habits
step by step gained ground; but the Celtic idiom was
put an end to here, not so much by the Germanic immigration
as by the Christianising of Gaul, which did not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
as in Syria and Egypt, adopt and make a vehicle of the
language of the country that was set aside by the government,
but preached the Gospel in Latin.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Romanising
stronger
in the east.</span>In the progress of Romanising, which in Gaul, apart
from the southern province, continued to be left in substance
to inward development, there is apparent a remarkable
diversity between the eastern Gaul and the west and
north&mdash;a difference, which turns doubtless in part, but
not solely, on the contrast between the Germans and the
Gauls. In the occurrences at and after Nero&#8217;s fall this
diversity comes into prominence even as exercising a
political influence. The close contact of the eastern
cantons with the camps on the Rhine and the recruiting
of the Rhenish legions, which took place especially here,
procured earlier and more complete entrance for Roman
habits there than in the region of the Loire and the Seine.
On occasion of those quarrels the Rhenish cantons&mdash;the
Celtic Lingones and Treveri, as well as the Germanic Ubii
or rather the Agrippinenses&mdash;went with the Roman town
of Lugudunum and held firmly to the legitimate Roman
government, while the insurrection, at least, as was
observed, in a certain sense national, originated from the
Sequani, Haedui, and Arverni. In a later phase of the
same struggle we find under altered party&ndash;relations the
same disunion&mdash;those eastern cantons in league with the
Germans, while the diet of Rheims refuses to join them.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Native
road&ndash;measurement.</span>While the Gallic land was thus in respect of language
treated in the main just like the other provinces, we again
meet with forbearance towards its old institutions in the
regulations as to weights and measures. It is true that,
alongside of the general imperial ordinance, which was
issued in this respect by Augustus, the local observances
continued in many places to subsist agreeably to the
tolerant, or rather indifferent, attitude of the government
in such things; but it was only in Gaul that the local
arrangement afterwards supplanted that of the empire.
The roads in the whole Roman empire were measured
and marked according to the unit of the Roman mile
&#40;1.48 kilom.&#41;, and up to the end of the second century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
this applied also to those provinces. But from Severus
onward its place was taken in the three Gauls and the
two Germanies by a mile correlated no doubt to the
Roman, but yet different and with a Gallic name, the
<em>leuga</em> &#40;2.22 kilom&egrave;tres&#41;, equal to one and a half Roman
miles. Severus cannot possibly have wished in this
matter to make a national concession to the Celts; this
is not in keeping either with the epoch or with that emperor
in particular, who stood in an attitude of expressed
hostility to these very provinces; it must have been considerations
of expediency that influenced him. These
could only be based on the fact that the national road&ndash;measure,
the <em>leuga</em> or else the double <em>leuga</em>, the German
<em>rasta</em>, which latter corresponds to the French <em>lieue</em>, continued
to subsist in these provinces after the introduction
of the unit of road&ndash;measure to a much greater extent
than was the case in other countries of the empire.
Augustus must have extended the Roman mile formally
to Gaul and placed the itineraries and the imperial highways
on that footing, but must have in reality left to the
country the old road&ndash;measurement; and so it may have
happened that the later administration found it less inconvenient
to acquiesce in the double unit for postal traffic<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
than to continue to make use of a road&ndash;measure practically
unknown in the country.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Religion of
the country.</span>Of far greater significance is the attitude of the Roman
government to the religion of the country; in this beyond
doubt the Gallic nationality found its most solid support.
Even in the south province the worship of non&ndash;Roman
deities must have held its ground long, much longer than,
for example, in Andalusia. The great commercial town
of Arelate, indeed, has no other dedications to show than
to gods worshipped also in Italy; but in Fr&eacute;jus, Aix,
N&icirc;mes, and the whole coast region generally, the old
Celtic divinities were in the imperial epoch not much less
worshipped than in the interior of Gaul. In the Iberian
part of Aquitania also we meet numerous traces of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
indigenous worship altogether different from the Celtic.
All the images of gods, however, that have come to light
in the south of Gaul bear a stamp deviating less from the
usual type than the monuments of the north; and, above
all, it was easier to manage matters with the national gods
than with the national priesthood, which meets us only in
imperial Gaul and in the British Islands,&mdash;the Druids &#40;iv.
236&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;225.</span>. It would be vain labour to seek to give any conception
of the internal character of the Druidic doctrine,
strangely composed of speculation and imagination; only
some examples may be allowed to illustrate its singular
and fearful nature. The power of speech was symbolically
represented in a bald&ndash;headed, wrinkled, sunburnt old man,
who carries club and bow, and from whose perforated
tongue fine golden chains run to the ears of the man that
follows him&mdash;betokening the flying arrows and the crushing
blows of the old man mighty in speech, to whom the
hearts of the multitude willingly listen. This was the
Ogmius of the Celts; to the Greeks he appeared as
a Charon dressed up as Herakles. An altar found in
Paris shows us three images of the gods with annexed
inscription; in the middle Jovis, on his left Vulcan, on
his right Esus &#8220;the horrid with his cruel altars,&#8221; as a
Roman poet terms him, and yet a god of commerce and
of peaceful dealing;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> he is girded for labour like Vulcan,
and, as the latter carries hammer and tongs, so he hews
a willow tree with the axe. A frequently recurring deity,
probably named Cernunnos, is represented cowering with
crossed legs; on its head it bears a stag&#8217;s antlers, on
which hangs a neck chain, and holds in its lap a money&ndash;bag;
before it stand cattle and goats&mdash;apparently, as if
it were meant to express the ground as the source of
riches. The enormous difference of this Celtic Olympus&mdash;void
of all chasteness and beauty and delighting in quaint
and fantastic mingling of things very earthly&mdash;from the
simply human forms of the Greek, and the simply human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
conceptions of the Roman, religion enables us to guess the
barrier which stood between these conquered and their
conquerors. With this were connected, moreover, very
serious practical consequences; a comprehensive traffic in
secret remedies and charms, in which the priests played
at the same time the part of physicians, and in which,
alongside of the conjuring and the blessing, human sacrifices
occurred, and healing of the sick by the flesh of those
thus slain. That direct opposition to the foreign rule prevailed
in the Druidism of this period cannot at least be
proved; but, even if this were not the case, it is easy to
conceive that the Roman government, which elsewhere let
alone all local peculiarities of worship with indifferent
toleration, contemplated this Druidical system, not merely
in its extravagances but as a whole, with apprehension.
The institution of the Gallic annual festival in the purely
Roman capital of the country, and with the exclusion of
any link attaching it to the national cultus, was evidently
a counter&ndash;move of the government against the old religion
of the country, with its yearly council of priests at
Chartres, the centre of the Gallic land. Augustus, however,
took no further direct step against Druidism than
that of prohibiting any Roman citizen from taking part in
the Gallic national cultus. Tiberius in his more energetic
way acted with decision, and prohibited altogether this
priesthood with its retinue of teachers and healing practitioners;
but it does not quite speak for the practical
success of this enactment that the same prohibition was
issued afresh under Claudius: it is narrated of the latter
that he caused a Gaul of rank to be beheaded, simply
because he was convicted of having brought into application
the charms customary in his own country for a good
result in proceedings before the emperor. That the
occupation of Britain, which had been from of old the
chief seat of these priestly actings, was in good part
resolved on in order thereby to get at the root of the evil,
will be fully set forth in the sequel &#40;<a href="#Page_185">p.&nbsp;185</a>&#41;. In spite of all
this the priesthood still played an important part in the
revolt which the Gauls attempted after the downfall of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the Claudian dynasty; the burning of the Capitol&mdash;so the
Druids preached&mdash;announced the revolution in affairs, and
the beginning of the dominion of the north over the south.
But, although this oracle came subsequently to be fulfilled,
it was not so through this nation and in favour of its
priests. The peculiarities of the Gallic worship doubtless
still exerted their effect even later; when in the third
century a distinctive Gallo&ndash;Roman empire came into existence
for some time, Hercules played the first part on its
coins partly in his Graeco&ndash;Roman form, partly as Gallic
Deusoniensis or Magusanus. But of the Druids there is
no further mention, except only so far as the sage women
in Gaul down to the time of Diocletian passed under the
name of Druidesses and uttered oracles, and the ancient
noble houses still for long boasted of Druidic progenitors
on their ancestral roll. The religion of the country fell
into the background still more rapidly perhaps than the
native language, and Christianity, as it pushed its way,
hardly encountered in the former any serious resistance.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Economic
condition.</span>Southern Gaul, withdrawn more than any other province
by its position from hostile assault, and, like Italy
and Andalusia, a land of the olive and the fig, rose under
the imperial government to great prosperity and rich
urban development. The amphitheatre and the sarcophagus&ndash;field
of Arles, the &#8220;mother of all Gaul,&#8221; the
theatre of Orange, the temples and bridges still standing
erect to this day in and near N&icirc;mes, are vivid witnesses
of this down to the present time. Even in the northern
provinces the old prosperity of the country was enhanced
by the lasting peace, which, certainly with lasting pressure
of taxation, accrued to the land by means of the foreign
rule. &#8220;In Gaul,&#8221; says a writer of the time of Vespasian,
&#8220;the sources of wealth are at home, and flood the earth
with their abundance.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Perhaps nowhere do equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
numerous and equally magnificent country&ndash;houses make
their appearance,&mdash;especially in the east of Gaul, on the
Rhine and its affluents; we discern clearly the rich Gallic
nobility. Famous is the testament of a man of rank
among the Lingones, who directs that there should be
erected for him a memorial tomb and a statue of Italian
marble or best bronze, and that, among other things, his
whole implements for hunting and fowling be burned
along with him. This reminds us of the elsewhere mentioned
hunting&ndash;parks enclosed for miles in the Celtic
country, and of the prominent part which the Celtic
hounds for the chase and Celtic huntsmanship play in the
Xenophon of Hadrian&#8217;s time, who does not fail to add
that the hunting system of the Celts could not have been
known to Xenophon the son of Gryllos. To this connection
belongs likewise the remarkable fact that in the Roman
army of the imperial period the cavalry was, properly
speaking, Celtic, not merely inasmuch as it was pre&ndash;eminently
recruited from Gaul, but also because the
man&oelig;uvres, and even the technical expressions, were in
good part derived from the Celts; we see here how,
after the disappearance of the old burgess&ndash;cavalry under
the republic, the cavalry became reorganised by Caesar
and Augustus with Gallic men and in Gallic fashion.
The basis of this notable prosperity was agriculture,
towards the elevation of which Augustus himself worked
with energy, and which yielded rich produce in all Gaul,
apart perhaps from the steppe&ndash;region on the Aquitanian
coast. The rearing of cattle was also lucrative, especially
in the north, particularly the rearing of swine and sheep,
which soon acquired importance for manufactures and
for export; the Menapian hams &#40;from Flanders&#41; and
the Atrebatian and Nervian cloth&ndash;mantles &#40;near Arras<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
and Tournay&#41; went forth in later times to the whole
empire.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Culture of
the vine.</span>Of special interest was the development of the culture
of the vine. Neither the climate nor the government was
favourable to it. The &#8220;Gallic winter&#8221; remained long
proverbial among the inhabitants of the southern lands;
as, indeed, it was on this side that the Roman empire
extended farthest towards the north. But narrower
limits were drawn for the Gallic cultivation of the vine
by Italian commercial competition. Certainly the god
Dionysos accomplished his conquest of the world on the
whole slowly, and only step by step did the drink prepared
from grain give way to the juice of the vine; but
it was a result of the prohibitive system that in Gaul beer
maintained itself at least in the north as the usual spirituous
drink throughout the whole period of the empire; and
even the emperor Julian, on his abode in Gaul, came into
conflict with this pseudo&ndash;Bacchus.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> The imperial government
did not indeed go so far as the republic, which
placed under police prohibition the culture of the vine
and olive on the south coast of Gaul<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;177;&nbsp;ii.&nbsp;375.</span>&#40;iii.&nbsp;175; ii.&nbsp;398&#41;;
but the Italians of their time were withal the true sons of
their fathers. The flourishing condition of the two great
emporia on the Rhine, Arles and Lyons, depended in no
small degree on the market for Italian wine in Gaul; by
which fact we may measure what importance the culture
of the vine must at that time have had for Italy. If one
of the most careful administrators who held the imperial
office, Domitian, issued orders that in all the provinces at
least the half of the vines should be destroyed<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>&mdash;which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
it is true, were not so carried out&mdash;we may thence infer
that the diffusion of the vine&ndash;culture was at all events subjected
to serious restriction on the part of the government.
In the Augustan age it was still unknown in the northern
part of the Narbonese province &#40;iv.&nbsp;227, note&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;217.</span>, and, though
here too it was soon taken up, it yet appears to have remained
through centuries restricted to the Narbonensis and
southern Aquitania; of Gallic wines the better age knows
only the Allobrogian and the Biturigian, according to our
way of speaking, the Burgundian and the Bordeaux.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> It
was only when the reins of the empire fell from the hands
of the Italians, in the course of the third century, that this
was changed, and the emperor Probus &#40;276&ndash;282&#41; at length
threw the culture of the vine open to the provincials.
Probably it was only in consequence of this that the vine
gained a firm footing on the Seine as on the Moselle.
&#8220;I have,&#8221; writes the emperor Julian, &#8220;spent a winter&#8221; &#40;it
was the winter of 357&ndash;358&#41; &#8220;in dear Lutetia, for so the
Gauls term the little town of the Parisii, a small island
lying in the river and walled all round. The water is there
excellent and pure to look at and to drink; the inhabitants
have a pretty mild winter, and good wine is
grown among them; in fact, some even rear figs, covering
them up in winter with wheaten straw as with a cloth.&#8221;
And not much later the poet of Bordeaux, in his pleasing
description of the Moselle, depicts the vineyards as bordering
that river on both banks, &#8220;just as my own vines
wreathe for me the yellow Garonne.&#8221; </p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Network of
highways.</span>The internal intercourse, as well as that with the
neighbouring lands, especially with Italy, must have been
very active, and the network of roads must have been
much developed and fostered. The great imperial highway
from Rome to the mouth of the Baetis, which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
been mentioned, under Spain &#40;<a href="#Page_74">p.&nbsp;74</a>&#41;, was the main artery
for the land traffic of the south province; the whole
stretch, kept in repair in republican times from the Alps
to the Rhone by the Massaliots, from thence to the Pyrenees
by the Romans, was laid anew by Augustus. In the north
the imperial highways led mainly to the Gallic capital or
to the great camps on the Rhine; yet sufficient provision
seems to have been made for other requisite communication.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Hellenism
in south
Gaul.</span>If the southern province in the olden time belonged
intellectually to the Hellenic type, the decline of Massilia
and the mighty progress of Romanism in southern Gaul
produced, no doubt, an alteration in that respect; nevertheless
this portion of Gaul remained always, like Campania,
a seat of Hellenism. The fact that Nemausus, one
of the towns sharing the heritage of Massilia, shows on its
coins of the Augustan period Alexandrian numbering of the
years and the arms of Egypt, has been not without probability
referred to the settlement by Augustus himself of
veterans from Alexandria in this city, which presented no
attitude of opposition to Hellenism. It may, doubtless, also
be brought into connection with the influence of Massilia,
that to this province, at least as regards descent, belonged
that historian, who&mdash;apparently in intentional contrast to
the national&ndash;Roman type of history, and occasionally
with sharp sallies against its most noted representatives,
Sallust and Livy&mdash;upheld the Hellenic type, the Vocontian
Pompeius Trogus, author of a history of the world beginning
with Alexander and the kingdoms of the Diadochi,
in which Roman affairs are set forth only within this
framework, or by way of appendix. Beyond doubt in this
he was only retaliating, which was strictly within the province
of the literary opposition of Hellenism; still it remains
remarkable that this tendency should find its Latin representative,
and an adroit and fluent one, here in the
Augustan age. From a later period Favorinus deserves
mention, of an esteemed burgess&ndash;family in Arles, one of
the chief pillars of polymathy in Hadrian&#8217;s time; a philosopher
with an Aristotelian and sceptical tendency, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
same time a philologue and rhetorician, the scholar of
Dion of Prusa, the friend of Plutarch and of Herodes
Atticus, assailed polemically in the field of science by
Galen and in light literature by Lucian, sustaining lively
relations generally with the noted men of letters of the
second century, and not less with the emperor Hadrian.
His manifold investigations, among other matters, concerning
the names of the companions of Odysseus that
were devoured by Scylla, and as to the name of the first
man who was at the same time a man of letters, make
him appear as the genuine representative of the erudite
dealing in trifles that was then in vogue; and his discourses
for a cultivated public on Thersites and the ague, as
well as his conversations in part recorded for us &#8220;on all
things and some others,&#8221; give not an agreeable, but a
characteristic, picture of the literary pursuits of the time.
Here we have to call attention to what he himself reckoned
among the remarkable points of his career in life, that he
was by birth a Gaul and at the same time a Greek author.
Although the <em>literati</em> of the West frequently gave, as
occasion offered, specimens of their Greek, but few of
them made use of this as the proper language of their
authorship; in this case its use would be influenced in
part by the scholar&#8217;s place of birth.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Latin literature
in the
south province.</span>South Gaul, moreover, had so far a share in the
Augustan bloom of literature, that some of the most
notable forensic orators of the later Augustan age,
Votienus Montanus &#40;&#8224; 27 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&#41;, from Narbo&mdash;named the
Ovid of orators&mdash;and Gnaeus Domitius Afer &#40;consul in
39 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&#41; from Nemausus, belonged to this province.
Generally, as was natural, Roman literature extended its
circulation also over this region; the poets of Domitian&#8217;s
time sent their free copies to friends in Tolosa and Vienna.
Pliny, under Trajan, is glad that his minor writings find
even in Lugudunum not merely favourable readers, but
booksellers who push their sale. But we cannot produce
evidence for the south of any such special influence, as
Baetica exercised in the earlier, and northern Gaul in the
later, imperial period, on the intellectual and literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
development of Rome. The fair land yielded richly
wine and fruits; but the empire drew from it neither
soldiers nor thinkers.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Literature
in imperial
Gaul.</span>Gaul proper was in the domain of science the promised
land of teaching and learning; this presumably was
due to the peculiar development and to the powerful
influence of the national priesthood. Druidism was by no
means a naive popular faith, but a highly developed and
pretentious theology, which in the good church&ndash;fashion
strove to enlighten, or at any rate control, all spheres of
human thought and action, physics and metaphysics, law
and medicine; which demanded of its scholars unwearied
study, it was said, for twenty years, and sought and found
these its scholars pre&ndash;eminently in the ranks of the
nobility. The suppression of the Druids by Tiberius and
his successors must have affected in the first instance
these schools of the priests, and have led to their being
at least publicly abolished; but this could only be done
effectively when the national training of youth was brought
face to face with the Romano&ndash;Greek culture, just as the
Carnutic council of Druids was confronted with the temple
of Roma in Lyons. How early this took place in Gaul,
without question under the guiding influence of the
government, is shown by the remarkable fact that in the
formerly mentioned revolt under Tiberius the insurgents
attempted above all to possess themselves of the town of
Augustodunum &#40;Autun&#41;, in order to get into their power
the youths of rank studying there, and thereby to gain or
to terrify the great families. In the first instance these
Gallic Lycea may well have been, in spite of their by no
means national course of training, a leaven of distinctively
Gallic nationality; it was hardly an accident that the
most important of them at that time had its seat, not in
the Roman Lyons, but in the capital of the Haedui, the
chief among the Gallic cantons. But the Romano&ndash;Hellenic
culture, though perhaps forced on the nation and
received at first with opposition, penetrated, as gradually
the antagonism wore off, so deeply into the Celtic character,
that in time the scholars applied themselves to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
more zealously than the teachers. The training of a
gentleman, somewhat after the manner in which it at
present exists in England, based on the study of Latin
and in the second place of Greek, and vividly reminding
us in the development of the school&ndash;speech, with its finely
cut points and brilliant phrases, of more recent literary
phenomena springing from the same soil, became gradually
in the West a sort of chartered right of the Gallo&ndash;Romans.
The teachers there were probably at all times
better paid than in Italy, and above all were better treated.
Quintilian already mentions with respect among the prominent
forensic orators several Gauls; and not without
design Tacitus, in his fine dialogue on oratory, makes the
Gallic advocate, Marcus Aper, the defender of modern
eloquence against the worshippers of Cicero and Caesar.
The first place among the universities of Gaul was subsequently
taken by Burdigala, and indeed generally Aquitania
was, as respects culture, far in advance of middle and
northern Gaul; in a dialogue written there at the beginning
of the fifth century one of the speakers, a clergyman
from Ch&#226;lon&ndash;sur&ndash;Sa&#244;ne, hardly ventures to open his mouth
before the cultivated Aquitanian circle. This was the
sphere of working of the formerly&ndash;mentioned professor
Ausonius, who was called by the emperor Valentinian to
be teacher of his son Gratian &#40;born in 359&#41;, and who has
in his miscellaneous poems raised a monument to a large
number of his colleagues; and, when his contemporary
Symmachus, the most famous orator of this epoch, sought
a private tutor for his son, he had one brought from Gaul
in recollection of his old teacher who had his home on
the Garonne. By its side Augustodunum remained always
one of the great centres of Gallic studies; we have still
the speeches which were made before the emperor Constantine,
asking, and giving thanks for, the re&ndash;establishment
of this school of instruction.</p>

<p>The representation in literature of this zealous
scholastic activity is of a subordinate kind, and of slight
value&mdash;declamations, which were stimulated especially by
the later conversion of Treves into an imperial residence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
and the frequent sojourn of the court in the Gallic land,
and occasional poems of a multifarious character. The
making of verses was, like the supply of speeches, a
necessary function of the teaching office, and the public
teacher of literature was at the same time a poet not
exactly born, but bespoken. At least the depreciation
of poetry, which is characteristic of the otherwise similar
Hellenic literature of the same epoch, did not prevail
among these Occidentals. In their verses the reminiscence
of the school and the artifice of the pedant predominate,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
and pictures of vivid and real feeling, as in the Moselle&ndash;trip
of Ausonius, but rarely occur. The speeches, which
we are indeed in a position to judge of only by some late
addresses delivered at the imperial palace, are models in
the art of saying little in many words, and of expressing
absolute loyalty with an equally absolute lack of thought.
When a wealthy mother sent her son, after he had acquired
the copiousness and ornateness of Gallic speech, onward
to Italy to acquire also the Roman dignity,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> this was
certainly more difficult of acquisition for these Gallic
rhetoricians than the pomp of words. For the early
Middle age such performances as these exercised decisive
influence; through them in the first Christian period
Gaul became the seat proper of pious verses and withal
the last refuge of scholastic literature, while the great
mental movement within Christianity did not find its chief
representatives there.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Constructive
and
plastic art.</span>In the sphere of the constructive and plastic arts the
climate itself called forth various phenomena unknown,
or known only in their germs, to the south proper. Thus
the heating of the air, which in Italy was usual only for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
baths, and the use of glass windows, which was likewise
far from common there, were comprehensively brought
into application in Gallic architecture. But we may
perhaps speak of a development of art peculiar to this
region, in so far as figures and, in progress of time,
representations of scenes of daily life emerge in the
Celtic territory with relatively greater frequency than in
Italy, and replace the used&ndash;up mythological representations
by others more pleasing. It is certainly almost in the
sepulchral monuments alone that we are able to recognise
this tendency to the real and the <em>genre</em>, but it doubtless
prevailed in the practice of art generally. The arch of
Arausio &#40;Orange&#41;, from the early imperial period, with
its Gallic weapons and standards; the bronze statue of
the Berlin museum found at Vetera, representing apparently
the god of the place with ears of barley in his hair; the
Hildesheim silver&ndash;plate, probably proceeding in part from
Gallic workshops, show a certain freedom in the adoption
and transformation of Italian suggestions. The tomb of
the Julii at St. Remy, near Avignon, a work of the
Augustan age, is a remarkable evidence of the lively and
spirited reception of Hellenic art in southern Gaul, as
well in its bold architectural structure of two square
storeys crowned by a peristyle with conic dome, as also
in its reliefs which, in style most nearly akin to the
Pergamene, present battle and hunting scenes with numerous
figures, taken apparently from the life of the persons
honoured, in picturesque animated execution. It is
remarkable that the acme of this development is reached&mdash;by
the side of the southern province&mdash;in the district of
the Moselle and the Maas. This region, not placed so
completely under Roman influence as Lyons and the
headquarter&ndash;towns on the Rhine, and more wealthy and
civilised than the districts on the Loire and the Seine,
seems to have in some measure produced of itself this
exercise of art. The tomb of a man of rank in Treves,
well known under the name of the Igel Column, gives
a clear idea of the tower&ndash;like monuments, crowned with
pointed roof and covered on all sides with representations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
of the life of the deceased, that are here at home.
Frequently we see on them the landlord, to whom his
peasants present sheep, fish, fowls, eggs. A tombstone
from Arlon, near Luxemburg, shows, besides the
portraits of the two spouses, on the one side a cart and
a woman with a fruit&ndash;basket, on the other a sale of
apples above two men squatting on the ground. Another
tombstone from Neumagen, near Treves, has the form of
a ship; in this sit six mariners plying the oars; the
cargo consists of large casks, alongside of which the
merry&ndash;looking steersman seems&mdash;one might imagine&mdash;to
be rejoicing over the wine which they contain. We
may perhaps bring them into connection with the serene
picture which the poet of Bordeaux has preserved to us
of the Moselle valley, with its magnificent castles, its
many vineyards, and its stirring doings of fishermen and
of sailors, and find in it the proof that in this fair land,
more than fifteen hundred years ago, there was already
the pulsation of peaceful activity, serene enjoyment, and
warm life.</p>

<p class="head3">ROMAN GERMANY AND THE FREE GERMANS.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Limitation
of Roman
Germany.</span><span class="smcap">The</span> two Roman provinces of Upper and Lower Germany
were the result of that defeat of the Roman arms and of
Roman policy under the reign of Augustus which has
been already &#40;<a href="#Page_55">p.&nbsp;55&nbsp;f.</a>&#41; described. The original province
of Germany, which embraced the country from the Rhine
to the Elbe, subsisted only twenty years, from the first
campaign of Drusus, 742 <span class="smcap lowercase">U.C.</span><span class="sidenote2">12.</span>, down to the battle of
Varus and the fall of Aliso, 762 <span class="smcap lowercase">U.C.</span> <span class="sidenote2"><span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;9.</span>;but as, on the
one hand, it included the military camps on the left bank
of the Rhine&mdash;Vindonissa, Mogontiacum, Vetera&mdash;and,
on the other hand, even after that disaster, more or less
considerable portions of the right bank remained Roman,
the governorship and the command were not, in a strict
sense, done away by that catastrophe, although they
were, so to speak, placed in suspense. The internal
organisation of the Three Gauls has been already set
forth; they embraced the whole country as far as the
Rhine without distinction of descent&mdash;except that the
Ubii, who had only been brought over to settle in Gaul
during the last crises, did not belong to the sixty&ndash;four
cantons, while the Helvetii, the Triboci, and generally
the districts elsewhere held in occupation by the Rhenish
troops, doubtless did so belong. The intention had
been to gather together the German cantons between
the Rhine and Elbe into a similar association under
Roman supremacy, as had been constituted in the case
of the Gallic cantons, and to bestow upon it, in the altar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
to Augustus of the Ubian town&mdash;the germ of the modern
Cologne&mdash;an executive centre similar to that which the
altar of Augustus at Lyons formed for Gaul; for the
more remote future the transference of the chief camp to
the right bank of the Rhine, and the restoration of the
left, at least in the main, to the governor of the Belgica,
were doubtless in contemplation. But these projects
came to an end with the legions of Varus; the Germanic
altar of Augustus on the Rhine became or remained
the altar of the Ubii; the legions permanently retained
their standing quarters in the territory, which properly
belonged to the Belgica, but&mdash;seeing that a separation of
the military and civil administration was, according to
the Roman arrangement, excluded&mdash;was placed, so long
as the troops were stationed there, for administrative
purposes also under the commandants of the two armies.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
For, as was formerly stated, Varus was probably the last
commandant of the united army of the Rhine; on the
increase of the army to eight legions, which was consequent
upon that disaster, the division of it to all
appearance also ensued. What we have to describe in
this section therefore is not, strictly speaking, the circumstances
of a Roman province, but the fortunes of a Roman
army, and, as most closely connected therewith, the
fortunes of the neighbouring peoples and adversaries, so
far as these are interwoven with the history of Rome.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Upper and
Lower Germany.</span>The two headquarters of the army of the Rhine were
always Vetera near Wesel and Mogontiacum, the modern
Mentz, both doubtless older than the division of the
command, and one of the reasons for introducing that
division. The two armies numbered in the first century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
four legions each, thus about 30,000 men<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>; at or between
those two points lay the main bulk of the Roman
troops, besides one legion at Noviomagus &#40;Nimeguen&#41;,
another at Argentoratum &#40;Strassburg&#41;, and a third at Vindonissa
&#40;Windisch not far from Z&uuml;rich&#41; not far from the
Raetian frontier. To the lower army belonged the not
inconsiderable fleet on the Rhine. The boundary between
the upper and the lower army lay between Andernach and
Remagen near Brohl,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> so that Coblenz and Bingen fell to
the upper, Bonn and Cologne to the lower military district.
On the left bank there belonged to the upper German
administrative circuit the districts of the Helvetii &#40;Switzerland&#41;,
the Sequani &#40;Besan&#231;on&#41;, the Lingones &#40;Langres&#41;,
the Rauraci &#40;Basle&#41;, the Triboci &#40;Alsace&#41;, the Nemetes
&#40;Spires&#41;, and the Vangiones &#40;Worms&#41;; to the more restricted
lower German circuit belonged the district of the
Ubii, or rather the colony Agrippina &#40;Cologne&#41;, those of
the Tungri &#40;Tongern&#41;, the Menapii &#40;Brabant&#41;, and the
Batavi, while the cantons situated farther to the west,
including Metz and Treves, were placed under the different
governors of the three Gauls. While this separation
has merely administrative significance, on the other hand
the varying extent of the two jurisdictions on the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
bank coincides with the varying relations to their neighbours
and the advancing or receding of the bounds of the
Roman rule conditioned by those relations. With these
neighbours confronting them, matters on the lower and
on the upper Rhine were regulated in ways so diverse, and
the course of events was so thoroughly different that here
the provincial separation became historically of the most
decisive importance. Let us look first at the development
of things on the lower Rhine.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Lower Germany.</span>We have formerly described how far the Romans had
subjugated the Germans on both banks of the Rhine.
The Germanic Batavi had been peacefully united with
the empire not by Caesar, but not long afterwards, perhaps
by Drusus &#40;<a href="#Page_28">p.&nbsp;28</a>&#41;. They were settled in the Rhine delta,
that is on the left bank of the Rhine and on the islands
formed by its arms, upwards as far at least as the Old
Rhine, and so nearly from Antwerp to Utrecht and
Leyden in Zealand and southern Holland, on territory
originally Celtic&mdash;at least the local names are predominantly
Celtic; their name is still borne by the Betuwe, the
lowland between the Waal and the Leck with the capital
Noviomagus, now Nimeguen. They were, especially compared
with the restless and refractory Celts, obedient and
useful subjects, and hence occupied a distinctive position
in the aggregate, and particularly in the military system,
of the Roman empire. They remained quite free from
taxation, but were on the other hand drawn upon more
largely than any other canton in the recruiting; this one
canton furnished to the army 1000 horsemen and 9000
foot soldiers; besides, the men of the imperial body&ndash;guard
were taken especially from them. The command of these
Batavian divisions was conferred exclusively on native
Batavi. The Batavi were accounted indisputably not
merely as the best riders and swimmers of the army, but
also as the model of true soldiers, and in this case certainly
the good pay of the Batavian body&ndash;guard, as well as the
privilege of the nobles to serve as officers, considerably
confirmed their loyalty. These Germans accordingly had
taken no part either preparatory to, or consequent upon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
the disaster of Varus; and if Augustus, under the first
impression of the terrible news, discharged his Batavian
guard, he soon became convinced of the groundlessness of
his suspicion, and the troop was a short time afterwards
reinstated.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Cannenefates.</span>On the other bank of the Rhine next to the Batavi, in
the modern Kennemer district &#40;North Holland beyond
Amsterdam&#41;, dwelt the Cannenefates, closely related to
them but less numerous; they are not merely named
among the tribes subjugated by Tiberius, but were also
treated like the Batavi in the furnishing of soldiers. <span class="sidenote">Frisians.</span> The
Frisians, adjoining these further on, in the coast district
that is still named after them, as far as the lower Ems,
submitted to Drusus and obtained a position similar to
that of the Batavi. There was imposed on them instead
of tribute simply the delivery of a number of bullocks&#8217;
hides for the wants of the army; on the other hand they
had to furnish comparatively large numbers of men for
the Roman service. They were the most faithful allies of
Drusus as afterwards of Germanicus, useful to him in constructing
canals as well as especially after the unfortunate
North Sea expeditions &#40;<a href="#Page_53">p.&nbsp;53</a>&#41;. They were followed on
the east by the Chauci, <span class="sidenote">Chauci.</span>a widely extended tribe of sailors
and fishermen along the coast of the North Sea on both
sides of the Weser, perhaps from the Ems to the Elbe; they
were brought into subjection to the Romans by Drusus at
the same time with the Frisians, but not, like these,
without resistance. All these Germanic coast tribes submitted
either by agreement or at any rate without any
severe struggle to the new rule, and as they had taken
no part in the rising of the Cherusci, they still continued
after the battle of Varus in their earlier relations to the
Roman empire; even from the more remote cantons of
the Frisians and the Chauci the garrisons were not at that
time withdrawn, and the latter still furnished a contingent
to the campaigns of Germanicus. On the renewed evacuation
of Germany in the year 17 the poor and distant land
of the Chauci, difficult of protection, seems certainly to
have been given up; at least there are no later evidences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
of the continuance of the Roman dominion there, and
some decades later we find them independent. But all
the land westward of the lower Ems remained with
the empire, whose boundary thus included the modern
Netherlands. The defence of this part of the imperial
frontier against the Germans not belonging to the empire
was left in the main to the subject maritime cantons
themselves.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Limes and
desert&ndash;frontier
on the
lower
Rhine.</span>Farther up the stream a different course was taken;
a frontier&ndash;road was here marked off, and the land lying
between it and the Rhine was depopulated. With the
frontier&ndash;road drawn at a greater or less distance from the
Rhine, the <em>Limes</em>,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> was associated the control of frontier&ndash;intercourse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
as the crossing of this road was forbidden
altogether by night, and, as regards armed men, by day,
and was permitted in the case of others, as a rule, only
under special precautions for security and on payment
of the prescribed transit&ndash;dues. Such a road was drawn
opposite to the headquarters on the lower Rhine, in what
is now M&uuml;nster, by Tiberius after the disaster of Varus,
at some distance from the Rhine, seeing that between it
and the river stretched the &#8220;Caesian forest,&#8221; the more
precise position of which is not known. Similar arrangements
must have been made at the same time in the
valleys of the Ruhr and the Sieg as far as that of the
Wied, where the province of the lower Rhine ended. This
road did not necessarily require to be militarily occupied
and arranged for defence, although of course the defence
of the frontier and the fortification of it always aimed at
making the frontier&ndash;road as far as possible secure. A
chief means for protecting the frontier was the depopulation
of the tract of land between the river and the road.
 &#8220;The tribes on the right bank of the Rhine,&#8221; says a well&ndash;informed
author of the time of Tiberius, &#8220;have been in
part transferred by the Romans to the left bank, in part
withdrawn of their own accord into the interior.&#8221; This
applied, in what is now the M&uuml;nster country, to the Germanic
stocks earlier settled there of the Usipes, Tencteri,
Tubantes. In the campaigns of Germanicus these appear
dislodged from the Rhine, but still in the region of the
Lippe, afterwards, probably in consequence of those very
expeditions, farther southward opposite to Mentz. Their
old home lay thenceforth desolate, and formed the extensive
pasture&ndash;country reserved for the herds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
lower Germanic army, on which in the year 58 first the
Frisii and then the Amsivarii, wandering homeless, thought
of settling, without being able to procure leave from the
Roman authorities to do so. Farther to the south at
least a portion of the Sugambri, who likewise were subjected
in great part to the same treatment, remained
settled on the right bank,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> while other smaller tribes were
wholly dislodged. The scanty population tolerated within
the Limes were, as a matter of course, subjects of the
empire, as is confirmed by the Roman levy taking place
among the Sugambri.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Conflicts
with the
Frisii and
Chauci
under
Claudius.</span>In this way matters were arranged on the lower Rhine
after the abandonment of the more comprehensive projects,
and thus a not inconsiderable territory on the right
bank was still held by the Romans. But various inconvenient
complications arose in connection with it. Towards
the end of the reign of Tiberius &#40;28&#41; the Frisians, in
consequence of intolerable oppression in the levying of
tribute in itself small, revolted from the empire, slew the
people employed in levying it, and besieged the Roman
commandant acting there, with the rest of the Roman
soldiers and civilians sojourning in the territory, in the
fortress of Flevum, where, previous to the extension of the
Zuyder See that took place in the Middle Ages, lay the
eastmost mouth of the Rhine, near the modern island
Vlieland beside the Texel. The rising assumed such
proportions that both armies of the Rhine marched in
concert against the Frisians; but still the governor Lucius
Apronius accomplished nothing. The Frisians gave up
the siege of the fortress, when the Roman fleet brought up
the legions; but it was difficult to get near the Frisians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
themselves in a country so much intersected; several Roman
corps were destroyed in detail, and the Roman advanced
guard was so thoroughly defeated that even the dead
bodies of the fallen were left in the power of the enemy.
The matter was not brought to a decisive action, nor yet
to a true subjugation; Tiberius, the older he grew, became
ever less inclined to larger enterprises, which gave to the
general in command a position of power. With this state
of things was connected the fact that in the immediately
succeeding years the neighbours of the Frisians, the
Chauci, became very troublesome to the Romans; in
the year 41 the governor Publius Gabinius Secundus
had to undertake an expedition against them, and six
years later &#40;47&#41; they even pillaged far and wide the coast
of Gaul with their light piratical vessels under the leadership
of the Roman deserter Gannascus, by birth one of
the Cannenefates. Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, nominated
governor of Lower Germany by Claudius, put a stop
with his fleet to these forerunners of the Saxons and
Normans, and afterwards vigorously brought back the
Frisians to obedience, by organising anew their commonwealth
and stationing a Roman garrison among them.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The occupation
of
the right
bank abandoned.</span>Corbulo had the intention of chastising the Chauci also;
at his instigation Gannascus was put out of the way&mdash;against
a deserter he held himself entitled to take this
course&mdash;and he was on the point of crossing the Ems
and advancing into the country of the Chauci, when not
only did he receive counter&ndash;orders from Rome, but the
Roman government wholly and completely altered its
attitude on the lower Rhine. The emperor Claudius
directed the governor to remove all Roman garrisons
from the right bank. We may well conceive that the
imperial general with bitter words commended the good
fortune of the free commanders of Rome in former days;
in this step certainly there was a conclusive admission of
defeat, which had been but partially owned after the
battle of Varus. Probably this restriction of the Roman
occupation of Germany, which was not occasioned by any
pressure of immediate necessity, was called forth by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
resolve just then adopted to occupy Britain, and finds its
justification in the fact that the troops were not sufficient
for accomplishing both objects at once. That the order
was executed, and matters remained afterwards in that
position, is proved by the absence of Roman military inscriptions
on the whole right bank of the lower Rhine.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
Only isolated points for crossing and sally&ndash;ports, such as,
in particular, Deutz opposite Cologne, formed exceptions
from this general rule. The military road keeps here to
the left bank and strictly to the course of the Rhine,
while the traffic&ndash;route running behind it, cutting off the
windings, pursues the straight line of communication.
Here on the right bank of the Rhine there is no evidence
of Roman military roads, either through the discovery of
milestones or otherwise.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Its subsequent
position.</span>The withdrawal of the garrisons did not imply giving
up possession, strictly speaking, of the right bank in this
province. It was looked upon by the Romans thenceforth
somewhat as the commandant of a fortress looks upon the
ground that lies under his cannon. The Cannenefates and
at least a part of the Frisians<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> were afterwards subject, as
before, to the empire. We have already remarked that subsequently
in the M&uuml;nster country the herds of the legions still
pastured, and the Germans were not allowed to settle there.
But the government thenceforth relied&mdash;for the defence
of such border&ndash;territory on the right bank as still existed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
in this province&mdash;in the north on the Cannenefates and the
Frisians, and farther up the stream substantially on the
space left desolate; and, if it did not directly forbid, at
any rate did not give scope to Roman settlement there.
The altar stone of a private person found at Altenberg
&#40;circuit of M&uuml;lheim&#41;, on the river Dh&uuml;n, is almost the only
evidence of Roman inhabitants in these regions. This is
the more remarkable, as the prosperity of Cologne would,
if special hindrances had not here stood in the way, have
of itself carried Roman civilisation far and wide on the
other bank. Often enough Roman troops may have
traversed these extensive regions, perhaps even have kept
the roads&mdash;which were here laid out in large number
during the Augustan period&mdash;in some measure passable,
and possibly laid out new ones; sparse settlers, partly
remains of the old Germanic population, partly colonists
from the empire, may have settled here, similar to those
that we shall soon find in the earlier imperial period on
the right bank of the upper Rhine; but the highways,
like the possessions, lacked the stamp of durability. There
was no wish to undertake here a labour of similar extent
and difficulty to that which we shall become acquainted
with further on in the upper province, or to provide here,
as was done there, military defence and fortification for
the frontier of the empire. Therefore the lower Rhine
was crossed doubtless by Roman rule, but not, like the
upper Rhine, also by Roman culture.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The situation
in Gaul
and Germany
after
the fall of
Nero.</span>For the double task of keeping the neighbouring Gaul
in obedience and of keeping the Germans of the right
bank aloof from Gaul, the army of the lower Rhine would,
even after abandoning the occupation of the region on the
right of the river, have quite sufficed, and the peace without
and within would not presumably have been interrupted,
had not the downfall of the Julio&ndash;Claudian dynasty,
and the civil or rather military war thereby called forth,
exercised a momentous influence on these relations. The
insurrection of the Celtic land under the leadership of
Vindex was no doubt defeated by the two Germanic
armies; but Nero&#8217;s fall nevertheless ensued, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
the Spanish army as well as the imperial guard in Rome
appointed a successor to him, the armies of the Rhine did
the same; and in the beginning of the year 69 the greater
portion of these troops crossed the Alps to settle the point
on the battle&ndash;fields of Italy, whether its ruler was to be
called Marcus or Aulus. In May of the same year the
new emperor Vitellius followed, after arms had decided in
his favour, accompanied by the remainder of the good
soldiers inured to war. The blanks in the garrisons of
the Rhine were no doubt filled up for the exigency by
recruits hastily levied in Gaul; but the whole land knew
that they were not the old legions, and it soon became
apparent that these were not coming back. If the new
ruler had had in his power the army that placed him on
the throne, at least a portion of them must have returned
to the Rhine immediately after the defeat of Otho in
April; but the insubordination of the soldiers still more
than the new complication which soon set in with the proclamation
of Vespasian as emperor in the East, retained
the German legions in Italy.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Preparations
for
the insurrection.</span>Gaul was in the most fearful excitement. The rising
of Vindex was, as we formerly remarked &#40;<a href="#Page_82">p.&nbsp;82</a>&#41;, in itself
directed not against the rule of Rome but against the
rulers for the time being; but it was none the less on that
account a warfare between the armies of the Rhine and
the levy <em>en masse</em> of the great majority of the Celtic cantons;
and these were none the less subjected to pillage and
maltreatment resembling that of the conquered. The tone
of feeling which subsisted between the provincials and the
soldiers was shown, for instance, by the treatment which
the canton of the Helvetii experienced as the troops
destined for Italy marched through it. Because a courier
despatched by the adherents of Vitellius to Pannonia had
here been seized, the columns on the march from the one
side, and the Romans stationed as a garrison in Raetia
on the other, entered the canton, pillaged the villages far
and wide, particularly what is now Baden near Z&uuml;rich,
chased those who had fled to the mountains out of their
lurking&ndash;places, and put them to death by thousands or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
sold the captives under martial law. Although the capital
Aventicum &#40;Avenches, near Murten&#41; submitted without
resistance, the agitators of the army demanded that it
should be razed, and all that the general granted was that
the question should be referred not, forsooth, to the emperor,
but to the soldiers of the great headquarters; these
sat in judgment on the fate of the town, and it was
merely the turn of their caprice that saved the place
from destruction. Outrages of this nature brought the
provincials to extremities; even before Vitellius left Gaul,
a certain Mariccus, from the canton of the Boii, dependent
on the Haedui, came forward a god on earth, as he said,
and destined to restore the freedom of the Celts; and
people flocked in troops to his banner. But the exasperation
in the Celtic country was not of so very great
moment. The very rising of Vindex had most clearly
shown how utterly incapable the Gauls were of releasing
themselves from the Roman embrace.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Rising of
the Batavian
auxiliaries.</span>But the tone of feeling of the Germanic districts
reckoned as belonging to Gaul&mdash;in the modern Netherlands&mdash;of
the Batavi, the Cannenefates, the Frisians, whose
distinctive position has already been dwelt on, had a
somewhat greater importance; and it happened that, on
the one hand, these very tribes had been exasperated to
the utmost, and on the other, that their contingents were
accidentally to be found in Gaul. The bulk of the Batavian
troops, 8000 men, assigned to the 14th legion, had
for a considerable time a place along with the latter in
the army of the upper Rhine, and had then under
Claudius, on occasion of the occupying of Britain, gone to
that island, where this corps shortly before had, by its
incomparable valour, gained the decisive battle under
Paullinus for the Romans; from this day onward it
occupied indisputably the first place among all the divisions
of the Roman army. When it was recalled on
account of this very distinction by Nero, in order to go
off with him to the war in the East, the revolution breaking
out in Gaul had brought about a quarrel between the
legion and its auxiliary troops; the former, faithfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
devoted to Nero, hastened to Italy; the Batavi, on the
other hand, refused to follow. Perhaps this was connected
with the fact that two of their most noted officers,
<span class="sidenote">Civilis.</span> the brothers Paulus and Civilis, had, without any reason
and without respect to many years of faithful service and
honourable wounds, been shortly before put on trial as
suspected of high treason, and the former executed, the
latter placed in captivity. After the downfall of Nero,
to which the revolt of the Batavian cohorts had materially
contributed, Galba released Civilis and sent the Batavians
back to their old headquarters in Britain. While they, on
the march thither, were encamped among the Lingones
&#40;Langres&#41;, the legions of the Rhine revolted from Galba
and proclaimed Vitellius emperor. The Batavi, after considerable
hesitation, ultimately joined the movement; Vitellius
did not forgive them for this hesitation, but did not venture
directly to call to account the leader of the powerful corps.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Progress of
the movement.</span>Thus the Batavians had marched with the legions of
lower Germany to Italy and had fought with their usual
valour in the battle of Betriacum for Vitellius, while their
old legionary comrades confronted them in the army of
Otho. But the arrogance of the Germans exasperated
their Roman comrades in victory, however much these
acknowledged their valour in battle; the very generals in
command did not trust them, and even made an attempt
to divide by detaching them&mdash;a course, which, in this war,
where the soldiers commanded and the generals obeyed,
was not capable of being carried out, and had almost cost
the general his life. After the victory they were commissioned
to accompany their hostile comrades of the 14th
legion to Britain; but when matters came to a skirmish
between the two at Turin, the latter alone went to Britain,
and the Batavians to Germany. Meanwhile Vespasian
had been proclaimed emperor in the East, and, while in
consequence of this Vitellius gave to the Batavian cohorts
marching orders for Italy as well as ordered new comprehensive
levies among the Batavi, commissioners of Vespasian
opened communications with the Batavian officers
to hinder this departure, and to provoke in Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
itself a rising which should detain the troops there.
Civilis entered into the suggestion. He resorted to his
home, and gained easily the assent of his own people as
well as the neighbouring Cannenefates and Frisians. The
insurrection broke out among the former; the camps of
the two cohorts in the neighbourhood were surprised and
the Roman posts seized; the Roman recruits fought ill;
soon Civilis with his cohort&mdash;which he had caused to follow,
ostensibly to employ it against the insurgents&mdash;threw himself
openly into the movement, along with the three
Germanic cantons renounced allegiance to Vitellius, and
summoned the other Batavians and Cannenefates, who
just then were breaking up from Mentz for the march to
Italy, to join him.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Its character.</span>All this was more a soldiers&#8217; rising than an insurrection
of the province, or even a Germanic war. If at that time
the Rhine legions were fighting with those of the Danube,
and further with these and the army of the Euphrates,
it was but in keeping that the soldiers of the second
class, and above all their most distinguished troop,
the Batavian, should enter independently into this divisional
warfare. Any one who compares this movement
among the cohorts of the Batavians and the Germans on
the left of the Rhine with the insurrection of those on
the right bank of the Rhine under Augustus, may not
overlook the fact, that in the later rising the alae and
cohorts took up the part of the general levy of the
Cherusci; and, if the perfidious officer of Varus released
his nation from the Roman rule, the Batavian leader
acted in the commission of Vespasian; in fact, perhaps, on
the secret directions of the governor of his province
privately inclined towards Vespasian, and the rising in
the first instance was directed simply against Vitellius.
It is true that the position of things was such that this
soldiers&#8217; revolt might change itself at any moment into
a German war of the most dangerous kind. The same
Roman troops who covered the Rhine against the
Germans of the right bank were, in consequence of
the corps&ndash;warfare, placed in an attitude of hostility to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the Germans on the left bank; the parts were of
such a nature, that it seemed almost easier to exchange
them than to carry them out. Civilis himself may
possibly have left it to depend on the sequel, whether the
movement would end in a change of emperor or in the
expulsion of the Romans from Gaul by the Germans.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">State of the
armies on
the Rhine.</span>The command of the two armies on the Rhine was
held at this time, after the governor of lower Germany
had been made emperor, by his former colleague in
upper Germany, Hordeonius Flaccus, a gouty man
advanced in years, without energy and without authority,
either, moreover, in fact secretly holding to Vespasian, or
at any rate very much suspected of such faithlessness by
the legions, who zealously adhered to the emperor of
their own making. It is characteristic of him and of his
position that, to clear himself of the suspicion of treason,
he gave orders that the government despatches on arrival
should be sent unopened to the eagle&ndash;bearers of the
legions, and these should read them in the first instance
to the soldiers, before they forwarded them to their
address. Of the four legions of the lower army which
had primarily to do with the insurgents two, the 5th
and the 15th, were stationed under the legate Munius
Lupercus in the headquarters at Vetera; the 16th, under
Numisius Rufus, in Novaesium &#40;Neuss&#41;; the 1st, under
Herennius Gallus, in Bonna &#40;Bonn&#41;. Of the upper army,
which then numbered only three legions,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> one, the 21st,
remained in its stated quarters Vindonissa, aloof from
these events, if it had not rather been drawn off wholly
to Italy; the two others, the 4th Macedonian and the
22d, were stationed at the headquarters Mentz, where
Flaccus also was present; and in point of fact, his able
legate Dillius Vocula exercised the chief command. The
legions had throughout only half of their full complement,
and most of the soldiers were half&ndash;invalids or recruits.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">First conflicts.</span>Civilis, at the head of a small number of regular
troops, but of the collective levy of the Batavi, Cannenefates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
and Frisians, advanced from his home to the attack.
In the first instance, on the Rhine he met with remnants
of the Roman garrisons driven from the northern cantons
and a division of the Roman Rhenish fleet; when he
attacked them, not merely did the ships&#8217; crews, consisting
in great part of Batavians, go over to him, but also a
cohort of the Tungri&mdash;it was the first revolt of a Gallic
division; such Italian soldiers as were present were
slain or taken prisoners. This success brought at length
the Germans on the right of the Rhine into the movement.
<span class="sidenote">Participation

of the Roman subjects on the other bank&mdash;now came to
be fulfilled, and as well the Chauci and the Frisians on
the coast, as above all, the Bructeri on both sides of the
upper Ems as far down as the Lippe, the Tencteri on
the middle Rhine opposite to Cologne, and in lesser
measure the tribes adjoining these on the south&mdash;Usipes,
Mattiaci, Chatti&mdash;threw themselves into the struggle.
When, on the orders of Flaccus, the two weak legions
marched out from Vetera against the insurgents, these
could already confront them with a numerous contingent
drawn from beyond the Rhine; and the battle ended, like
the combat on the Rhine, with a defeat of the Romans
through the defection of the Batavian cavalry, which
belonged to the garrison of Vetera, and through the bad
behaviour of the cavalry of the Ubii and of the Treveri.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Siege of
Vetera.</span>The insurgents and the Germans who flocked to them
proceeded to invest and besiege the headquarters of the
lower army. During this siege news of the events on
the lower Rhine reached the other Batavian cohorts in
the neighbourhood of Mentz; they at once wheeled round
towards the north. Instead of ordering them to be cut
down, the weak&ndash;minded commander&ndash;in&ndash;chief allowed them
to go, and when the commandant of the legion in Bonn
sought to intercept them, Flaccus did not support him as
he might have done and had even at first promised. So the
brave Germans dispersed the Bonn legion and succeeded
in joining Civilis&mdash;henceforth the compact core of his
army, in which now the banners of the Roman cohorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
stood by the side of the animal&ndash;standards from the sacred
groves of the Germans. But still the Batavian held, at
least ostensibly, by Vespasian; he swore in the Roman
troops in Vespasian&#8217;s name, and summoned the garrison
of Vetera to join him in declaring for the latter. These
troops, however, saw in this, probably with warrant, a
mere attempt to overreach them, and repelled it as
resolutely as they repelled the assailing hosts of the
enemy, who soon found themselves compelled by the
superiority of Roman tactics to change the siege into a
blockade. But, as the leaders of the Roman army had
been taken by surprise in these events, provisions were
scarce and speedy relief was urgently called for. In
order to bring it, Flaccus and Vocula set out with their
whole force from Mentz, drew to themselves on the way
the two legions from Bonna and Novaesium as well as
the auxiliary troops of the Gallic cantons appearing
at the word of command in large numbers, and approached
Vetera.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Vocula.</span>But instead of throwing at once the whole force from
within and without on the besiegers, however great their
superiority in numbers, Vocula pitched his camp at Gelduba
&#40;Gellep on the Rhine, not far from Krefeld&#41; a long
day&#8217;s march distant from Vetera, while Flaccus lay farther
back. The worthlessness of the so&ndash;called general and the
ever increasing demoralisation of the troops, above all, the
distrust towards the officers, which frequently went so far
as to maltreat and attempt to kill them, can alone at least
explain this halting. Thus the mischief gradually
thickened on all sides. All Germany seemed desirous to
take part in the war; while the besieging army constantly
obtained new contingents from that quarter, other bands
passed over the Rhine, which in this dry summer was
unusually low, partly in the rear of the Romans into the
cantons of the Ubii and the Treveri to lay waste the valley
of the Moselle, partly below Vetera into the region of the
Maas and the Scheldt; further bands appeared before
Mentz and made pretext of besieging it. Then came the
accounts of the catastrophe in Italy. On the news of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
second battle at Betriacum in the autumn of the year 69
the Germanic legions gave up the cause of Vitellius as
lost and took the oath, though reluctantly, to Vespasian,
perhaps in the hope that Civilis, who had in fact inscribed
the name of Vespasian on his banners, would then make
his peace. But the German swarms, who had meanwhile
poured themselves over all northern Gaul, had not come
to install the Flavian dynasty; even if Civilis had ever
wished this, he now had no longer the power. He threw
off the mask, and openly expressed&mdash;what indeed was
long settled&mdash;that the Germans of north Gaul intended,
with the help of their free countrymen, to shake off the
Roman rule.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Relief of
Vetera.</span>But the fortune of war changed. Civilis attempted to
surprise the camp of Gelduba; the attack began successfully,
and the defection of the cohorts of the Nervii
brought Vocula&#8217;s little band into a critical position. Then
suddenly two Spanish cohorts fell on the rear of the Germans;
what threatened to be a defeat was converted into
a brilliant victory; the flower of the assailing army
remained on the field of battle. Vocula indeed did not
advance at once against Vetera, as he possibly might
have done, but he penetrated into the besieged town some
days later after a renewed vehement conflict with the
enemy. It is true that he brought no provisions; and,
as the river was in the power of the enemy, these had to
be procured by the land&ndash;route from Novaesium, where
Flaccus was encamped. The first convoy passed through;
but the enemy, having meanwhile assembled again, attacked
the second column with provisions on its way, and compelled
it to throw itself into Gelduba. Vocula went off
thither to its support with his troops and a part of the old
garrison of Vetera. When they had arrived at Gelduba,
the men refused to return to Vetera and to take upon
themselves the further sufferings of the siege in prospect;
instead of this they marched to Novaesium, and Vocula,
who knew that the remnant of the old garrison of
Vetera was in some measure provisioned, had for good
or evil to follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Mutiny of
Roman
troops.</span>In Novaesium meanwhile mutiny had broken out.
The soldiers had come to learn that a largess destined for
them by Vitellius had reached the general, and compelled
its distribution in the name of Vespasian. They
had scarcely received it, when, in the wild carousing which
ensued upon the largess, the old grudge of the soldiers
broke out afresh; they pillaged the house of the general
who had betrayed the army of the Rhine to the general of
the Syrian legions, slew him, and would have prepared the
same fate for Vocula, if the latter had not escaped in
disguise. Thereupon they once more proclaimed Vitellius
emperor, not knowing that he was already dead.
When this news came to the camp, the better part of the
soldiers, and in particular the two upper German legions,
began in some measure to reflect; they again exchanged
the effigy of Vitellius on their standards for that of Vespasian,
and placed themselves under the orders of Vocula;
he led them to Mentz, where he remained during the
rest of the winter 69&ndash;70. Civilis occupied Gelduba, and
thereby cut off Vetera, which was most closely blockaded;
the camps of Novaesium and Bonna were still held.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Insurrection
in
Gaul.</span>Hitherto the Gallic land, apart from the few insurgent
Germanic cantons in the north, had kept firmly by Rome.
Certainly partisanship ran through the several cantons;
among the Tungri, for example, the Batavi had a strong
body of adherents, and the bad behaviour of the Gallic
auxiliary troops during the whole campaign may probably
have been in part called forth by such a temper of hostility
to the Romans. But even among the insurgents
there was a considerable party favourably disposed to
Rome; a Batavian of note, Claudius Labeo, waged a partisan
warfare not without success against his countrymen in
his home and its neighbourhood, and the nephew of Civilis,
Julius Briganticus, fell in one of these combats at the head
of a band of Roman horse. All the Gallic cantons had
without more ado complied with the injunction to send
contingents; the Ubii, although of Germanic descent,
were in this war mindful simply of their Romanism, and
they as well as the Treveri had offered brave and successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
resistance to the Germans invading their territory. It
is easy to understand how this was so. The position of
things in Gaul was still much as it was in the days of
Caesar and Ariovistus; a liberation of their Gallic home
from the Roman dominion by means of those hordes,
which, in order to lend to Civilis the help of his countrymen,
were just then pillaging the valleys of the Moselle,
Maas, and Scheldt, was tantamount to a surrender of the
land to its Germanic neighbours; in this war, which had
grown out of a feud between two corps of Roman troops
into a conflict between Rome and Germany, the Gauls
were, properly speaking, nothing but the stake and the
booty. That the tone of feeling among the Gauls, in
spite of all their well&ndash;founded general and special complaints
as to the Roman government, was predominantly
anti&ndash;Germanic, and that the materials for kindling such a
national rising suddenly bursting into flame and reckless
of consequences, as had spread through the people in
an earlier time, were wanting in this Gaul now half&ndash;Romanised,
events up to this time had most clearly shown.
But amidst the constant misfortunes of the Roman army
the courage of the Gauls hostile to the Romans gradually
grew stronger, and their defection completed the catastrophe.
Two Treveri of note, Julius Classicus, the commander
of the Treverian cavalry, and Julius Tutor, commandant
of the garrisons on the banks of the middle
Rhine, Julius Sabinus one of the Lingones, descended, as
he at least boasted, from a bastard of Caesar, and some
other men of like mind from different cantons, professed
in thoughtless Celtic fashion to discern that the destruction
of Rome was written in the stars and announced to
the world by the burning of the Capitol &#40;Dec. 69&#41;.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Gallic
empire.</span>So they resolved to set aside the Roman rule and to
set up a Gallic empire. For this purpose they took the
course of Arminius. Vocula allowed himself to be really
induced by falsified reports of these Roman officers to set
out, with the contingents placed under their command and
a part of the Mentz garrison, in the spring of 70 for the
lower Rhine, in order with these troops and the legions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Bonna and Novaesium to relieve the hard&ndash;pressed Vetera.
On the march from Novaesium to Vetera, Classicus and
the officers in concert with him left the Roman army and
proclaimed the new Gallic empire. Vocula led the legions
back to Novaesium; Classicus pitched his camp immediately
in front of it; Vetera could not now hold out
long; the Romans could not but expect after its fall to find
themselves confronted by the whole power of the enemy.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Capitulation
of the
Romans.</span>The Roman troops refused to face this prospect and
entered into a capitulation with the revolted officers. In
vain Vocula attempted once more to urge the ties of discipline
and of honour; the legions of Rome allowed a
Roman deserter from the 1st legion to stab the brave
general on the order of Classicus, and themselves delivered
up the other chief officers in chains to the representative
of the empire of Gaul, who thereupon made the soldiers
swear allegiance to that empire. The same oath was
taken at the hands of the perfidious officers by the garrison
of Vetera, which, compelled by famine, at once surrendered,
and likewise by the garrison of Mentz, where
but a few individuals avoided disgrace by flight or death.
The whole proud army of the Rhine, the first army of the
empire, had surrendered to its own auxiliaries; Rome had
surrendered to Gaul.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">End of the
Gallic empire.</span>It was a tragedy, and at the same time a farce. The
Gallic empire lapsed, as it could not fail to do. Civilis
and his Germans were doubtless, in the first instance,
well content that the quarrel in the Roman camp delivered
the one as well as the other half of their foes into their
hands; but he had no thought of recognising that empire,
and still less had his allies from the right bank of the
Rhine.</p>

<p>As little would the Gauls themselves have anything
to do with it&mdash;a result, to which certainly the split
between the eastern districts and the rest of the country,
which had already become apparent at the rising of
Vindex, materially contributed. The Treveri and the
Lingones, whose leading men had instigated that camp&ndash;conspiracy,
stood by their leaders, but they remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
virtually alone; only the Vangiones and Triboci joined
them. The Sequani, into whose territory the Lingones
marched to induce their accession, drove them summarily
homeward. The esteemed Remi, the leading canton in
Belgica, convoked the diet of the three Gauls, and,
although there was no lack there of orators on behalf of
political freedom, it resolved simply to dissuade the
Treveri from the revolt. How the constitution of the
new empire would have turned out, had it been established,
it is difficult to say; we learn only that Sabinus, the
great&ndash;grandson of Caesar&#8217;s concubine, named himself
also Caesar, and in this capacity allowed himself to be
beaten by the Sequani; whereas Classicus, who had not
such ascendency at his command, assumed the insignia
of Roman magistracy, and thus played perhaps the part
of republican proconsul. In keeping with this there
exists a coin, which must have been struck by Classicus
or his adherents, exhibiting the head of Gallia, as the
coins of the Roman republic show that of Roma, and by
its side the symbol of the legion, with the genuinely
audacious legend of &#8220;fidelity&#8221; &#40;<em>fides</em>&#41;. At first, doubtless,
on the Rhine the imperialists, in concert with the
insurgent Germans, had full freedom. The remnants
of the two legions that had capitulated in Vetera were
put to death, contrary to the terms of surrender and to
the will of Civilis; the two from Novaesium and Bonna
were sent to Treves; all the Roman camps on the
Rhine, large and small, with the exception of Mogontiacum,
were burnt. The Agrippinenses found themselves
in the worst plight. The imperialists had certainly
confined themselves to requiring from them the oath of
allegiance; but the Germans in this case did not forget
that they were properly speaking, the Ubii.&nbsp;A message
of the Tencteri from the right bank of the Rhine&mdash;this
was one of the tribes whose old home the Romans had
laid desolate and used as pasture&ndash;ground, and which had
in consequence of this been obliged to seek other abodes&mdash;demanded
the razing of this chief seat of the Germanic
apostates, and the execution of all their citizens of Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
descent. This would probably have been resolved on
had not Civilis, who was personally under obligation to
them, as well as the German prophetess Veleda in the
canton of the Bructeri, who had predicted this victory,
and whose authority the whole insurgent army recognised,
interceded on their behalf.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Advent of
the Romans.</span>The victors were not left long to contend over the
booty. The imperialists certainly gave the assurance
that the civil war in Italy had broken out, that all the
provinces were overrun by the enemy, and Vespasian was
probably dead; but the heavy arm of Rome was soon
enough felt. The newly confirmed government could
despatch its best generals and numerous legions to the
Rhine; and certainly an imposing display of power was
there needed. Annius Gallus took up the command in
the upper, Petillius Cerialis in the lower province; the
latter, an impetuous and often incautious, but brave and
capable officer, took the really serious action. Besides
the 21st legion from Vindonissa, five came from Italy,
three from Spain, one along with the fleet from Britain,
and, in addition, a further corps from the Raetian
garrison. This and the 21st legion were the first to
arrive. The imperialists had possibly talked of blocking
the passes of the Alps; but nothing was done, and the
whole country of the upper Rhine lay open as far as
Mentz. The two Mentz legions had no doubt sworn
allegiance to the Gallic empire, and at first offered resistance;
but, so soon as they perceived that a larger Roman
army confronted them, they returned to obedience, and
the Vangiones and Triboci immediately followed their
example. Even the Lingones submitted&mdash;merely upon
a promise of mild treatment&mdash;without striking a blow on
the part of their 70,000 men capable of bearing arms.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>
The Treveri themselves had almost done the same; but
they were prevented from doing so by the nobility. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
two surviving legions of the lower Rhenish army that
were stationed here had, on the first news of the approach
of the Romans, torn the Gallic insignia from their
standards, and withdrew to the Mediomatrici that had
remained faithful &#40;Metz&#41;, where they submitted to the
mercy of the new general. When Cerialis arrived at the
army, he found a good part of the work already done.
The insurgent leaders exerted themselves, it is true, to
the utmost&mdash;at that time by their orders the legionary
legates delivered up at Novaesium were put to death&mdash;but
in a military sense they were impotent, and their
last political move&mdash;that of offering the Roman general
himself the sovereignty of the Gallic empire&mdash;was worthy
of the beginning. After a short combat Cerialis occupied
the capital of the Treveri, the leaders and the whole
council having taken refuge with the Germans. This
was the end of the Gallic empire.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Last
struggles
of Civilis.</span>More serious was the struggle with the Germans.
Civilis, with his whole fighting strength, the Batavi, the
contingent of the Germans, and the refugee bands of the
Gallic insurgents, suddenly assailed the much weaker
Roman army in Treves itself. The Roman camp was
already in his power, and the bridge of the Moselle
occupied by him, when his men, instead of following up
the victory which they had won, began prematurely to
pillage, and Cerialis, compensating for his imprudence by
brilliant valour, restored the combat and ultimately drove
the Germans out from the camp and the town. There
was no further success of importance. The Agrippinenses
again joined the Romans, and killed the Germans, who
were staying among them, in their houses; a whole
Germanic cohort encamped there was shut up and burnt
in its quarters. Whatsoever in Belgica still held to the
Germans was brought back to obedience by the legion
arriving from Britain; a victory of the Cannenefates
over the Roman ships which had landed the legion, and
other isolated successes of the brave Germanic bands, above
all, of the more numerous and better managed Germanic
ships, did not change the general position of the war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
On the ruins of Vetera Civilis confronted the foe; but
he had to give way to the Roman army, which had meanwhile
been doubled, and at length, after an obstinate
resistance, had to leave his own home to the enemy.
As ever happens, discord ensued in the train of misfortune.
Civilis was no longer sure of his own men, and
sought and found protection from them among his
opponents. Late in the autumn of the year 70 the
unequal struggle was decided; the auxiliaries now on
their part surrendered to the burgess&ndash;legions, and the
priestess Veleda went as a captive to Rome.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Nature of
the Roman
task and
its issue.</span>When we look back on this war, one of the most
singular and most dreadful in all ages, we cannot but
own that hardly ever has an army had a task set before
it equally severe with that of the two Roman armies on
the Rhine in the years 69 and 70. In the course of a
few months soldiers successively of Nero, of the senate,
of Galba, of Vitellius, and of Vespasian; the only support
to the dominion of Italy over the two mighty nations
of the Gauls and the Germans, while the soldiers of the
auxiliaries were taken almost entirely, and those of the
legions in great part, from those very nations; deprived
of their best men, mostly without pay, often starving, and
beyond all measure wretchedly led, they were certainly
expected to perform feats physically and morally super&ndash;human.
They ill sustained the severe trial. This was
less a war between two divisions of the army, like the
other civil wars of this terrible time, than a war of
soldiers, and above all of officers, of the second class
against those of the first, combined with a dangerous
insurrection and invasion of the Germans, and an incidental
and insignificant revolt of some Celtic districts. In
Roman military history Cannae and Carrhae and the
Teutoburg Forest are glorious pages compared with the
double disgrace of Novaesium; only a few individual
men, not a single troop, preserved a pure escutcheon
amidst the general dishonour. The frightful disorganisation
of the political and, above all, of the military system,
which meets us on the fall of the Julio&ndash;Claudian dynasty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
appears&mdash;more clearly even than in the leaderless battle
of Betriacum&mdash;in those events on the Rhine, to which the
history of Rome never before and never after exhibits a
parallel.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Consequences
of
the Batavian
war.</span>The very extent and general diffusion of these misdeeds
rendered a corresponding chastisement impossible.
It deserves to be acknowledged that the new ruler, who
happily had remained in person aloof from all these occurrences,
in a genuine statesmanly fashion allowed the
past to be past, and exerted himself only to prevent the
repetition of similar scenes. That the prominent culprits,
whether from the ranks of the troops or from the insurgents,
were brought to account for their crimes, was a
matter of course; we may measure the punishment by the
fact that when five years afterwards one of the Gallic
insurgent leaders was discovered in a lurking&ndash;place, in
which his wife had up to that time kept him concealed,
Vespasian gave him as well as her over to the executioner.
But the renegade legions were allowed to share in the
fighting against the Germans, and to atone for their guilt
to some extent in the hot conflicts at Treves and at
Vetera. It is true, nevertheless, that the four legions of
the lower Rhenish army were all dismissed, as was one
of the two upper Rhenish legions that took part&mdash;one
would gladly believe that the 22d was spared in honourable
remembrance of its brave legate. Probably a considerable
number of the Batavian cohorts met with the same
fate, and not less, apparently, the cavalry regiment of the
Treveri, and perhaps several other specially prominent
troops. Still less than against the rebellious soldiers
could proceedings be taken with the full severity of the
law against the insurgent Celtic and German cantons;
that the Roman legions demanded the razing of the
Treverian colony of Augustus&mdash;this time for the sake not
of booty but of vengeance&mdash;is at least as intelligible as
the destruction, desired by the Germans, of the town of
the Ubii; but as Civilis protected the one so Vespasian
protected the other. Even the Germans on the left of
the Rhine had, on the whole, their previous position left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
to them. But probably&mdash;we are here without certain
tradition&mdash;there was introduced in the levy and the employment
of the <em>auxilia</em> an essential change, which
diminished the danger involved in the auxiliary system.
The Batavi retained freedom from taxation and a still
privileged position as regards service; a part of them, not
altogether inconsiderable, had withal championed in arms
the cause of the Romans. But the Batavian troops were
considerably diminished, and, while hitherto&mdash;as it would
appear of right&mdash;officers had been placed over them from
their own nobility, and the same had been at least frequently
done as respects the other Germanic and Celtic
troops, the officers of the <em>alae</em> and <em>cohortes</em> were afterwards
taken predominantly from the class from which Vespasian
himself was descended&mdash;from the good urban middle class
of Italy and of the provincial towns organised after the
Italian fashion. Officers of the position of the Cheruscan
Arminius, of the Batavian Civilis, of the Treverian Classicus
do not henceforth recur. As little is the previous
close association of troops levied from the same canton
met with subsequently; on the contrary, the men serve,
without distinction as to their descent, in the most various
divisions; this was probably a lesson which the Roman
military administration gathered from this war. It was
another change, probably suggested by this war, that while
hitherto the majority of the auxiliaries employed in Germany
were taken from the Germanic and neighbouring cantons,
thenceforth the Germanic auxiliary troops found preponderantly
employment outside of their native country, just
like the Dalmatian and Pannonian troops in consequence
of the war with Bato. Vespasian was a soldier of sagacity
and experience; it is probably in good part a merit of
his if we meet with no later example of revolt of the
<em>auxilia</em> against their legions.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Later
attitude of
the Roman
Germans
on the
lower
Rhine.</span>That the insurrection, which we have just narrated, of
the Germans on the left of the Rhine&mdash;although it, in
consequence of the accidental completeness of the accounts
preserved respecting it, alone gives us a clear insight into
the political and military relations on the lower Rhine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
and in Gaul generally, and therefore deserved to be narrated
in more detail&mdash;was yet called forth more by outward
and accidental causes than by the inner necessity of things,
is proved by the apparently complete quiet which now
ensued there, and by the&mdash;so far as we can see&mdash;uninterrupted
<em>status quo</em> in this very region. The Roman Germans
were merged in the empire no less completely than
the Roman Gauls; of attempts at insurrection on the
part of the former there is no further mention. At the
close of the third century, the Franks invading Gaul by
way of the lower Rhine included in their seizure the
Batavian territory; yet the Batavians maintained themselves
in their old though diminished settlements, as did likewise
the Frisians, even during the confusions of the great
migration of peoples, and, so far as we know, preserved
allegiance even to the decaying empire.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The free
Germans
on the
lower
Rhine.</span>When we turn from the Romanised to the free Germans
to the east of the Rhine, we find offensive action on their
part not less brought to an end with their participation
in that Batavian insurrection, than the attempts of the
Romans to bring about an alteration of the frontier on a
grand scale in those regions came to a close with the
expeditions of Germanicus.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Bructeri.</span>Of the free Germans, those dwelling next to the
Roman territory were the Bructeri on both banks of the
middle Ems, and in the region of the sources of the Ems
and Lippe; for which reason they took part before all the
other Germans in the Batavian insurrection. To their
canton belonged the maiden Veleda, who sent forth her
countrymen to the war against Rome and promised them
the victory, whose utterance decided the fate of the town
of the Ubii, and to whose high tower the captive senators
and the captured admiral&#8217;s ship of the Rhenish fleet were
sent. The overthrow of the Batavi affected them also;
and perhaps, in addition, a special counterblow of the
Romans since that virgin was subsequently led as a captive
to Rome. This disaster, as well as feuds with the
neighbouring tribes, broke their power; under Nero a
king whom they did not wish was obtruded on them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
force of arms on the part of their neighbours with the
passive assistance of the Roman legate.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Cherusci.</span>The Cherusci, in the region of the upper Weser, in
the time of Augustus and Tiberius the leading canton in
central Germany, is seldom mentioned after the death of
Arminius, but always as sustaining good relations to the
Romans. When the civil war, which must have continued
to rage among them even after the fall of Arminius, had
swept away the whole family of their princes, they requested
from the Roman government the last of that
house, Italicus, a brother&#8217;s son of Arminius living in Italy,
to be their ruler; it is true that the return home of one
who was brave but answered more to his name than to
his lineage, kindled the feud afresh, and, when he was
driven off by his own people, the Langobardi placed him
once more on the tottering throne. One of his successors,
king Chariomerus, so earnestly took the side of the
Romans in Domitian&#8217;s war with the Chatti, that he after
its close, when driven away by the Chatti, fled to the
Romans and invoked&mdash;although vainly&mdash;their intervention.
Through those perpetual inward and outward feuds
the Cheruscan people was so weakened that it henceforth
disappears from active politics. The name of the Marsi
is no longer met with at all after the expeditions of Germanicus.
That the tribes dwelling farther to the east on
the Elbe as well as all the more remote Germans took as
little part in the struggles of the Batavians and their allies
in the years 69 and 70, as these took in the German wars
under Augustus and Tiberius may, considering the detailed
character of the narrative, be described as certain.
Where they meet us subsequently they never appear in a
hostile attitude to the Romans.<span class="sidenote">Langobardi.</span>That the Langobardi
reinstated the Roman king of the Cherusci, has already
been mentioned.<span class="sidenote">Semnones.</span>Masuus, the king of the Semnones, and&mdash;what
is remarkable&mdash;along with him the prophetess
Ganna, who was held in high repute among this tribe
famous for its special credulity, visited the emperor
Domitian in Rome, and met with a friendly reception at
his court. In the regions from the Weser to the Elbe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
during these centuries various feuds may have raged, the
balance of power may in various cases have shifted, various
cantons may have changed their name or joined another
combination; as regards their relations to the Romans a
permanent frontier&ndash;peace set in, after it came to be generally
felt that these had positively abandoned the subjugation
of this region. Even invasions from the far East
cannot have materially disturbed it at this epoch; for they
could not but have reacted on the Roman guarding of the
frontier, and we should not have lacked information
had more serious crises occurred in this domain. All
this is confirmed by the reduction of the army of the
lower Rhine to half of its former amount, which occurred
we know not exactly when, but within this epoch. The
army of the lower Rhine, with which Vespasian had to
fight, numbered four legions; that of the time of Trajan
presumably the same number, at least three;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> probably
already under Hadrian, certainly under Marcus, there
were not more than two&mdash;the 1st Minervian and the 30th
of Trajan&mdash;stationed there.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Upper
Germany.</span>Germanic affairs in the upper province developed
themselves after another fashion. Of the Germans on the
left of the Rhine who belonged to this province, the
Triboci, Nemetes, Vangiones, there is nothing historically
worth mentioning, except that they, for long settled among
the Celts, shared the destinies of Gaul. Here too the
Rhine always remained the chief line of defence for the
Romans. All the standing camps of the legions were at
all times on the left bank of the Rhine; not even that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Argentoratum was transferred to the right bank, when the
whole region of the Neckar was Roman. But while in
the lower province the Roman rule on the right bank of
the Rhine was restricted in course of time, here on the
other hand it was extended. The project of Augustus
to connect the camps on the Rhine with those on the
Danube by advancing the imperial frontier in an eastward
direction&mdash;which, if it had been carried out, would
have enlarged upper more than lower Germany&mdash;was
perhaps never completely abandoned in this command,
and was resumed subsequently, though on a more modest
scale. Historical tradition does not give us the means of
presenting a connected view of the operations continued
with this object for centuries, the construction of roads
and walls pertaining thereto, and the wars waged on this
account; and even the great military structure still existing,
whose rise and progress&mdash;likewise embracing centuries&mdash;must
include in itself a good part of that history, has
hitherto not been investigated throughout, as it well might
be, by the eyes of military experts. The hope that unified
Germany would combine for the investigation of this its
oldest historical monument, has not been fulfilled. We
shall here attempt to put together what has hitherto been
brought to light on the subject from the fragments of the
Roman annals or of the Roman strongholds.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Mogontiacum.</span>On the right bank, not far from the northern end of
the province, there stretches in front of the level or hilly
country of the lower Rhine, in a direction from west to
east, the range of the Taunus, which abuts on the Rhine
opposite to Bingen. Parallel to this mountain&ndash;range,
shut off on the other side by the spurs of the Odenwald,
stretches the plain of the lower Main&ndash;valley, the true
access to the interior of Germany, dominated by the key
of the position at the point where the Main falls into the
Rhine, Mogontiacum or Mentz, from the time of Drusus
down to the end of Rome the stronghold out of which
the Romans sallied to attack Germany from Gaul,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
is at the present day the true barrier of Germany against
France. Here the Romans, even after they had abandoned
their rule in the region of the upper Rhine generally,
retained not merely the <em>t&#234;te&ndash;de&ndash;pont</em> on the other bank,
the <em>castellum Mogontiacense</em> &#40;Castel&#41;, but also that plain
of the Main itself in their possession; and in this region
a Roman civilisation might establish itself.<span class="sidenote">Mattiaci.</span>This land
originally belonged to the Chatti, and a Chattan tribe, the
Mattiaci, remained settled here even under Roman rule;
but, after the Chatti were compelled to cede this district
to Drusus, it remained a part of the empire. The
hot springs in the immediate neighbourhood of Mentz
&#40;aquae Mattiacae, Wiesbaden&#41; were used by the Romans
demonstrably in Vespasian&#8217;s time, and doubtless long
before: silver was worked here under Claudius; the
Mattiaci already furnished troops to the army at an early
date like other subject districts. They took part in the
general rising of the Germans under Civilis; but, after
they were vanquished, the earlier relations were re&ndash;established.
From the end of the second century we
find the community of the Taunensian Mattiaci under
authorities organised after the Roman model. <a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Chatti.</span>The Chatti, although thus driven away from the
Rhine, appear in the sequel as the most powerful among
the tribes of inland Germany who came into contact
with the Romans; the lead which, under Augustus and
Tiberius, had been possessed by the Cherusci on the
middle Weser, passed, amidst the constant feuds with
these their southern cognate neighbours, over to the latter.
All the wars between Romans and Germans, of which
we have any knowledge from the time after the death of
Arminius down to the time when the migrations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
peoples began at the end of the third century, were waged
against the Chatti; as in the year 41 under Claudius by
Galba, who became afterwards emperor; and in the
year 50 under the same emperor by Publius Pomponius
Secundus, celebrated as a poet. These were the usual
border incursions, and the Chatti had taken a part, but
only a secondary one, in the great Batavian war &#40;<a href="#Page_133">p.&nbsp;133</a>&#41;.
But in the campaign which the Emperor Domitian undertook
in the year 83 the Romans were the aggressors;
and this war led, not indeed to brilliant victories, but
doubtless to a considerable and momentous pushing forward
of the Roman frontier.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> At that time the frontier&ndash;line
was arranged, as we find it thenceforth drawn; and
within that line, which in its most northern portion was
not far removed from the Rhine, must have been included
a great part of the Taunus and the region of the Main as
far as above Friedberg. The Usipes, who, after their
already&ndash;mentioned expulsion from the region of the Lippe,
appear about the time of Vespasian in the neighbourhood
of Mentz, and may have found new settlements to the
east of the Mattiaci on the Kinzig or in the Fuldan district,
were then annexed to the empire, and, at the same
time with them, a number of smaller tribes thrown off by
the Chatti. Thereupon, when in the year 88, under the
governor Lucius Antonius Saturninus, the upper German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
army rose against Domitian, the war was on the point of
renewal; the revolted troops made common cause with
the Chatti;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> and it was only the interruption of the communications,
when the ice broke up on the Rhine, that
made it possible for the regiments which had remained
faithful to settle matters with the revolters before the
dangerous contingent arrived. It is stated that the
Roman rule extended from Mentz towards the interior
80 <em>leugae</em>, and thus even beyond Fulda;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
account appears worthy of credit, if we take into consideration
that the military frontier&ndash;line, which certainly
seems not to have gone far above Friedberg, doubtless
kept here also within the territorial boundary.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The region of the Neckar.</span>But not
merely was the valley of the lower Main in
front of Mentz brought within the military frontier&ndash;line;
in south&ndash;western Germany also the boundary was pushed
forward in a still greater degree. The region of the
Neckar, once possessed by the Celtic Helvetii, then for
long a debateable borderland between these and the advancing
Germans, and therefore named the Helvetian
desert, subsequently perhaps occupied partially by the Marcomani,
before these retreated to Bohemia &#40;<a href="#Page_29">p.&nbsp;29</a>&#41;, came on
the regulation of the Germanic boundaries after the battle
of Varus into the same position as the greater portion of
the right bank of the lower Rhine. Here, too, there must
have been a frontier&ndash;line already at that time marked off,
within which Germanic settlements were not tolerated.
Thereupon individual, mostly Gallic, immigrants, who had
not much to lose, settled down, as on an unenclosed moor,
in these fertile but little protected regions, which went at
that time by the name of <em>agri decumates</em>.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> This private
occupation, which was, it may be conjectured, merely
tolerated by the government, was followed by the formal
taking possession of it probably under Vespasian. As
already, about the year 74, a highway was carried from
Strassburg on the right bank of the Rhine as far as
Offenburg,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> there must have been instituted about this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
time in this region a more earnest protection of the frontier
than the mere prohibition of Germanic settlement
furnished. What the father had begun the sons carried
out. Perhaps even through the construction&mdash;whether by
Vespasian, by Titus, or Domitian&mdash;of the &#8220;Flavian altars&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
at the source of the Neckar, near the modern Rottweil&mdash;a
settlement of which indeed we know nothing but the
name&mdash;there was procured for the new upper Germany
on the right of the Rhine a centre similar to what the
Ubian altar was formerly intended to become for Great
Germany, and soon afterwards the altar of Sarmizegetusa
became for the newly&ndash;conquered Dacia. The first institution
of the frontier&ndash;defence, to be described further on, by
which the Neckar valley was brought within the Roman
line, is thus the work of the Flavii, chiefly, doubtless, of
Domitian,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> who thereby carried further the construction
at the Taunus. The military road on the right of the
Rhine from Mogontiacum by way of Heidelberg and
Baden in the direction of Offenburg&mdash;the necessary consequence
of this annexation of the Neckar region&mdash;was,
as we now know,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> constructed by Trajan in the year
100, and was a part of the more direct communication
established by that emperor between Gaul and the line of
the Danube. There was employment for the soldiers at
these works, but hardly for their arms; there were no
Germanic tribes dwelling in the region of the Neckar, and
still less can the narrow strip on the left bank of the
Danube, which was thereby brought within the frontier
line, have cost serious struggles. The nearest Germanic
people of note there, the Hermunduri, had more friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
dispositions towards the Romans than any other tribe had,
and carried on lively commercial intercourse with them in
the town of the Vindelici, Augusta; of the fact that this
advance met with no resistance from them, we shall find
traces further on. Under the following reigns of Hadrian,
Pius, and Marcus, further progress was made with these
military arrangements.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The upper
Germanic
Limes.</span>We cannot historically follow out the mode in which the
frontier&ndash;fence between the Rhine and the Danube&mdash;still
in great part subsisting as regards its foundations at
the present day&mdash;came into existence, but we are able to
recognise not merely the course which it took but also
the purpose which it served. The work was as to its
nature and purpose different in upper Germany from
what it was in Raetia. The upper German frontier&ndash;fence,
with a length in all of about 250 Roman miles
&#40;228 English miles<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>&#41; begins immediately at the northern
boundary of the province, embraces, as has been already
said, the Taunus and the plain of the Main as far as the
district of Friedberg, and turns thence southward to the
Main, which it meets at Grosskrotzenburg above Hanau.
Following the Main thence as far as W&ouml;rth, it here takes
the direction of the Neckar, which it reaches somewhat
below Wimpfen and does not again leave. Afterwards
in front of the southern half of this frontier&ndash;line a second
was laid out, which follows the Main by way of W&ouml;rth as
far as Miltenberg, and thence is led for the most part in
a straight direction to Lorch between Stuttgart and Aalen.
Here to the upper German frontier&ndash;fence is joined on the
Raetian, only 120 miles &#40;108 English&#41; long; it leaves the
Danube at Kelheim above Ratisbon and runs thence,
twice crossing the Altmuhl, in a curve westward likewise
as far as Lorch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>The upper Germanic Limes consists of a series of forts
which are distant from each other, at the most, half a day&#8217;s
march &#40;about nine English miles&#41;. Where the lines of
connection between the forts are not closed by the Main
or the Neckar, as stated above, there was introduced an
artificial barrier, at first perhaps merely by a palisade,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> afterwards
by a continuous earthen rampart of moderate height,
with a fosse outside and watch&ndash;towers built in at short
intervals on the inner side.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> The forts are not introduced
into the rampart, but constructed immediately behind it at
a distance seldom exceeding one&ndash;third of an English mile.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Raetian
Limes.</span>The Raetian frontier&ndash;fence was a mere barrier, produced
by piling up quarry&ndash;stones; there were no fosses
or watch&ndash;towers, and the forts, constructed behind the
Limes without regular succession and at unequal intervals
&#40;none nearer than two and a half to three miles&#41;, stand
in no immediate connection with the barrier&ndash;line. As to
the order in time of the constructions there is no definite
testimony; it is proved that the upper Germanic line of
the Neckar was in existence under Pius,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> that placed in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of it from Miltenberg to Lorch under Marcus.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> The idea of
a frontier&ndash;bar was common to the two structures, otherwise
so different; the preference in the one case for the piling
up of earth&mdash;whence the fosse for the most part resulted
of itself&mdash;in the other case, for layers of stone, probably
depended only on the diversity of the soil and of the
materials for building. It was common to them, further,
that neither the one nor the other was constructed for the
defence, as a whole, of the frontier. Not merely was the
hindrance, which the piling up of earth or stone presented
to the assailant, slight in itself; but along the line we meet
everywhere with commanding positions, morasses lying in
the rear, a want of outlook towards the country in front,
and similar clear indications of the fact, that in the tracing
of it warlike purposes generally were not contemplated.
The forts are of course arranged for defence, each by itself,
but they are not connected by paved cross&ndash;roads; and
so the individual garrison relied for support not on those
of the neighbouring forts, but on the rear&ndash;base, to which
the road led, whereby each was kept garrisoned. Moreover,
these garrisons were not dovetailed into a military
system of frontier defence; they were rather fortified positions
for a case of need than strategically chosen for the
occupation of the territory, as indeed the very extent of
the line itself, compared with the number of troops at
disposal, excludes the possibility of its defence as a
whole.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Object of
these structures.</span>Thus these extensive military structures had not, like the
Britannic wall, the object of checking the invasion of the
enemy. The intention rather was, that, like the bridges
over the river&ndash;frontier, so the roads on the land&ndash;frontier
should be commanded by the forts, but in other respects,
like the river as the water&ndash;boundary, so the wall on the
landward should hinder the uncontrolled crossing of the
frontier. Other uses might be combined with this; the
preference, often apparent, for the rectilineal direction
points to its application for signals, and occasionally the
structure may have been used directly for purposes of
war. But the proper and immediate object of the structure
was to prevent the crossing of the frontier. The
fact, withal, that watch&ndash;posts and forts were erected, not
on the Raetian but on the upper Germanic frontier, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
explained by their different relations to the neighbours, in
the former case to the Hermunduri, in the latter to the
Chatti. The Romans in upper Germany did not confront
their neighbours as they confronted the Highlanders
of Britain, in whose presence the province was always in
a state of siege; but the repulse of predatory invaders as
well as the levying of the frontier&ndash;dues demanded at any
rate ready and near military help. The upper German
army, and in keeping with it the garrisons on the Limes,
might be gradually reduced, but the Roman <em>pilum</em> could
never be dispensed with in the land of the Neckar. It
might, however, be dispensed with in presence of the
Hermunduri, who, in Trajan&#8217;s time, alone of all the Germans,
were at liberty to cross the frontier of the empire without
special control and to trade freely in the Roman territory,
especially in Augsburg, and with whom, so far as we
know, border&ndash;collisions never took place. There was
thus at this period no occasion for a similar structure on
the Raetian frontier; the forts north of the Danube, which
can be shown to have subsisted already in Trajan&#8217;s time,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
sufficed here for the protection of the frontier and the
control of frontier&ndash;intercourse. This accords with the
observation that the Raetian Limes, as it stands before our
eyes, corresponds only with the more recent upper Germanic
barrier&ndash;line perhaps laid out for the first time
under Marcus. Then occasion for it was not wanting.
The wars of the Chatti, as we shall see &#40;<a href="#Page_161">p.&nbsp;161</a>&#41;, seized at
this time also on Raetia; the strengthening too of the
garrison of the province might reasonably stand in connection
with the erection of this Limes, which, however
little it was arranged for military ends, was at any rate
doubtless constructed with a view to its being a frontier&ndash;bar,
though of less strong character.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Their
effect.</span>In a military as well as a political sense the shifting
of the frontier, or rather the strengthening of the frontier&ndash;fence,
was effective and useful. While formerly the
Roman chain of forts in upper Germany and Raetia
probably went up the Rhine by way of Strassburg to Basel
and along by Vindonissa to the lake of Constance, then
from thence to the upper Danube, now the upper German
headquarters were in Mentz and the Raetian in
Ratisbon, and generally the two chief armies of the
empire were brought considerably nearer to each other.
The legionary camp of Vindonissa &#40;Windisch near Z&uuml;rich&#41;
became thereby superfluous. The army of the upper
Rhine could, like the neighbouring one, be reduced after
some time to the half of its former strength. The
original number of four legions, which was only accidentally
diminished to three during the Batavian war,
subsisted, at all events, probably still under Trajan;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> but
under Marcus the province was only occupied by two
legions, the 8th and the 22d, of which the former was
stationed at Strassburg, the second at the headquarters
Mentz, while most of the troops, broken up into smaller
posts, were stationed along the frontier&ndash;wall. Within the
new line urban life flourished almost as on the left bank
of the Rhine; Sumelocenna &#40;Rottenburg on the Neckar&#41;,
Aquae &#40;<em>civitas Aurelia Aquensis</em>, Baden&#41;, Lopodunum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
&#40;Ladenburg&#41;, had, if we except Cologne and Treves, to
fear no comparison as respects Roman urban development
with any town of Belgica. The rise of these settlements
was chiefly the work of Trajan, who began his government
with this act of peace;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> &#8220;the Rhine Roman on both
its banks&#8221; is what a Roman poet entreats speedily to
send to Rome its yet unseen ruler. The great and fertile
region, which was placed in this way under the protection
of the legions, needed that protection and was worthy of
it. Doubtless the battle of Varus marks the beginning of
the ebb of Roman power, but only in so far as its advance
was thereby ended, and the Romans thenceforth contented
themselves in general with shielding more vigorously and
continuously what was retained.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Germany
under
Marcus.</span>Down to the beginning of the third century the Roman
power on the Rhine showed no indications of tottering.
During the war with the Marcomani under Marcus all
remained quiet in the lower province. If a legate of
Belgica had at that time to call out the general levy
against the Chauci, this was presumably a piratical expedition,
such as often visited the north coast at this time, just
as earlier and later. The surge of the great movement of
peoples reached to the sources of the Danube and even as
far as the region of the Rhine; but it did not shake the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
foundations there. The Chatti, the only considerable
Germanic tribe on the upper German and Raetian border&ndash;fence,
pushed forward in both directions, and were probably
at that time even among the Germans invading
Italy, as will be shown further on when we describe this
war. At any rate the reinforcement of the Raetian army
at that time ordained by Marcus, and its conversion into
a command of the first class with legion and legates, can
only have taken place in order to check the attacks of the
Chatti, and proves that they did not treat them lightly as
regards the future. The already&ndash;mentioned strengthening
of the border&ndash;defence would likewise stand connected with
this movement. These measures must have sufficed for
the next generation.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">War with
the
Alamanni.</span>Under Antoninus the son of Severus a new and more
severe war once more &#40;213&#41; broke out in Raetia. This
also was waged against the Chatti; but by their side a
second people is named, which we here meet for the first
time&mdash;the Alamanni. Whence they came, we know not.
According to a Roman writing a little later they were a
conflux of mixed elements; the appellation also seems
to point to a league of communities, as well as the fact
that afterwards the different tribes comprehended under
this name stand forth&mdash;more than is the case among the
other great Germanic peoples&mdash;in their separate character,
and the Juthungi, the Lentienses, and other Alamannic
peoples not seldom act independently. But that it is
not the Germans of this region who here emerge allied
under the new name and strengthened by the alliance, is
shown as well by the naming of the Alamanni alongside
of the Chatti, as by the mention of the unwonted skilfulness
of the Alamanni in equestrian combat. On the contrary
it was certainly, in the main, hordes coming on from
the East that lent new strength to the almost extinguished
German resistance on the Rhine; it is not improbable that
the powerful Semnones, in earlier times dwelling on the
middle Elbe, of whom there is no further mention after
the end of the second century, furnished a strong contingent
to the Alamanni.<span class="sidenote">Severus
Antoninus.</span> The constantly increasing misgovernment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
in the Roman empire naturally contributed its
share, although only in a secondary degree, to the shifting
of power. The emperor took the field in person against
the new foe; in August of the year 213 he crossed the
Roman frontier, and a victory over them on the Main was
achieved or at least celebrated; further forts were constructed;
the tribes of the Elbe and of the North Sea
sent deputies to the Roman ruler, and wondered when in
receiving them he wore their own dress, with silver&ndash;mounted
jacket, and hair and beard coloured and arranged after the
German fashion. But thenceforth the wars on the Rhine
are incessant, and the aggressors are the Germans; the neighbours
formerly so pliant had as it were exchanged characters.
Twenty years later the inroads of the barbarians
on the Danube as on the Rhine were so constant and so
serious, <span class="sidenote">Alexander.</span>that the emperor Alexander had on their account to
break off the less immediately dangerous Persian war and
to resort in person to the camp of Mentz, not so much to
defend the territory as to purchase peace from the Germans
by large sums of money. The exasperation of the
soldiers at this led to his murder &#40;<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 235&#41;, and thereby
to the fall of the Severian dynasty, the last that existed
at all until the regeneration of the state.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Maximinus.</span>His successor Maximinus, a rough but brave Thracian who
had risen from the position of a common soldier,
compensated for the cowardly conduct of his predecessor
by an energetic expedition into the heart of Germany.
The barbarians did not yet venture to face a strong and
well&ndash;led Roman army; they retreated to their forests and
morasses, and the brave emperor, following them even
thither, fought in front of all hand to hand. From these
conflicts, which were doubtless directed from Mentz
primarily against the Alamanni, he could with right call
himself Germanicus; and even for the future the expedition
of the year 236, for long the last great victory which
the Romans gained on the Rhine, bore some fruit.
Although the constant and bloody changes on the throne
and the grave disasters in the East and on the Danube
allowed the Romans no time to breathe, during the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
twenty years, if peace was not strictly preserved on the
Rhine a greater disaster did not occur. It appears even
that one of the upper German legions was at that time
sent to Africa without its place being supplied, and so
upper Germany was held as tolerably secure. But when
in the year 253 the different generals of Rome were once
more fighting each other for the imperial dignity, and the
Rhine&ndash;legions marched to Italy to fight out the cause of
their emperor Valerianus against the Aemilianus of the
Danube&ndash;army, this seems to have been the signal<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> for the
Germans pushing forward especially towards the lower
Rhine.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> <span class="sidenote">The
Franks.</span>These Germans were the Franks, who appear
here for the first time, perhaps new opponents only in
name; for, although the identification of them, already to
be met with in later antiquity, with tribes formerly named
on the lower Rhine&mdash;partly, the Chamavi settled beside
the Bructeri, partly the Sugambri formerly mentioned
subject to the Romans&mdash;is uncertain and at least inadequate,
there is here greater probability than in the case of
the Alamanni that the Germans hitherto dependent on
Rome on the right bank of the Rhine, and the Germanic
tribes previously dislodged from the Rhine, took at that
time&mdash;under the collective name of the &#8220;Free&#8221;&mdash;the
offensive in concert against the Romans.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Gallienus.</span>So long as Gallienus himself remained on the Rhine,
he, notwithstanding the small forces that were at his disposal,
kept his opponents to some extent in check, prevented
them from crossing the river, or drove out again
the intruders, although he doubtless ceded to one of the
Germanic leaders a portion of the desired territory on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
river&ndash;bank, under the condition of his acknowledging the
Roman rule and defending his possession against his
countrymen&mdash;which indeed almost amounted to a capitulation.
But when the emperor, recalled by the still more
dangerous position of affairs on the Danube, resorted
thither and left behind as representative in Gaul his elder
son still in boyhood, one of the officers, to whom he had
intrusted the defence of the frontier and the guardianship
of his son, <span class="sidenote">Postumus.</span>Marcus Cassianius Latinius Postumus,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
himself proclaimed by his men as emperor and besieged
in Cologne Silvanus the guardian of the emperor&#8217;s son.
He was successful in capturing the town and in getting
into his power his former colleague as well as the imperial
boy, whereupon he had them both executed. But during
this confusion the Franks burst over the Rhine, and not
merely overflowed all Gaul, but penetrated also into Spain
and indeed pillaged even the coast of Africa. Soon afterwards,
when the capture of Valerian by the Persians had
filled up the measure of misfortune, all the Roman land
on the left bank of the Rhine in the upper province was
lost, passing doubtless to the Alamanni, whose eruption
into Italy in the last years of Gallienus necessarily presupposes
this loss. He is the last emperor whose name
is found on monuments on the right of the Rhine. His
coins celebrate him on account of five great victories over
the Germans, and not less are those of his successor in
the Gallic rule, Postumus, full of the praise of the German
victories of the deliverer of Gaul. Gallienus in his earlier
years had taken up the struggle on the Rhine not without
energy, and Postumus was even an excellent officer and
would gladly have been a good regent; but amidst the utter
unruliness which then prevailed in the Roman state or
rather in the Roman army, the talent and ability of the
individual profited neither himself nor the commonwealth.
A series of flourishing Roman towns was at that time laid
desolate by the invading barbarians, and the right bank
of the Rhine was for ever lost to the Romans.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Aurelianus.</span>The re&ndash;establishment of peace and order in Gaul was
primarily dependent on the cohesion of the empire
generally; so long as the Italian emperors stationed
their troops in the Narbonensis to set aside the Gallic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
rival, and the latter in turn made as though he would
cross the Alps, effective operations against the Germans
were of themselves excluded. It was only after that,
about the year 272,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> the then ruler of Gaul, Tetricus,
weary of his ungrateful part, had himself brought about
the submission of his troops to Aurelianus, the emperor
recognised by the Roman senate, that the thought of
warding off the Germans could be again entertained.
The raids of the Alamanni, who had for almost ten years
ravaged upper Italy as far down as Ravenna, had a stop
put to them for long by the same able ruler who had
brought Gaul back to the empire, and he emphatically
defeated one of their tribes, the Juthungi, on the upper
Danube. If his government had lasted he would doubtless
have renewed the protection of the frontier also in
Gaul; after his speedy and sudden end &#40;275&#41; the
Germans once more crossed the Rhine and devastated the
country far and wide.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Probus.</span>His successor Probus &#40;from 276&#41;, also an able soldier,
not merely drove them out afresh&mdash;he is said to have
taken from them seventy towns&mdash;but also advanced
again on the aggressive, crossed the Rhine, and drove
the Germans back over the Neckar. He did not, however,
renew the lines of the earlier time,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> but contented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
himself with erecting and occupying at the more important
positions of the Rhine <em>t&#234;tes de pont</em> on the other bank,&mdash;that
is, he reverted nearly to such arrangements as had
subsisted here before Vespasian. At the same time the
Franks were defeated by his generals in the northern
province. Great masses of the vanquished Germans
were sent as forced settlers to Gaul, and above all to
Britain. In this way the frontier of the Rhine was won
back and handed over to the later empire. No doubt,
like the rule on the right bank of the Rhine, peace on
the left had passed away beyond recall. The Alamanni
stood in a threatening attitude opposite to Basel and
Strassburg, the Franks opposite to Cologne. By their
side other tribes presented themselves. The fact that
the Burgundiones, once settled beyond the Elbe, advancing
westward as far as the upper Main, threatened Gaul, is
first mentioned under the emperor Probus; a few years
later the Saxons, in concert with the Franks, began their
attacks by sea on the north coast of Gaul as on the
Roman Britain. But under the&mdash;for the most part&mdash;vigorous
and capable emperors of the Diocletiano&ndash;Constantinian
house, and even under their immediate
successors, the Romans kept the threatening inundation
of peoples within measured bounds.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Romanising
of the
Germans.</span>To depict the Germans in their national development
is not the task of the historian of the Romans; for him
they appear only as hindering or as destroying. An
interpenetration of the two nationalities, and a mixed
culture thence resulting, such as the Romanised land of
the Celts presented, Roman Germany has none to show;
or&mdash;so far as concerns our conception of it&mdash;it coincides
with the Romano&ndash;Gallic all the more, since the Germanic
territories on the left bank of the Rhine, which remained
for a considerable time in the Roman possession, were
pervaded throughout with Celtic elements, and even those
on the right, deprived for the most part of their original
population, obtained the majority of the new settlers
from Gaul. Communal centres, such as the Celtic system
possessed in large number, were wanting to the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
element. Partly on that account, partly in consequence
of outward circumstances, the Roman element was able,
as has been already brought out &#40;<a href="#Page_102">p.&nbsp;102</a>&#41;, to develop
itself sooner and more fully in the Germanic east than in
the Celtic regions. The encampments of the army of
the Rhine, all of which fell within Roman Germany,
were of essential influence in this respect. The larger
of them obtained, partly through the traders who attached
themselves to the army, partly, and above all, through
the veterans who remained in their wonted quarters even
after their discharge, an urban appendage&mdash;a town of
huts &#40;<em>canabae</em>&#41;, separate from the military quarters proper;
everywhere, and particularly in Germany, towns proper
grew in time out of these at the legionary camps and
especially the headquarters. At their head stood the
Roman town of the Ubii, originally the second largest
camp of the army of the lower Rhine, then from the
year 50 onward a Roman colony &#40;<a href="#Page_99">p.&nbsp;99</a>&#41;, exercising the
most important effect in elevating Roman civilisation in
the region of the Rhine. Here the camp&ndash;town gave
place to that of the Roman plantation; subsequently
urban rights were obtained, without shifting the quarters
of the troops, by the settlements belonging to the two
great camps of the lower Rhine&mdash;Ulpia Noviomagus, in
the land of the Batavi, and Ulpia Traiana, near Vetera&mdash;from
Trajan, and in the third century by the military
capital of upper Germany, Mogontiacum. No doubt
these civil towns always retained a subordinate position
by the side of the military centres of administration
independent of them.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Roman
Germanising.</span>If we look beyond the limit where this narrative
closes, we certainly find, instead of the Romanising of
the Germans, in some measure a Germanising of the
Romans. The last phase of the Roman state was marked
by its becoming barbarian, and especially becoming Germanised;
and the beginnings of the process reach far
back. It commences with the peasantry in the colonate,
passes on to the troop as modelled by the emperor Severus,
seizes then on the officers and magistrates, and ends with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the hybrid Romano&ndash;Germanic states of the Visigoths in
Spain and Gaul, the Vandals in Africa, above all, with the
Italy of Theoderic. For the understanding of this last
phase there is certainly needed an insight into the political
development of the one as of the other nation. Unfortunately,
the enquiry into early German history is here at
fault. It is true that the political arrangements into
which these Germans entered as servants or joint rulers
are well known, far better than the systematic history of
the same epoch. But over the primitive condition of the
Germans floats that gray morning&ndash;haze in which sharp
outlines are lost. German heathenism, apart from the
far north, perished before the time of which we have
knowledge; and the religious elements, which are never
wanting in a national war, we know doubtless for the
Sassanidae, but not for the Marcomani. The beginnings
of the political development of the Germans are delineated
for us in part by the picture of Tacitus&mdash;many&ndash;coloured,
hampered by modelling itself on the ideas of a fading past,
and but too often keeping silence as to elements of really
decisive moment&mdash;while in part we must take them from
the hybrid states which arose on formerly Roman soil and
had Roman elements everywhere inwoven. Here our
records seldom give us German technical terms, but substitute
Latin descriptions which are plainly inadequate,
and here, in general, we miss those sharply&ndash;defined ideas
which our studies of classical history offer us in plenty.
It is characteristic of our German nation that it has not
been permitted to develop itself by German effort from
German origins, and we may connect with this the fact
that German scholarship has studied the beginnings and
characters of other nations with more success than it has
won in the study of its own.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="head3">BRITAIN.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Caesar and
the Julian
Emperors.</span><span class="smcap">Ninety&ndash;seven</span> years elapsed from the time when Roman
troops had entered, subdued, and again abandoned the
great island in the north&ndash;western ocean, before the Roman
government resolved to repeat the voyage and permanently
to occupy Britain. Certainly Caesar&#8217;s Britannic expedition
had not been, like his campaigns against the Germans, a
mere forward movement of defence. So far as his arm
reached, he had made the individual tribes subject to the
empire, and had regulated their annual tribute to it in
this case as in Gaul. The leading tribe, too, which was
to be firmly attached to Rome by its privileged position
and thereby to become the fulcrum of Roman rule, was
found; the Trinovantes &#40;Essex&#41; were to take up on the
Celtic island the same part&mdash;more advantageous than
honourable&mdash;as the Haedui and the Remi on the
Gallic continent. The bloody feud between the prince
Cassivellaunus and the princely house of Camalodunum
&#40;Colchester&#41; had been the immediate cause of the Roman
invasion; to reinstate this house Caesar had landed, and
the object was for the moment attained. Beyond doubt
Caesar never deceived himself as to the fact that the
tribute, as well as the protectorate, were in the first
instance mere words; but these words were a programme
which could not but bring about, and was intended to
bring about, the permanent occupation of the island by
Roman troops.</p>

<p>Caesar himself did not get so far as permanently to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
organise the affairs of the subject island; and for his
successors Britain was a perplexity. The Britons who
had become subject to the empire certainly did not long
pay&mdash;perhaps never paid at all&mdash;the tribute which was
due. The protectorate over the dynasty of Camalodunum
must have been still less respected, and had simply as its
effect, that princes and scions of that house again and again
appeared in Rome and invoked the intervention of the
Roman government against neighbours and rivals. Thus
king Dubnovellaunus, probably the successor of the prince
of the Trinovantes confirmed by Caesar, came as a refugee
to Rome to the emperor Augustus, and so, later, one of
the princes of the same house came to the emperor Gaius.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>In fact the expedition to Britain was a necessary part
of the heritage left by Caesar. Already during the Dual
Rule Caesar the younger had projected such an expedition,
and had only desisted from it on account of the more
urgent necessity of procuring quiet in Illyricum, or on
account of the strained relation with Antonius, which
proved useful to the Parthians in the first instance as
well as to the Britons. The courtly poets of the earlier
years of Augustus celebrated variously in anticipation the
Britannic conquest; the programme of Caesar was thus
accepted and adopted by his successor. When the
monarchy was consolidated, all Rome thereupon expected
that the close of the civil war would be followed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Britannic expedition; the complaints of the poets as to
the dreadful strife, but for which the Britons would long
since have been led in triumphal procession to the
Capitol, became transformed into the proud hope of
adding to the empire the new province of Britain. The
expedition was, moreover, repeatedly announced &#40;727,
728&#41;<span class="sidenote2">27,&nbsp;26.</span>, yet Augustus, without formally abandoning the
undertaking, soon desisted from carrying it out; and
Tiberius, faithful to his maxim, adhered in this question
also to the system of his father.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> The worthless thoughts
of the last Julian emperor roamed doubtless also over
the ocean; but serious things he was incapable of even
planning. It was the government of Claudius that first
took up the plan of the dictator afresh and carried it out.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The reasons
for, and
against, the
occupation
of Britain.</span>What were the determining motives, on the one side
as on other, may be at least partially discerned.
Augustus himself laid it down that the occupation of the
island was not necessary from a military point of view&mdash;seeing
that its inhabitants were not in a position to annoy
the Romans on the continent&mdash;and was not advantageous
for the finances; that what could be drawn from Britain
flowed into the exchequer of the empire in the form of
import and export duties at the Gallic harbours; that
at least a legion and some cavalry would be requisite
as garrison, and after deduction of its cost from the
tribute of the island not much would be left.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> All this
was indisputably correct, but it was not the whole
truth. Experience showed later that a legion was far
from sufficient to hold the island. We must further take
into account, what the government certainly had no
occasion to say, that, considering the state of weakness
to which the Roman army had been brought by the
internal policy of Augustus, it could not but appear very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
hazardous to banish a considerable fragment of it, once
for all, to a distant island of the North Sea. There was
presumably only the choice of keeping aloof from Britain
or increasing the army on its account; and with Augustus
considerations of internal policy always outweighed those
of an external character.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Conviction
of its necessity
predominant.</span>But yet the conviction of the necessity for subduing
Britain must have predominated with Roman statesmen.
Caesar&#8217;s conduct would be inconceivable if we do not presuppose
that conviction in his case. Augustus at first
formally recognised, and never formally disowned, the aim
proposed by Caesar, notwithstanding its inconvenience. It
was precisely the governments that were the most far&ndash;seeing
and most tenacious of purpose&mdash;those of Claudius, Nero,
and Domitian&mdash;that laid the foundation for the conquest
of Britain, or extended the work; and, after it had taken
place, it was never regarded in any such light as, let us
say, the conquest by Trajan of Dacia and Mesopotamia. If
the maxim of government, elsewhere adhered to almost
inviolably, that the Roman empire had simply to fill, but
not to extend, its bounds, was permanently set aside only
in respect of Britain, the cause lies in the fact that the
Celts could not be subdued in such a way as Rome&#8217;s
interest demanded, on the continent alone. This nation
was to all appearance more connected than separated by
the narrow arm of the sea which parts England and
France; the same names of peoples meet us on the one side
and on the other; the bounds of the individual states often
reach over the Channel; the chief seat of the priestly
system, which here more than anywhere else pervaded
the whole nationality, was from of old the islands of the
North Sea. These islanders indeed were not able to
wrest the continent of Gaul from the Roman legions; but,
if the conqueror of Gaul himself, and, later, the Roman
government in Gaul, pursued other aims than in Syria and
Egypt&mdash;if the Celts were to be annexed as members to
the Italian nation&mdash;this task remained quite impracticable,
so long as the subjugated and the free Celtic territories
touched each other over the sea, and the enemy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Romans as well as the Roman deserter found an asylum
in Britain.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> In the first instance the subjugation of the
southern coast sufficed for this purpose, although the
effect was naturally the greater, the farther the free Celtic
territory was pushed back.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> The special regard of Claudius
for his Gallic home and his knowledge of Gallic
relations may also have played a part in the matter.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Occasion
for the war.</span>What furnished occasion for the war was the fact
that that very principality which sustained a certain
dependence on Rome under the leadership of its king<span class="sidenote">Cunobelinus.</span>
Cunobelinus&mdash;this was Shakespeare&#8217;s Cymbeline&mdash;extended
widely its rule,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> and emancipated itself from the
Roman protectorate. One of his sons&mdash;Adminius, who had
revolted against his father, came to the emperor Gaius desiring
protection, and upon his successor refusing to deliver
up to the British ruler these his subjects, the war arose in
the first instance against the father and the brothers of this
Adminius. The real motive, of course, was the indispensable
need for completing the conquest of a nation
hitherto but half vanquished and keeping closely together.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Military
arrangements
for
occupying
the island.</span>That the occupation of Britain could not ensue without
a contemporary increase of the standing army was also
the view of those statesmen who gave occasion to it;
three of the Rhine&ndash;legions and one from the Danube were
destined thither,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> but at the same time two newly instituted
legions were assigned to the Germanic armies. An able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
soldier, Aulus Plautius, was selected as leader of this
expedition, and at the same time as first governor of the
province; it departed for the island in the year 43.
The soldiers showed themselves reluctant, more doubtless
because of the banishment to the distant island than from
fear of the foe. One of the leading men, perhaps the
soul of the undertaking, Narcissus, the emperor&#8217;s cabinet&ndash;secretary,
wished to instil into them courage; they did
not allow the slave to utter a word for their shouts of
scoffing, but did withal as he wished and embarked.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Course of
the occupation.</span>The occupation of the island was not attended by any
special difficulty. The natives stood, in a political as in
a military point of view, at the same low stage of development
which Caesar had previously found in the island.
Kings or queens reigned in the several cantons, which had
no outward bond of conjunction and were at perpetual
feud with one another. The men were doubtless possessed
of bodily strength, endurance, and bravery&mdash;despising
death; and were in particular expert horsemen. But the
Homeric war&ndash;chariot, which was still a reality here, and
on which the princes of the land themselves wielded the
reins, as little held its ground against the compact squadrons
of Roman cavalry as the foot soldier without coat
of mail and helmet, defended only by the small shield,
was with his short javelin and his broad sword a match in
close combat for the short Roman knife, or even for the
heavy <em>pilum</em> of the legionary, and sling&ndash;bullet and arrow
of the light Roman troops. To the army of about 40,000
well&ndash;trained soldiers the natives could oppose no corresponding
defensive force. The disembarkation did not
even encounter resistance; the Britons had accounts as to
the reluctant temper of the troops and no longer expected
the landing. King Cunobelinus had died shortly before;
the opposition was led by his two sons Caratacus and
Togodumnus. The invading army had its march at once
directed to Camalodunum,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> and in a rapid course of victory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
it reached as far as the Thames; here a halt was made,
chiefly perhaps to give the emperor the opportunity of
plucking the easy laurels in person. So soon as he
arrived, the river was crossed; the British levy was beaten,
on which occasion Togodumnus met his death; Camalodunum
itself was taken. His brother Caratacus, it is
true, obstinately continued the resistance, and gained for
himself, in victory or defeat, a proud name with friend and
foe; nevertheless, the progress of the Romans was not to
be checked. One prince after another was beaten and
deposed&mdash;the triumphal arch of Claudius names eleven
British kings as conquered by him; and what did not
succumb to the Roman arms yielded to the Roman
largesses. Numerous men of rank accepted the possessions
which the emperor conferred on them at the expense of
their countrymen; various kings also submitted to the
modest position of vassals, as indeed Cogidumnus the
king of the Regni &#40;Chichester&#41; and Prasutagus the king of
the Iceni &#40;Norfolk&#41; bore rule for a series of years as dependent
princes. But in most districts of the island, which
had hitherto been monarchically governed throughout, the
conquerors introduced their communal constitution, and
gave what was still left to be administered into the hands
of the local men of rank&mdash;a course which brought in its
train wretched factions and internal quarrels. Even under
the first governor the whole level country as far as the
Humber seems to have come into Roman power; the
Iceni, for example, had already submitted to him. But it
was not merely with the sword that the Romans made
way for themselves. Veterans were settled at Camalodunum
immediately after its capture; thus the first town
of Roman organisation and Roman burgess&ndash;rights, the
&#8220;Claudian colony of victory,&#8221; was founded in Britain,
destined to be the capital of the country. Immediately
afterwards began also the profitable working of the British
mines, particularly of the productive lead&ndash;mines; there are
British leaden bars from the sixth year after the invasion.
Evidently with like rapidity the stream of Roman merchants
and artisans poured itself over the field newly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
opened up; if Camalodunum received Roman colonists,
Roman townships, which soon obtained legally urban
organisation, were formed elsewhere in the south of the
island as a mere result of freedom of traffic and of immigration,
particularly at the hot springs of Sulis &#40;Bath&#41;, in
Verulamium &#40;St. Albans to the north&ndash;west of London&#41;,
and above all in the natural emporium of trading on a
great scale&mdash;Londinium at the mouth of the Thames.</p>

<p>The advance of the foreign rule asserted itself everywhere,
not merely in new taxes and levies, but perhaps still
more in commerce and trade. When Plautius after four
years of administration was recalled, he entered Rome in
triumph, the last citizen who attained such honour, and
honours and orders were lavished on the officers and
soldiers of the victorious legions; triumphal arches were
erected to the emperor in Rome, and thereafter in other
towns, on account of victory achieved &#8220;without any losses
whatever;&#8221; the crown&ndash;prince born shortly before the
invasion received, instead of his grandfather&#8217;s name, that
of Britannicus. We may discern in these matters the
unmilitary age disused to victories with loss, and the extravagance
in keeping with political dotage; but, if the
invasion of Britain has not much significance from a military
standpoint, testimony must withal be borne to the
leading men that they set about the work in an energetic
and persistent fashion, and that the painful and dangerous
time of transition from independent to foreign rule in
Britain was an unusually short one.</p>

<p>After the first rapid success, it is true, there were
developed difficulties and even dangers, which the occupation
of the island brought not merely to the conquered
but also to the conquerors.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Resistance
in West
Britain.</span>They were masters of the level country, but not of the
mountains or of the sea. The west above all gave trouble
to the Romans. No doubt in the extreme south&ndash;west, in
what is now Cornwall, the old nationality maintained itself,
probably more because the conquerors concerned themselves
but little about this remote corner than because it
directly rebelled against them. But the Silures in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
south of the modern Wales, and their northern neighbours
the Ordovici, perseveringly defied the Roman arms;<span class="sidenote">Mona.</span> the
island Mona &#40;Anglesey&#41;, adjacent to the latter, was the
true focus of national and religious resistance. It was not
the character of the ground alone that hindered the advance
of the Romans; what Britain had been for Gaul,
that the large island Ivernia was now for Britain, and
especially for this west coast; the freedom on the one
side of the channel did not allow the foreign rule to take
firm root in the other. We clearly recognise in the
laying out of the legionary camps that the invasion was
here arrested. Under the successor of Plautius the camp
for the 14th legion was laid out at the confluence of the
Tern with the Severn near Viroconium &#40;Wroxeter, not
far from Shrewsbury&#41;;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> presumably about the same time,
to the south of it, that of Isca &#40;Caerleon &#61; <em>Castra legionis</em>&#41;
for the 2d; to the north that of Deva &#40;Chester &#61; <em>Castra</em>&#41;
for the 20th; these three camps shut off the region of
Wales towards the south, north, and west, and protected
thus the pacified land against the mountains
that remained free. Into this region the last prince of
Camalodunum, Caratacus, threw himself, after his home
had become Roman. He was defeated by the successor
of Plautius, Publius Ostorius Scapula, in the territory of
the Ordovici, and soon afterwards delivered up by the
terrified Brigantes, with whom he had taken refuge, to the
Romans &#40;51&#41;, and conducted with all his adherents to Italy.
In surprise he asked, when he saw the proud city, how the
masters of such palaces could covet the poor huts of his
native country. But with this the west was by no means
subdued; the Silures above all persevered in obstinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
resistance, and the fact that the Roman general announced
his purpose of extirpating them to the last man did not
contribute to make them more submissive.<span class="sidenote">Paullinus.</span> The enterprising
governor, Gaius Suetonius Paullinus, attempted
some years later &#40;61&#41; to bring into Roman power the chief
seat of resistance, the island of Mona, and in spite of the
furious opposition with which he was met, and in which
the priests and the women took the lead, the sacred trees,
beneath which many a Roman captive had bled, fell under
the axes of the legionaries. But out of the occupation of
this last asylum of the Celtic priesthood there was developed
a dangerous crisis in the subject territory itself;
and the governor was not destined to complete the conquest
of Mona.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Boudicca.</span>In Britain, too, the alien rule had to stand the test of
national insurrection. What was undertaken by Mithradates
in Asia Minor, by Vercingetorix among the Celts of
the continent, by Civilis among the subject Germans, was
attempted among the insular Celts by a woman, the wife
of one of those vassal&ndash;princes confirmed by Rome, the
Queen of the Iceni, Boudicca. Her deceased husband
had, to secure the future of his wife and his daughters,
bequeathed his sovereignty to the emperor Nero, and
divided his property between the latter and his own relatives.
The emperor took the legacy and, in addition, what
was not meant for him; the princely cousins were put
in chains, the widow was scourged, the daughters maltreated
in more shameful fashion. Then came other
wrongs at the hands of the later Neronian government.
The veterans settled in Camalodunum chased the earlier
possessors from house and homestead as it pleased them,
without the authorities interfering to check them. The
presents conferred by the emperor Claudius were confiscated
as revocable gifts. Roman ministers, who at the
same time trafficked in money, drove in this way the
Britannic communities, one after the other, to bankruptcy.
The moment was favourable. The governor Paullinus,
more brave than cautious, was just then, as we have said,
with the flower of the Roman army in the remote island of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Mona, and this attack on the most sacred seat of the national
religion exasperated men&#8217;s minds as much as it paved the
way for insurrection. The old vehement Celtic faith,
which had given the Romans so much trouble, burst forth
once more, for the last time, in a mighty flame. The
weakened and far separated camps of the legions in the
west and in the north afforded no protection to the whole
south&ndash;east of the island with its flourishing Roman towns.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Attack on
Camalodunum.</span>Above all, the capital, Camalodunum, was utterly
defenceless; there was no garrison. The walls were not
completed, although the temple of their imperial founder,
the new god Claudius, was so. The west of the island,
probably kept down by the legions stationed there, seems
not to have taken part in the rising, and as little the non&ndash;subject
north; but, as frequently occurred in Celtic revolts,
in the year 61 on a concerted signal all the rest of the
subject territory rose in a moment against the foreigners,
the Trinovantes, driven out of their capital, taking the
lead. The second commander, who at the time represented
the governor, the procurator Decianus Catus, had
at the last moment sent what soldiers he had to its protection;
they were 200 men. They defended themselves
with the veterans and the other Romans capable of arms
for two days in the temple; then they were overpowered,
and all that was Roman in the town perished. The like
fate befell the chief emporium of Roman trade, Londinium,
and a third flourishing Roman city, Verulamium &#40;St.
Albans, north&ndash;west of London&#41;, as well as the foreigners
scattered over the island; it was a national Vesper like
that of Mithradates, and the number of victims&mdash;alleged
to be 70,000&mdash;was not less. The procurator gave up the
cause of Rome as lost, and fled to the continent. The
Roman army, too, became involved in the disaster. A
number of scattered detachments and garrisons succumbed
to the assaults of the insurgents. Quintus Petillius
Cerialis, who held the command in the camp of Lindum,
marched on Camalodunum with the 9th legion; he came
too late to save it, and, assailed by an enormous superiority
of force, lost in the battle all his infantry; the camp was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
stormed by the Brigantes. The same fate well&ndash;nigh overtook
the general&ndash;in&ndash;chief. Hastily returning from the
island of Mona, he called to him the 2d legion stationed
at Isca; but it did not obey the command, and with only
about 10,000 men Paullinus had to take up the unequal
struggle against the numberless and victorious army of the
insurgents. If ever soldiers made good the errors of their
leader it was on the day when this small band&mdash;chiefly
the thenceforth celebrated 14th legion&mdash;achieved, doubtless
to its own surprise, a full victory, and once more
established the Roman rule in Britain. Little was wanting
to bring the name of Paullinus into association with
that of Varus. But success decides, and here it remained
with the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> The guilty commandant of the legion
that remained aloof anticipated the court&ndash;martial, and
threw himself upon his sword. The queen Boudicca drank
the cup of poison. The otherwise brave general was not
indeed brought to trial, as seemed to be at first the intention
of the government, but was soon under a suitable
pretext recalled.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Subjugation
of
West Britain.</span>The subjugation of the western portions of the island was
not continued at once by the successors of Paullinus.
The able general Sextus Julius Frontinus first under
Vespasian forced the Silures to recognise the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
rule; his successor Gnaeus Julius Agricola, after obstinate
conflicts with the Ordovici, effected what Paullinus had
not achieved, and occupied in the year 78 the island of
Mona. Afterwards there is no mention of active resistance
in these regions; the camp of Viroconium could probably
about this time be dispensed with, and the legion thereby
set free could be employed in northern Britain. But the
other two legionary camps still remained on the spot
down to the time of Diocletian, and only disappeared in
the later arrangements of the troops. If political considerations
may have contributed to this &#40;<a href="#Page_190">p.&nbsp;190</a>&#41;, yet
the resistance of the west was probably continued even
later, perhaps supported by communications with Ivernia.
Moreover, the complete absence of Roman traces in the
interior of Wales, and the Celtic nationality maintaining
itself there up to the present day, tell in favour of this
view.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Subjugation
of
Northern
Britain.</span>In the north the camp of the 9th Spanish legion in
Lindum &#40;Lincoln&#41; formed the centre of the Roman position
to the east of Viroconium. In closest contact with this
camp in north England was the most powerful principality
of the island, that of the Brigantes &#40;Yorkshire&#41;; it had
not properly submitted, but the queen, Cartimandus,
sought to keep peace with the conquerors and showed
herself compliant to them. The party hostile to the
Romans had attempted to break loose here in the year
50, but the attempt had been quickly suppressed.
Caratacus, beaten in the west, had hoped to be able to
continue his resistance in the north, but the queen delivered
him, as already stated, to the Romans. These internal
dissensions and domestic quarrels must have partly
influenced the rising against Paullinus, in which we
find the Brigantes in a leading position, and which fell
with all its weight upon this very legion of the north.
Meanwhile the Roman party of the Brigantes, however,
was influential enough to obtain the restoration of the
government of Cartimandus after the insurrection was
defeated. But some years afterwards the patriotic party
there, supported by the tidings of revolt from Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
which during the civil war after the downfall of Nero
filled all the west, brought about a new rising of the
Brigantes against the foreign rule, at the head of which
stood Cartimandus&#8217;s former husband, set aside and scorned
by her&mdash;the veteran warrior Venutius. It was only after
prolonged conflicts that the mighty people was subdued
by Petillius Cerialis, the same who had fought unsuccessfully
under Paullinus against these same Britons, now one
of the most noted generals of Vespasian, and the first
governor of the island nominated by him. The gradually
slackening resistance of the west made it possible to
combine one of the three legions hitherto stationed there
with that stationed in Lindum, and to advance the
camp itself from Lindum to the chief place of the
Brigantes, Eburacum &#40;York&#41;. But, so long as the west
offered serious resistance, nothing further was done in the
north for the extension of the Roman bounds; at the
Caledonian forest, says an author of the time of Vespasian,
the Roman arms were arrested for thirty years.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Agricola.</span>It was Agricola who first, after his work was over in
the west, energetically set himself to the subjugation also
of the north. First of all, he created for himself a fleet,
without which the provisioning of the troops in these
mountains, which afforded few supplies, would have been
impossible. Supported by this fleet he reached, under Titus
&#40;80&#41;, as far as the estuary of the Tava &#40;Frith of Tay&#41;, into
the region of Perth and Dundee, and employed the three
following campaigns in gaining an exact knowledge of the
wide districts between this frith and the previous Roman
boundary on the two seas, in breaking everywhere the
local resistance, and in constructing intrenchments at the
fitting places; with reference to which, in particular, the
natural line of defence which is formed by the two friths
running deeply into the land, of Clota &#40;Clyde&#41; near
Glasgow, and Bodotria &#40;Forth&#41; near Edinburgh, was
selected for a basis. This advance called the whole
Highlands under arms; but the mighty battle which the
united Caledonian tribes offered to the legions between
the two friths of Forth and Tay at the Graupian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
mountains ended with the victory of Agricola. According
to his view the subjugation of the island, once begun,
had to be also completed, nay, even extended to Ivernia;
and in favour of that course there might be urged, with
respect to Roman Britain, what the occupation of the
island had brought about with respect to Gaul. Moreover,
with an energetic carrying out of the occupation of
the islands as a whole, the expenditure of men and money
for the future would probably be reduced.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Caledonia
abandoned.</span>The Roman government did not follow these counsels.
How far personal and spiteful motives may have co&ndash;operated
in the recall of the victorious general in the year 85, who
for that matter had remained longer in office than was
usually the case elsewhere, must be left undetermined.
The coincidence of the last victories of the general in
Scotland and the first defeats of the emperor in the region
of the Danube was certainly in a high degree annoying.
But for the putting a stop to the operations in Britain,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>
and for the calling away, which apparently then ensued,
of one of the four legions with which Agricola had
executed his campaigns to Pannonia, a quite sufficient
explanation is furnished by the military position of the
state at that time&mdash;the extension of the Roman rule to
the right bank of the Rhine in upper Germany and the
outbreak of the dangerous wars in Pannonia. This, indeed,
does not explain why, withal, an end should be put to
the pressing forward towards the north, and northern
Scotland as well as Ireland should be left to themselves.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Probable
grounds
for this
policy.</span>That thenceforth the government desisted not on
account of accidents of the situation for the moment, but
once for all, from pushing forward the frontier of the empire,
and amidst all change of persons adhered to this course,
we are taught by the whole later history of the island, and
taught especially by the laborious and costly wall&ndash;structures
to be mentioned immediately. Whether the completion
of the conquest was renounced by them in the true interest
of the state, is another question. That the imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
finances would only suffer loss by this extension of the
bounds was even now urged, quite as much as it formerly
was against the occupation of the island itself; but could
not be decisive of the matter.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> In a military point of
view the occupation was capable of being carried out, as
Agricola had conceived it, beyond doubt without material
difficulty. But the consideration might turn the scale, that
the Romanising of the regions still free would have to encounter
great difficulty on account of the diversity of race.
The Celts in England proper belonged throughout to those
of the continent; national name, faith, language, were common
to both. As the Celtic nationality of the continent
had found a support in the island, on the other hand the
Romanising of Gaul necessarily carried its influence over
to England, and to this especially Rome owed the fact
that Britain became Romanised with so surprising rapidity.
But the natives of Ireland and Scotland belonged to
another stock and spoke another language; the Briton
understood their Gaelic probably as little as the German
understood the language of the Scandinavians. The
Caledonians&mdash;with the Iverni the Romans hardly came
into contact&mdash;are described throughout as barbarians of
the wildest type. On the other hand, the priest of the
oak &#40;Derwydd, <em>Druida</em>&#41; exercised his office on the Rhone
as in Anglesey, but not in the island of the west nor in
the mountains of the north. If the Romans had waged
the war chiefly to bring the domain of the Druids entirely
into their power, this aim was in some measure attained.
Beyond doubt at another time all these considerations
would not have induced the Romans to renounce the
sea&ndash;frontier on the north when brought so near to them,
and at least Caledonia would have been occupied. But
the Rome of that time was no longer able to leaven
further regions with Roman habits; the productive power
and the progressive spirit of the people had disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
from it. At least that sort of conquest, which cannot be
enforced by decrees and marches, would have hardly
succeeded, had they attempted it.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Fortifying
of the
northern
frontier.</span>Their aim therefore was to arrange the northern
frontier appropriately for defence, and to this object their
military works were thenceforth directed. Eburacum
remained the military centre. The wide territory occupied
by Agricola was retained and furnished with forts, which
served as advanced posts for the headquarters in rear;
probably the greatest part of the non&ndash;legionary troops
were employed for this purpose. The construction of
connected lines of fortification followed later. The first
of the kind proceeded from Hadrian, <span class="sidenote">The wall
of Hadrian.</span>and is also remarkable,
in so far as it still in a certain sense subsists to the
present day, and is more completely known than any
other of the great military structures of the Romans.
It is, strictly taken, a military road protected on both
sides by fortifications, leading from sea to sea for a length
of about seventy miles, westward to the Solway Frith, and
eastward to the mouth of the Tyne. The defence on the
north is formed by a huge wall, originally at least 16 feet
high and 8 feet thick, built on the two outer sides of
square stones, filled up between with rubble and mortar, in
front of which stretched a no less imposing fosse, 9 feet
in depth and 34 feet or more in breadth at the top.
Towards the south the road is protected by two parallel
earthen ramparts, even now 6 to 7 feet high, between
which is drawn a fosse 7 feet deep, with a margin raised
to the south, so that the structure from rampart to rampart
has a total breadth of 24 feet. Between the stone&ndash;wall
and the earthen ramparts on the road itself lie the camp&ndash;stations
and watch&ndash;houses, viz. at the distance of about
four miles from one another the cohort&ndash;camps, constructed
as forts, independently capable of defence, with gates
opening towards all the four sides; between every two
of these a smaller structure of a similar kind with sally&ndash;ports
to the north and south; between every two of the
latter four smaller watch&ndash;houses within call of each other.
This structure of grand solidity, which must have required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
as garrison 10,000 to 12,000 men, formed thenceforth the
basis of military operations in the north of England. It
was not a frontier&ndash;wall in the proper sense; on the
contrary, not merely did the posts that had already from
Agricola&#8217;s time been pushed forward far beyond it continue
to subsist by its side, but subsequently the line, <span class="sidenote">The wall of
Antoninus.</span>about a
half shorter, from the Frith of Forth to the Frith of Clyde,
already occupied by Agricola with a chain of posts, was
fortified in a similar but weaker way, first under Pius,
then in a more comprehensive manner under Severus&mdash;as
it were, as an advanced post for Hadrian&#8217;s wall.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> In point
of construction this line was different from that of Hadrian
only so far as it was limited to a considerable earthen
wall, with fosse in front and road behind, and so was not
adapted for defence toward the south; moreover, it too
included a number of smaller camps. At this line the
Roman imperial roads terminated,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> and, although there
were Roman posts even beyond this&mdash;the most northerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
point, at which the tombstone of a Roman soldier has
been found, is Ardoch, between Stirling and Perth&mdash;the
limit of the expeditions of Agricola, the Frith of Tay,
may be regarded as subsequently still the limit of the
Roman empire.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Wars in the
2d and 3d
centuries.</span>We know more of these imposing defensive works
than of the application that was made of them, and
generally of the later events on this distant scene of
warfare. Under Hadrian a severe disaster occurred here,
to all appearance a sudden attack on the camp of Eburacum,
and the annihilation of the legion stationed there,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>
the same 9th legion which had fought so unsuccessfully
in the war with Boudicca. Probably this was occasioned,
not by a hostile inroad, but by the revolt of the northern
tribes that passed as subjects of the empire, especially of
the Brigantes. With this we shall have to connect the
fact that the wall of Hadrian presents a front towards the
south as well as towards the north; evidently it was
destined also for the purpose of keeping in check the
superficially subdued north of England. Under Hadrian&#8217;s
successor Pius also conflicts took place here, in which the
Brigantes again took part; yet more exact information
cannot be got.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> The first serious attack upon this
imperial boundary, and the first demonstrable crossing
of the wall&mdash;doubtless that of Pius&mdash;took place under
Marcus, and further attacks under Commodus; as indeed
Commodus is the first emperor who assumed the surname
of victory Britannicus, after the able general Ulpius
Marcellus had routed the barbarians. But the sinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
of the Roman power was henceforth just as apparent here
as on the Danube and on the Euphrates. In the turbulent
early years of Severus&#8217;s reign the Caledonians had broken
their promise not to interfere with the Roman subjects,
and, resting on their support, their southern neighbours,
the Maeates, had compelled the Roman governor Lupus
to ransom captive Romans with large sums. For this
the heavy arm of Severus lighted on them not long before
his death; he penetrated into their own territory and compelled
them to cede considerable tracts,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> from which indeed,
after the old emperor had died in 211 at the camp of
Eburacum, his sons at once of their own accord withdrew
the garrisons, to be relieved of their burdensome defence.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Caledonians
and Scots.</span>From the third century hardly anything is told us of
the fate of the island. Since none of the emperors down
to Diocletian and his colleagues derived the name of conqueror
from the island, there were probably no more
serious conflicts in that quarter; and, although in the
region lying between the walls of Pius and of Hadrian
the Roman system doubtless never gained a firm footing,
yet at least the wall of Hadrian seems to have rendered
even then the service for which it was intended, and the
foreign civilisation seems to have developed in security
behind it. In the time of Diocletian we find the district
between the two walls evacuated, but the Hadrianic wall
occupied still as before, and the rest of the Roman army
in cantonments between it and the headquarters Eburacum,
to ward off the predatory expeditions, thenceforth often
mentioned, of the Caledonians, or&mdash;as they are now usually
called&mdash;the &#8220;tattooed&#8221; &#40;<em>picti</em>&#41;, and the Scots streaming
in from Ivernia.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Fleet.</span>The Romans possessed a standing fleet in Britain;
but, as the marine always remained the weak side of
Roman warlike organisation, the British fleet was temporarily
of importance only under Agricola.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Garrison
and administration
in the 2d
and 3d
centuries.</span>If, as is probable, the government had reckoned on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
being able to take back the greater part of the troops sent
to the island, after it had been occupied, this hope was
not fulfilled; only one of the four legions sent thither was,
as we have seen, recalled under Domitian; the three others
must have been indispensable, for no attempt was ever
made to shift them. To these fall to be added the auxiliaries,
who were called out apparently in larger proportion
than the burgess&ndash;troops for the far from inviting service
in the remote island of the North Sea. In the battle at
the Graupian Mount in 84 there fought, besides the
four legions, 8000 infantry and 3000 horsemen of the
auxiliary soldiers. For the time of Trajan and Hadrian,
when of these there were stationed in Britain six <em>alae</em> and
twenty&ndash;one cohorts, together about 15,000 men, we shall
have to estimate the whole British army at about 30,000
men. Britain was from the outset a field of command of
the first rank, inferior to the two Rhenish commands and to
the Syrian perhaps in rank, but not in importance, towards
the end of the second century probably the most highly
esteemed of all the governorships. It was owing only to
the great distance that the British legions appear in
the second rank amidst the rival armies of the earlier
imperial period; in the soldiers&#8217; war after the extinction
of the Antonine house they fought in the first rank.
But it was one of the consequences of the victory of
Severus that the governorship was divided. Thenceforth
the two legions of Isca and Deva were placed under the
legate of the upper province, the legion of Eburacum and
the troops at the walls&mdash;consequently the main body of
the auxiliaries&mdash;under the legate of the lower province.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>
Probably the transference of the whole garrison to the
north, which, as was above remarked, would doubtless have
been appropriate on mere military grounds, was not
carried out&mdash;partly because it would have put three legions
into the hands of one governor.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Taxation
and levy.</span>That financially the province cost more than it brought
in &#40;<a href="#Page_172">p.&nbsp;172</a>&#41;, can accordingly excite no surprise. For the
military strength of the empire, on the other hand, Britain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
was of considerable account; the balance of proportion
between taxation and levy must have had its application
also to the island, and the British troops were reckoned
alongside of the Illyrian as the flower of the army. At the
very beginning seven cohorts were raised from the natives
there, and these were constantly increased onward to the
time of Hadrian; after the latter had brought in the
system of recruiting the troops as far as possible from
their garrison&ndash;districts, Britain appears to have furnished
the supply, at least in great part, for its strong garrison.
There was an earnest and brave spirit in the people; they
bore willingly the taxes and the levy, but not the arrogance
and brutality of the officials.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Communal
organisation.</span>As a basis for the internal organisation of Britain, the
cantonal constitution existing there at the time of the
conquest offered itself, which differed, as we have already
remarked, from that of the Celts of the continent essentially
only in the fact that the several tribes of the island,
apparently all of them, were under princes &#40;iv.&nbsp;233&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;222.</span>. But
this organisation seems not to have been retained, and the
canton &#40;<em>civitas</em>&#41; to have become in Britain as in Spain a
geographical conception; at least we can hardly otherwise
explain the facts that the Britannic tribes, taken in the
strict sense, disappear as soon as they fall under Roman
rule, and of the individual cantons after their subjugation
there is virtually no mention at all. Probably the several
principalities, as they were subdued and annexed, were
broken up into smaller communities; this was facilitated
by the fact that there did not exist on the island, as there
did on the continent, a cantonal constitution organised
without a monarchic head. With this is doubtless connected
the circumstance that, while the Gallic cantons
possessed a common capital and in it a political and
religious collective representation, nothing similar is stated
as to Britain. The province was not without a <em>concilium</em>
and a common <em>cultus</em> of the emperor; but, if the altar of
Claudius in Camalodunum<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> had been even approximately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
what that of Augustus was in Lugudunum, something
would doubtless have been heard of it. The free and
great political remodelling, which was given to the Gallic
country by Caesar and confirmed by his son, no longer
fits into the framework of the later imperial policy.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the founding, nearly contemporary
with the invasion of Britain, of the colony
Camalodunum &#40;<a href="#Page_176">p.&nbsp;176</a>&#41;, as it has also been already noticed
that the Italian urban constitution was early introduced
into a series of British townships. Herein, too, Britain
was treated more after the model of Spain than after that
of the Celtic continent.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Prosperity.</span>The internal condition of Britain must, in spite of the
general faults of the imperial government, have been, at
least in comparison with other regions, not unfavourable.
If the people in the north knew only hunting and pasturing,
and the inhabitants there as well as those adjoining
them were always ready for feud and rapine, the south
developed itself in an undisturbed state of peace, especially
by means of agriculture, and along with it by cattle&ndash;rearing
and the working of mines, to a moderate prosperity.
The Gallic orators of Diocletian&#8217;s time praise the wealth
of the fertile island, and often enough the Rhine&ndash;legions
received their corn from Britain.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Roads.</span>The network of roads in the island, which was uncommonly
developed, and for which in particular Hadrian did
much in connection with the building of his wall, was of
course primarily subservient to military ends; but alongside
of, and in fact taking precedence over the legionary
camps Londinium occupies in that respect a place which
brings clearly into view its leading position in traffic. Only
in Wales were these imperial roads solely in the immediate
neighbourhood of the Roman camps, from Isca to Nidum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
&#40;Neath&#41; and from Deva to the point of crossing to
Mona.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Roman
manners
and culture.</span>In respect of Romanisation, Britain seems to have been
very similar to northern and central Gaul. The national
deities, the Mars Belatucadrus or Cocidius, the goddess
Sulis treated as equivalent to Minerva, after whom the
modern city of Bath was named, still received much
worship on the island even in the Latin language. The
language and manners that penetrated thither from Italy
were yet more an exotic growth on the island than
on the continent; still towards the close of the first
century the families of note there shunned as well the
Latin language as the Latin dress. The great urban
centres, the seats proper of the new culture, were more
weakly developed in Britain; we do not precisely know
what English town served as seat for the <em>concilium</em> of the
province and for the common worship of the emperor, or
in which of the three legion&ndash;camps the governor of the
province resided; if, as it seems, the civil capital of
Britain was Camalodunum, and the military capital Eburacum,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>
the latter can as little measure itself with Mentz
as the former with Lyons. The ruined sites even of
places of note, of the Claudian veteran&ndash;town Camalodunum,
and the populous mercantile town Londinium, and not
less the camps of the legions for several hundred years,
at Deva, Isca, Eburacum, present inscribed stones only in
trifling number; towns of name with Roman rights like
the colony Glevum &#40;Gloucester&#41;, and the <em>municipium</em> Verulamium,
have hitherto yielded not a single one; the
custom of setting up memorial&ndash;stones, on the results of
which we are for such questions largely dependent,
never really prevailed in Britain. In the interior of
Wales and in other less accessible districts no Roman
monuments at all have come to light. But there exist withal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
clear traces of the stirring commerce and traffic brought
into prominence by Tacitus, such as the numerous drinking&ndash;cups
which have come out of the ruins of London, and
the London network of roads. If Agricola exerted himself
to transplant municipal emulation in the embellishment
of one&#8217;s native city by buildings and monuments
to Britain, as it had been transferred from Italy to Africa
and Spain, and to induce the islanders of note to adorn
the markets of their home and to erect temples and
palaces, as this was usual elsewhere, he was but in a slight
degree successful as regards the public buildings. But it
was otherwise as regards private economics; the stately
country&ndash;houses constructed and embellished in Roman
fashion, of which now nothing is left but the mosaic pavements,
are found in southern Britain&mdash;so far north as the
region of York<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>&mdash;as frequently as in the land of the Rhine.
The higher scholastic training of youth penetrated gradually
from Gaul into Britain. It is specified among Agricola&#8217;s
administrative successes that the Roman tutor began to
find his way into the leading houses of the island. In
Hadrian&#8217;s time Britain is described as a region conquered
by the Gallic schoolmasters, and &#8220;even Thule speaks of
hiring a professor for itself.&#8221; These schoolmasters were
in the first instance Latin, but Greeks also came; Plutarch
tells of a conversation which he held at Delphi with a
Greek teacher of languages from Tarsus returning home
from Britain. If in modern England, apart from Wales
and its borders, the old native language has disappeared,
it has given way not to the Angles or to the Saxons, but to
the Roman idiom; and, as usually happens in border&ndash;lands,
in the later imperial period no one stood more faithfully by
Rome than the man of Britain. It was not Britain that
gave up Rome, but Rome that gave up Britain. The last
that we learn of the island is the urgent entreaty of the
population addressed to the emperor Honorius for protection
against the Saxons, and his answer, that they might
help themselves as best they could.</p>

<p class="head3">THE DANUBIAN LANDS AND THE WARS ON THE DANUBE.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Arrangements of
Augustus.</span><span class="smcap">As</span> the frontier on the Rhine was the work of Caesar, so
the frontier on the Danube was the work of Augustus.
When he came to the helm, the Romans were in the
Italian peninsula hardly masters of the Alps, and in the
Greek peninsula hardly masters of the Haemus &#40;Balkan&#41;
and of the coast districts along the Adriatic and the Black
Sea; nowhere did their territory reach the mighty stream
which separates southern from northern Europe. As well
northern Italy as the Illyrian and Pontic commercial
towns, and still more the civilised provinces of Macedonia
and Thrace, were constantly exposed to the predatory expeditions
of the rude and restless neighbouring tribes.
When Augustus died there were substituted for the one
province of Illyricum, which had barely attained to independent
administration, five great Roman administrative
districts, Raetia, Noricum, Lower Illyria or Pannonia,
Upper Illyria or Dalmatia, and Moesia; and the Danube
became in its whole course, if not everywhere the military,
at any rate the political, frontier of the empire. The comparatively
easy subjugation of these wide territories, as well
as the grave insurrection of the years 6&ndash;9, and the abandonment,
thereby occasioned, of the formerly cherished purpose
of shifting the boundary&ndash;line from the upper Danube to
Bohemia and to the Elbe, have been formerly described.
It remains that we should set forth the development of
these provinces in the time after Augustus and the relations
of the Romans to the tribes dwelling beyond the Danube.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Late civilisation
in
Raetia.</span>The destinies of Raetia were so closely interwoven
with those of the upper German province that we might
refer for them to the earlier narrative. Roman civilisation
here, taken as a whole, underwent but little development.
The highlands of the Alps with the valleys of the upper
Inn and the upper Rhine embraced a weak and peculiar
population, probably the same as had once possessed the
eastern half of the north&ndash;Italian plain, perhaps akin to
the Etruscans. Driven back thence by the Celts, and
perhaps also by the Illyrici, it held its ground in the
northern mountains. While the valleys opening to the
south, like that of the Adige, were attached to Italy, these
offered to the southerns little room and still less incitement
for settlement and founding of towns. Farther
northward on the plateau between the lake of Constance
and the Inn, which was occupied by the Celtic tribes of
the Vindelici, there would doubtless have been room and
place for Roman culture; but apparently in this region,
which could not become, like the Norican, an immediate
continuation of Italy, and which, like the adjacent so&ndash;called
Decumates&ndash;land, was probably in the first instance
of value for the Romans merely as separating them from
the Germans, the policy of the earlier imperial period
had rather repressed culture. We have already indicated
<a href="#Page_18">p.&nbsp;18</a>&#41; that immediately after the conquest there were
thoughts of depopulating the district. Alongside of this
lies the fact, that in the earlier imperial period no
community with Roman organisation originated here.
It is true that the founding of Augusta Vindelicorum,
the modern Augsburg, was a necessary part of the
laying out of the great road which was carried, simultaneously
with the conquest itself, by the elder Drusus
through the high Alps to the Danube &#40;pp. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>, <a href="#Page_20">20</a>&#41;; but
this rapidly flourishing place was, and remained for above
a century, a market&ndash;village, till at length Hadrian in this
respect left the path prescribed by Augustus and made
the land of the Vindelici share in the Romanising of
the north. The bestowal of Roman urban rights on the
chief place of the Vindelici by Hadrian may be connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
with the fact that, nearly about the same time, the military
frontier was pushed forward on the upper Rhine, and
Roman towns arose in the former Decumates&ndash;land;
nevertheless in Raetia ever afterwards Augusta remained
the only larger centre of Roman civilisation. The military
arrangements exercised an influence in keeping it
back. The province was from the first under imperial
administration, and could not be left without a garrison;
but special considerations, as we have formerly shown,
compelled the government to send to Raetia simply troops
of the second class, and, though these were not inconsiderable
in number, the smaller headquarters of <em>alae</em> and
<em>cohortes</em> could not have exercised a civilising and town&ndash;forming
effect like the camp of the legion. Under Marcus
certainly, in consequence of the Marcomanian war, the
Raetian headquarters, Castra Regina, the modern Ratisbon,
was occupied by a legion; but even this place appears to
have remained in the Roman time a mere military settlement,
and hardly to have stood on a line in urban development
with the camps of second rank on the Rhine, such
as <em>e.g.</em> Bonna.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Raetian
Limes.</span>That the frontier of Raetia was already in Trajan&#8217;s
time pushed forward from Ratisbon westward some distance
beyond the Danube, has already been observed
&#40;<a href="#Page_158">p.&nbsp;158</a>&#41;; and it has been there also shown that this
territory was probably annexed to the empire without
applying force of arms, similarly with the Decumates&ndash;land.
It was likewise already mentioned that the fortifying of
this territory was perhaps connected with the incursions of
the Chatti extending thus far under Marcus, as also that
these and subsequently the Alamanni in the third century
visited as well this country in front as Raetia itself, and
ultimately under Gallienus wrested it from the Romans.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Italising
of
Noricum.</span>The neighbouring province of Noricum was doubtless
in the provincial arrangement treated similarly to Raetia,
but in other respects had a different development. In no
direction was Italy so open for land&ndash;traffic as towards the
north&ndash;east; the commercial relations of Aquileia, as well
through Friuli with the upper Danube and with the iron&ndash;works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
of Noreia, as over the Julian Alps with the valley
of the Save, here paved the way for the Augustan extension
of the frontier as nowhere else in the region of the
Danube. Nauportus &#40;Upper Laybach&#41; beyond the pass
was a Roman trading village already in the time of the
republic; Emona &#40;Laybach&#41;, a Roman burgess&ndash;colony,
afterwards formally incorporated with Italy, but substantially
belonging to Italy from the time of its foundation
by Augustus. Hence, as has already been noticed
&#40;<a href="#Page_18">p.&nbsp;18</a>&#41;, the mere proclamation was probably enough for
the conversion of this &#8220;kingdom&#8221; into a Roman province.
The population, originally doubtless Illyrian, afterwards
in good part Celtic, shows no trace of that adherence to
the national ways and language which we perceive among
the Celts of the west. Roman language and Roman
manners must have found early entrance here; and by the
emperor Claudius the whole territory, even the northern
portion separated by the Tauern chain from the valley of
the Drave, was organised in accordance with the Italian
municipal constitution. While in the neighbouring lands
of Raetia and Pannonia the monuments of Roman language
are either wanting or appear withal only at the
larger centres, the valleys of the Drave, the Mur, and the
Salzach and their affluents are filled far up into the mountains
with evidences of the Romanising which here took
deep hold. Noricum adjoined, and was as it were a part
of, Italy; in the levy for the legions and for the guard,
so long as the Italians were here at all preferred, this
preference was extended to no other province so fully as
to this.</p>

<p>As respects military occupation what applies to
Raetia applies also to Noricum. For the reasons already
developed there were in Noricum, during the first two
centuries of the empire, only forts of <em>alae</em> and <em>cohortes</em>.
Carnuntum &#40;Petronell, near Vienna&#41;, which in the Augustan
age belonged to Noricum, was, when the Illyrian legions
were sent thither, annexed for that very reason to Pannonia.
The smaller Norican encampments on the Danube,
and even the camp of Lauriacum &#40;near Enns&#41;, instituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
by Marcus for the legion sent by him to this province,
were of no importance for the urban development. The
large townships of Noricum, such as Celeia &#40;Cilli&#41;, in the
valley of the Sann, Aguontum &#40;Lienz&#41;, Teurnia &#40;not far
from Spital&#41;, Virunum &#40;Zollfeld, near Klagenfurt&#41;, in the
north Juvavum &#40;Salzburg&#41;, originated purely out of civil
elements.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Illyrian
stock.</span>Illyricum, that is the Roman territory between Italy
and Macedonia, was in the republican time united, as to
its lesser portion, with the Graeco&ndash;Macedonian governorship,
as to its greater, administered as a land adjacent to
Italy, and, after the institution of the governorship of
Cisalpine Gaul, as a portion of the latter. The territory
coincides to a certain degree with the widely diffused
stock from which the Romans named it; it is the same
whose scanty remnant still at the present day, at the
southern end of its formerly far&ndash;extended possessions, has
preserved its own nationality and its old language under
the name of Skipetars, which they assign to themselves,
or, as their neighbours call them, the Arnauts or Albanians.
It is a member of the Indo&ndash;Germanic family, and within
it doubtless most closely akin to the Greek branch, as is
in keeping with its local relations; but it stands by the
side of the Greek at least as independent as the Latin and
the Celtic. This nation in its original extent filled the
coast of the Adriatic Sea from the mouth of the Po
through Istria, Dalmatia, and Epirus, as far as Acarnania
and Aetolia, and also in the interior upper Macedonia, as
well as the modern Servia and Bosnia and the Hungarian
territory on the right bank of the Danube; it bordered
thus on the east with the Thracian tribes, on the west
with the Celtic, from which latter Tacitus expressly distinguishes
them. It is a vigorous type of a southern
kind, with black hair and dark eyes, very different from
the Celts, and still more from the Germans; sober, temperate,
intrepid, proud people, excellent soldiers, but little
accessible to civic organisation, shepherds more than
agriculturists. They did not attain any great political
development. On the Italian coast they were confronted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
probably, in the first instance, by the Celts; the probably
Illyrian tribes there, especially the Veneti, became, through
rivalry with the Celts, at an early date pliant subjects
of the Romans.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Its relations
with
Rome.</span>At the end of the sixth century of the city the
founding of Aquileia and the subjugation of the peninsula
of Istria &#40;ii.&nbsp;207 f.&#41;<span class="sidenote2">ii.&nbsp;196.</span> farther narrowed their limits. Along
the east coast of the Adriatic Sea the more important
islands and the southern harbours of the mainland had
long been occupied by the bold Hellenic mariners. When
thereupon in Scodra &#40;Scutari&#41;, to a certain extent in olden
time as now the central point of the Illyrian land, the
rulers began to develop a power of their own, and especially
to make war upon the Greeks at sea, Rome, even before
the Hannibalic war, struck them down with a strong
hand, and took the whole coast under its protectorate
&#40;ii.&nbsp;77 f.&#41;<span class="sidenote2">ii.&nbsp;74&nbsp;f.</span>, which soon, after the ruler of Scodra had shared
war and defeat with king Perseus of Macedonia, brought
about the complete dissolution of this principality &#40;ii.&nbsp;321&#41;<span class="sidenote2">ii.&nbsp;303.</span>.
At the end of the sixth century of the city, and in the
first half of the seventh, after long years of conflict, the
coast between Istria and Scodra was also occupied by
the Romans &#40;iii.&nbsp;180 f.&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;172.</span>. In the interior the Illyrians
were little touched by the Romans during the republican
period; but instead the Celts, advancing from the west,
must have brought under their power a good portion of
originally Illyrian territory, such as Noricum, afterwards
preponderantly Celtic. The Latobici also in the modern
Carniola were Celts; and in the whole territory between
the Save and Drave, just as in the Raab valley, the two
great stocks were settled promiscuously, when Caesar
Augustus subjected the southern districts of Pannonia to
the Roman rule. Probably this strong admixture of
Celtic elements contributed its part, along with the level
character of the ground, to the early decline of the
Illyrian nation in the Pannonian districts. Into the
southern half, on the other hand, of the regions inhabited
by Illyrians there penetrated of the Celts only
the Scordisci, whose establishment on the lower Save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
as far as Morava, and raids as far as the vicinity of
Thessalonica, have been formerly mentioned &#40;iii.&nbsp;184 f.&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;176&nbsp;f.</span>.
But the Greeks here gave place to them in some measure;
the sinking of the Macedonian power, and the desolation
of Epirus and Aetolia, must have favoured the extension
of the Illyrian neighbours. Bosnia, Servia, above all
Albania, were in the imperial period Illyrian, and Albania
is so still.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The province
of Illyricum.</span>It has already been mentioned that Illyricum was,
according to the design of the dictator Caesar, to be
constituted as a special governorship, and this design
came into execution on the partition of the provinces
between Augustus and the senate; that this governorship,
at first committed to the senate, passed to the
emperor on account of the need for waging war there;
that Augustus divided this governorship and rendered
effective the rule, which hitherto on the whole had been
but nominal, over the interior both in Dalmatia and in
the region of the Save; and, lastly, that he subdued, after
a severe struggle of four years, the mighty national
insurrection which broke out among the Dalmatian as
among the Pannonian Illyrians in the year 6. It remains
that we relate the further fortunes, in the first instance,
of the southern province.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Dalmatia
and its
Italian civilisation.</span>After the experience attained in the insurrection it
seemed requisite not merely to employ the forces raised in
Illyricum abroad rather than as hitherto in their native
country, but also to keep in subordination the Dalmatians
as well as the Pannonians by a command of the first rank.
This rapidly fulfilled its object. The resistance, which the
Illyrici under Augustus opposed to the unwonted foreign
rule, expended its rage in the one violent storm; afterwards
our reports record no similar movement, even of
but a partial kind. For the southern or, according to the
Roman expression, the Upper Illyricum&mdash;the province
Dalmatia, as it was usually called from the time of the
Flavii&mdash;a new epoch began with the government of the
emperors. The Greek merchants had indeed founded on
the coast lying nearest to them the two great emporia of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Apollonia &#40;near Valona&#41; and Dyrrachium &#40;Durazzo&#41;;
for that very reason this portion had already under the
republic been consigned to Greek administration. But
farther northward the Hellenes had settled only on the
adjacent islands Issa &#40;Lissa&#41;, Pharos &#40;Lesina&#41;, Black&ndash;Corcyra
&#40;Curzola&#41;, and thence maintained intercourse with
the natives particularly along the coast of Narona and in
the townships adjacent to Salonae. Under the Roman
republic the Italian traders, who here entered upon the
heritage of the Greek, had settled in the chief ports Epitaurum
&#40;Ragusa Vecchia&#41;, Narona, Salonae, Iader &#40;Zara&#41;,
in such numbers that they could play a not unimportant
part in the war of Caesar and Pompeius. But it was only
through Augustus that these townships received strengthening
by the settlement of veterans there, and&mdash;what was
the main thing&mdash;urban rights; and at the same time partly
the energetic suppression of the piratic retreats still existing
in the islands, partly the subjugation of the interior
and the pushing forward of the Roman frontier towards
the Danube, tended to benefit especially these Italians
settled on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea. Above all
the capital of the country, the seat of the governor and of
the whole administration, <span class="sidenote">Salonae.</span>Salonae rapidly flourished and
far outstripped the older Greek settlements Apollonia and
Dyrrachium, although to the latter town there were sent
likewise under Augustus Italian colonists, not indeed
veterans but dispossessed Italians, and the town was
erected as a Roman burgess&ndash;community. It may be conjectured
that in the prosperity of Dalmatia and the arrested
development of the Illyro&ndash;Macedonian coast the distinction
between the imperial and the senatorial government played
an essential part&mdash;as regards better administration, as
well as a privileged position with the real holder of
power. With this, moreover, may be connected the fact,
that the Illyrian nationality held its ground better in the
sphere of the Macedonian governorship than in that of the
Dalmatian; in the former it still lives at the present day;
and in the imperial period&mdash;apart from the Greek Apollonia
and the Italian colony of Dyrrachium&mdash;while the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
languages of the empire were made use of, in the interior
that of the people must have continued to be the Illyrian.
In Dalmatia, on the other hand, the coasts and the islands,
so far as they were at all adapted thereto&mdash;the inhospitable
stretch to the north of the Iader necessarily was left
behind in the development&mdash;were communalised after the
Italian organisation, and soon the whole coast spoke Latin,
somewhat as it speaks at the present day Venetian.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Civilisation
in the interior.</span>The advance of civilisation into the interior had to
encounter local difficulties. The considerable streams of
Dalmatia form waterfalls more than water&ndash;ways; and
even the establishment of land&ndash;routes meets unusual difficulties
from the nature of its mountain&ndash;network. The
Roman government made earnest exertions to open up the
country. Under the protection of the legionary camp of
Burnum in the valley of the Kerka and in that of Cettina
under the protection of the camp of Delminium&mdash;which
camps must have been here too the channels of civilisation
and of Latinising&mdash;the cultivation of the soil developed
itself after the Italian fashion, as also the planting of the
vine and the olive, and in general Italian organisation and
habits. On the other hand, beyond the watershed between
the Adriatic Sea and the Danube the valleys less
favourable for agriculture from the Kulpa to the Drin
remained during the Roman period in a primitive state,
similar to that exhibited by Bosnia at the present day.
The emperor Tiberius certainly had various roads made
by the soldiers of the Dalmatian camps from Salonae into
the valleys of Bosnia; but the later governments apparently
allowed the difficult task to drop. On the coast
and in the districts adjoining the coast Dalmatia soon
needed no further military protection; Vespasian could
already withdraw the legions from the valleys of the Kerka
and the Cettina and employ them elsewhere.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Prosperity
under Diocletian.</span>Amidst the decay of the empire in the third century
Dalmatia suffered comparatively little; indeed, Salonae
probably only reached at that time its greatest prosperity.
This, it is true, was occasioned partly by the fact that the
regenerator of the Roman state, the emperor Diocletian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
was by birth a Dalmatian, and allowed his efforts aimed
at the decapitalising of Rome to redound chiefly to the
benefit of the capital of his native land; he built alongside
of it the huge palace, from which the modern capital of the
province takes the name Spalato, within which it has for
the most part found a place, and the temples of which
now serve it as cathedral and as baptistery.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> Diocletian,
however, did not make Salonae a great city for the first
time, but, because it was such, chose it for his private
residence; commerce, navigation, and trade must at that
time in these waters have been concentrated chiefly at
Aquileia and at Salonae, and the city must have been
one of the most populous and opulent towns of the west.
The rich iron mines of Bosnia were largely worked at
least in the later imperial period; the forests of the province
likewise yielded abundant and excellent timber; even
of the flourishing textile industry of the land a reminiscence
is still preserved in the priestly &#8220;Dalmatica.&#8221; Altogether
the civilising and Romanising of Dalmatia form
one of the most peculiar and most significant phenomena
of the imperial period. The boundary between Dalmatia
and Macedonia was at the same time the political and
linguistic demarcation of the West and East. As the
spheres of rule of Caesar and Marcus Antonius came into
contact at Scodra, so did those of Rome and Byzantium
after the partition of the empire in the fourth century.
Here the Latin province of Dalmatia bordered with the
Greek province of Macedonia; and the younger sister
stands here alongside of the elder, vigorous in aspiration
and excelling in energy of effort.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Pannonia
down to
Trajan.</span>While the southern Illyrian province and its peaceful
government soon ceased to be prominent in a historical
aspect, northern Illyricum, or as it is usually called, Pannonia,
forms in the imperial period one of the great military
and thereby also political centres. In the army of
the Danube the Pannonian camps have the leading position
like the Rhenish in the west, and the Dalmatian and
the Moesian attach themselves to them, and subordinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
themselves under them, in like manner as the legions of
Spain and Britain were subordinate to those of the Rhine.
Roman civilisation stands and continues here under the
influence of the camps, which did not remain in Pannonia
as in Dalmatia only for some generations, but were permanent.
After the subduing of the insurrection of Bato,
the regular garrison of the province amounted at first to
three, afterwards apparently only to two, legions; and the
further development was conditioned by their standing
quarters and the shifting of these forward. When Augustus
after the first war against the Dalmatians had selected
Siscia, at the point where the Kulpa falls into the Save,
as his chief stronghold, after Tiberius had subdued Pannonia
at least as far as the Drave, the camps were pushed
forward to the latter, and at least one of the Pannonian
headquarters was thenceforth found at Poetovio &#40;Pettau&#41;,
on the borders of Noricum. The reason why the Pannonian
army remained wholly or in part in the valley of
the Drave can only have been the same as led to the construction
of the Dalmatian legionary camps; they needed
troops here to keep in obedience their subjects as well in
the neighbouring Noricum as above all in the region of
the Drave itself. On the Danube watch was kept by the
Roman fleet, which is already mentioned in the year 50,
and presumably originated on the erection of the province.
There was not yet perhaps a legionary camp on the river
itself under the Julio&ndash;Claudian dynasty,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
with which we may note that the state of the Suebi immediately
adjoining the province in front was at that time
immediately dependent on Rome, and sufficed in some
measure to protect the frontier. Then, as with the camps
of Dalmatia, Vespasian apparently did away also with the
camps on the Drave and transferred them to the Danube
itself; thenceforth the great headquarters of the Pannonian
army were the formerly Norican &#40;<a href="#Page_198">p.&nbsp;198</a>&#41; Carnuntum
&#40;Petronell, to the east of Vienna&#41;, and along with it Vindobona
&#40;Vienna&#41;.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Urban development.</span>Civil development, such as we meet in Noricum and
on the coast of Dalmatia, shows itself likewise in Pannonia
only at some districts situated on the Norican frontier, and
in part belonging originally to Noricum; Emona and the
upper valley of the Save stand on an equality with Noricum,
and if Savaria &#40;Stein, on the Anger&#41; received the
Italian municipal constitution at the same time with the
Norican towns, that place must doubtless, so long as Carnuntum
was a Norican town, have belonged also to
Noricum. It was only after the troops were stationed on
the Danube that the government set to work to give urban
organisation to the country behind. In the western
territory originally Norican, Scarbantia &#40;Oedenburg, on
the Neusiedler See&#41; obtained urban rights under the
Flavii, while Vindobona and Carnuntum became of
themselves camp&ndash;towns. Between the Save and Drave
Siscia and Sirmium received urban rights under the
Flavii, as on the Drave Poetovio &#40;Pettau&#41; under Trajan,
Mursa &#40;Eszeg&#41; under Hadrian colonial rights&mdash;to mention
here only the chief places. That the population, predominantly
Illyrian but in good part also Celtic, opposed
no energetic resistance to the Romanising, has already
been mentioned; the old language and the old habits
disappeared where the Romans came, and kept their
ground only in the more remote districts. The districts&mdash;wide,
but far from inviting for settlement&mdash;to the east of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the river Raab and to the north of the Drave as far as the
Danube were probably reckoned even from the time of
Augustus as belonging to the empire, but perhaps in a
way not much differing from Germany before the battle
of Varus; urban development neither then nor later found
a true soil here, and in a military point of view this region
was for a long time occupied but little or not at all. This
state of matters changed in some measure only in consequence
of the incorporation of Dacia under Trajan; the
pushing forward of the Pannonian camps towards the east
frontier of the province, to which that step gave occasion,
and the further internal development of Pannonia, will be
better described in connection with the wars of Trajan.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Thracian
stock.</span>The last portion of the right bank of the Danube&mdash;the
mountain&ndash;land on the two sides of the Margus &#40;Morava&#41;,
and the flat country stretching along between the Haemus
and the Danube&mdash;was inhabited by Thracian tribes; and
it appears necessary in the first instance to cast a glance
at this great stock as such. It runs parallel in a certain
sense to the Illyrian. As the Illyrians once filled the
regions from the Adriatic Sea to the middle Danube, so
the Thracians were formerly settled to the east of them,
from the Aegean Sea as far as the mouths of the Danube,
and not less on the one hand upon the left bank of the
Danube, particularly in the modern Transylvania, on the
other hand beyond the Bosporus, at least in Bithynia
and as far as Phrygia. Herodotus is not wrong in calling
the Thracians the greatest of the peoples known to him
after the Indians. Like the Illyrian, the Thracian stock
attained to no full development, and appears more as hard&ndash;pressed
and dispossessed than as having any historically
memorable course of its own. But, while the language
and habits of the Illyrians have been preserved&mdash;though
in a form worn down in the course of centuries&mdash;to the
present day, and we with some right transfer the image
of the Palikars from more recent history to that of the
Roman imperial period, the same does not hold good
of the Thracian stock. There is manifold and sure
attestation that the tribes of the territory, which in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
of the Roman provincial division has ultimately
retained the name Thracian, as well as the Moesians between
the Balkan and the Danube, and not less the Getae
or Daci on the other bank of the Danube, all spoke one
and the same language. This language had in the Roman
empire a position similar to that of the Celts and of the
Syrians. The historian and geographer of the Augustan
age, Strabo, mentions the likeness of language among the
peoples named; in botanical writings of the imperial
period the Dacian appellations of a number of plants are
specified.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> When his contemporary, the poet Ovid, had
opportunity given to him in the far&ndash;off Dobrudscha to
reflect on his too dissolute course of life, he used his leisure
to learn Getic, and became almost a poet of the Getae:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><em>Ah pudet! et Getico scripsi sermone libellum&#8230;.</em></div>
<div class="line"><em>Et placui &#40;gratare mihi&#41; coepique poetae</em></div>
<div class="line"><em>Inter inhumanos nomen habere Getas.</em></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But while the Irish bards, the Syrian missionaries, and
the mountain valleys of Albania secured a certain continued
duration for other idioms of the imperial period, the
Thracian disappeared amidst the fluctuations of peoples in
the region of the Danube and the overpowerful influence
of Constantinople, and we cannot even determine the
place which belongs to it in the pedigree of nations. The
descriptions of manners and customs of particular tribes
belonging to it, as to which various notices have been preserved,
yield no individual traits valid for the race as a
whole, and for the most part bring into relief merely singularities
such as appear among all peoples at a low stage
of culture. But they were and remained a soldier&ndash;people,
not less useful as horsemen than for light infantry, from
the times of the Peloponnesian war and of Alexander
down to that of the Roman Caesars, whether they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
range themselves against them or subsequently fight for
them. Their wild but grand mode of worshipping the
gods may perhaps be conceived as a trait peculiar to this
stock&mdash;the mighty outburst of the joy of spring and
youth, the nocturnal mountain&ndash;festivals of torch&ndash;swinging
maidens, the intoxicating sense&ndash;confusing music, the
flowing of wine and the flowing of blood, the giddy festal
whirl frantic with the simultaneous excitement of all
sensuous passions. Dionysos, the glorious and the terrible,
was a Thracian god; and whatever of the kind was
specially prominent in the Hellenic and the Roman <em>cultus</em>,
was connected with Thracian or Phrygian customs.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Thracian
principate.</span>While the Illyrian tribes in Dalmatia and Pannonia,
after the overthrow of the great insurrection in the last
years of Augustus, did not again invoke the decision of
arms against the Romans, the same did not hold true of
the Thracian stock; the often&ndash;shown spirit of independence
and the wild bravery of this nation did not fail it
even in its decline. In Thrace, south of the Haemus, the
old principate remained under Roman supremacy. The
native ruling house of the Odrysae, with their residence
Bizye &#40;Wiza&#41;, between Adrianople and the coast of the
Black Sea, was already in the earlier period the most prominent
among the princely families of Thrace; after the
triumviral period there is no further mention of other
Thracian kings than of those of this house, so that the other
princes appear to have been made vassals or superseded
under Augustus, and only members of this family were
thenceforth invested with the Thracian kingly office.
This was done, probably, because during the first century,
as will be shown further on, there were no Roman legions
stationed on the lower Danube; Augustus expected the
frontier at the mouth of the Danube to be protected by
the Thracian vassals. Rhoemetalces, who in the second
half of the reign of Augustus ruled all Thrace as a Roman
vassal&ndash;king,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> and his children and grandchildren therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
played in this country nearly the same part as Herod and
his descendants in Palestine; unconditional devotedness
towards the lord&ndash;paramount, a decided inclination to
Roman habits, hostility to their own countrymen who
clung to the national independence, mark the attitude
of the Thracian ruling house. The great Thracian insurrection
of the years 741&ndash;743, of which we have formerly
spoken &#40;<a href="#Page_24">p.&nbsp;24</a>&#41;, was directed in the first instance against
this Rhoemetalces and his brother and co&ndash;regent Cotys
who perished in it, and, as he at that time was indebted
to the Romans for reinstatement into his dominion, so he
some years afterwards rendered to them his thanks when,
on occasion of the rising of the Dalmatians and the
Pannonians, to which his Dacian kinsmen adhered, he
kept faithfully to the Romans, and bore an essential part in
its overthrow. His son Cotys was more Roman, or rather
Greek, than Thracian; he traced back his pedigree to
Eumolpus and Erichthonius, and gained the hand of a
kinswoman of the imperial house, the great granddaughter
of the triumvir Antonius; and not merely did the Greek
and Latin poets of his time address him in song, but
he himself was also a poet and not a Getic poet.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> The last
of the Thracian kings, Rhoemetalces, son of the early deceased
Cotys, was reared in Rome, and, like the Herodian
Agrippa, a youthful playmate of the emperor Gaius.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Province of
Thrace.</span>But the Thracian nation by no means shared the Roman
leanings of the ruling house, and the government gradually
became convinced in Thrace as in Palestine that the
tottering vassal&ndash;throne, only maintained by constant interference
of the protecting power, was of use neither for
them nor for the country, and that the introduction of
direct administration was in every respect to be preferred.
The emperor Tiberius made use of the quarrels that arose
in the Thracian royal house to send to Thrace in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
year 19 a Roman governor, Titus Trebellenus Rufus, under
cover of exercising guardianship over the princes that were
minors. Yet this occupation was not accomplished without
resistance, ineffectual doubtless, but serious on the
part of the people, who, particularly in the mountain&ndash;valleys,
troubled themselves little about the rulers appointed
by Rome, and whose forces, led by their family&ndash;chiefs,
hardly felt themselves to be soldiers of the king, and
still less soldiers of Rome. The sending of Trebellenus
called forth in the year 21 a rising, in which not merely
did the most noted Thracian tribes take part, but which
threatened to assume greater proportions; messengers of
the insurgents went over the Haemus to enkindle the
national war in Moesia, and perhaps still further. Meanwhile
the Moesian legions appeared in right time to
relieve Philippopolis, which the insurgents besieged, and to
suppress the movement. But, when some years later &#40;25&#41;
the Roman government ordered levies in Thrace, the men
refused to serve beyond the bounds of their own country.
When no regard was paid to this refusal, the whole
mountains rose and a struggle of despair ensued, in which
the insurgents, constrained at length by hunger and thirst,
threw themselves in great part on the swords of the enemy
or on their own, and preferred to renounce life rather than
their time&ndash;honoured freedom. The direct government
continued in the form of exercising wardship in Thrace
up to the death of Tiberius; and, if the emperor Gaius at
the commencement of his reign gave back the rule to the
Thracian friend of his youth just as to the Jewish, a few
years after, in the year 46, the government of Claudius
definitely put an end to it. This final annexation of the
kingdom, and conversion of it into a Roman province, also
encountered an equally hopeless and equally obstinate
resistance. But with the introduction of direct administration
the resistance was broken. The governor, at first
of equestrian, and from Trajan&#8217;s time of senatorial, rank,
never had a legion; the garrison sent into the country,
though it was not stronger than 2000 men, along with
a small squadron stationed at Perinthus, was sufficient, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
connection with the precautionary measures otherwise
taken by the government, to keep down the Thracians.
The laying out of military roads was begun immediately
after the annexation; we find that the buildings requisite
in the state of the country for the accommodation of
travellers at the posting stations were already, in the year
61, erected by the government and opened to traffic.
Thrace was thenceforth an obedient and important province
of the empire; hardly any other furnished so
numerous men for all parts of the war&ndash;forces, especially for
the cavalry and the fleet, as this old home of gladiators
and of mercenary soldiers.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Moesia.</span>The serious conflicts which the Romans had to sustain
with the same nation on the so&ndash;called &#8220;Thracian shore&#8221;
&#91;Ripa Thraciae&#93;, in the region between the Balkan and
the Danube, and which led to the institution of the Moesian
command, form an essential constituent part of the regulation
of the northern frontier in the Augustan age, and
have been already described in their connection &#40;<a href="#Page_13">p.&nbsp;13 f</a>&#41;.
Of resistance similar to that offered by the Thracians to
the Romans nothing is reported from Moesia; the tone of
feeling there may not have been different, but in the level
country and under the pressure of the legions encamped
at Viminacium the resistance did not emerge openly.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Hellenism
and Romanism
in
Thrace.</span>Civilisation came to the Thracian tribes, as to the
Illyrian, from two sides; that of the Hellenes from the
coast and from the Macedonian frontier, the Latin from
the Dalmatian and Pannonian frontier. Of the former it
will be more appropriate to treat when we attempt to
describe the position of the European Greeks under the
imperial rule; here it suffices generally to bring out the
fact that not merely did that rule protect the Greek
element, where it found it, and the whole coast, even that
subject to the governor of Moesia, always remained Greek;
but that the province of Thrace, whose civilisation was
begun in earnest only by Trajan, and was throughout a
work of the imperial period, was not guided into a Roman
path, but became Hellenised. Even the northern slopes
of the Haemus, although administratively belonging to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Moesia, were comprehended in this Hellenising; Nicopolis
on the Jantra and Marcianopolis, not far from Varna, both
foundations of Trajan, were organised after a Greek
model.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">And in
Moesia.</span>Of the Latin civilisation of Moesia the same holds
true as of that of the adjoining Dalmatian and Pannonian
interior; only, as was natural, it emerges so
much the later, weaker, and more impure, the farther
remote it is from its starting&ndash;point. It followed predominantly
here the encampments of the legions, and with
these advanced eastward, starting from the probably
oldest camps of Moesia at Singidunum &#40;Belgrade&#41; and
Viminacium &#40;Kostolatz&#41;.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> It is true that, in keeping with
the character of its armed apostles, it kept at a very low
stage in upper Moesia, and left room enough for the play
of the primitive conditions. Viminacium obtained Italian
urban rights from Hadrian. Lower Moesia, between the
Balkan and the Danube, in the earlier imperial period,
remained probably throughout in the condition which the
Romans found subsisting there; not till the legion&ndash;camps
on the lower Danube were founded at Novae, Durostorum,
and Troesmis, which, as will be set forth further on &#40;<a href="#Page_227">p.&nbsp;227</a>&#41;, probably did not take place till the beginning of
the second century, did this part of the right bank of the
Danube become a seat of so much Italian civilisation as was
compatible with camp&ndash;arrangements. Thenceforth civil
settlements arose here too&mdash;particularly on the Danube<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
itself, between the great standing camps, the towns constituted
after the Italian model, Ratiaria, not far from
Widin, and Oescus at the confluence of the Iskra with the
Danube&mdash;and gradually the region approached the level
of the Roman culture then subsisting, though of itself on
its decline. In the construction of highways in lower
Moesia the rulers displayed manifold activity after the
time of Hadrian, from whom the oldest milestones hitherto
found there date.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Hermunduri.</span>If we turn from the survey of the Roman rule, as it
took shape from Augustus onward in the lands on the
right bank of the Danube, to the relations and the inhabitants
of the left, what we should have to remark as to
the most westerly region has already in the main been said
in the description of upper Germany; and in particular it
has been noticed &#40;<a href="#Page_158">p.&nbsp;158</a>&#41; that the Germans next adjoining
Raetia, the Hermunduri, were of all the neighbours of the
Romans the most peaceful, and, so far as is known to us,
never fell into conflict with them.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Marcomani.</span>We have already stated that the people of the Marcomani,
or, as Romans usually term them in earlier
times, the Suebi, after it had in the Augustan age found
new settlements in the old land of the Boii, the modern
Bohemia, and had acquired through king Maroboduus a
more fixed political organisation, remained indeed an onlooker
during the Romano&ndash;German wars, but was preserved
through the intervention of the Rhenish Germans
from the threatened Roman invasion. We have also pointed
out that, indirectly, the renewed abandonment of the Roman
offensive on the Rhine overthrew this too neutral state.
The position of paramount power, which the Marcomani
under Maroboduus had gained over the more remote
peoples in the region of the Elbe, was thereby lost; and
the king himself died as an exile on Roman soil &#40;<a href="#Page_61">p.&nbsp;61</a>&#41;.
The Marcomani and their eastern neighbours of kindred
stock, the Quadi in Moravia, fell under Roman clientship,
in so far as in their case, nearly as in that of Armenia,
the pretenders contending for the mastery leaned in
part for support on the Romans, and these claimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
and according to circumstances also exercised, the
right of investiture. The prince of the Cotones, Catualda,
who had in the first instance overthrown Maroboduus,
could not maintain himself long as his successor,
especially as Vibilius king of the neighbouring Hermunduri
took part against him; he too had to pass over into
Roman territory, and like Maroboduus to invoke the
imperial favour.<span class="sidenote">Vannius.</span>Tiberius then induced a Quadian of rank
Vannius to take his place; for the numerous train of the
two banished kings, which was not allowed to remain on
the right bank of the Danube, Tiberius procured settlements
on the left in the March valley,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> and procured for
Vannius recognition on the part of the Hermunduri friendly
with Rome. After a thirty years&#8217; rule the latter was overthrown
in the year 50 by his two nephews Vangio and
Sido, who revolted against him, and gained for themselves
the neighbouring peoples, the Hermunduri in Franconia,
the Lugii in Silesia. The Roman government, which
Vannius solicited for support, remained true to the policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
of Tiberius; it granted to the overthrown king the right
of asylum, but did not interfere, especially as the successors,
who shared the territory between them, readily acknowledged
the Roman supremacy. The new prince of the
Suebi, Sido, and his co&ndash;ruler Italicus, perhaps the successor
of Vangio, fought in the battle, which decided between
Vitellius and Vespasian, with the Roman army of the
Danube on the side of the Flavians. In the great crises
of the Roman rule on the Danube under Domitian and
Marcus we shall again meet their successors. The Suebi
of the Danube did not belong to the Roman empire;
coins probably struck by them show doubtless Latin inscriptions,
but not the Roman standard, to say nothing of
the image of the emperor; taxes proper and levies for
Rome did not here take place. But, in the first century
particularly, the Suebian state in Bohemia and Moravia
was included within the sphere of Roman power; and, as
was already observed, this was not without its influence
on the stationing of the Roman frontier&ndash;guard.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Jazyges.</span>In the plain between the Danube and Theiss eastward
from the Roman Pannonia, and between this and the
Thracian Daci, there was inserted a section of the people&mdash;probably
belonging to the Medo&ndash;Persian stock&mdash;the Sarmatae,
who living nomadically as a nation of shepherds
and horsemen filled in great part the wide east&ndash;European
plain; these were the Jazyges, named the &#8220;emigrants&#8221;
&#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετανάσται</span>&#41; in distinction from the chief stock which
remained behind on the Black Sea. The designation
shows that they only advanced at a comparatively late
period into these regions; perhaps their immigration falls
to be included among the assaults, under which about the
time of the battle of Actium the Dacian kingdom of Burebista
broke down &#40;<a href="#Page_11">p.&nbsp;11</a>&#41;. They meet us here at first under
the emperor Claudius; the Jazyges supplied the Suebian
king Vannius with the cavalry for his wars. The Roman
government was on its guard against the alert and predatory
bands of horsemen, but did not otherwise sustain
hostile relations to them. When the legions of the Danube
marched to Italy in the year 70 to place Vespasian on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
throne, they declined the contingent of cavalry offered by
the Jazyges, and in fitter fashion carried with them only a
number of the men of chief rank, in order that these should
meanwhile be pledges for quiet on the denuded frontier.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Daci.</span>More serious and continuous watch was needed farther
down on the lower Danube. There, beyond the mighty
stream, which was now the boundary of the empire,
were settled in the plains of Wallachia and the modern
Transylvania the Daci; in the eastern flat country, in
Moldavia, Bessarabia, and onward, in the first instance, the
Germanic Bastarnae, and then Sarmatian tribes, such as
the Roxolani, a people of horsemen like the Jazyges, at
first between the Dnieper and Don &#40;iii.&nbsp;295&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;281.</span>, then advancing
along the sea&ndash;shore. In the first years of Tiberius the
vassal prince of Thrace strengthened his troops to ward off
the Bastarnae and Scythians; in the latter years of Tiberius
it was urged among other proofs of his government more
and more neglecting everything, that he suffered the inroads
of the Dacians and the Sarmatae to pass unpunished.
How matters went on in the last years of Nero on either
side of the mouths of the Danube is approximately shown
by the accidentally preserved report of the governor of
Moesia at that time, Tiberius Plautius Silvanus Aelianus.
The latter &#8220;brought upwards of 100,000 men dwelling
beyond the Danube, with their wives and children, and their
princes or kings over the river, so that they became liable
to pay tribute. He suppressed a movement of the Sarmatae
before it came to an outbreak, although he had given
away a great part of his troops for the carrying on of war
in Armenia &#40;to Corbulo&#41;. A number of kings hitherto unknown
or at feud with the Romans he brought over to the
Roman bank, and compelled them to prostrate themselves
before the Roman standards. To the kings of the Bastarnae
and Roxolani he sent back their sons, who had been
made captive or recovered from the enemy, to those of the
Dacians their captive brothers,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> and took hostages from
several of them. Thereby the state of peace for the province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
was confirmed as well as further extended. He induced
also the king of the Scythians to desist from the siege
of the town Chersonesus &#40;Sebastopol&#41; beyond the Borysthenes.
He was the first who, by great consignments of
corn from this province, made bread cheaper in Rome.&#8221;
We perceive here clearly as well the agitated vortex of
peoples on the left bank of the Danube under the Julio&ndash;Claudian
dynasty, as also the strong arm of the imperial
power, which even beyond the stream sought to protect
the Greek towns on the Dnieper and in the Crimea, and
was able also in some measure to do so, as will be further
set forth when we describe the state of Greek affairs.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Inadequacy
of
Roman
forces.</span>The forces, however, which Rome had here at her disposal,
were more than inadequate. The insignificant garrison
of Asia Minor, and the fleet, likewise small on the
Black Sea, were of account at most for the Greek inhabitants
of its northern and western coasts. A very difficult
task was assigned to the governor of Moesia, who with his
two legions had to protect the bank of the Danube from
Belgrade to the mouth; and the aid of the far from
obedient Thracians was under the circumstances an additional
danger. Especially towards the mouth of the
Danube there was wanting a sufficient bulwark against
the barbarians now pressing on with increasing weight.
The withdrawal on two occasions of the Danubian legions to
Italy in the troubles after Nero&#8217;s death provoked still more
at the mouth of the Danube, than on the lower Rhine,
incursions of the neighbouring peoples, at first of the
Roxolani, then of the Dacians, then of the Sarmatae, that
is, probably the Jazyges. There were severe conflicts; in
one of these engagements, apparently with the Jazyges,
the brave governor of Moesia, Gaius Fonteius Agrippa,
fell. Nevertheless, Vespasian did not proceed to increase
the army of the Danube;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> the necessity of strengthening
the Asiatic garrisons must have appeared still more urgent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
and the economy specially enjoined at that time forbade
any increase of the army as a whole. He contented himself
with pushing forward the great camps of the army of
the Danube to the frontier of the empire, as the pacification
of the interior allowed, and the relations subsisting at
the frontier, as well as the breaking up of the Thracian
troops brought about by the annexation of Thrace, imperatively
required. Thus the Pannonian camps were brought
away from the Drave, opposite to the Suebian kingdom, to

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Dacian war
of Domitian.</span>A shifting of the proportions of power to the disadvantage
of Rome set in under Domitian,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> or rather the
consequences of the insufficient frontier&ndash;defence were then
reaped. According to the little we know of the matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
the change of affairs hinged, quite like the similar one in
Caesar&#8217;s time, upon a single Dacian man; what king
Burebista had planned, king Decebalus seemed destined
to execute.<span class="sidenote">Decebalus.</span>How much the real moving&ndash;spring lay in
his personality, is shown by the story that the Dacian
king Duras, in order to bring the right man into the
right place, retired from his office in favour of Decebalus.
That Decebalus first of all organised in order to strike,
is shown by the reports as to his introduction of Roman
discipline into the Dacian army, and his enlisting people
of capacity among the Romans themselves, and even by
the condition proposed by him to the Romans after the
victory, that they should send him the necessary workmen
to instruct his people in the arts of peace as of war.
On what a great scale he set to work is shown by the
connections which he formed, westward and eastward, with
the Suebi and the Jazyges, and even with the Parthians.
The assailants were the Dacians. The governor of the
province of Moesia, who first went to oppose them, Oppius
Sabinus, lost his life on the field of battle. A number of
smaller camps were conquered; the larger were threatened,
the possession of the province itself was at stake. Domitian
in person resorted to the army, and his representative&mdash;he
himself was no general and remained in the
background&mdash;the commandant of the guard, Cornelius
Fuscus, led the army over the Danube; but he paid for
the incautious proceeding by a severe defeat, and he too,
the second in supreme command, fell before the enemy.
His successor, Julianus, a capable officer, defeated the
Dacians in their own territory in a great battle near
Tapae, and was on the way to achieve lasting results.
But, while the struggle with the Dacians was in suspense,
Domitian had threatened the Suebi and Jazyges with
war, because they had omitted to send to him a contingent
against the former; the messengers, who came to excuse
this, he caused to be executed.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> Here too misfortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
pursued the Roman arms. The Marcomani achieved a
victory over the emperor himself; a whole legion was
surrounded by the Jazyges and cut down. Shaken by
this defeat, Domitian, in spite of the advantages gained
by Julianus over the Dacians, hastily concluded with these
a peace, which did not indeed prevent him from conferring
the crown upon the representative of Decebalus in
Rome, Diegis, just as if the latter were a vassal of the
Romans, or from marching as victor to the Capitol, but
which in reality was equivalent to a capitulation. What
Decebalus, on the advance of the Roman army into Dacia,
had scoffingly offered&mdash;to dismiss to his home uninjured
every man for whom a yearly payment of two asses was
promised to him&mdash;became almost true: in the peace the
incursions into Moesia were bought off with a fixed sum
to be paid yearly.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Dacian war
of Trajan.</span>Here a change had to be effected. Domitian, who
was doubtless a good administrator of the empire, but
obtuse to the demands of military honour, was followed
after the short reign of Nerva by the emperor Trajan,
who, first and above all a soldier, not merely tore in
pieces that agreement, but also took measures that similar
things should not recur. The war against the Suebi and
Sarmatae, which was still being continued at Domitian&#8217;s
death &#40;96&#41;, was happily ended, as it would seem, under
Nerva in the year 97. The new emperor went, even
before he held his entrance into the capital of the empire,
from the Rhine to the Danube, where he stayed in the
winter 98&ndash;99, but not to attack the Dacians at once, but
to prepare for the war: to this time belongs the construction&mdash;joining
itself on to the roads formed in upper
Germany&mdash;of the road completed on the right bank of
the Danube in the region of Orsova in the year 100
&#40;<a href="#Page_153">p.&nbsp;153</a>&#41;. For the war against the Dacians, in which, as
in all his campaigns, he commanded in person, he did not
set out till the spring of 101. He crossed the Danube
below Viminacium, and advanced against the not far
distant capital of the king, Sarmizegetusa. Decebalus
with his allies&mdash;the Buri and other tribes dwelling to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
northward took part in this struggle&mdash;offered resolute
resistance, and it was only by vehement and bloody conflicts
that the Romans cleared their way; the number of
the wounded was so great that the emperor put his own
wardrobe at the disposal of the physicians. But victory
did not waver; one stronghold after another fell; the
sisters of the king, the captives from the former war, the
standards taken from the armies of Domitian, fell into
the hands of the Romans; for the king, intercepted by
Trajan himself and by the brave Lusius Quietus, nothing
was left but complete surrender &#40;102&#41;. Trajan demanded
nothing less than the renunciation of the sovereign power
and the entrance of the Dacian kingdom into the clientship
of Rome. The deserters, the arms, the engines of
war, the workmen once supplied for these by Rome, had to
be delivered up, and the king personally to kneel before
the victor; he divested himself of the right to make war
and peace, and promised military service; the fortresses
were either razed or delivered to the Romans, and in
these, above all in the capital, there remained a Roman
garrison. The strong bridge of stone, which Trajan
caused to be thrown over the Danube at Drobetae
&#40;opposite Turnu Severinului&#41;, secured the communication
even in the bad season of the year, and gave to the
Dacian garrisons a reserve&ndash;support in the near legions of
upper&ndash;Moesia.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Second
Dacian
war.</span>But the Dacian nation, and above all the king himself,
did not know the art of accommodating themselves
to dependence, as the kings of Cappadocia and Mauretania
had understood it; or rather they had merely taken upon
them the yoke in the hope of ridding themselves of it
again on the first opportunity. The signs of this were
soon apparent. A portion of the arms to be delivered
up was kept back; the fortresses were not given over
as had been stipulated; an asylum was still granted,
moreover, to Roman deserters; portions of territory
were wrested from the Jazyges at enmity with the Dacians,
or perhaps the occurrence of violations of the frontier
on their part was not taken patiently; a lively and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
suspicious intercourse was maintained with the more remote
natives still free. Trajan could not but be convinced
that his work was but half done; and, rapid in
resolution as he was, he, without entering upon further
negotiations, declared war once more against the king
three years after the conclusion of peace &#40;105&#41;. Gladly
would the latter have avoided it; but the demand that
he should give himself a captive spoke too clearly. Nothing
was left but a struggle of despair, and all were not
ready for this; a great part of the Dacians submitted
without resistance. The appeal to the neighbouring
peoples to enter jointly into measures for warding off
the danger that threatened even their freedom and their
national existence sounded without effect; Decebalus
and the Dacians that remained faithful to him stood alone
in this war. The attempts to make away with the
imperial general by means of deserters, or to purchase
tolerable terms by the release of a high officer taken
prisoner, likewise broke down. The emperor marched
once more as victor into the enemy&#8217;s capital, and Decebalus,
who up to the last moment had struggled with fate,
put himself to death when all was lost &#40;107&#41;. This time
Trajan made an end; the war concerned no longer the
freedom of the people, but its very existence. The native
population were driven out from the best part of the land,
and these districts were reoccupied with a non&ndash;national
population brought in from the mountains of Dalmatia,
for the mines, and otherwise preponderantly, as it would
appear, from Asia Minor. In several regions, no doubt,
the old population yet remained, and even the language
of the country maintained its ground.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> These Dacians,
as well as the sections dwelling beyond the bounds, still
gave trouble to the Romans&mdash;subsequently, for example,
under Commodus and Maximinus; but they stood
isolated, and dwindled away. The danger with which
the vigorous Thracian race had several times threatened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
the Roman rule could not be allowed to recur, and this
end Trajan attained. The Rome of Trajan was no longer
that of the age of Hannibal; but it was still dangerous
to have conquered the Romans.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Trajan&#8217;s
column.</span>The stately column which six years afterwards was
erected to the emperor by the imperial senate in the new
Forum Trajanum of the capital, and which still adorns it
at the present day, is an evidence, to which we possess
nothing parallel, of the extent to which the traditional
history of the Roman imperial period has suffered havoc.
Throughout its height of exactly one hundred Roman feet
it is covered with separate representations to the number
of one hundred and twenty&ndash;four&mdash;a chiselled picture&ndash;book
of the Dacian wars, to which almost everywhere we lack
the text. We see the watch&ndash;towers of the Romans with
their pointed roofs, their palisaded court, their upper
gallery, their fire&ndash;signals; the town on the bank of the
Danube&ndash;stream, whose river&ndash;god looks on at the Roman
warriors, as they march under their standards along the
bridge of boats; the emperor himself in his council of
war, and then sacrificing at the altar before the walls of
the camp. It is narrated that the Buri allied with the
Dacians dissuaded Trajan from the war in a Latin sentence
written on a huge mushroom; we fancy that we recognise
this mushroom placed as a load on a sumpter&ndash;animal,
jumping from which a barbarian, lying on the ground
with his club, points out the mushroom with his finger to
the advancing emperor. We see the pitching of the
camp, the felling of trees, the fetching of water, the laying
of the bridge. The first captive Dacians, easily recognisable
by their long&ndash;sleeved frocks and their wide trousers, with
their hands bound behind their back, and with their long
bushy hair grasped by the soldiers, are brought before the
emperor. We see the combats, the men hurling spears,
the slingers, the sickle&ndash;bearers, the archers on foot, the
heavy&ndash;mailed horsemen also bearing the bow, the dragon&ndash;banners
of the Dacians, the officers of the enemy adorned
with the round cap as the token of their rank, the pine&ndash;wood,
into which the Dacians carry their wounded, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
cut&ndash;off heads of the barbarians deposited before the
emperor. We see the Dacian village on piles in the
middle of the lake, against the round huts of which, with
their pointed roof, the burning torches are flying. Women
and children sue the emperor for mercy. The wounded
are cared for and bound up; badges of honour are distributed
to officers and soldiers. Then the conflict proceeds;
the hostile entrenchments, partly of wood, partly stone
walls, are assailed; the besieging&ndash;train advances, the
ladders are brought up, the storming&ndash;column makes
its assault under cover of the <em>testudo</em>. Lastly, the king
with his train lies at the feet of Trajan; the dragon&ndash;banners
are in the hands of the Romans; the troops in
exultation salute the emperor; Victoria stands before the
piled&ndash;up arms of the enemy and inscribes the slab recording
the victory. Then follow the pictures of the second
war, of similar character on the whole to those of the first
series. Worthy of notice is one great representation, which,
after the king&#8217;s stronghold has been burnt, appears to
show the princes of the Dacians sitting round a kettle
and, one after the other, emptying the poison&ndash;cup;
another, where the head of the brave Dacian king is
brought on a tray to the emperor; and lastly, the closing
picture, the long series of the conquered with their
women, children, and flocks marching away from their
home. The emperor himself wrote the history of this
war&mdash;as Frederick the Great wrote that of the Seven
Years&#8217; War&mdash;and many others after him; all this is
lost to us, and as nobody would venture to invent the
history of the Seven Years&#8217; War from Menzel&#8217;s pictures,
there is left to us only, along with a glimpse into half
intelligible details, the painful feeling of a stirring and
great historical catastrophe faded for ever and lost even
to remembrance.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Military
position on
the Danube
after
Trajan.</span>The defence of the frontier in the region of the
Danube was not shifted to such a degree, as might well
be expected, in consequence of the conversion of Dacia
into a Roman province; a change, in the strict sense, of
the line of defence did not take place, but the new province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
was treated on the whole as an eccentric position, which
was only connected directly with the Roman territory
towards the south along the Danube itself, on the other three
sides projected into the barbarian land. The plain of the
Theiss, stretching between Pannonia and Dacia continued
in the hands of the Jazyges; there have been found
remains of old walls, which led from the Danube over the
Theiss away to the Dacian mountains, and bounded the
region of the Jazyges to the north, but of the time and
the authors of these entrenchments nothing certain is
known. Bessarabia also is intersected by a double
barrier&ndash;line which, running from the Pruth to the Dniester,
ends at Tyra, and&mdash;according to the inadequate reports
hitherto before us on the subject&mdash;appears to proceed from
the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> If this was the case, then Moldavia and
the south half of Bessarabia as well as the whole of
Wallachia were incorporated in the Roman empire. But,
though this may have been done nominally, the Roman
rule hardly extended effectively to these lands; at least
there is, up to the present time, an utter absence of sure
proofs of Roman settlement either in eastern Wallachia
or in Moldavia and Bessarabia. At any rate, the Danube
here remained, much more than the Rhine in Germany,
the limit of Roman civilisation and the proper basis of
frontier&ndash;defence. The positions on it were considerably
reinforced. It was a fortunate circumstance for Rome
that, while the surge of peoples rose on the Danube, it
sank on the Rhine, and the troops that could be there
dispensed with were disposable elsewhere.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Commands
increased to
five.</span>Although under Vespasian probably not more than
six legions were stationed on the Danube, their number
was subsequently raised by Domitian and Trajan to ten;
the two chief commands of Moesia and Pannonia hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
subsisting were withal divided, the first under Domitian,
the second under Trajan, and, as the Dacian was super&ndash;added,
the whole number of the commanderships on the
lower Danube was fixed at five. At the outset, indeed,
they seem to have cut off the corner which this stream forms
below Durostorum &#40;Silistria&#41;&mdash;the modern Dobrudscha&mdash;and
from the place now called Rassowa, where the river
approaches within thirty miles of the sea, in order then
to bend almost at a right angle to the north, to have
substituted for the river&ndash;line a fortified road after the
manner of the British &#40;<a href="#Page_187">p.&nbsp;187</a>&#41;, which reached the coast
at Tomis.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> This corner, however, was, at least from the
time of Hadrian, embraced within the Roman frontier&ndash;fortification;
for from that time we find lower Moesia,
which before Trajan had probably possessed no larger
standing garrisons at all, furnished with the three legionary
camps of Novae &#40;near Svischtova&#41;, Durostorum &#40;Silistria&#41;,
and Troesmis &#40;Iglitza, near Galatz&#41;, of which the last lies
in front of that very angle of the Danube. Against the
Jazyges the position was strengthened by adding to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
upper Moesian camps at Singidunum and Viminacium
the lower Pannonian at the confluence of the Theiss with
the Danube near Acumincum. Dacia itself was then but
weakly garrisoned. The capital, now a colony of Trajan,
Sarmizegetusa, lay not far from the chief crossings over
the Danube in upper Moesia; here and on the middle
Marisus, as well as beyond it in the districts of the gold
mines, the Romans chiefly settled; the one legion serving
as garrison since Trajan&#8217;s time in Dacia obtained its
headquarters, at least soon afterwards, in this region at
Apulum &#40;Karlsburg&#41;. Farther to the north Potaissa
&#40;Thorda&#41; and Napoca &#40;Klausenburg&#41; were probably also
at once taken possession of by the Romans, but it was
only gradually that the great Pannono&ndash;Dacian military
centres pushed farther towards the north. The transference
of the lower Pannonian legion from Acumincum to
Aquincum, the modern Buda, and the occupation of this
commanding military position, fall not later than Hadrian,
and probably under him; probably at the same time one
of the upper Pannonian legions came to Brigetio &#40;opposite
to Comorn&#41;. Under Commodus all settlement was
prohibited along the northern frontier of Dacia for a
breadth of nearly five miles, which must stand connected
with the frontier regulations to be subsequently
mentioned after the Marcomanian war. At that time also
the fortified lines may have originated, which barred this
frontier similarly to the upper Germanic. Under Severus
one of the legions previously in lower Moesia was brought
to Potaissa &#40;Thorda&#41; on the Dacian north frontier.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Dacia an
advanced
position.</span>But even after these transferences Dacia remained an
advanced position on the left bank, covered by mountains
and defences, with reference to which it might well be
doubtful whether it did more to promote or to impede
the general defensive attitude of the Romans. Hadrian,
in fact, had thought of giving up this territory, and so
regarded its incorporation as a mistake; after the step
had once been taken, there certainly preponderated the
consideration, if not of the lucrative gold mines of the
country, at any rate of the Roman civilisation rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
developing itself in the region of the Marisus. But he
caused at least the superstructure of the stone bridge of
the Danube to be removed, as his apprehension of its
being used by the enemy outweighed his consideration
for the Dacian garrison. The later period released itself
from this anxiety; but the eccentric position of Dacia in
relation to the rest of the frontier&ndash;defence remained.</p>

<p>The sixty years after the Dacian wars of Trajan were
for the Danube lands a time of peace and of peaceful
development. No doubt there was never entire quiet,
particularly at the mouths of the Danube, and even the
hazardous expedient of purchasing the security of the
frontier from the adjoining restless neighbours, just as
was done with Decebalus, by the bestowal of yearly
gratuities was further employed;<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> yet the remains of
antiquity show at this very time everywhere the flourishing
of urban life, and not a few communities, particularly
of Pannonia, name as their founder Hadrian or Pius. But
upon this stillness followed a storm such as the empire
had not yet sustained, and which, although properly but
a frontier&ndash;war, by its extension over a series of provinces
and by its duration for thirteen years shook the empire
itself.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Marcomanian
war.</span>The war named after the Marcomani was not kindled
by any single personage of the type of Hannibal or
Decebalus. As little did aggressions on the part of the
Romans provoke this war; the emperor Pius injured no
neighbour, either powerful or humble, and set on peace
almost more than its just value. The realm of Maroboduus
and of Vannius had thereafter, perhaps in
consequence of the partition under Vangio and Sido
&#40;<a href="#Page_216">p.&nbsp;216</a>&#41;, become divided into the kingdom of the Marcomani
in what is now Bohemia and that of the Quadi
in Moravia and upper Hungary. Conflicts with the
Romans do not appear to have occurred here; the vassal&ndash;relation
of the princes of the Quadi was even formally
recognised under the reign of Pius by the confirmation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
asked for. Shiftings of peoples, which lay beyond the
Roman horizon, were the proximate cause of the great
war. Soon after the death of Pius &#40;&#8224; 161&#41; masses of
Germans, especially Langobardi from the Elbe, but also
Marcomani and other bodies of men, appeared in Pannonia,
apparently to gain new abodes on the right bank.
Pressed hard by the Roman troops who were despatched
against them, they sent the prince of the Marcomani,
Ballomarius, and with him a representative of each of
the ten tribes taking part, to renew their request for
assignation of land. But the governor abode by his
decision and compelled them to go back over the Danube.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Its beginning.</span>This was the beginning of the great Danubian war.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>
The governor of upper Germany, Gaius Aufidius Victorinus,
the father&ndash;in&ndash;law of Fronto known in literature, had
already, about the year 162, to repel an assault of the
Chatti, which likewise may have been occasioned by tribes
from the Elbe pressing on their rear. Had equally
energetic steps been taken, greater mischief might have
been averted. But just then the Armenian war had
begun, into which the Parthians soon entered; though
the troops were not actually sent away from the threatened
frontier to the east, for which there is at least no evidence,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a>
there was at any rate a want of men to take up the
second war at once with energy. This temporising
severely avenged itself. Just when people were triumphing
in Rome over the kings of the east, on the Danube
the Chatti, the Marcomani, the Quadi, the Jazyges burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
as with a thunderclap into the Roman territory. Raetia,
Noricum, the two Pannonias, Dacia, were inundated at
the same moment; in the Dacian mine&ndash;district we can
still follow the traces of this irruption. What devastations
they then wrought in those regions, which for long had
seen no enemy, is shown by the fact that several years
afterwards the Quadi gave back first 13,000, then 50,000,
and the Jazyges even 100,000 Roman captives. Nor
did the matter end with the injury done to the provinces.
<span class="sidenote">Invasion of
Italy.</span> There happened what had not occurred for three hundred
years and begun to be accounted as impossible&mdash;the
barbarians broke through the wall of the Alps and invaded
Italy itself; from Raetia they destroyed Opitergium
&#40;Oderzo&#41;; bands from the Julian Alps invested Aquileia.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>
Defeats of individual Roman divisions must have taken
place in various cases; we learn only that one of the
commandants of the guard, Victorinus, fell before the
enemy, and the ranks of the Roman armies were sorely
thinned.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Pestilence.</span>This grave attack befell the state at a most unhappy
moment. No doubt the Oriental war was ended; but in
its train a pestilence had spread throughout Italy and the
west, which swept men away more continuously than the
war, and in more fearful measure. When the troops were
concentrated, as was necessary, the victims of the pestilence
were all the more numerous. As dearth always
accompanies pestilence, so on this occasion there appeared
with it failure of crops and famine, and severe financial
distress; the taxes did not come in, and in the course
of the war the emperor saw himself under the necessity
of alienating by public auction the jewels of his palace.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Verus and
Marcus.</span>There was lack of a fitting leader. A military and
political task so extensive and so complicated could, as
things stood in Rome, be undertaken by no commissioned
general, but only by the ruler himself. Marcus had, with
a correct and modest knowledge of his shortcomings, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
ascending the throne, placed by his side with equal rights
his younger adopted brother Lucius Verus, on the benevolent
assumption that the jovial young man&mdash;as he was
a vigorous fencer and hunter&mdash;would also grow into an
able general. But the worthy emperor did not possess
the sharp glance of one who knows men; the choice had
proved as unfortunate as possible; the Parthian war just
ended had shown the nominal general to be personally
dissolute, and as an officer incapable. The joint regency of
Verus was nothing but an additional calamity, which indeed
was obviated by his death, that ensued not long after the
outbreak of the Marcomanian war &#40;169&#41;. Marcus, by his
leanings more reflective than inclined to practical life,
and not at all a soldier, nor in general a strong personality,
undertook the exclusive and personal conduct of
the requisite operations. He may, in doing so, have made
mistakes enough in detail, and perhaps the long duration
of the struggle is partly traceable to this; but the unity
of supreme command, his clear insight into the object for
which the war was waged, the tenacity of his statesmanly
action, above all the rectitude and firmness of the man
administering his difficult office with self&ndash;forgetful faithfulness,
ultimately broke the dangerous assault. This
was a merit all the higher, as the success was due more
to character than to talent.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Progress of
the war.</span>The character of the task set before the Romans is
shown by the fact that the government, despite the want
of men and money in the first year of this war, had the
walls of the capital of Dalmatia, Salonae, and of the
capital of Thrace, Philippopolis, restored by its soldiers
and at its expense; certainly these were not isolated
arrangements. They had to prepare themselves to see the
men of the north everywhere investing the great towns
of the empire; the terrors of the Gothic expeditions were
already knocking at the gates, and were perhaps for this
time averted only by the fact that government saw them
coming. The immediate superintendence of the military
operations, and the regulation, demanded by the state of the
case, of the relations to the frontier&ndash;peoples and reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
of the existing arrangements on the spot, might neither
be omitted nor left to his unprincipled brother or individual
leaders. In fact, the position of matters was
changed as soon as the two emperors arrived at Aquileia,
in order to set out thence with the army to the scene of
war. The Germans and Sarmatians, far from united in
themselves, and without common leading, felt themselves
unequal to such a counter&ndash;blow. The masses of invaders
everywhere retreated; the Quadi sent in their submission
to the imperial generals, and in many cases the leaders of
the movement directed against the Romans paid for this
reaction with their lives. Lucius thought that the war
had demanded victims enough, and advised a return to
Rome; but the Marcomani persevered in haughty resistance,
and the calamity which had come upon Rome, the
hundred thousands of captives dragged away, the successes
achieved by the barbarians, imperatively demanded a more
vigorous policy and the offensive continuance of the war.
The son&ndash;in&ndash;law of Marcus, Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus,
as an extraordinary measure took the command in Raetia
and Noricum; his able lieutenant, the subsequent emperor,
Publius Helvius Pertinax, cleared the Roman territory
without difficulty with the first auxiliary legion called up
from Pannonia. In spite of the financial distress two new
legions were formed, particularly from Illyrian soldiers, in
the raising of which no doubt many a previous highway&ndash;robber
was made a defender of his country; and, as was
already stated &#40;pp. <a href="#Page_161">161</a>, <a href="#Page_198">198</a>&#41;, the hitherto slight frontier&ndash;guard
of these two provinces was reinforced by the new
legion&ndash;camps of Ratisbon and Enns. The emperors themselves
went to the upper Pannonian camps. It was above
all of consequence to restrict the area within which the
fire of war was raging. The barbarians coming from
the north, who offered their aid, were not repelled, and
fought in Roman pay, so far as they did not&mdash;as also
occurred&mdash;break their word and make common cause with
the enemy. The Quadi, who sued for peace and for the
confirmation of the new king Furtius, had the latter readily
granted to them, and nothing demanded of them but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
giving back of the deserters and the captives. Success in
some measure attended the attempt to restrict the war to
the two chief opponents, the Marcomani and the Jazyges
from of old allied with them. Against these two peoples
it was carried on in the following years with severe conflicts
and not without defeat. We know only isolated
details, which do not admit of being brought into set
connection. Marcus Claudius Fronto, to whom had been
entrusted the commands of upper Moesia and Dacia
united as an extraordinary measure, fell about the year
171 in conflict against Germans and Jazyges. The commandant
of the guard, Marcus Macrinius Vindex, likewise
fell before the enemy. They and other officers of high
rank obtained in these years honorary monuments in Rome
at the column of Trajan, because they had met death in
defence of their fatherland. The barbaric tribes, who had
declared for Rome, again partially fell away&mdash;such as the
Cotini and above all the Quadi, who granted an asylum
to the fugitive Marcomani and drove out their vassal&ndash;king
Furtius, whereupon the emperor Marcus set a price
of 1000 gold pieces on the head of his successor Ariogaesus.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Its issue;
and second
war.</span>Not till the sixth year of the war &#40;172&#41; does the
complete conquest of the Marcomani seem to have been
achieved, and Marcus to have thereupon assumed the
well&ndash;deserved title of victory, Germanicus. Then followed
the overthrow of the Quadi; lastly in 175 that of the
Jazyges, in consequence of which the emperor received
the further surname of Conqueror of the Sarmatae.
The terms which were laid down for the conquered
tribes show that Marcus designed not to punish but to
subdue. The Marcomani and the Jazyges, probably also
the Quadi, were required to evacuate a border&ndash;strip along
the river to the breadth of ten, subsequently modified to
five, miles. In the strongholds on the right bank of
the Danube were placed Roman garrisons, which, among
the Marcomani and Quadi alone, amounted together to
not less than 20,000 men. All the subdued had to
furnish contingents to the Roman army; the Jazyges, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
example, 8000 horsemen. Had the emperor not been
recalled by the insurrection of Syria, he would have
driven the latter entirely from their country, as Trajan
drove the Dacians. That Marcus intended to treat the
revolted Transdanubians after this model, was confirmed
by the further course of events. Hardly was that hindrance
removed, when the emperor went back to the
Danube and began, just like Trajan, in 178 the second
definitive war. The ground put forward for thus declaring
war is not known; the aim is doubtless correctly specified
to the effect that he purposed to erect two new provinces,
Marcomania and Sarmatia. To the Jazyges, who must have
shown themselves submissive to the designs of the emperor,
their burdensome imposts were for the most part
remitted, and, in fact, for intercourse with their kinsmen
dwelling to the east of Dacia the Roxolani, right of
passage through Dacia was granted to them under fitting
supervision&mdash;probably just because they were already
regarded as Roman subjects. The Marcomani were
almost extirpated by sword and famine. The Quadi in
despair wished to migrate to the north, and to seek settlements
among the Semnones; but even this was not
allowed to them, as they had to cultivate the fields in
order to provide for the Roman garrisons. After fourteen
years of almost uninterrupted warfare, he who was a
warrior&ndash;prince against his will reached his goal, and the
Romans were a second time face to face with the acquisition
of the upper Elbe; now, in fact, all that was wanting
was the announcement of the wish to retain what was
won. Thereupon he died&mdash;not yet sixty years of age&mdash;in
the camp of Vindobona on 17th March 180.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Results of
the Marcomanian
war.</span>We must not merely acknowledge the resoluteness
and tenacity of the ruler, but must also admit that he did
what right policy enjoined. The conquest of Dacia by
Trajan was a doubtful gain, although in this very Marcomanian
war the possession of Dacia not only removed
a dangerous element from the ranks of the antagonists of
Rome, but probably also had the effect of preventing the
host of peoples on the lower Danube, the Bastarnae, Roxolani,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
and others, from interfering in the war. But after
the mighty onset of the Transdanubians to the west of
Dacia had made their subjugation a necessity, this could
only be accomplished in a definitive way by embracing
Bohemia, Moravia, and the plain of the Theiss within the
Roman line of defence, although these regions were probably
accounted, like Dacia, as having only the position
of advanced posts, and the strategical frontier&ndash;line was
certainly meant to remain the Danube.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Conclusion
of peace by
Commodus.</span>The successor of Marcus, the emperor Commodus, was
present in the camp when his father died, and as he had
already for several years nominally shared the throne with
his father, he entered with the latter&#8217;s death at once into possession
of unlimited power. Only for a brief time did the
nineteen years&#8217; old successor allow the men who had enjoyed
his father&#8217;s confidence&mdash;his brother&ndash;in&ndash;law Pompeianus,
and others who had borne with Marcus the heavy
burden of the war&mdash;to rule in his spirit. Commodus was
in every respect the opposite of his father; not a scholar,
but a fencing&ndash;master; as cowardly and weak in character,
as his father was resolute and tenacious of purpose; as indolent
and forgetful of duty, as his father was active and
conscientious. He not merely gave up the idea of incorporating
the territory won, but voluntarily granted even to
the Marcomani conditions such as they had not ventured
to hope for. The regulation of the frontier&ndash;traffic under
Roman control, and the obligation not to injure their
neighbours friendly to the Romans, were matters of course;
but the garrisons were withdrawn from their country, and
there was retained only the prohibition of settlement on
the border&ndash;strip. The payment of taxes and the furnishing
of recruits were doubtless stipulated for, but the former
were soon remitted, and the latter were certainly not furnished.
A similar settlement was made with the Quadi;
and the other Transdanubians must have been similarly
dealt with. Thereby the conquests made were given up,
and the work of many years of warfare was in vain; if
no more was wished for, a similar arrangement of things
might have been reached much earlier. Nevertheless the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Marcomanian war secured in these regions the supremacy
of Rome for the sequel, in spite of the fact that Rome let
slip the prize of victory. It was not by the tribes that
had taken part in it that the blow was dealt, to which
the Roman world&ndash;power succumbed.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The
colonate.</span>Another permanent consequence of this war was connected
with the removals, to which it gave occasion, of the
Transdanubians over into the Roman empire. Of themselves
such changes of settlement had occurred at all
times; the Sugambri, transplanted under Augustus to
Gaul, the Dacians sent to Thrace, were nothing but new
subjects or communities of subjects added to those formerly
existing, and probably not much different were the
3000 Naristae, whom Marcus allowed to exchange their
settlements westward of Bohemia for such settlements
within the empire, while the like request was refused to the
otherwise unknown Astingi on the Dacian north frontier.
But the Germans settled by him not merely in the land
of the Danube, but in Italy itself at Ravenna, were neither
free subjects nor strictly non&ndash;free persons; these were the
beginnings of the Roman villanage, the colonate, the influence
of which on the agricultural economy of the whole
state is to be set forth in another connection. That
Ravennate settlement, however, had no permanence; the
men rose in revolt and had to be conveyed away, so that
the new colonate remained restricted primarily to the
provinces, particularly to the lands of the Danube.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The advancing
Northmen.</span>The great war on the middle Danube was once more
followed by sixty years&#8217; time of peace, the blessings of
which could not be completely neutralised by the internal
misgovernment that was constantly increasing during its
course. No doubt various isolated accounts show that the
frontier, especially the Dacian, which was most exposed,
remained not without trouble; but above all, the stern
military government of Severus did its duty here, and at
least Marcomani and Quadi appear even under his immediate
successors in unconditional dependence, so that
the son of Severus could cite a prince of the Quadi before
him and lay his head at his feet. The conflicts occurring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
at this epoch on the lower Danube were of subordinate
importance. But probably at this period a comprehensive
shifting of peoples from the north&ndash;east towards the Black
Sea took place, and the Roman frontier&ndash;guard on the
lower Danube had to confront new and more dangerous
opponents. Up to this time the antagonists of the
Romans there had been chiefly Sarmatian tribes, among
whom the Roxolani came into closest contact with them;
of Germans there were settled here at that time only the
Bastarnae, who had been long at home in this region.
Now the Roxolani disappear, merged possibly among the
Carpi apparently akin to them, who thenceforth were the
nearest neighbours of the Romans on the lower Danube,
perhaps in the valleys of the Seret and Pruth.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Goths.</span>By the side of the Carpi came, likewise as immediate
neighbours of the Romans at the mouth of the Danube,
the people of the Goths. This Germanic stock migrated,
according to the tradition which has been preserved to us,
from Scandinavia over the Baltic towards the region of the
Vistula, and from this to the Black Sea; in accordance
with this the Roman geographers of the second century
know them at the Vistula, and Roman history from the
first quarter of the third at the north&ndash;west coast of the
Black Sea. Thenceforth they appear here constantly on
the increase; the remains of the Bastarnae retired before
them to the right bank of the Danube under the emperor
Probus, the remains of the Carpi under the emperor Diocletian,
while beyond doubt a great part of the former as
of the latter mingled among the Goths and joined them.
On the whole this catastrophe may be designated as that
of the Gothic war only in the sense in which that which
set in under Marcus is called the war of the Marcomani;
the whole mass of peoples set in movement by the stream
of migration from the north&ndash;east to the Black Sea took
part in it; and took part all the more, seeing that these
attacks took place just as much by land over the lower
Danube as by water from the north coasts of the Black
Sea, in an inextricable complication of landward and
maritime piracy. Not unsuitably, therefore, the learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Athenian who fought in this war and has narrated it,
prefers to term it the Scythian, as he includes under this
name&mdash;which, like the Pelasgian, forms the despair of the
historian&mdash;all Germanic and non&ndash;Germanic enemies of
the empire. What is to be told of these expeditions will
here be brought together, so far as the confusion of tradition,
which is only too much in keeping with the confusion
of these fearful times, allows.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Gothic
wars.</span>The year 238&mdash;a year also of civil war, when there
were four emperors&mdash;is designated as that in which the
war against those here first named Goths began.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> As the
coins of Tyra and Olbia cease with Alexander &#40;&#8224; 235&#41;,
these Roman possessions situated beyond the boundary
of the empire had doubtless become some years earlier a
prey to the new enemy. In that year they first crossed
the Danube, and the most northerly of the Moesian coast
towns, Istros, was the first victim. Gordianus, who emerged
out of the confusions of this time as ruler, is designated
as conqueror of the Goths; it is more certain that the
Roman government at any rate under him, if not already
earlier, agreed to buy off the Gothic incursions.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> As was
natural, the Carpi demanded the same as the emperor
had granted to the inferior Goths; when the demand
was not granted, they invaded the Roman territory in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
year 245. The emperor Philippus&mdash;Gordianus was at that
time already dead&mdash;repulsed them, and energetic action
with the combined strength of the great empire would
probably here have checked the barbarians.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Decius.</span>But in these years the murderer of an emperor reached
the throne as surely as he found in turn his own murderer
and successor; it was just in the imperilled regions of the
Danube that the army proclaimed against the emperor
Philippus first Marinus Pacatianus, and, after he was set
aside, Traianus Decius, which latter in fact vanquished his
antagonist in Italy, and was acknowledged as ruler. He
was an able and brave man, not unworthy of the two names
which he bore, and entered, so soon as he could, resolutely
into the conflicts on the Danube; but what the civil war
waged in the meanwhile had destroyed, could no longer be
retrieved. While the Romans were fighting with one another
the Goths and the Carpi had united, and had under the
Gothic prince Cniva invaded Moesia denuded of troops.
The governor of the province, Trebonianus Gallus, threw
himself with his force into Nicopolis on the Haemus, and
was here besieged by the Goths; these at the same time
pillaged Thrace and besieged its capital, the great and
strong Philippopolis; indeed they reached as far as Macedonia,
and invested Thessalonica, where the governor
Priscus found this just a fitting moment to have himself
proclaimed as emperor. When Decius arrived to combat
at once his rival and the public foe, the former was doubtless
without difficulty set aside, and success also attended
the relief of Nicopolis, where 30,000 Goths are said to
have fallen. But the Goths, retreating to Thrace, conquered
in turn at Bero&#235; &#40;Alt&ndash;Zagora&#41;, threw the Romans
back on Moesia, and reduced Nicopolis there as well
as Anchialus in Thrace and even Philippopolis, where
100,000 men are said to have come into their power.
Thereupon they marched northwards to bring into safety
their enormous booty. Decius projected the plan of inflicting
a blow on the enemy at the crossing of the Danube.
He stationed a division under Gallus on the bank, and
hoped to be able to throw the Goths upon this, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
cut off their retreat. But at Abrittus, a place on the
Moesian frontier, the fortune of war, or else the treachery
of Gallus, decided against them.<span class="sidenote">His death.</span>Decius perished with
his son, and Gallus, who was proclaimed as his successor,
began his reign by once more assuring to the Goths the
annual payments of money &#40;251&#41;.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> This utter defeat of
Roman arms as of Roman policy, the fall of the emperor,
the first who lost his life in conflict with the barbarians&mdash;a
piece of news which deeply moved men&#8217;s minds even in
this age demoralised by its familiarity with misfortune&mdash;the
disgraceful capitulation following thereon, placed in
fact the integrity of the empire at stake. Serious crises
on the middle Danube, threatening probably the loss of
Dacia, must have been the immediate consequence. Once
more this was averted; the governor of Pannonia, Marcus
Aemilius Aemilianus, a good soldier, achieved an important
success of arms, and drove the enemy over the
frontier. But Nemesis bore sway. The consequence of
this victory, achieved in the name of Gallus, was, that the
army renounced allegiance to the betrayer of Decius and
chose their general as his successor. Once more therefore
civil war took precedence of frontier&ndash;defence; and,
while Aemilianus no doubt vanquished Gallus in Italy
but soon afterwards succumbed to his general Valerianus
&#40;254&#41;, <span class="sidenote">Loss of
Dacia.</span>Dacia was lost for the empire&mdash;how, and
to whom, we know not.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> The last coin struck by this
province, and the latest inscription found there, are of
the year 255, the last coin of the neighbouring Viminacium
in upper Moesia of the following year; in the
first years of Valerianus and Gallienus therefore the barbarians
occupied the Roman territory on the left bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
of the Danube, and certainly also pressed across to
the right.</p>

<p>Before we pursue further the development of affairs
on the lower Danube, it appears necessary to cast a glance
at piracy, as it was then in vogue in the eastern half of
the Mediterranean, and the maritime expeditions of the
Goths and their allies originating from it.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Piracy on
the Black
Sea.</span>That the Roman fleet could at no time be dispensed
with on the Black Sea, and piracy there was probably
never extirpated, was implied in the very nature of the
Roman rule as it had taken shape on its coasts. The
Romans were in firm possession only from about the
mouths of the Danube as far as Trapezus. It is true
that on the one hand Tyra at the mouth of the Dniester
and Olbia on the bay at the mouth of the Dnieper, on the
other side the Caucasian harbours in the regions of the
modern Suchum&ndash;Kaleh, Dioscurias and Pityus, were Roman.
The intervening Bosporan kingdom in the Crimea also
stood under Roman protection, and had a Roman garrison
subject to the governor of Moesia. But on these shores,
for the most part far from inviting, there were only those
posts formerly held either as old Greek settlements or as
Roman fortresses; the coast itself was desolate or in the
hands of the natives filling the interior, who, comprehended
under the general name of Scythians, mostly of
Sarmatian descent, never were, or were to become, subject
to the Romans; it was enough if they did not directly
lay hands on the Romans or their clients. Accordingly, it
is not to be wondered at, that even in the time of Tiberius
the pirates of the east coast not merely made the Black
Sea insecure, but also landed and levied contributions on
the villages and towns of the coast. If, under Pius or
Marcus, a band of the Costoboci dwelling on the north&ndash;western
shore fell upon the inland town Elateia situated
in the heart of Phocis, and came to blows under its walls
with the citizens, this event, which certainly only by
accident stands forth for us as isolated, shows that the
same phenomena which preceded the downfall of the
government of the senate were now renewed, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
with the imperial power maintaining itself outwardly
unshaken not merely individual piratical ships, but squadrons
of pirates cruised in the Black and even in the
Mediterranean seas. The decline of the government,
clearly discernible after the death of Severus, and above
all after the end of the last dynasty, manifested itself
then, as was natural, especially in the further decay of
marine police. The accounts, in detail far from trustworthy,
mention already in the time before Decius the
appearance of a great fleet of pirates in the Aegean Sea;
then under Decius the plundering of the Pamphylian
coast and of the Graeco&ndash;Asiatic islands; under Gallus
maraudings of pirates in Asia Minor as far as Pessinus
and Ephesus.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> These were predatory expeditions. These
comrades plundered the coasts far and wide, and made
even, as we see, bold raids into the interior; but nothing
is mentioned of the destruction of towns, and the pirates
shunned coming into collision with Roman troops; the
attack was chiefly directed against such regions as had
no troops stationed in them.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Maritime
expeditions
of the Goths
and allies.</span>Under Valerian these expeditions assume a different
character. The nature of the raids varies so much from
the earlier, that the raid, in itself not specially important,
of the Borani against Pityus under Valerian could be
designated by intelligent reporters precisely as the
beginning of this movement,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> and that the pirates were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
for a long time called in Asia by the name of this tribe
not otherwise known to us. These expeditions proceed
no longer from the old native dwellers beside the Black
Sea, but from the hordes pressing behind them. What
had hitherto been piracy begins to form a portion of that
migratory movement of peoples to which the advance of
the Goths on the lower Danube belongs. The peoples
taking part in it are very varied and in part little known;
in the later expeditions the Germanic Heruli, then dwelling
beside the Maeotis, appear to have played a leading part.
The Goths also took part, but, so far as sea&ndash;voyages are
concerned&mdash;and tolerably exact reports of these are before
us&mdash;not in a prominent manner; strictly speaking, these
expeditions are more correctly termed Scythian than
Gothic. The maritime centre of these aggressions was
the mouth of the Dniester, the port of Tyra.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> The
Greek towns of the Bosporus, abandoned through the
bankruptcy of the imperial power, without protection to
the hordes pressing onward, and expecting to be besieged
by them, consented, half under compulsion, half voluntarily,
to convey in their vessels, and by their mariners, the inconvenient
new neighbours over to the nearest Roman
possessions on the north coast of Pontus&mdash;for which
these neighbours themselves lacked the needful means and
the needful skill. It was thus that the expedition against
Pityus was brought about. The Borani were landed and,
confident of success, sent back the ships. But the
resolute commander of Pityus, Successianus, repelled the
attack; and the assailants, fearing the arrival of the other
Roman garrisons, hastily withdrew, for which they had
difficulty in procuring the necessary transports. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
plan was not given up; in the next year they came back,
and, as the commandant had meanwhile been changed,
the fortress surrendered.<span class="sidenote">To Trapezus.</span> The Borani, who this time had
retained the Bosporan vessels and had them manned by
pressed mariners and Roman captives, possessed themselves
of the coast far and wide, and reached as far as
Trapezus. Into this well fortified and strongly garrisoned
town all had fled, and the barbarians were not in a
position for a real siege. But the leadership of the
Romans was bad, and the military discipline so on the
decline that not even the walls were occupied; so the
barbarians scaled them by night, without encountering
resistance, and in the great and rich city enormous booty,
including a number of ships, fell into their hands.
They returned successful from the far distant land to
the Maeotis.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">To Bithynia.</span>Excited by this success, a second expedition of other
but neighbouring Scythian bands was in the following
winter directed against Bithynia. It is significant of the
unsettled state of things that the instigator of this movement
was Chrysogonus, a Greek of Nicomedia, and that
he was highly honoured by the barbarians for its successful
result. This expedition was undertaken&mdash;as the necessary
number of ships was not to be procured&mdash;partly by land,
partly by water; it was only in the neighbourhood of
Byzantium that the pirates succeeded in possessing themselves
of a considerable number of fishing&ndash;boats, and so
they arrived along the Asiatic coast at Chalcedon, whose
strong garrison on this news ran off. Not merely this
town fell into their hands, but also along the coast
Nicomedia, Chios, Apamea; in the interior Nicaea and
Prusa; Nicomedia and Nicaea they burnt down, and
reached the river Rhyndacus. Thence they sailed home,
laden with the treasures of the rich land and of its considerable
cities.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">To Greece.</span>The expedition against Bithynia had already been
undertaken in part by land; all the more were the attacks
that were directed against European Greece composed of
piratical expeditions by land and sea. If Moesia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Thrace were not permanently occupied by the Goths,
they yet came and went there as if they were at home,
and roved from thence far into Macedonia. Even
Achaia expected under Valerian invasion from this side;
Thermopylae and the Isthmus were barricaded, and the
Athenians set to work to restore their walls that had lain
in ruins since the siege by Sulla. The barbarians did
not come then, nor by this route. But under Gallienus
a fleet of five hundred sail, this time chiefly Heruli,
appeared before the port of Byzantium, which, however,
had not yet lost its capacity of defence; the ships of
the Byzantines successfully repulsed the robbers. These
sailed onward, showed themselves on the Asiatic coast
before Cyzicus not formerly attacked, and arrived from
thence by way of Lemnos and Imbros at Greece proper.
Athens, Corinth, Argos, Sparta, were pillaged and destroyed.
It was always something that, as in the times of the
Persian wars, the citizens of the destroyed Athens, two
thousand in number, laid an ambush for the retiring
barbarians, and, under the leadership of their equally
learned and brave captain, Publius Herennius Dexippus,
of the old and noble family of the Kerykes, with support
of the Roman fleet, inflicted a notable loss on the pirates.
On the return home, which took place in part by the
land route, the emperor Gallienus attacked them in
Thrace at the river Nestus and put to death a considerable
number of their men.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The imperial

of
the Gothic
period.</span>In order completely to survey the measure of misfortune,
we must take into account that in this empire
going to shreds, and above all in the provinces overrun
by the enemy, one officer after another grasped at the
crown, which hardly any longer existed. It is not worth
the trouble to record the names of these ephemeral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
wearers of the purple; it marks the situation that, after
the devastation of Bithynia by the pirates, the emperor
Valerian omitted to send thither an extraordinary commandant,
because every general was, not without reason,
regarded by him as a rival. This co&ndash;operated to produce
the almost thoroughly passive attitude of the government
in presence of this sore emergency. Yet, on the other
hand, undoubtedly a good part of this irresponsible
passiveness is to be traced to the personality of the
rulers: Valerian was weak and aged, Gallienus vehement
and dissolute, and neither the one nor the other was
equal to the guidance of the vessel of the state in a storm.
Marcianus, to whom Gallienus after the invasion of Achaia
had committed the command in these regions, operated
not without success; but the matter did not gain any
real turn for the better so long as Gallienus occupied the
throne.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Gothic victories
of
Claudius.</span>After the murder of Gallienus &#40;268&#41;, perhaps on the
news of it, the barbarians, again led by the Heruli, but
this time with united forces, undertook an assault on the
imperial frontier, such as there had not been hitherto, with
a powerful fleet, and probably at the same time by land
from the Danube.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> The fleet had much to suffer from
storms in the Propontis; then it divided, and the Goths
advanced partly against Thessaly and Greece, partly
against Crete and Rhodes; the chief mass resorted to
Macedonia and thence penetrated into the interior, beyond
doubt in combination with the bands that had marched
into Thrace. But the emperor Claudius, who marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
up in person with a strong force, brought relief at length
to the Thessalonians oft besieged but now reduced to
extremity; he drove the Goths before him up the valley
of the Axius &#40;Vardar&#41; and onward over the mountains
to upper Moesia; after various conflicts, with changing
fortune of war, he achieved here in the Morava valley
near Naissus a brilliant victory, in which 50,000 of the
enemy are said to have fallen. The Goths retired broken
up, first in the direction towards Macedonia, then through
Thrace to the Haemus, in order to put the Danube
between themselves and the enemy. A quarrel in the
Roman camp, this time between infantry and cavalry,
had almost given them once more a respite; but, when it
came to fighting, the cavalry could not bear to leave their
comrades in the lurch, and so the united army was once
more victorious. A severe pestilence, which raged in all
the years of distress, but especially then in those regions,
and above all in the armies, did great injury doubtless to
the Romans&mdash;the emperor Claudius himself succumbed
to it&mdash;but the great army of the Northmen was utterly
extirpated, and the numerous captives were incorporated
in the Roman armies or made serfs.<span class="sidenote">Renewed
fortifying of
the Danube&ndash;frontier.</span> The hydra of
military revolutions, too, was in some measure subdued;
Claudius, and after him Aurelian, were masters in the
empire after another fashion than could be said of
Gallienus. The renewal of the fleet, towards which a
beginning had been made under Gallienus, would not be
wanting. The Dacia of Trajan was, and remained, lost;
Aurelian withdrew the posts still holding out there, and
gave to the possessors dislodged or inclined for emigration
new dwellings on the Moesian bank. But Thrace and
Moesia, which for a time had belonged more to the Goths
than to the Romans, returned under Roman rule, and at
least the frontier of the Danube was once more fortified.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Character
of the
Gothic
wars.</span>We may not assign to these Gothic and Scythian
expeditions by land and by sea, which fill up the twenty
years 250&ndash;269, such significance, as if the hordes moving
forth had been minded to take permanent possession of
the countries which they traversed. Such a plan cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
be shown to have existed even for Moesia and Thrace, to
say nothing of the more remote coasts; hardly, moreover,
were the assailants numerous enough to undertake invasions
proper. As the bad government of the last rulers, and above
all the untrustworthiness of the troops, far more than the
superior power of the barbarians, called forth the flooding
of the territory by land and sea robbers, so the re&ndash;establishment
of internal order and the energetic demeanour of the
government of themselves brought its deliverance. The
Roman state could not yet be broken if it did not break
itself. But still it was a great work to rally the government
again as Claudius had done it. We know somewhat
less even of him than of most regents of this time, as the
probably fictitious carrying back of the Constantinian
pedigree to him has repainted his portrait after the tame
pattern of perfection; but this very association, as well as
the numberless coins struck in his honour after his death,
show that he was regarded by the next generation as the
deliverer of the state, and in this it cannot have been
mistaken. These Scythian expeditions were at all events
a prelude of the later migration of peoples; and the
destruction of cities, which distinguishes them from the
ordinary piratic voyages, took place at that time to such
an extent that the prosperity as well as the culture of
Greece and Asia Minor never recovered from it.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Danubian
wars
to the end
of the 3d
century.</span>On the re&ndash;established frontier of the Danube Aurelian
consolidated the victory achieved, inasmuch as he conducted
the defensive once more offensively, and, crossing the
Danube at its mouth, defeated beyond it not only the Carpi,
who thenceforth stood in client&ndash;relation to the Romans, but
also the Goths under king Canabaudes. His successor
Probus took, as was already stated, the remains of the
Bastarnae, hard pressed by the Goths, over to the Roman
bank, just as Diocletian in the year 295 took the remnant
of the Carpi. This points to the fact that beyond the
river the empire of the Goths was consolidating; but they
came no further. The border&ndash;fortresses were reinforced;
counter&ndash;Aquincum &#40;<em>contra Aquincum</em>, Pesth&#41; was constructed
in the year 294. The piratic expeditions did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
entirely disappear. Under Tacitus hordes from the
Maeotis appeared in Cilicia. The Franks, whom Probus
had settled on the Black Sea, procured for themselves
vessels, and sailed home to their North Sea, after plundering
by the way on the Sicilian and African coasts. By
land, too, there was no cessation of arms, as indeed all the
numerous Sarmatian victories of Diocletian, and a part of
his Germanic, would fall to the regions of the Danube;
but it was only under Constantine that matters again came
to a serious war with the Goths, which had a successful
issue. The preponderance of Rome was re&ndash;established
after the Gothic victory of Claudius as firmly as before.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Illyrising of
the military
force and of
the government.</span>The war&ndash;history which we have just unfolded did not
fail to react with general and lasting effect upon the internal
organisation of the Roman political and military
system. It has already been pointed out that the corps
of the Rhine, holding in the early imperial period the
leading position in the army, yielded their primacy already
under Trajan to the legions of the Danube. While under
Augustus six legions were stationed in the region of the
Danube and eight in that of the Rhine, after the Dacian
wars of Domitian and Trajan in the second century the
Rhine&ndash;camps numbered only four, the camps of the Danube
ten, and after the Marcomanian war even twelve, legions.
Inasmuch as since Hadrian&#8217;s time the Italian element,
apart from the officers, had disappeared from the army,
and, taken on the whole, every regiment was recruited in
the district in which it was quartered, the most of the
soldiers of the Danubian army, and not less the centurions
who rose from the ranks, were natives of Pannonia, Dacia,
Moesia, Thrace. The new legions formed under Marcus
proceeded from Illyricum, and the extraordinary supplemental
levies which the troops then needed were probably
likewise taken chiefly from the districts in which the
armies were stationed. Thus the primacy of the Danubian
armies, which the war of the three emperors in the
time of Severus established and increased, was at the same
time a primacy of Illyrian soldiers; and this reached a
very emphatic expression in the reform of the guard under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Severus. This primacy did not, properly speaking, affect
the higher spheres of government, so long as the position
of officer still coincided with that of imperial official,
although the equestrian career was accessible to the common
soldier through the intervening link of the centurionate
at all times, and thus the Illyrians early found their
way into that career; as indeed, already, in the year 235,
a native Thracian, Gaius Julius Varus Maximinus, in the
year 248 a native Pannonian, Trajanus Decius, had in this
way attained even to the purple. But when Gallienus, in a
distrust certainly but too well justified, excluded the class
of senators from serving as officers, what had hitherto held
good as to the soldiers became necessarily extended to
the officers also. It was thus simply a matter of course
that the soldiers belonging to the army of the Danube,
and mostly springing from Illyrian districts, played thenceforth
the first part also in government, and, so far as the
army made the emperors, these were likewise as to the
majority Illyrians. Thus Gallienus was followed by
Claudius the Dardanian, Aurelianus from Moesia, Probus
from Pannonia, Diocletianus from Dalmatia, Maximianus
from Pannonia, Constantius from Dardania, Galerius from
Serdica; as to the last named, an author writing under
the Constantinian dynasty brings into prominence their
descent from Illyricum, and adds that they, with little
culture but good preliminary training by labour in the
field and service in war, had been excellent rulers. Such
service as the Albanians for a long time rendered to the
Turkish empire, their predecessors likewise rendered to
the Roman imperial state, when this had arrived at similar
disorder and similar barbarism. Only, the Illyrian
regeneration of the Roman imperial order may not be
conceived of as a national reorganisation; it was simply
the propping up, by soldiers, of an empire utterly reduced
through the misgovernment of rulers of gentler birth.
Italy had wholly ceased to be military; and history
does not acknowledge the ruler&#8217;s right without the
warrior&#8217;s power.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="head3">GREEK EUROPE.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Hellenism
and Panhellenism.</span><span class="smcap">With</span> the general intellectual development of the Hellenes
the political development of their republics had not kept
equal pace, or rather the luxuriant growth of the former
had&mdash;just as too full a bloom bursts the calyx that contains
it&mdash;not allowed any individual commonwealth to
acquire the extent and stability which are preliminary
conditions for the thorough formation of a state. The
petty&ndash;state&ndash;system of individual cities or city&ndash;leagues could
not but be stunted in itself or fall a prey to the barbarians.
Panhellenism alone guaranteed alike the continued existence
of the nation and its further development in presence
of the alien races dwelling around it. It was realised by
the treaty which king Philip of Macedonia, the father of
Alexander, concluded in Corinth with the states of Hellas.
This was, in name, a federal agreement, in fact, the subjection
of the republics to the monarchy, but a subjection,
which took effect only as regards external relations, seeing
that the absolute generalship in opposition to the national
foe was transferred by almost all towns of the Greek mainland
to the Macedonian general, while in other respects
freedom and autonomy were left to them; and this was, as
circumstances stood, the only possible realisation of Panhellenism
and the form regulating in substance the future
of Greece. It subsisted in presence of Philip and Alexander,
though the Hellenic idealists were reluctant, as they
always were, to acknowledge the realised ideal as such.
Then, when the kingdom of Alexander fell to pieces, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
was over, as with Panhellenism itself, so also with the
union of the Greek towns under the monarchic supremacy;
and these wore out their last mental and material power
in centuries of aimless striving, distracted between the
alternating rule of the too powerful monarchies, and vain
attempts, under cover of their quarrels, to restore the old
particularism.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Hellas and
Rome.</span>When at length the mighty republic of the west
entered into the conflict, hitherto in some measure balanced,
of the monarchies of the east, and soon showed itself more
powerful than each of the Greek states there striving with
one another, the Panhellenic policy became renewed as the
position of supremacy became fixed. Neither the Macedonians
nor the Romans were Hellenes in the full sense
of the word; it is indeed the sad feature of Greek development
that the Attic naval empire was more a hope than
a reality, and the work of union could not emanate from
the bosom of the nation itself. While in a national
respect the Macedonians stood nearer to the Greeks than
the Romans did, the commonwealth of Rome had politically
far more of elective affinity to the Hellenic than the
Macedonian hereditary kingdom. But&mdash;what is the chief
matter&mdash;the attractive power of the Greek spirit was
probably felt more permanently and deeply by the Roman
burgesses than by the statesmen of Macedonia, just because
the former stood at a greater distance from it than the
latter. The desire to become at least internally Hellenised,
to become partakers of the manners and the culture,
of the art and the science of Hellas, to be&mdash;in the footsteps
of the great Macedonian&mdash;shield and sword of the Greeks
of the East, and to be allowed further to civilise this East
not after an Italian but after a Hellenic fashion&mdash;this
desire pervades the later centuries of the Roman republic
and the better times of the empire with a power and an
ideality which are almost no less tragic than that political
toil of the Hellenes failing to attain its goal. For both
sides strove after the impossible: to Hellenic Pan&ndash;hellenism
there was refused duration, and to Roman Hellenism solid
intrinsic worth. Nevertheless it has essentially influenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
the policy of the Roman republic as well as that of the
emperors. However much the Greeks, particularly in the
last century of the republic, showed the Romans that their
labour of love was a forlorn one, this made no change
either in the labour or in the love.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Amphictiony
of
Augustus.</span>The Greeks of Europe had been comprehended by the
Roman republic under a single governorship named after
the chief country Macedonia. When this was administratively
dissolved at the beginning of the imperial period,
there was at the same time conferred on the whole Greek
name a religious bond of union, which attached itself to
the old Delphic Amphictiony introduced for the sake of
 &#8220;a peace of God&#8221; and then misused for political ends.
Under the Roman republic it had been in the main
brought back to the original foundations; Macedonia as
well as Aetolia, both of which had intruded as usurpers,
were again eliminated, and the Amphictiony once more
embraced not all, but most, of the tribes of Thessaly and
of Greece proper. Augustus caused the league to be
extended to Epirus and Macedonia, and thereby made
it in substance the representative of the Hellenic land in
the wider sense alone suited to this epoch. A privileged
position in this union alongside of the time&ndash;honoured
Delphi was occupied by the two cities of Athens and
Nicopolis, the former the capital of the old, the latter,
according to Augustus&#8217;s design, that of the new imperial,
Hellenic body.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> This new Amphictiony has a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
resemblance to the diet of the three Gauls &#40;<a href="#Page_93">p.&nbsp;93</a>&#41;; just
like the altar of the emperor at Lyons for this diet, the
temple of the Pythian Apollo was the religious centre of
the Greek provinces. But, while to the former withal a
directly political activity was conceded, the Amphictions
of this epoch, in addition to the religious festivals proper,
simply attended to the administration of the Delphic
sanctuary and of its still considerable revenues.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> If its
president in later times ascribed to himself &#8220;Helladarchy,&#8221;
this rule over Greece was simply an ideal conception.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>
But the official conserving of the Greek nationality remained
always a token of the attitude which the new
imperialism occupied towards it, and of its Philhellenism,
far surpassing that of the republic.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Province of
Achaia.</span>Hand in hand with the ritual union of the European
Greeks went the administrative breaking up of the
Graeco&ndash;Macedonian governorship of the republic. It
did not depend on the partition of the imperial administration
between emperor and senate, as this whole territory
and not less the adjacent Danubian regions were assigned
in the original partition to the senate; as little did military
considerations here intervene, seeing that the whole
peninsula up to the frontier of Thrace was&mdash;as protected
partly by this region, partly by the garrisons on the
Danube&mdash;always reckoned to belong to the pacified
interior. If the Peloponnesus and the Attico&ndash;Boeotian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
mainland obtained at that time its own proconsul and was
separated from Macedonia&mdash;which perhaps Caesar may
have already designed&mdash;it may be presumed that in that
course, along with the general tendency not to magnify
the senatorial governorships the dominant consideration
was that of separating the purely Hellenic domain from
what was half&ndash;Hellenic. The boundary of the province
of Achaia was at first Oeta, and, even after the Aetolians
were subsequently attached to it,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> it did not go beyond
the Achelous and Thermopylae.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Greek
towns
under the
Roman
republic.</span>These arrangements concerned the country as a whole.
We turn now to the position which was given to the several
urban communities under the Roman rule.</p>

<p>The original design of the Romans&mdash;to attach the
whole of the Greek urban communities to their own commonwealth,
in a way similar to what had been done with
the Italian&mdash;had undergone essential restrictions, in consequence
of the resistance which these arrangements met
with, especially in consequence of the insurrection of the
Achaean league in the year 608 &#40;iii.&nbsp;47&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;45.</span>, and of the
falling away of most of the Greek towns to king Mithradates
in the year 666 &#40;iii.&nbsp;313&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;297.</span>. The city&ndash;leagues, the
foundation of all development of power in Hellas as in
Italy, and at first accepted by the Romans, were all of
them&mdash;particularly the most important, the Peloponnesian,
or, as it called itself, the Achaean&mdash;broken up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
the several cities were admonished to regulate their own
public affairs. Moreover certain general rules were laid
down by the leading power for the several communal
constitutions, and according to this scheme these were
reorganised in an anti&ndash;democratic sense. It was only
within these limits that the individual community retained
autonomy and a magistracy of its own. It retained also
its own courts; but the Greek stood at the same time <em>de
jure</em> under the rods and axes of the praetor, and at least
could be sentenced&mdash;on account of any offence which
admitted of being regarded as rebellion against the leading
power&mdash;by the Roman officials to a money&ndash;fine or
banishment, or even capital punishment.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> The communities
taxed themselves; but they had throughout to pay
to Rome a definite sum, on the whole, apparently, not on
a high scale. Garrisons were not assigned, as formerly
in the Macedonian period, to the towns, for the troops
stationed in Macedonia were in a position, should need
arise, to move also into Greece. But a graver blame
than that falling on the memory of Alexander through
the destruction of Thebes rests on the Roman aristocracy
for the razing of Corinth. The other measures, odious and
exasperating as in part they were, particularly as imposed
by foreign rule, might, taken as a whole, be unavoidable
and have in various respects a salutary operation; they
were the inevitable palinode of the original Roman policy&mdash;in
part truly impolitic&mdash;of forgiving and forgetting towards
the Hellenes. But in the treatment of Corinth mercantile
selfishness had after an ill&ndash;omened fashion shown itself
more powerful than all Philhellenism.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Freed communities
under the
Roman republic.</span>Amidst all this, the fundamental idea of Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
policy&mdash;to confederate the Greek towns with the Italian&mdash;was
never forgotten; just as Alexander never wished to rule
Greece like Illyria and Egypt, so his Roman successors
never completely applied the subject&ndash;relation to Greece,
and even in the republican period essentially fell short
of urging the strict rights of the war forced upon the
Romans. Especially was this the case in dealing with
Athens. No Greek city from the standpoint of Roman
policy erred so gravely against Rome as this; its demeanour
in the Mithradatic war would, had its case been
that of any other commonwealth, have inevitably led to
its being razed. But from the Philhellenic standpoint,
doubtless, Athens was the masterpiece of the world, and
for the genteel world of other lands similar leanings and
memories were associated with it, as for our cultivated
circles are connected with Pforta and Bonn. This consideration
then, as formerly, prevailed. Athens was never
placed under the fasces of the Roman governor, and never
paid tribute to Rome; it always had a sworn alliance
with Rome, and granted aid to the Romans only in an extraordinary
and, at least as to form, voluntary fashion. The
capitulation after the Sullan siege brought about doubtless
a change in the constitution of the community, but the
alliance was renewed,&mdash;in fact, even all extraneous possessions
were given back, including the island of Delos itself,
which, when Athens passed over to Mithradates, had
broken off and constituted itself an independent commonwealth,
and had been, by way of punishment for its fidelity
towards Rome, pillaged and destroyed by the Pontic
fleet.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>Sparta was treated with similar consideration, and that
doubtless in good part on account of its great name.
Some other towns of the freed communities to be afterwards
named had this position already under the republic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Probably such exceptions occurred in every Roman
province; but this was from the outset peculiar to the
Greek territory, that precisely its two most noted cities
were beyond the range of the subject&ndash;relation, which
accordingly affected only the smaller commonwealths.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">City&ndash;leagues
under the
republic.</span>Even for the subject Greek cities alleviations were
introduced already under the republic. The city&ndash;leagues, at
first prohibited, gradually and very soon revived, especially
the smaller and powerless ones, like the Boeotian;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> with
the becoming familiarised to foreign rule the oppositional
tendencies disappeared which had brought about their
abolition, and their close connection with the time&ndash;hallowed
<em>cultus</em> carefully spared must have further told in their
favour, as indeed it has already been observed that the
Roman republic restored and protected the Amphictiony
in its original non&ndash;political functions. Towards the end
of the republican period the government seems even to
have allowed the Boeotians to enter into a collective
union with the small regions adjacent to the north and
the island of Euboea.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>The copestone of the republican epoch was the
atonement for the sack of Corinth made by the greatest
of all Romans and of all Philhellenes, the dictator Caesar
&#40;iv.&nbsp;574&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;544.</span>, and the renewal of the star of Hellas in the

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Achaia

at its outset found existing in Greece, and in these
paths it went forward. The communities freed from the
immediate interference of the provincial government and
from the payment of tribute to the empire, with which the
colonies of Roman burgesses in many respects stood on a
level, comprehended far the largest and best part of the
province of Achaia:<span class="sidenote">Freed

of Athens as well in its petrified, old&ndash;fashioned institutions
as in its at least outwardly preserved organisation and

Laconians, the southern half of the Laconian region, once
Spartan subjects, organised by the Romans as an independent
cities&ndash;league after the war against Nabis, and,
like Sparta, invested with freedom by Augustus;<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> lastly,
in the region of the Achaeans not only Dyme, which had
been already furnished by Pompeius with pirate&ndash;colonists,
and then had received new Roman settlers from Caesar,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
but above all Patrae, which Augustus, on account of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
position favourable for commerce, transformed from a declining
hamlet,&mdash;partly by drawing together the small surrounding
townships, partly by settlement of numerous Italian
veterans&mdash;into the most populous and most flourishing
city of the peninsula, and constituted as a Roman burgess&ndash;colony,
under which was also placed Naupactus &#40;the
Italian Lepanto&#41; on the opposite Locrian coast. On the
Isthmus Corinth, as it had formerly become a victim to
the advantages of its site, had now after its restoration
rapidly risen, similarly to Carthage, and had become the
richest in industry and in population of the cities of
Greece, as well as the regular seat of government. As
the Corinthians were the first Greeks who had recognised
the Romans as countrymen by admission to the Isthmian
games &#40;ii.&nbsp;79&#41;<span class="sidenote2">ii.&nbsp;75.</span>, so this town now, although a Roman burgess&ndash;community,
took charge of this high Greek national
festival. On the mainland there belonged to the freed
districts not merely Athens, with its territory embracing
all Attica and numerous islands of the Aegean Sea, but
also Tanagra and Thespiae, at that time the two most considerable
towns of the Boeotian country, as also Plataeae;<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>
in Phocis Delphi, Abae, Elateia, as well as the most considerable
of the Locrian towns, Amphissa. What the
republic had begun Augustus completed in the arrangement
just set forth, which was at least in its main outlines
settled by him and was afterwards in substance maintained.
Although the communities of the province subject
to the proconsul preponderated, certainly as to number,
and perhaps also as to the aggregate population, yet in
a genuinely Philhellenic spirit the towns of Greece most
distinguished by material importance or by great memories
were set free.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

Philhellene, went further than Augustus had gone in this
direction. In gratitude for the recognition which his artistic
contributions had met with in the native land of the
Muses, Nero, like Titus Flamininus formerly &#40;ii.&nbsp;262&#41;<span class="sidenote2">ii.&nbsp;247.</span>&mdash;and
that once more in Corinth at the Isthmian games&mdash;declared
the Greeks collectively to be rid of Roman
government, free from tribute, and, like the Italians, subject
to no governor. At once there arose throughout
Greece movements, which would have been civil wars, if
these people could have achieved anything more than
brawling; and after a few months Vespasian re&ndash;established
the provincial constitution,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> so far as it went, with the dry
remark that the Greeks had unlearned the art of being
free.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Rights of
the freed
towns.</span>The legal position of the communities set free remained
in substance the same as under the republic. They
retained, so far as Roman burgesses were not in question,
the full control of justice; only, the general enactments
as to appeals to the emperor on the one hand and to the
senatorial authorities on the other seem to have also included
the free towns.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> Above all, they retained full
self&ndash;determination and self&ndash;administration. Athens, for
example, exercised in the imperial period the right of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
coinage, without even putting the emperor&#8217;s head on its
coins, and even on Spartan coins of the first imperial
period it is frequently wanting. In Athens even the old
reckoning by <em>drachmae</em> and <em>oboli</em> continued; only that, it is
true, the local Attic <em>drachma</em> of this period was nothing but
small money current on the spot, and as to value circulated
as <em>obolus</em> of the Attic imperial <em>drachma</em> or of the Roman
<em>denarius</em>. Even the formal exercise of the right of war
and peace was in individual treaties granted to such
states.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> Numerous institutions quite at variance with
the Italian municipal organisation remained in existence,
such as the annual change of the members of council and
the daily allowance&ndash;moneys of these and the jurymen,
which, at least at Rhodes, were still paid in the imperial
period. As a matter of course, the Roman government
nevertheless exercised continuously a regulative influence
over the constitution even of the freed communities. Thus,
for example, the Athenian constitution was, whether at
the end of the republic or by Caesar or Augustus, modified
in such a way that the right of bringing a proposal
before the burgesses belonged no longer to every burgess,
but, as according to the Roman arrangement, only to
definite officials; and among the great number of officials,
who were mere figures, the conduct of business was placed
in the hands of a single one&mdash;the <em>Strategos</em>. Certainly
in this way various further reforms were carried out, the
presence of which, in dependent as in independent Greece,
we everywhere discern, without being able to determine
the time and occasion of the reform. Thus the right, or
rather the wrong, of asylums, which, as survivals of a
lawless period, had now become pious retreats for bad
debtors and criminals, was certainly, if not set aside, at
least restricted in this province also. The institution
of <em>proxenia</em>&mdash;originally an appropriate arrangement, that
may be compared to our foreign consulates, but politically
dangerous through the bestowal of full civil rights and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
often also of the privilege of exemption from taxes on
the friendly foreigner, especially considering the extent
to which it was granted&mdash;was set aside by the Roman
government, apparently only at the beginning of the imperial
period; in room of which thereupon came, after
the Italian fashion, the empty city&ndash;patronate, which did
not come into contact with the system of taxation. Lastly,
the Roman government, as wielding supreme sovereignty
over these dependent republics just as over the client&ndash;princes,
always regarded it as its right, and exercised the
power, to cancel the free constitution in case of misuse,
and to take the town into its own administration. But
partly the sworn agreement, partly the powerlessness of
these nominally allied states, gave to these treaties a
greater stability than is discernible in the relation to the
client&ndash;princes.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Diets of the
Greek
cities.</span>While the freed communities of Achaia retained their
previous legal position under the empire, Augustus conferred
on those communities of the province, in which freedom
was not granted or possessed, a new and better legal
position. As he had given to the Greeks of Europe a
common centre in the reorganised Delphic Amphictiony,
he allowed also all the towns of the province of Achaia, so
far as they were placed under Roman administration, to
constitute themselves as a collective union, and to meet
annually in Argos, the most considerable town of non&ndash;free
Greece, as a national assembly.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> Thereby not merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
was the Achaean league, dissolved after the Achaean war,
reconstituted, but also the enlarged Boeotian union formerly
mentioned &#40;<a href="#Page_259">p.&nbsp;259</a>&#41; was engrafted on it. Probably
it was just by the laying together of these two domains
that the demarcation of the province of Achaia was
brought about. The new union of the Achaeans, Boeotians,
Locrians, Phocians, Dorians, and Euboeans,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> or, as
it is usually designated like the province, the union of the
Achaeans, presumably had rights neither more nor less
than the other provincial diets of the empire. A certain
control of the Roman officials must have been intended
in the case, and for that reason the towns not placed
under the proconsul, like Athens and Sparta, must have
been excluded from it. This diet withal, like all similar
ones, must have found the centre of its activity chiefly
in the common <em>cultus</em> embracing the whole land. But,
while in the other provinces this <em>cultus</em> of the land preponderantly
attached itself to Rome, the diet of Achaia
was rather a focus of Hellenism, and was perhaps meant
to be so. Already under the Julian emperors it regarded
itself as the true representative of the Greek nation, and
assigned to its president the name of Helladarch, to itself
even that of &#8220;the Panhellenes.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> The assembly thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
deviated from its provincial basis, and its modest administrative
functions fell into the background.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Panhellenion
of Hadrian
in Athens.</span>These Panhellenes therefore took to themselves this
name by an abuse of language, and were simply tolerated
by the government. But as Hadrian created a new
Athens, so he created also a new Hellas. Under him
the representatives of all the autonomous or non&ndash;autonomous
towns of the province of Achaia were allowed
to constitute themselves in Athens as united Greece,
as the Panhellenes.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> The national union, often dreamed
of and never attained in better times, was thereby created,
and what youth had wished for old age possessed in
imperial fulness. It is true that the new Panhellenion did
not obtain political prerogatives; but there was no lack
of what imperial favour and imperial gold could give.
There arose in Athens the temple of the new Zeus
Panhellenios, and brilliant popular festivals and games
were connected with this foundation, the carrying out
of which pertained to the <em>collegium</em> of the Panhellenes, and
primarily to the priest of Hadrian as the living god who
founded them. One of the acts, which these performed
every year, was the offering of sacrifice to Zeus the Deliverer
at Plataeae, in memory of the Hellenes that fell there in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
battle against the Persians, on the anniversary of the
battle, the 4th Boedromion: this marks its tendency.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
Still more clearly was this shown in the fact that the
Greek towns outside of Hellas, which appeared worthy of
the national fellowship, had ideal certificates of Hellenism
issued to them by the assembly in Athens.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The decay
of Hellas.</span>While the imperial rule in its whole wide range
encountered the devastations of a twenty years&#8217; civil
war, and in many places its consequences were never
entirely healed, probably no domain was so severely
affected by them as the Greek peninsula. Fate had so
arranged, that the three great decisive battles of this
epoch&mdash;Pharsalus, Philippi, Actium&mdash;were fought on its
soil or on its coast; and the military operations, which
with both parties led up to these battles, had here above
all demanded their sacrifices of human life and human
happiness. Even Plutarch was told by his great&ndash;grandfather
how the officers of Antonius had compelled the
citizens of Chaeronea, when they no longer possessed
slaves or beasts of burden, to drag their last grain on
their own shoulders to the nearest port to be shipped for
the army; and how thereupon, just as the second convoy
was about to depart, the accounts of the battle of Actium
arrived as glad news of relief. The first thing that
Caesar did after the victory was to distribute the enemy&#8217;s
stores of grain that had fallen into his power among the
famishing population of Greece. This heaviest measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
of suffering fell upon a specially weak power of resistance.
<span class="sidenote">Decrease of
the population.</span>Already, more than a century before the battle
of Actium, Polybius had stated that unfruitfulness in
marriage and diminution of the population had in his
time come over all Greece, without any diseases or severe
wars befalling the land. Now these scourges had emerged
in fearful fashion; and Greece remained desolate for all
time to come. Plutarch thinks that throughout the
Roman empire the population had fallen off in consequence
of the devastating wars, but most of all in
Greece, which was not now in a position to furnish from
the better circles of the citizens the 3000 hoplites, with
which once the smallest of the Greek districts, Megara, had
fought at Plataeae.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> Caesar and Augustus had attempted
to remedy this depopulation, which alarmed even the
government, by the despatch of Italian colonists, and, in
fact, the two most flourishing towns of Greece were these
very colonies; the later governments did not repeat
such consignments. The background to the charming
Euboean peasant&ndash;idyll of Dio of Prusa is formed by
a depopulated town, in which numerous houses stand
empty, flocks are fed at the council&ndash;hall and at the city
register&ndash;house, two&ndash;thirds of the territory lie untilled for
want of hands; and when the narrator reports this as
falling within his own experience, he therewith assuredly
describes not unaptly the circumstances of numerous small
Greek country towns in the time of Trajan. &#8220;Thebes
in Boeotia,&#8221; says Strabo in the Augustan age, &#8220;is now
hardly to be termed even a goodly village, and the same
holds true of all the Boeotian towns, with the exception
of Tanagra and Thespiae.&#8221; But not merely did men
dwindle away as regards number; the type also declined.
 &#8220;There are doubtless still beautiful women,&#8221;
says one of the finest observers about the end of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
century,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> &#8220;but beautiful men one sees no longer; the Olympian
victors of more recent times appear, compared with
the older, inferior and common, partly no doubt owing to
the fault of the artists, but chiefly because they are just
what they are.&#8221; The bodily training of the youth had
been carried in this promised land of ephebi and athletes
to such an extent, as if the very aim of the communal
constitution were to rear the boys as gymnasts and the men
as boxers; but, if no province possessed so many artists
for the ring, none supplied so few soldiers to the imperial
army. Even from the instruction of the Athenian youth&mdash;which
in the olden time embraced spear&ndash;throwing, shooting
with the bow, the use of missiles, the marching out and
pitching of the camp&mdash;this playing at soldiers on the part
of the boys now disappears. The Greek towns of the
empire were virtually not taken account of in the levy,
whether because their recruits appeared physically incapable,
or because this element appeared dangerous in
the army; it was an imperial pleasantry that the caricature
of Alexander, Severus Antoninus, reinforced the
Roman army for the conflict with the Persians by some
companies of Spartiates.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> Whatever was done for internal
order and security must have emanated from the individual
communities, as Roman troops were not stationed
in the province; Athens, for example, maintained a garrison
in the island of Delos, and probably a division of
militia lay also in the citadel.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> In the crises of the third
century the general levy of Elateia &#40;<a href="#Page_242">p.&nbsp;242</a>&#41; and that of
Athens &#40;<a href="#Page_246">p.&nbsp;246</a>&#41; valiantly repulsed the Costoboci and the
Goths; and, after a worthier fashion than the grandchildren
of the combatants of Thermopylae in Caracalla&#8217;s Persian
war, in the Gothic the grandchildren of the victors of
Marathon inscribed their names for the last time in the
annals of ancient history. But, though such incidents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
must preclude us from treating the Greeks of this epoch
absolutely as a decayed rabble, yet the decline of the
population as regards number and vigour steadily continued
even during the better imperial period, until, from
the end of the second century, the diseases which severely
visited these lands, likewise the inroads of land and sea
pirates who particularly affected the east coast, and
lastly, the collapse of the imperial power in the time
of Gallienus, raised the chronic suffering into an acute
catastrophe.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Greek tone
of feeling.</span>The decay of Hellas, and the feelings which it
called forth among the best men, come before us after
a striking manner in the appeal which one of these, the
Bithynian Dio, addressed about the time of Vespasian
to the Rhodians. These were not unjustly regarded as
the most excellent of the Hellenes. In no city were the
lower population better cared for, and nowhere did that
care bear more the stamp of giving not alms but work.
When, after the great civil war, Augustus made all private
debts irrecoverable at law in the East, the Rhodians alone
rejected the dangerous favour. Although the great epoch
of Rhodian commerce was over, there were still in
Rhodes numerous flourishing branches of business and
wealthy houses.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> But many evils had invaded the place,
and the philosopher demands that they be done away,
not so much, as he says, for the sake of the Rhodians, as
for the sake of the Hellenes in common. &#8220;Once upon
a time the honour of Hellas rested on many, and many
increased its renown&mdash;you, the Athenians, the Lacedaemonians,
Thebes, Corinth for a time, at a remote period
Argos. But now the others are as nothing; for some
are totally decayed and destroyed, others conduct themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
as you know, and are dishonoured and destroyers of
their old renown. You are surviving; you alone are still
somewhat and are not utterly despised; for, after the way
in which those go to work, all Hellenes would long ago
have sunken more deeply than the Phrygians and the
Thracians. As when a great and noble family is reduced
to a single survivor, and the sin which this last of the
house commits brings all his ancestors into dishonour, so
you stand in Hellas. Believe not that you are the first
of the Greeks; you are the only ones. If we look at
those pitiful scoundrels, the great destinies of the past
become themselves inconceivable; the stones and ruins
of cities show more clearly the pride and the greatness
of Hellas than these descendants not even worthy of
Mysian ancestors; and better than with towns inhabited
by such as these has it fared with those cities which
lie in ruins, for their memory remains in honour and
their well&ndash;acquired renown unstained&mdash;better burn the
carcase than allow it to lie rotting.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The good
old
manners.</span>We shall not disparage this noble spirit of a scholar
who measured the petty present by the great past, and,
as could not fail to be the case, looked at the one with
indignant eyes and at the other in the transfigured glory
of what had been, if we point out the fact that the good
old Hellenic habits were at that time and even long
afterwards not merely to be found in Rhodes, but were in
many respects still everywhere alive. The inward independence,
the well warranted self&ndash;esteem of the nation
that was still standing at the head of civilisation had not
disappeared in the Hellenes even of this age, amidst all
the pliancy of subjection and all the humility of parasitism.
The Romans borrowed the gods from the old Hellenes
and the form of administration from the Alexandrines;
they sought to master the Greek language and to Hellenise
their own in measure and style. The Hellenes even of
the imperial period did not pursue a like course; the
national deities of Italy, like Silvanus and the Lares, were
not adored in Greece, and it never entered into the mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
of any Greek urban community to introduce at home the
political organisation which their Polybius celebrates as
the best. So far as the knowledge of Latin was a
condition for the career of the higher as of the lower
magistracies, the Greeks who entered upon this career
acquired it; for, though practically it only occurred to
the emperor Claudius to withdraw the Roman franchise
from the Greeks who did not understand Latin, certainly
the real execution of the rights and duties connected with
it was possible only for one who was master of the imperial
language. But, apart from public life, Latin was
never so learned in Greece as Greek in Rome. Plutarch,
who, as an author, joined as it were in marriage the two
halves of the empire, and whose parallel biographies of
famous Greeks and Romans recommended themselves
and were effective above all by this juxtaposition, understood
not very much more of Latin than Diderot of
Russian, and at least, as he himself says, did not master
the language; the Greek literati having a real command
of Latin were either officials, like Appian and Dio Cassius,
or neutrals, like king Juba.</p>

<p>Really Greece was far less changed in itself than in its
external position. The government of Athens was truly
bad, but even in the time of Athenian greatness it had not
been at all exemplary. &#8220;There is,&#8221; says Plutarch, &#8220;the
same national type, the same disorders, earnest and jest,
charm and malice, as among their ancestors.&#8221; This epoch,
too, still exhibits in the life of the Greek people individual
features which are worthy of its civilising leadership. The
gladiatorial games, which spread from Italy everywhere,
especially to Asia Minor and to Syria, found admission to
Greece latest of all lands; for a considerable period they
were confined to the half&ndash;Italian Corinth, and when the
Athenians, in order not to be behind that city, introduced
them also among themselves without listening to the
voice of one of their best men, who asked them whether
they would not first set up an altar to the God of compassion,
several of the noblest turned indignantly away
from the city of their fathers that so dishonoured itself. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
no country of the ancient world were slaves treated with
such humanity as in Hellas; it was not the law, but custom
that forbade the Greek to sell his slaves to a non&ndash;Greek
master, and so banished from this region the slave&ndash;trade
proper. Only here in the imperial period do we find the
non&ndash;free people provided for in the burgess&ndash;feasts and in
largesses of oil to the burgesses.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> Only here could one
who was not free, like Epictetus under Trajan, in his more
than modest outward existence in the Epirot Nicopolis,
hold intercourse with respected men of senatorial rank,
after the manner of Socrates with Critias and Alcibiades,
so that they listened to his oral instructions as disciples
to the master, and took notes of, and published, his conversations.
The alleviations of slavery by the imperial
law are essentially traceable to the influence of Greek
views, <em>e.g.</em> with the emperor Marcus, who looked up to
that Nicopolitan slave as his master and model.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Parallel between
Roman
and
Athenian
life.</span>The author of a dialogue preserved among those of
Lucian gives an unsurpassed description of the demeanour
of the polished Athenian citizen, amidst his narrow circumstances,
overagainst the genteel and rich travelling public
of doubtful culture or else undoubted coarseness; how
the rich foreigner has been weaned from appearing in the
public bath with a host of attendants, as if he were not
otherwise certain of his life in Athens and there were no
peace in the land; and how he was weaned from showing
himself on the street with his purple dress by people making
the friendly inquiry whether it was not that of his mamma.
He draws a parallel between Roman and Athenian
existence; in the former the burdensome banquets and
the still more burdensome brothels, the inconvenient
convenience of the swarms of menials and the domestic
luxury, the troubles of a dissolute life, the torments of
ambition, all the superfluity, the multifariousness, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
unrest of the doings of the capital; in the latter the charm
of poverty, the free talk in the friendly circle, the leisure
for intellectual enjoyment, the possibility of peace and of
joy in life&mdash; &#8220;How couldest thou,&#8221; one Greek in Rome
asks another, &#8220;leave the light of the sun, Hellas, and its
happiness and its freedom for the sake of this crowd?&#8221;
In this fundamental keynote all the more finely and purely
organised natures of this epoch are agreed; the very best
Hellenes would rather not exchange with the Romans.
There is hardly anything equally pleasing in the literature
of the imperial period with the already mentioned Euboean
idyll of Dio; it depicts the existence of two families
of hunters in the lonely forest, whose property consists
of eight goats, a cow without a horn, and a fine calf, four
sickles and three hunting&ndash;spears, who know nothing either
of gold or of taxes, and who, when placed before the
raging burgess&ndash;assembly of the city, are by the latter dismissed
at length unmolested to joy and to freedom.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Plutarch.</span>The real embodiment of this poetically transfigured
conception of life is Plutarch of Chaeronea, one of the
most charming, most fully informed, and withal most
effective writers of antiquity. Sprung from a family of
means in that small Boeotian country&ndash;town, and introduced
to the full Hellenic culture, first at home and then
at Athens and at Alexandria; familiar, moreover, with
Roman affairs through his studies and manifold personal
relations, as well as by his travels in Italy, he disdained to
enter into the service of the state or to adopt the professional
career after the usual manner of gifted Greeks;
he remained faithful to his home, enjoying domestic life,
in the finest sense of the word, with his excellent wife and
his children, and with his friends, male and female; contenting
himself with the offices and honours which his own
Boeotia was able to offer to him, and with the moderate
property which he had inherited. In this Chaeronean
the contrast between the Hellenes and the Hellenised
finds expression; such a type of Greek life was not
possible in Smyrna or in Antioch; it belonged to the
soil like the honey of Hymettus. There are men enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
of more powerful talents and of deeper natures, but hardly
any second author has known in so happy a measure
how to reconcile himself serenely to necessity, and how to
impress upon his writings the stamp of his tranquillity of
spirit and his blessedness of life.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Misgovernment
of the
provincial
administration.</span>The self&ndash;mastery of Hellenism cannot manifest itself
in the field of public life with the purity and beauty which
it presents in the quiet homestead, after which history
happily does not inquire any more than it inquires after
history. When we turn to public affairs, there is more to
be told of misrule than of rule, both as regards the Roman
government and the Greek autonomy. There was no
want of goodwill on the part of the former, in so far as
Roman Philhellenism dominated the imperial period even
much more decidedly than the republican. It expresses
itself everywhere in great matters as in small, in the prosecution
of the Hellenising of the Eastern provinces and
the recognition of a double official language for the empire,
as well as in the courteous forms in which the government
dealt, and enjoined its officials to deal, even with the
pettiest Greek community.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> Nor did the emperors fail to
favour this province with gifts and buildings; and, though
most things of this sort came to Athens, Hadrian at any
rate constructed a great aqueduct for the benefit of
Corinth, and Pius the hospital at Epidaurus. But the
considerate treatment of the Greeks in general, and the
special kindness which was shown by the imperial government
to Hellas proper, because it was accounted in a
certain sense as, like Italy, &#8220;motherland,&#8221; did not redound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
to the true benefit either of the government or of the
country. The annual changes of the chief magistrates,
and the remiss control of the central position, made all the
senatorial provinces, so far as rule by governors went,
feel rather the oppression than the blessing of unity of administration,
and doubly so in proportion to their smallness
and their poverty. Even under Augustus himself these
evils prevailed to such a degree that it was one of the first
acts of the reign of his successor to take Greece as well as
Macedonia into his own power,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> as it was alleged, temporarily,
but in fact for the whole duration of his reign.
It was very constitutional, but perhaps not quite so wise on
the part of the emperor Claudius, when he came to power,
that he re&ndash;established the old arrangement. Thenceforward
the matter remained on this footing, and Achaia was
administered by magistrates not nominated, but chosen by
lot, till this form of administration fell altogether into
abeyance.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Misgovernment
of the
free towns.</span>But the case was far worse with the communities of
Greece exempted from the rule of the governor. The
design of favouring these commonwealths&mdash;by freeing
them from tribute and levy, and not less by the slightest
possible restriction of the rights of the sovereign state&mdash;led
at least in many cases to the opposite result. The
intrinsic falseness of the institutions avenged itself. No
doubt among the less privileged or better administered
communities the communal autonomy may have fulfilled
its aim; at least we do not learn that Sparta, Corinth,
Patrae fared specially ill in this respect. <span class="sidenote">Administration of
Athens.</span>But Athens was
not made for self&ndash;administration, and affords the disheartening
picture of a commonwealth pampered by the
supreme power, and financially as well as morally ruined.
By rights it ought to have found itself in a flourishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>condition. If the Athenians were unsuccessful in uniting
the nation under their hegemony, this city was the only one
in Greece, as in Italy, which carried out completely the
union of its territory: no city of antiquity elsewhere possessed
a domain of its own, such as was Attica, of about 700
square miles, double the size of the island of R&uuml;gen. But
even beyond Attica they retained what they possessed, as
well after the Mithradatic war by favour of Sulla, as after
the Pharsalian battle, in which they had taken the side of
Pompeius, by the favour of Caesar&mdash;he asked them only
how often they would still ruin themselves and trust to be
saved by the renown of their ancestors. To the city
there still belonged not merely the territory, formerly
possessed by Haliartus, in Boeotia &#40;ii.&nbsp;329&#41;<span class="sidenote2">ii.&nbsp;309</span>, but also on
their own coast Salamis, the old starting&ndash;point of their
dominion of the sea, and in the Thracian Sea the lucrative
islands Scyros, Lemnos, and Imbros, as well as Delos in
the Aegean; it is true this island, after the end of the
republic, was no longer the central emporium of trade with
the East, now that the traffic had been drawn away from
it to the ports of the west coast of Italy, and this was an
irreparable loss for the Athenians. Of the further grants,
which they had the skill to draw by flattery from Antonius,
Augustus, against whom they had taken part, took from
them certainly Aegina and Eretria in Euboea, but they
were allowed to retain the smaller islands of the Thracian
Sea, Icus, Peparethus, Sciathus, and further Ceos confronting
the promontory of Sunium; and Hadrian, moreover,
gave to them the best part of the great island Cephallenia
in the Ionian Sea. It was only by the emperor Severus,
who bore them no good will, that a portion of these extraneous
possessions was withdrawn from them. Hadrian
further granted to the Athenians the delivery of a certain
quantity of grain at the expense of the empire, and by
the extension of this privilege, hitherto reserved for the
capital, acknowledged Athens, as it were, as another imperial
metropolis. Not less was the blissful institute of
alimentary endowments, which Italy had enjoyed since
Trajan&#8217;s time, extended by Hadrian to Athens, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
capital requisite for this purpose certainly presented to
the Athenians from his purse. An aqueduct, which he
likewise dedicated to his Athens, was only completed
after his death by Pius. To this falls to be added the
conflux of travellers and of students, and the endowments
bestowed on the city in ever increasing number by Roman
grandees and by foreign princes.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Its difficulties.</span>Yet the community was in constant distress. The
right of citizenship was dealt with not merely in the way
everywhere usual of giving and taking, but was made
formally and openly a matter of traffic, so that Augustus
interfered to prohibit the evil. Once and again the
council of Athens resolved to sell this or that one of its
islands; and not always was there found a rich man ready
to make sacrifices like Julius Nicanor, who, under
Augustus, bought back for the bankrupt Athenians the
island of Salamis, thereby earning from its senate the
honorary title of the &#8220;new Themistocles,&#8221; as well as,
seeing that he also made verses, that of the &#8220;new Homer,&#8221;
and&mdash;together with the noble councillors&mdash;from the public
well&ndash;merited derision. The magnificent buildings with
which Athens continued to embellish herself were obtained
without exception from foreigners, among others from the
rich kings Antiochus of Commagene and Herod of
Judaea, but above all from the emperor Hadrian, who laid
out a complete &#8220;new town&#8221; &#40;<em>novae Athenae</em>&#41; on the Ilisus,
and&mdash;besides numberless other buildings, including the
already mentioned Panhellenion&mdash;worthily brought to
completion the wonder of the world, seven centuries after
it had been begun, the gigantic building, commenced by
Pisistratus, of the Olympieion, with its 120 columns partly
still standing, the largest of all that are erect at the present
day. This city itself was without money, not merely for
its harbour&ndash;walls, which now certainly might be dispensed
with, but even for its harbour. In Augustus&#8217;s time the
Piraeus was a small village of a few houses, only visited
for the sake of the masterpieces of painting in the halls of
the temples. There was hardly any longer commerce or
industry in Athens; or rather for the citizens as a body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
as well as individually there was but a single flourishing
trade&mdash;begging.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Street&ndash;riots.</span>Nor did the matter end with financial distress. The
world doubtless had peace, but not the streets and squares
of Athens. Even under Augustus an insurrection in
Athens assumed such proportions that the Roman government
had to take steps against the free city;<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> and though
this event stands isolated, riots on the street on account
of the price of bread and on other trifling occasions belonged
in Athens to the order of the day. The prospect
must not have been much better in numerous other free
towns, of which there is less mention. To give criminal
justice absolutely into the hands of such a burgess&ndash;body
could hardly be justified; and yet it belonged <em>de jure</em> to
the communities admitted to international federation, like
Athens and Rhodes. When the Athenian Areopagus in
the time of Augustus refused to release from punishment
on the intercession of a Roman of rank a Greek condemned
for forgery, it must have been within its right;
but when the Cyzicenes under Tiberius imprisoned Roman
burgesses, and under Claudius the Rhodians even nailed
a Roman burgess to the cross, these were formal violations
of law, and a similar occurrence under Augustus
cost the Thessalians their autonomy. Arrogance and
aggression are not excluded by absence of power&mdash;are
not seldom even ventured on by weak clients. With all
respect for great memories and sworn treaties, these free
states could not but appear to every conscientious government
not much less than an infringement of the general
order of the empire, like the still more time&ndash;hallowed
right of asylum in the temples.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Correctores.</span>Ultimately the government acted with decision, and
placed the free towns, as regards their economy, under the
superintendence of officials of imperial nomination, who,
at all events in the first instance, are described as extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
commissioners &#8220;for the correction of evils prevailing
in the free towns,&#8221; and thence subsequently bear the
designation &#8220;Correctores&#8221; as their title. The germs of
this office may be traced back to the time of Trajan; we
find them as standing officials in Achaia in the third century.
These officials, appointed by the emperor, and acting
alongside of the proconsuls, occur in no part of the Roman
empire so early, and are in no case found so early permanent,
as in Achaia, which half consisted of free cities.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Clinging to
memories
of the past.</span>The self&ndash;esteem of the Hellenes, well&ndash;warranted in itself
and fostered by the attitude of the Roman government,
and perhaps still more by that of the Roman public&mdash;the
consciousness of intellectual primacy&mdash;called into life
among them a <em>cultus</em> of the past, which was compounded
of a faithful clinging to the memories of greater and happier
times and a quaint reverting of matured civilisation
to its in part very primitive beginnings.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Religion.</span>To foreign worships, if we keep out of view the service
of the Egyptian deities already earlier naturalised by
trading intercourse, particularly that of Isis, the Greeks
in Hellas proper sustained throughout the attitude of
declining them; if this held least true in the case of
Corinth, Corinth was also the least Greek town of Hellas.
The old religion of the country was not protected by
hearty faith, from which this age had long since broken
off;<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> but the habits of home and the memory of the past
clung to it by preference, and therefore it was not merely
retained with tenacity, but it even became&mdash;in good part
by the process of erudite retouching&mdash;always more rigid
and more antique as time went on, always more a distinctive
possession of such as made it a study.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Pedigrees.</span>It was the same with the worship of pedigrees, in
which the Hellenes of this age performed uncommon feats,
and left the most aristocratic of the Romans far behind
them. In Athens the family of the Eumolpidae played a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
prominent part at the reorganisation of the Eleusinian
festival under Marcus. His son Commodus conferred on
the head of the clan of the Kerykes the Roman franchise,
and from him descended the brave and learned Athenian,
who, almost like Thucydides, fought with the Goths and
then described the Gothic war &#40;<a href="#Page_246">p.&nbsp;246</a>&#41;. A contemporary
of Marcus, the professor and consular Herodes Atticus,
belonged to this same clan, and his court&ndash;poet sings of
him, that the red shoe of the Roman patriciate well befitted
the high&ndash;born Athenian, the descendant of Hermes
and of Cecrops&#8217;s daughter Herse, while one of his panegyrists
in prose celebrates him as Aeacides, and at the
same time as a descendant of Miltiades and Cimon. But
even Athens was far outbidden in this respect by Sparta;
on several occasions we meet with Spartiates who boast
of descent from the Dioscuri, Herakles, Poseidon, and of
the priesthood of these ancestors hereditary for forty generations
and more in their house. It is significant of
this nobility, that it in the main presents itself only with
the end of the second century; the heraldic draughtsmen
who projected these genealogical tables cannot have
been very punctilious as to vouchers either in Athens or
in Sparta.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Language;
archaism
and barbarism.</span>The same tendency appears in the treatment of the
language or rather of the dialects. While at this time in
the other Greek&ndash;speaking lands and also in Hellas the
so&ndash;called common Greek, debased in the main from the
Attic dialect, predominated in ordinary intercourse, not
merely did the written language of this epoch strive to set
aside prevalent faults and innovations, but in many cases
dialectic peculiarities were again taken up in opposition to
common usage, and here, where it was least of all warranted,
the old particularism was in semblance brought
back. On the statues which the Thespians set up to the
Muses in the grove of Helicon, there were inscribed in
good Boeotian the names Orania and Thalea, while the
epigrams belonging to them, composed by a poet of
Roman name, called them in good Ionic Uranie and
Thaleie, and the non&ndash;learned Boeotians, if they knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
them, like all other Greeks called them Urania and
Thaleia. By the Spartans especially incredible things were
done in this way, and not seldom more was written for
the shade of Lycurgus than for the Aelii and Aurelii living
at the time.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> Moreover, the correct use of the language
at this period appears gradually losing ground even in
Hellas; archaisms and barbarisms often stand peacefully
side by side in the documents of the imperial period.
The population of Athens, much mixed with foreigners,
has at no time specially distinguished itself in this
respect,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> and, although the civic documents keep themselves
comparatively pure, yet from the time of Augustus
the gradually increasing corruption of language here also
makes itself felt. The strict grammarians of the time
filled whole books with the linguistic slips with which the
much celebrated rhetorician Herodes Atticus just mentioned
and the other famous school&ndash;orators of the second
century were chargeable,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> quite apart from the quaint
artificiality and the affected point of their discourse. But
barbarism proper as regards language and writing set in
in Athens and all Greece, just as in Rome, with Septimius
Severus.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The public
career.</span>The bane of Hellenic existence lay in the limitation
of its sphere; high ambition lacked a corresponding
aim, and therefore the low and degrading ambition flourished
luxuriantly. Even in Hellas there was no lack of
native families of great wealth and considerable influence.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a>
<span class="sidenote">Great
families.</span> The country was doubtless on the whole poor, but there
were houses of extensive possessions and old&ndash;established
prosperity. In Sparta, for example, that of Lachares
occupied, from Augustus down at least to the time of
Hadrian, a position which in point of fact was not far
removed from that of a prince. Antonius had caused
Lachares to be put to death for exaction. Thereupon his
son Eurycles was one of the most decided partisans of
Augustus, and one of the bravest captains in the decisive
naval battle, who had almost made the conquered general
personally a captive; he received from the victor, among
other rich gifts as private property, the island of Cythera
&#40;Cerigo&#41;. Later he played a prominent and hazardous
part not merely in his native land, over which he must
have exercised a permanent presidency, but also at the
courts of Jerusalem and Caesarea, to which the respect
paid to a Spartiate by the Orientals contributed not a
little. For that reason brought to trial several times at
the bar of the emperor, he was at length condemned and
sent into exile; but death seasonably withdrew him from
the consequences of the sentence, and his son Lacon came
into the property, and substantially also, though in a more
cautious form, into the position of power of his father.
The family of the often&ndash;mentioned Herodes had a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
standing in Athens; we can trace it going back through
four generations to the time of Caesar, and confiscation
was decreed, just as over the Spartan Eurycles, over the
grandfather of Herodes on account of his exorbitant position
of power in Athens. The enormous landed estates
which the grandson possessed in his poor native country,
the extensive spaces applied for the sake of erecting tombs
for his boy&ndash;favourites, excited the indignation even of the
Roman governors. It may be presumed that there were
powerful families of this sort in most districts of Hellas,
and, while they as a rule decided matters at the diet of
the province, they were not without connections and
influence even in Rome. <span class="sidenote">The career
of state&ndash;offices.</span> But although those legal bars,
which excluded the Gaul and the Alexandrian even after
obtaining the franchise from the imperial senate, hardly
stood in the way of those Greeks of rank, but on the
contrary the political and military career which offered
itself to the Italian likewise stood open in law to the
Hellenes, these in point of fact entered only at a late
period and to a limited extent into the service of the state;
partly, doubtless, because the Roman government of the
earlier imperial period reluctantly admitted the Greeks as
foreigners, partly because these themselves shunned the
translation to Rome that was associated with entrance on
this career, and preferred to be the first at home instead
of one the more among the many senators. It was the
great&ndash;grandson of Lachares, Herclanus, who first in the
time of Trajan entered the Roman senate; and in the
family of Herodes probably his father was the first to do
so about the same time.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Personal
service of
the emperor.</span>The other career, which only opened up in the imperial
period&mdash;the personal service of the emperor&mdash;gave
doubtless in favourable circumstances riches and influence,
and was earlier and more frequently pursued by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
Greeks; but, as most, and the most important, of these
positions were associated with service as officers, there seems
to have been for a considerable time a <em>de facto</em> preference
of Italians for these places, and the direct way was here
also in some measure barred to Greeks. In subordinate
positions Greeks were employed at the imperial court
from the first and in great numbers, and they often in
circuitous ways attained to trust and influence; but such
persons came more from the Hellenised regions than from
Hellas itself, and least of all from the better Hellenic
houses. For the legitimate ambition of the young man
of ancestry and estate there was, if he was a Greek, but
limited scope in the Roman empire.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Municipal
administration.</span>There remained to him his native land, and in its
case to be active for the common weal was certainly a
duty and an honour. But the duties were very modest
and the honours more modest still. &#8220;Your task,&#8221; Dio says
further to his Rhodians, &#8220;is a different one from that of
your ancestors. They could develop their ability on many
sides, aspire to government, aid the oppressed, gain allies,
found cities, make war and conquer; of all this you can
no longer do aught. There is left for you the conduct of
the household, the administration of the city, the bestowal
of honours and distinctions with choice and moderation,
a seat in council and in court, sacrifice to the gods and
celebration of festivals; in all this you may distinguish
yourselves above other towns. Nor are these slight
matters: the decorous bearing, the care for the hair and
beard, the sedate pace in the street, so that the foreigners
accustomed to other things may by your side unlearn their
haste, the becoming dress, even, though it may seem
ridiculous, the narrow and neat purple&ndash;border, the calmness
in the theatre, the moderation in applause&mdash;all this
forms the honour of your town; therein more than in
your ports and walls and docks appears the good old
Hellenic habit; and thereby even the barbarian, who
knows not the name of the city, perceives that he is in
Greece and not in Syria or Cilicia.&#8221; All this was to the
point; but, if it was no longer required now of the citizen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
to die for the city of his fathers, the question was at any rate
not without warrant, whether it was still worth the trouble
to live for that city.<span class="sidenote">Plutarch&#8217;s
view of its
duties.</span> There exists a disquisition by
Plutarch as to the position of the Greek municipal official
in his time, wherein he discusses these relations with the
fairness and circumspection characteristic of him. The
old difficulty of conducting the good administration of
public affairs by means of majorities of the citizens&mdash;uncertain,
capricious, often bethinking them more of their
own advantage than of that of the commonwealth&mdash;or
even of the very numerous council&ndash;board&mdash;the Athenian
numbered in the imperial period first 600, then 700,
later 750 town&ndash;councillors&mdash;subsisted now, as formerly:
it is the duty of the capable magistrate to prevent the
&#8220;people&#8221; from inflicting wrong on the individual burgess,
from appropriating to themselves unallowably private property,
from distributing among them the municipal property&mdash;tasks
which are not rendered the easier by the fact that
the magistrate has no means for the purpose but judicious
admonition and the art of the demagogue, that it is
further suggested to him not to be too punctilious in
such things, and, if at a city festival a moderate largess
to the burgesses is proposed, not to spoil matters with the
people on account of such a trifle. But in other respects
the circumstances had entirely changed, and the official
must learn to adapt himself to things as they are. First
of all he has to keep the powerlessness of the Hellenes
present at every moment to himself and to his fellow&ndash;citizens.
The freedom of the community reaches so far
as the rulers allow it, and anything more would doubtless
be evil. When Pericles put on the robes of office, he
called to himself not to forget that he was ruling over
free men and Greeks; to&ndash;day the magistrate has to say
to himself that he rules under a ruler, over a town subject
to proconsuls and imperial procurators, that he can and
may be nothing but the organ of the government, that
a stroke of the governor&#8217;s pen suffices to annul any one
of his decrees. Therefore it is the first duty of a good
magistrate to place himself on a good understanding with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
the Romans, and, if possible, to form influential connections
in Rome, that these may benefit his native place.
It is true that the upright man warns urgently against
servility; in case of need the magistrate ought courageously
to confront the bad governor, and the resolute
championship of the community in such conflicts at Rome
before the emperor appears as the highest service. In a
significant way he sharply censures those Greeks who&mdash;quite
as in the times of the Achaean league&mdash;call for the
intervention of the Roman governor in every local quarrel,
and urgently exhorts them rather to settle the communal
affairs within the community than by appeal to give themselves
into the hands, not so much of the supreme
authority, as of the pleaders and advocates that practise
before it. All this is judicious and patriotic, as judicious
and patriotic as was formerly the policy of Polybius, which
is expressly referred to. At this epoch of complete world&ndash;peace,
when there was neither a Greek nor a barbarian
war anywhere, when civic commands, civic treaties of
peace and alliances belonged solely to history, the advice
was very reasonable to leave Marathon and Plataeae
to the schoolmasters, and not to heat the heads of the
Ecclesia by such grand words, but rather to content themselves
with the narrow circle of the free movement still
allowed to them. The world, however, belongs not to reason
but to passion. The Hellenic burgess could still even
now do his duty towards his fatherland; but for the true
political ambition striving after what was great, for the
passion of Pericles and Alcibiades, there was in this
Hellas&mdash;apart perhaps from the writing&ndash;desk&mdash;nowhere
any room; and in the vacant space there flourished the
poisonous herbs which, wherever high effort is arrested in
the bud, harden and embitter the human heart.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Games.</span>Therefore Hellas was the motherland of the degenerate,
empty ambition which was perhaps the most general, and
certainly among the most pernicious, of the many sore evils
of the decaying ancient civilisation. Here in the first
rank stood the popular festivals with their prize competitions.
The Olympic rivalries well beseemed the youthful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
people of the Hellenes; the general gymnastic festival
of the Greek tribes and towns, and the chaplet plaited
from the branches of the olive for the ablest runner according
to the decision of the &#8220;Hellas&ndash;judges,&#8221; were the
innocent and simple expression of the young nation as a
collective unity. But their political development had soon
carried them beyond this early dawn. Already in the
days of the Athenian naval league, or at least of the
monarchy of Alexander, that festival of the Hellenes was
an anachronism, a childs&#8217; play continued in the age of
manhood; the fact, that the possessor of that olive wreath
passed at least with himself and his fellow&ndash;citizens as
holder of the national primacy, had nearly as much significance,
as if in England the victors in the students&#8217; boat
races were to be placed on a level with Pitt and Beaconsfield.
The extension of the Hellenic nation by colonising
and Hellenising found, amidst its ideal unity and real disruption,
its true expression in this dreamy realm of the
olive&ndash;wreath; and the materialist policy of the time of
the Diadochi thereupon gave itself, as was meet, but little
trouble on the subject. But when the imperial period
after its fashion took up the Panhellenic idea, and the
Romans entered into the rights and duties of the Hellenes,
then Olympia remained or became the true symbol for the
Roman &#8220;All&ndash;Hellas&#8221;; at any rate the first Roman Olympic
victor appears under Augustus, and in the person of no less
than Augustus&#8217;s stepson, the subsequent emperor Tiberius.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a>
The far from pure marriage&ndash;alliance, which Allhellenism
entered into with the demon of play, converted these
festivals into an institution as powerful and lasting as it
was injurious in general, and especially for Hellas. The
whole Hellenic and Hellenising world took part therein,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
sending deputies to them and imitating them; everywhere
similar festivals destined for the whole Greek world sprang
from the soil, and the zealous participation of the masses
at large, the general interest felt in the individual competitors,
the pride not merely of the victor but of his adherents
and of his native land, made people almost forget
what in the strict sense were the things contended for.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Universal
interest in
them.</span>Not merely did the Roman government allow free
scope to this rivalry in gymnastic and other competitions,
but the empire took part in them; the right solemnly to
fetch home the victor to his native city did not in
the imperial period depend on the pleasure of the burgesses
concerned, but was conferred on the individual
agonistic institutes by imperial charter,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> and in this case
also the yearly pension &#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σίτησις</span>&#41; assigned to the victor
was charged upon the imperial exchequer, and the more
important agonistic institutes were treated directly as
imperial institutions. This interest in games seized all the
provinces as well as the empire itself; but Greece proper
was always the ideal centre of such contests and victories.
Here was their home on the Alpheus; here the seat of
the oldest imitations, of the Pythia, Isthmia, and Nemea,
still belonging to the great times of the Hellenic name
and glorified by its classic poets, and no less of a number
of more recent but richly equipped similar festivals, the
Euryclea, which the just&ndash;mentioned lord of Sparta had
founded under Augustus, the Athenian Panathenaea, the
Panhellenia, endowed by Hadrian with imperial munificence
and likewise celebrated at Athens. It might
be matter for wonder that the whole world of the wide
empire seemed to revolve round these gymnastic festivals,
but not that the Hellenes above all got intoxicated over
this rare cup of enchantment, and that the life of political
quiet, which their best men recommended to them, was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
the most injurious way disturbed by the wreaths and the
statues and the privileges of the festal victors.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Municipal
ambition.</span>Civic institutions took a similar course, certainly in
the empire as a whole, but again more especially in Hellas.
When great aims and an ambition still existed there, in
Hellas, just as in Rome, the pursuit of public offices and
public honours had formed the centre of political emulation,
and had called forth, along with much that was empty,
ridiculous, mischievous, also the ablest and noblest services.
Now the kernel had vanished and the husk remained;
in Panopeus, in the Phocian territory, the houses were
roofless, and the citizens dwelt in huts, but it was still
a city, indeed a state, and in the procession of the Phocian
communities the Panopeans were not wanting. These
towns, with their magistracies and priesthoods, with their
laudatory decrees proclaimed by herald and their seats of
honour in the public assemblies, with the purple dress
and the diadem, with statues on foot and on horseback,
drove a trade in vanity and money&ndash;jobbing worse than
the pettiest paltry prince of modern times with his orders
and titles. There would not be wanting even amidst these
incidents real merit and honourable gratitude; but generally
it was a trade of giving and taking, or, to use
Plutarch&#8217;s language, an affair as between a courtesan and
her customers. As at the present day private munificence
in the positive degree procures an order, in the superlative
a patent of nobility, so it then procured the priestly
purple and the statue in the market place; and it is not
with impunity that the state issues a spurious coinage of
its honours.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Its honours
and their
evils.</span>As regards the scale of conducting such proceedings
and the grossness of their forms the doings of the present
day fall considerably behind those of the ancient world,
as is natural, seeing that the seeming autonomy of the
community, not sufficiently restrained by the idea of the
State, bore unhindered sway in this domain, and the decreeing
authorities throughout were the burgesses or the
councils of petty towns. The consequences were pernicious
on both sides; the municipal offices were given away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
more according to the ability to pay than according to
the aptitude of the candidates; the banquets and largesses
made the recipients none the richer, and often impoverished
the donor; to the increased aversion for labour and
the decay in the means of good families, this evil habit
contributed its full share. The economy of the communities
themselves also suffered severely under the spreading
evil of adulation. No doubt the honours, with which
the community thanked the individual benefactor, were
measured in great part by the same rational principle
of cheapness which governs at the present day similar decorative
favours; and, when that was not the case, the
benefactor frequently found himself ready, for example,
personally to pay for the statue to be erected in his
honour. But the same did not apply to the marks of
honour which the community showed to foreigners of
rank, above all to the governors and the emperors, and to
the members of the imperial house. The tendency of
the time to set value even on meaningless and enforced
homage did not dominate the imperial court and the
Roman senators so much as the circles of ambition in the
petty town, but yet it did so in a very perceptible way;
and, as a matter of course, the honours and the homage
grew withal in the course of time through misuses to
which they were put, and, further, in the same proportion
as the worthlessness of the personages governing or taking
part in the government. In this respect, as might be
conceived, the supply of honours was always stronger than
the demand for them, and those who correctly valued
such marks of homage, in order to remain spared from
it, were compelled to decline them, which seems to
have been done often enough in individual cases,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> but
seldom with consistency&mdash;for Tiberius, the small number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
of statues erected to him may perhaps be recorded among
his titles to honour. The disbursements for honorary
memorials, which often went far beyond the simple statue,
and for honorary embassies,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> were a cancer, and became
ever more so, in the municipal economy of all the provinces.
But none perhaps expended uselessly sums so
large in proportion to its slender ability to furnish them
as the province of Hellas, the motherland of municipal
honours as of rewards for the festal victor, and unexcelled
at this period in one pre&ndash;eminence&mdash;that of menial
humility and abject homage.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Trade and
intercourse.</span>That the economic circumstances of Greece were not
favourable, scarce needs to be specially set forth in detail.
The land, taken on the whole, was but of moderate
fertility, the agricultural portions of limited extent, the
culture of the vine on the mainland not of prominent importance,
that of the olive more so. As the quarries of
the famous marble&mdash;the shining white Attic and the green
Carystian&mdash;belonged, like most others, to the domanial
possessions, the working of them by imperial slaves
tended little to benefit the population.</p>

<p>The most assiduous of the Greek districts from an industrial
point of view was that of the Achaeans, where the
manufacture of woollen stuffs, that had long existed, maintained
its ground, and in the well&ndash;peopled town of Patrae
numerous looms worked up the fine flax of Elis into
clothing and head&ndash;dresses. Art and art&ndash;handiwork still
continued chiefly in the hands of the Greeks; and of the
masses in particular of Pentelic marble, which the imperial
period made use of, no small portion must have been
worked up on the spot. But it was predominantly
abroad that the Greeks practised both; of the export of
Greek art&ndash;products formerly so important there is little
mention at this period. The city of the two seas, Corinth&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
metropolis common to all Hellenes, constantly
swarming with foreigners, as a rhetorician describes it&mdash;had
the most stirring traffic. In the two Roman colonies
of Corinth and Patrae, and, moreover, in Athens constantly
filled by strangers seeing and learning, was concentrated
the larger banking&ndash;business of the province, which, in the
imperial period, as in the republican, lay largely in the
hands of Italians settled there. In places too of the
second rank, as in Argos, Elis, Mantinea in the Peloponnesus,
the Roman merchants who were settled formed
societies of their own, standing alongside of the burgesses.
In general trade and commerce were at a low ebb in
Achaia, particularly since Rhodes and Delos had ceased
to be emporia for the carrying traffic between Asia and
Europe, and the latter had been drawn to Italy. Piracy
was restrained, and even the land&ndash;routes were tolerably
secure;<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> but withal the old happy times did not return.
The desolation of the Piraeus has been already mentioned;
it was an event when one of the great Egyptian corn ships
once strayed thither. Nauplia, the port of Argos, the
most considerable coast town of the Peloponnesus after
Patrae, lay likewise desolate.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Roads.</span>It is in accordance with this state of things that virtually
nothing was done for the roads of this province in
the imperial period; Roman milestones have been found
only in the immediate vicinity of Patrae and of Athens,
and even these belong to the emperors of the end of the
third and of the fourth century; evidently the earlier
governments renounced the idea of restoring communications
here. Hadrian alone undertook at least to make
the equally important and short land&ndash;connection between
Corinth and Megara&mdash;by way of the wretched pass of the
&#8220;Scironian cliffs&#8221;&mdash;into a practicable road by means of
huge embankments thrown into the sea.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Piercing of
the
Isthmus.</span>The long&ndash;discussed plan of piercing the Corinthian
isthmus, which the dictator Caesar had conceived, was
subsequently attempted, first by the emperor Gaius and
then by Nero. The latter even, on occasion of his abode
in Greece, personally took the first step towards the canal,
and caused 6000 Jewish captives to work at it for a series
of months. In connection with the cutting operations
resumed in our own day, considerable remains of these
buildings have been brought to light, which show that
the works were tolerably far advanced when they were
broken off, probably not in consequence of the revolution
that broke out some time afterwards in the West, but
because here, just as with the similar Egyptian canal, in
consequence of the difference of level that was erroneously
assumed to exist between the two seas, there were apprehensions
of the destruction of the island of Aegina and
of further mischief on the completion of the canal. No
doubt had this canal been completed, it would have
shortened the course of traffic between Asia and Italy,
but it would not have tended specially to benefit Greece
itself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Epirus.</span>It has already been remarked &#40;<a href="#Page_256">p.&nbsp;256</a>&#41; that the regions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
to the north of Hellas, Thessaly, and Macedonia, and at
least from Trajan&#8217;s time Epirus, were in the imperial
period separated administratively from Greece. Of these
the small Epirot province, which was administered by an
imperial governor of the second rank, never recovered
from the devastation to which it had been subjected in
the course of the third Macedonian war &#40;ii.&nbsp;329&#41;<span class="sidenote2">ii.&nbsp;309.</span>. The
mountainous and poor interior possessed no city of note
and a thinly&ndash;scattered population. Augustus had endeavoured
to raise the not less desolated coast by the
construction of two towns&mdash;by the completion of the
colony of Roman citizens already resolved on by Caesar
in Buthrotum overagainst Corcyra, which, however, attained
no true prosperity, and by the founding of the
<span class="sidenote">Nicopolis.</span>Greek town Nicopolis, just at the spot where the headquarters
had been stationed before the decisive battle of
Actium, at the southernmost point of Epirus, about
an hour and a half north of Prevesa, according to the
design of Augustus, at once a permanent memorial of the
great naval victory and the centre of a newly flourishing
Hellenic life. This foundation was new in its kind as
Roman.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> The words of a contemporary Greek poet,
which we quote below, simply express what Augustus here
did; he united the whole surrounding territory, southern
Epirus, the opposite region of Acarnania with the island
of Leucas, and even a portion of Aetolia into one urban
domain, and transferred the inhabitants still left in the
decaying townships there existing to the new city of
Nicopolis, opposite to which on the Acarnanian shore the
old temple of the Actian Apollo was magnificently renewed
and enlarged.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Its character
and
privileges.</span>A Roman city had never been founded in this way;
this was the <em>synoekismos</em> of the successors of Alexander.
Quite in the same way had king Cassander constituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
the Macedonian towns Thessalonica and Cassandreia,
Demetrius Poliorcetes the Thessalian town Demetrias,
and Lysimachus the town of Lysimachia on the Thracian
Chersonese out of a number of surrounding townships
divested of their independence. In keeping with the
Greek character of the foundation Nicopolis was, according
to the intention of its founder, to become a Greek city on
a great scale.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> It obtained freedom and autonomy like
Athens and Sparta, and was intended, as already stated,
to wield the fifth part of the votes in the Amphictiony
representing all Hellas, and to do so, like Athens, without
alternating with other towns &#40;<a href="#Page_254">p.&nbsp;254</a>&#41;. This new Actian
shrine of Apollo was erected quite after the model of
Olympia, with a quadriennial festival, which even bore
the name of &#8220;Olympia&#8221; alongside of its own, had equal
rank and equal privileges, and even its Actiads as the
former had its Olympiads;<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> the town of Nicopolis stood
related to it like the town of Elis to the Olympian
temple.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> Everything properly Italian was carefully
avoided in the erection of the town as well as in the
religious arrangements, however natural it might be to
mould after the Roman fashion the &#8220;city of victory&#8221; so
intimately associated with the founding of the empire.
Whoever considers the arrangements of Augustus in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
Hellas in this connection, and especially this remarkable
corner&ndash;stone, will not be able to resist the conviction
that Augustus believed that a reorganisation of Hellas
under the protection of the Roman principate was
practicable, and wished to carry it out. The locality at
least was well chosen for it, as at that time, before the
foundation of Patrae, there was no larger city on the
whole Greek west coast. But what Augustus may have
hoped for at the commencement of his sole rule, he did
not attain, and perhaps even subsequently abandoned,
when he gave to Patrae the form of a Roman colony.
Nicopolis remained, as the extensive ruins and the
numerous coins show, comparatively populous and
flourishing;<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> but its citizens do not appear to have
taken a prominent part in commerce and manufactures
or otherwise. Northern Epirus, which, like the adjoining
Illyricum bordering on Macedonia, was in greater part
inhabited by Albanian tribes and was not placed under
Nicopolis, continued during the imperial period in its
primitive condition, which still subsists in some measure at
the present day. &#8220;Epirus and Illyricum,&#8221; says Strabo,
&#8220;are in great part a desert; where men are found, they
dwell in villages and in ruins of earlier towns; even the
oracle of Dodona,&#8221;&mdash;laid waste in the Mithradatic war
by the Thracians &#40;iii.&nbsp;312&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;296.</span>,&mdash;&#8220;is extinct like everything
else.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Thessaly.</span>Thessaly, in itself a purely Hellenic district as well
as Aetolia and Acarnania, was in the imperial period
separated administratively from the province of Achaia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
and placed under the governor of Macedonia. What
holds true of northern Greece applies also to Thessaly.
The freedom and autonomy which Caesar had allowed
generally to the Thessalians, or rather had not withdrawn
from them, seem to have been withdrawn, on
account of misuse, from them by Augustus, so that
subsequently Pharsalus alone retained this legal position;<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>
Roman colonists were not settled in the district. It
retained its separate diet in Larisa, and civic self&ndash;administration
was left with the Thessalians, as with the dependent
Greeks in Achaia. Thessaly was far the most fertile
region of the whole peninsula, and still exported grain in
the fourth century; nevertheless Dio of Prusa says that
even the Peneus flows through waste land; and in the
imperial period money was coined in this region only to
a very small extent. Hadrian and Diocletian exerted
themselves to restore the roads of the country, but they
alone, so far as we see, of the Roman emperors did so.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Macedonia.</span>Macedonia, as a Roman administrative district under
the empire, was materially curtailed as compared with
the Macedonia of the republic. Certainly, like the latter,
it reached from sea to sea, inasmuch as the coast as
well of the Aegean Sea from the region of Thessaly
belonging to Macedonia as far as the mouth of the
Nestus &#40;Mesta&#41;, as of the Adriatic from the Aous<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> as
far as the Drilon &#40;Drin&#41;, was reckoned to this district;
the latter territory, not properly Macedonian but Illyrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
land, but already in the republican period assigned to
the governor of Macedonia &#40;iii.&nbsp;44&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;42.</span>, remained with the
province also during the time of the empire. But we
have already stated that Greece south of Oeta was
separated from it. The northern frontier towards Moesia
and the east frontier towards Thrace remained indeed
in so far unaltered, as the province in the imperial period
reached as far as the Macedonia proper of the republic
had reached, viz. on the north almost as far as the vale
of the Erigon, eastward as far as the river Nestus; but
while in the time of the republic the Dardani and the
Thracians, and all the tribes of the north and north&ndash;east
adjoining the Macedonian territory, had to do with this
governor in their circumstances of peaceful or warlike
contact, and in so far it could be said that the Macedonian
boundary reached as far as the Roman lances, the
Macedonian governor of the imperial period bore sway
only over the district assigned to him, which no longer
bordered on neighbours half or wholly independent.
As the defence of the frontier was transferred in the
first instance to the kingdom of the Thracians which
had come under allegiance to Rome, and soon to the
governor of the new province Moesia, the governor of
Macedonia was from the outset relieved of his command.
There was hardly any fighting on Macedonian soil under
the empire; only the barbarian Dardani on the upper
Axius &#40;Vardar&#41; still at times pillaged the peaceful
neighbouring province. There is no report, moreover,
from this province of any local revolts.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Nationalities.</span>From the more southerly Greek districts this&mdash;the
most northerly&mdash;stood aloof as well in its national basis
as in the stage of its civilisation. While the Macedonians
proper on the lower course of the Haliacmon &#40;Vistritza&#41;
and the Axius &#40;Vardar&#41;, as far as the Strymon, were an
originally Greek stock, whose diversity from the more
southern Hellenes had no further significance for the
present epoch, and while the Hellenic colonisation
embraced within its sphere both coasts&mdash;on the west
with Apollonia and Dyrrachium, on the east in particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
with the townships of the Chalcidian peninsula&mdash;the
interior of the province, on the other hand, was filled
with a confused mass of non&ndash;Greek peoples, which must
have differed from the present state of things in the same
region more as to elements than as to results. After
the Celts who had pushed forward into this region, the
Scordisci, had been driven back by the generals of the
Roman republic, the interior of Macedonia fell to the
share especially of Illyrian stocks in the west and north,
of Thracian in the east. Of both we have already spoken
previously; here they come into consideration only so
far as the Greek organisation, at least the urban, was
probably introduced&mdash;as in the earlier,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> so also in the
imperial period&mdash;among these stocks only in a very
limited measure. On the whole, an energetic impulse
of urban development never pervaded the interior of
Macedonia; the more remote districts hardly reached&mdash;at
least as in a real sense&mdash;beyond the village&ndash;system.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Greek
polity.</span>The Greek polity itself was not a spontaneous growth
in this monarchical country, as it was in Hellas proper,
but was introduced by the princes, who were more Hellenes
than their subjects. What shape it had is little known;
yet the civic presidency of politarchs uniformly recurring
in Thessalonica, Edessa, Lete, and not met with elsewhere,
leads us to infer a perceptible, and indeed in itself probable,
diversity of the Macedonian urban constitution from
that elsewhere usual in Hellas. The Greek cities, which
the Romans found existing, retained their organisation and
their rights; Thessalonica, the most considerable of them,
also freedom and autonomy. There existed a league and
a diet &#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοινόν</span>&#41; of the Macedonian towns, similar to those
in Achaia and Thessaly. It deserves mention, as an evidence
of the continued working of the memories of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
old and great times, that still in the middle of the third
century after Christ the diet of Macedonia and individual
Macedonian towns issued coins on which, in place of the
head and the name of the reigning emperor, came those
of Alexander the Great. The pretty numerous colonies
of Roman burgesses which Augustus established in Macedonia,
Byllis not far from Apollonia, Dyrrachium on the
Adriatic, on the other coast Dium, Pella, Cassandreia, in
the region of Thrace proper Philippi, were all of them
older Greek towns, which obtained merely a number of
new burgesses and a different legal position, and were
called into life primarily by the need of providing quarters
in a civilised and not greatly populous province for Italian
soldiers who had served their time, and for whom there
was no longer room in Italy itself. The granting of
Italian rights certainly took place only to gild for the
veterans their settlement abroad. That it was never
intended to draw Macedonia into the development of
Italian culture is evinced, apart from all else, by the fact
that Thessalonica remained Greek and the capital of the
country. By its side flourished Philippi, properly a mining
town, constituted on account of the neighbouring gold
mines, favoured by the emperors as the seat of the battle
which definitively founded the monarchy, and on account
of the numerous veterans who took part in it and subsequently
settled there. A Roman, not colonial, municipal
constitution was obtained already in the first period of the
empire by Stobi, the already mentioned most northerly
frontier&ndash;town of Macedonia towards Moesia, at the confluence
of the Erigon with the Axius, in a commercial as in
a military point of view an important position, and which,
it may be conjectured, had already in the Macedonian
time attained to Greek polity.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Economy.
Roads and
levy.</span>In an economic point of view little was done on the
part of the state for Macedonia under the emperors; at
least there is no appearance of any special care on their
part for this province, which was not put under their own
administration. The military road already constructed
under the republic right across the country from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
Dyrrachium to Thessalonica, one of the most important
arteries of intercourse in the whole empire, called forth renewed
effort, so far as we know, only from emperors of the
third century, and first from Severus Antoninus; the
towns adjacent to it, Lychnidus on the Ochrida&ndash;lake and
Heraclea Lyncestis &#40;Bitolia&#41;, were never of much account.
Yet Macedonia was, economically, better situated than
Greece. It far excelled it in fertility; as still at present
the province of Thessalonica is relatively well cultivated
and well peopled, so in the description of the empire
from the time of Constantius, at all events when Constantinople
was already in existence, Macedonia is reckoned
among the specially wealthy districts. If for Achaia and
Thessaly our documents concerning the Roman levy are
absolutely silent, Macedonia on the other hand was drawn
upon, in particular for the imperial guard, to a considerable
extent, more strongly than the most of the Greek districts&mdash;on
which, no doubt, the familiarity of the Macedonians
with regular war&ndash;service and their excellent
qualifications for it, and probably also the relatively small
development of the urban system in this province, had an
important bearing. Thessalonica, the metropolis of the
province, and its most populous and most industrial town
at this time, represented likewise under various forms in
literature, has also secured to itself an honourable place in
political history by the brave resistance which its citizens
opposed to the barbarians in the terrible times of the
Gothic invasions &#40;<a href="#Page_248">p.&nbsp;248</a>&#41;.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Thrace.</span>If Macedonia was a half&ndash;Greek, Thrace was a non&ndash;Greek
land. Of the great but for us vanished Thracian
stock we have formerly &#40;<a href="#Page_207">p.&nbsp;207</a>&#41; spoken. Into its domain
Hellenism came simply from without; and it will not be
superfluous in the first instance to glance back and to set
forth how often Hellenism had previously knocked at the
gates of the most southerly region which this stock possessed,
and which we still name after it, and how little it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
had hitherto penetrated into the interior, in order to make
clear what was left for Rome here to overtake and what
it did overtake.<span class="sidenote">Philip and
Alexander.</span>Philip, the father of Alexander, first
subjected Thrace, and founded not merely Calybe in the
neighbourhood of Byzantium, but also in the heart of the
land the town which thenceforth bore his name. Alexander,
here too the precursor of Roman policy, arrived at
and crossed the Danube, and made this stream the northern
boundary of his empire; the Thracians in his army played
by no means the least part in the subjugation of Asia.
After his death the Hellespont seemed as though it would
become one of the great centres of the new formation of
states, and the wide domain from thence to the Danube<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a>
as though it would become the northern half of a Greek
empire, and would promise for the capital of Lysimachus,
the former governor of<span class="sidenote">Lysimachus.</span>Thrace&mdash;the town of Lysimachia,
newly established in the Thracian Chersonese&mdash;a like
future as for the capitals of the marshals of Syria and
Egypt. But this result was not attained; the independence
of this kingdom did not survive the fall of its first
ruler &#40;281 <span class="smcap"><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></span>, 473 <span class="smcap lowercase">U.C.</span>&#41;. In the century which elapsed
from that time to the establishment of the ascendancy of
Rome in the East, attempts were made, sometimes by the
Seleucids, sometimes by the Ptolemies, sometimes by the
Attalids, to bring the European possessions of Lysimachus
under their power, but all of them without lasting result.
<span class="sidenote">Empire of
Tylis.</span> The empire of Tylis in the Haemus, which the Celts not
long after the death of Alexander, and nearly at the same
time with their permanent settlement in Asia Minor, had
founded in the Moeso&ndash;Thracian territory, destroyed the
seed of Greek civilisation within its sphere, and itself
succumbed during the Hannibalic war to the assaults of
the Thracians, who extirpated these intruders to the last
man. Thenceforth there was not in Thrace any leading
power at all; the relations subsisting between the Greek
coast&ndash;towns and the princes of the several tribes, which
would probably correspond approximately to those before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Alexander&#8217;s time, are illustrated by the description which
Polybius gives of the most important of these towns:
&#8220;Where the Byzantines had sowed, there the Thracian
barbarians reaped, and against these neither the sword
nor money is of avail; if the citizens kill one of the
princes, three others thereupon invade their territory, and,
if they buy off one, five more demand the like annual
payment.&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Later
Macedonian
rulers.</span>The efforts on the part of the later Macedonian rulers
to gain once more a firm footing in Thrace, and in particular
to bring under their power the Greek towns of the
south coast, were opposed by the Romans, partly in order to
keep down the development of Macedonia&#8217;s power generally,
partly in order not to allow the important &#8220;royal
road&#8221; leading to the East&mdash;that along which Xerxes
marched to Greece and the Scipios marched against
Antiochus&mdash;to fall in all its extent into Macedonian
hands. Already, after the battle at Cynoscephalae, the
frontier&ndash;line was drawn nearly such as it thenceforth
remained. The two last Macedonian rulers made several
attempts, either directly to establish themselves in Thrace
or to attach to themselves its individual rulers by treaties;
the last Philip even gained over Philippopolis once more,
and put into it a garrison, which, it is true, the Odrysae
soon drove out afresh. Neither he nor his son succeeded
in placing matters on a permanent footing; and the independence
conceded by Rome to the Thracians after the
breaking up of Macedonia destroyed whatever Hellenic
germs might still be left there. Thrace itself became&mdash;in
part already in the republican, and more decidedly in
the imperial period&mdash;a Roman vassal&ndash;principality, and
then in 46 a Roman province &#40;<a href="#Page_211">p.&nbsp;211</a>&#41;; but the Hellenising
of the land had not passed beyond the fringe of Greek
colonial towns, which in the earliest period had been
established round this coast, and in course of time had
sunk rather than risen. Powerful and permanent as was
the hold of Macedonian civilisation on the East, as weak
and perishable was its contact with Thrace; Philip and
Alexander themselves appear to have reluctantly undertaken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
and to have but lightly valued, their settlements in
this land.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> Till far into the imperial period the land
remained with the natives; the Greek towns that were
still left along the coast, almost all on the decline, remained
without any Greek land in their rear.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Greek
towns in
Thrace and
on the
Black Sea.</span>This belt of Hellenic towns stretching from the
Macedonian frontier to the Tauric Chersonese was of very
unequal texture. In the south it was close and compact
from Abdera onward to Byzantium on the Dardanelles; yet
none of these towns held a prominent position in later
times with the exception of Byzantium, which through
the fertility of its territory, its productive tunny fisheries,
its uncommonly favourable position for trade, its industrial
diligence, and the energy of its citizens&mdash;heightened
merely and hardened by its exposed situation&mdash;was
enabled to defy even the worst times of Hellenic anarchy.
Far more scantily had the settlements developed themselves
on the west coast of the Black Sea; among those
subsequently belonging to the Roman province of Thrace
Mesembria alone was of some importance; among those
subsequently Moesian Odessus &#40;Varna&#41; and Tomis &#40;K&uuml;stendje&#41;.
Beyond the mouths of the Danube and the
boundary of the Roman empire, on the northern shore of
the Pontus, there lay amidst the barbarian land Tyra<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> and
Olbia; further on, the old and great Greek mercantile
cities in what is now the Crimea&mdash;Heraclea or Chersonesus
and Panticapaeum&mdash;formed a stately copestone.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Under
Roman
protection.</span>All these settlements enjoyed Roman protection, after
the Romans had become generally the leading power on
the Graeco&ndash;Asiatic continent; and the strong arm, which
often came down heavily on the Hellenic land proper,
prevented here at least disasters like the destruction of
Lysimachia. The protection of these Greeks devolved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
the republican period partly on the governor of Macedonia,
partly on the governor of Bithynia, after this became
Roman; Byzantium subsequently remained with Bithynia.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a>
We may add that in the imperial period, after the erection
of the governorship of Moesia and subsequently of that
of Thrace, the supplying of protection devolved on
these.</p>

<p>Protection and favour were granted by Rome to these
Greeks from the first; but neither the republic nor the
earlier imperial period made efforts for the extension of
Hellenism.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> After Thrace had become Roman, it was
divided into land&ndash;districts;<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> and almost down to the end
of the first century there is no record of the laying out of
a town there, with the exception of two colonies of Claudius

Perinthus, and Deultus on the most northern coast.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>
<span class="sidenote">Philippopolis and other towns with civic rights.</span>
Domitian began by introducing the Greek urban constitution
into the interior, at first for the capital of the country,
Philippopolis. Under Trajan a series of other Thracian
townships obtained like civic rights; Topirus not far
from Abdera, Nicopolis on the Nestus, Plotinopolis on the
Hebrus, Pautalia near K&ouml;stendil, Serdica now Sofia,
Augusta Traiana near Alt&ndash;Zagora, a second Nicopolis on
the northern slope of Haemus,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> besides, on the coast, Traianopolis
at the mouth of the Hebrus; further, under
Hadrian Adrianopolis, the modern Adrianople. All these
towns were not colonies of foreigners but polities of Greek
organisation, composed after the model set up by Augustus
in the Epirot Nicopolis; it was a civilising and Hellenising
of the province from above downwards. A Thracian
diet existed thenceforth in Philippopolis just as in the
properly Greek provinces. This last offshoot of Hellenism
was not the weakest. The country was rich and charming&mdash;a
coin of the town Pautalia praises the fourfold
blessing of the ears of grain, of the grapes, of the silver,
and of the gold; and Philippopolis as well as the beautiful
valley of the Tundja were the home of rose&ndash;culture and
of rose&ndash;oil&mdash;and the vigour of the Thracian type was not
broken. Here was developed a dense and prosperous
population; we have already mentioned the largeness of
the levy in Thrace, and few territories stand on an equality
with Thrace at this epoch in the activity of the urban
mints. When Philippopolis succumbed in the year 251<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
to the Goths &#40;<a href="#Page_240">p.&nbsp;240</a>&#41;, it is said to have numbered
100,000 inhabitants. The energetic part taken by the
Byzantines in favour of the emperor of the Greek East,
Pescennius Niger, and the several years&#8217; resistance which
the town even after his defeat opposed to the victor, show
the resources and the courage of these Thracian townsmen.
If the Byzantines here, too, succumbed and lost
even for a season their civic rights, the time, for which the
rise of the Thracian land paved the way, was soon to set
in, when Byzantium should become the new Hellenic
Rome and the chief capital of the remodelled empire.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Lower
Moesia.</span>In the neighbouring province of lower Moesia a similar
development took place, although on a smaller scale. The
Greek coast&ndash;towns, the metropolis of which, at least in the
Roman period, was Tomis, were, probably on the constituting
of the Roman province of Moesia, grouped as the
&#8220;Five&ndash;cities&ndash;league of the left shore of the Black Sea,&#8221; or
as it was also called, &#8220;of the Greeks,&#8221; that is, the Greeks of
this province.<span class="sidenote">Tomis and
the Pontic
Pentapolis.</span>Later there was annexed to this league, as
a sixth town, that of Marcianopolis, constructed by Trajan
not far from the coast on the Thracian frontier, and
organised, like the Thracian towns, after the Greek model.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
We have already observed that the camp&ndash;towns on the
bank of the Danube, and generally the townships
called into life by Rome in the interior, were instituted
after the Italian model; lower Moesia was the only
Roman province intersected by the linguistic boundary,
inasmuch as the Tomitanian cities&ndash;league belonged to the
Greek, the Danubian towns, like Durostorum and Oescus
to the Latin, linguistic domain. In other respects essentially
the same holds true of this Moesian cities&ndash;league, as
was remarked regarding Thrace. We have a description
of Tomis from the last years of Augustus, doubtless by
one banished thither for punishment, but certainly true in
substance. The population consists for the greater part
of Getae and Sarmatae; they wear, like the Dacians on
Trajan&#8217;s column, skins and trousers, long waving hair and
unshorn beard, and appear in the street on horseback
and armed with the bow, with the quiver on their shoulder,
and the knife in their girdle. The few Greeks who are
found among them have adopted the barbarian customs,
including the trousers, and are able to express themselves
as well or better in Getic than in Greek; he is lost, who
cannot make himself intelligible in Getic, and no man
understands a word of Latin. Before the gates rove
predatory bands of the most various peoples, and their
arrows not seldom fly over the protecting city&ndash;walls; he
who ventures to till his field does it at the peril of his life,
and ploughs in armour&mdash;at anyrate about the time of
Caesar&#8217;s dictatorship; on occasion of the raid of Burebista,
the town had fallen into the hands of the barbarians, and
a few years before that exile came to Tomis, during the
Dalmato&ndash;Pannonian insurrection, the fury of war had once
more raged over this region. The coins and the inscriptions
of that city accord well with these accounts, in so far
as the metropolis of the &#8220;left&ndash;Pontic cities&ndash;league&#8221; in the
pre&ndash;Roman period coined no silver, which several other of
these towns did; and, in general, coins and inscriptions
from the time before Trajan occur only in an isolated way.
But in the second and third centuries it was remodelled
and may be termed a foundation of Trajan with very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
much the same warrant as Marcianopolis, which likewise
quickly attained to considerable development. The barrier
formerly mentioned &#40;<a href="#Page_227">p.&nbsp;227</a>&#41; in the Dobrudscha served
at the same time as a protecting wall for the town of
Tomis. Behind this wall commerce and navigation
were flourishing. There was in the town a society of
Alexandrian merchants with its own chapel of Serapis;<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a>
in municipal liberality and municipal ambition the town
was inferior to no Greek town of middle size; it was still
even now bilingual, but in such a way that, alongside of
the Greek language always retained on the coins, here on
the border, where the two languages of the empire came
into contact, the Latin is also often employed even in
public monuments.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Tyra.</span>Beyond the imperial frontier, between the mouths of
the Danube and the Crimea, the Greek merchant had
made few settlements on the coast; there were here only
two Greek towns of note, both founded in remote times
by Miletus, Tyra at the mouth of the river of the same
name, the modern Dniester, and Olbia on the bay into
which the Borysthenes &#40;Dnieper&#41; and the Hypanis &#40;Bug&#41;
fall. The forlorn position of these Hellenes amidst the
barbarians pressing around them, in the time of the
Diadochi as well as during the earlier rule of the Roman
republic, has already been described &#40;iii.&nbsp;297&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;282.</span>. The emperors
brought help. In the year 56, that is, in the
exemplary beginning of Nero&#8217;s government, Tyra was
annexed to the province of Moesia.<span class="sidenote">Olbia.</span>Of the more remote
Olbia we possess a description from the age of Trajan;<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
the town was still bleeding from its old wounds; the
wretched walls enclosed equally wretched houses, and the
quarter then inhabited filled but a small portion of the old
considerable city&ndash;circuit, of which individual towers that
were left stood far off in the desolate plain; in the
temples there was no statue of the gods which did not
bear traces of the hands of the barbarians; the inhabitants
had not forgotten their Hellenic character, but they
dressed and fought after the manner of the Scythians,
with whom they were daily in conflict. Just as often as
by Greek names, they designated themselves by Scythian,
<em>i.e.</em> by those of Sarmatian stocks akin to the Iranians;<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a>
in fact, in the royal house itself Sauromates was a common
name. These towns were indebted doubtless for
their very continued existence less to their own power
than to the good&ndash;will or rather the self&ndash;interest of the
natives. The tribes settled on this coast were neither in
a position to carry on foreign trade from emporia of their
own, nor could they dispense with it; in the Hellenic
coast&ndash;towns they bought salt, articles of clothing and
wine, and the more civilised princes protected in some
measure the strangers against the attacks of the barbarians
proper. The earlier rulers of Rome must have had
scruples at undertaking the difficult protection of this
remote settlement; nevertheless Pius, when the Scythians
once more besieged them, sent to them Roman auxiliary
troops, and compelled the barbarians to offer peace and furnish
hostages. The town must have been incorporated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
directly with the empire by Severus, from whom onward
Olbia struck coins with the image of the Roman rulers.
As a matter of course this annexation extended only to
the town&ndash;territories themselves, and it never was intended
to bring the barbarian dwellers around Tyra and Olbia
under the Roman sceptre. It has already been remarked
&#40;<a href="#Page_239">p.&nbsp;239</a>&#41; that these towns were the first which, presumably
under Alexander &#40;&#8224; 235&#41;, succumbed to the incipient
Gothic invasion.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Bosporus.</span>If the Greeks had but sparingly settled on the mainland
to the north of the Black Sea, the great peninsula
projecting from this coast, the Tauric Chersonesus&mdash;the
modern Crimea&mdash;had for long been in great part in their
hands. Separated by the mountains, which the Taurians
occupied, the two centres of the Greek settlement upon it
were, at the western end the Doric free town of Heraclea
or Chersonesus &#40;Sebastopol&#41;, at the eastern the principality
of Panticapaeum or Bosporus &#40;Kertch&#41;. King Mithradates
had at the summit of his power united the two, and
here established for himself a second northern empire &#40;iii.&nbsp;298&#41;, which then, after the collapse of his power, was left
as the only remnant of it to his son and murderer Pharnaces.
When the latter, after the war between Caesar and
Pompeius, attempted to regain his father&#8217;s dominion in
Asia Minor, Caesar had vanquished him &#40;iv.&nbsp;439&#41;, and
declared him to have forfeited also the Bosporan empire. <span class="sidenote">Asander.</span>
In the meanwhile Asander, the governor left there by
Pharnaces, had renounced allegiance to the king in the
hope of acquiring the kingdom for himself by this service
rendered to Caesar. When Pharnaces after his defeat
returned to his Bosporan kingdom, he at first indeed
repossessed himself of his capital, but ultimately was
worsted, and fell bravely fighting in the last battle&mdash;as a
soldier at least, not unequal to his father. The succession
was contested between Asander, who was in fact master
of the land, and Mithradates of Pergamus, an able officer
of Caesar, whom the latter had invested with the Bosporan
principality; both sought at the same time to lean
for support on the dynasty heretofore ruling in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
Bosporus and on the great Mithradates, inasmuch as
Asander married Dynamis, the daughter of Pharnaces,
while Mithradates, sprung from a Pergamene burgess&ndash;family,
asserted that he was an illegitimate son of the
great Mithradates Eupator&mdash;whether it was that this
rumour determined the selection, or that it was put into
circulation in order to justify it. As Caesar himself was
called in the first instance to attend to more important
tasks, arms decided between the legitimate and the illegitimate
Caesarian, and once more in favour of the latter;
Mithradates fell in combat, and Asander remained master
in the Bosporus. In the outset&mdash;without doubt, because
he had not the confirmation of the lord&ndash;paramount&mdash;he
avoided assuming the name of king, and contented himself
with the title of archon, borne by the older princes of
Panticapaeum; but he soon procured, probably even from
Caesar himself, the confirmation of his rule and the royal
title.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> At his death &#40;737&ndash;738 <span class="smcap lowercase">U.C.</span>&#41;<span class="sidenote2">17&ndash;16.</span> he left his kingdom to
his wife Dynamis. So strong was still the power of
hereditary succession and of the name of Mithradates, that
both a certain Scribonianus, who first attempted to occupy
Asander&#8217;s place, <span class="sidenote">Polemon.</span>and after him king Polemon of Pontus,
to whom Augustus promised the Bosporan kingdom, conjoined
with the taking up of the dominion a marriage&ndash;alliance
with Dynamis; moreover, the former asserted
that he was himself a grandson of Mithradates, while king
Polemon, soon after the death of Dynamis, married a
granddaughter of Antonius, and consequently a kinswoman
of the imperial house. After his early death&mdash;he
fell in conflict with the Aspurgiani on the Asiatic coast&mdash;his
children under age did not succeed him; and even
with his grandson of the same name, whom the emperor
Gaius reinstated, notwithstanding his boyish age, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
year 38, into the two principalities of his father, the
Bosporan kingdom did not long remain. In his place
the emperor Claudius called a real or alleged descendant
of Mithradates Eupator, and in this house, apparently,
the principality thenceforth continued.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Eupatorids.</span><span class="sidenote">Extent of
the Bosporan
rule.</span>While in the Roman state elsewhere the dependent
principality disappears after the end of the first dynasty,
and from Trajan&#8217;s time the principle of direct government
is carried out through the whole extent of the Roman
empire, the Bosporan kingdom subsisted under Roman
supremacy down to the fourth century. It was only after
the centre of gravity of the empire was shifted to Constantinople
that this state became merged in the empire at
large,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> in order to be soon thereafter abandoned by it and
to become, at least in greater part, the prey of the Huns.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
The Bosporus, however, in reality was and continued to
be more a town than a kingdom, and had more similarity
with the town&ndash;districts of Tyra and Olbia than with the
kingdoms of Cappadocia and Numidia. Here, too, the
Romans protected only the Hellenic town Panticapaeum,
and did not aim at enlargement of the bounds and subjugation
of the interior any more than in Tyra and Olbia.
To the domain of the prince of Panticapaeum belonged
the Greek settlements of Theudosia on the peninsula itself,
and Phanagoria &#40;Taman&#41; on the opposite Asiatic coast, but
not Chersonesus<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a>&mdash;or at least only somewhat as Athens belonged
to the province of the governor of Achaia. The town
had obtained autonomy from the Romans, and saw in the
prince its immediate protector, not its sovereign; as a free
town, too, in the imperial period, it never coined with the
stamp either of king or emperor. On the mainland, not
even the town which the Greeks called Tanais&mdash;a
stirring emporium at the mouth of the Don, but hardly
a Greek foundation&mdash;stood permanently under subjection
to the Roman vassal&ndash;princes.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> Of the more or
less barbarian tribes on the peninsula itself, and on the
European and Asiatic coast southward from Tanais,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
probably only the nearest stood in a fixed relation of
dependence.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Military
position of
the Bosporus.</span>The territory of Panticapaeum was too extensive and
too important, especially for mercantile intercourse, to be
left like Olbia and Tyra to the administration of changing
municipal officials and a far distant governor; therefore
it was entrusted to hereditary princes&mdash;a course further
recommended by the circumstance that it might not seem
advisable to transfer directly to the empire the relations
which this region sustained to the surrounding tribes.
The rulers of the Bosporan house, in spite of their Achaemenid
pedigree and their Achaemenid mode of reckoning
time, felt themselves thoroughly as Greek princes, and
traced back their origin, after the good Hellenic fashion,
to Herakles and the Eumolpids. The dependence of
these Greeks on Rome&mdash;the royal in Panticapaeum, as the
republican in Chersonesus&mdash;was implied in the nature of
things, and they never thought of rising against the protecting
arm of the empire; if once, under the emperor
Claudius, the Roman troops had to march against an insubordinate
prince of the Bosporus,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> yet withal this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
region itself, amidst the fearful confusion in the middle
of the third century, which especially affected it, never
broke away from the empire even when it was falling to
pieces.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> The prosperous merchant&ndash;towns, permanently in
need of military protection amidst a flux of barbaric
peoples, held to Rome as the advanced posts to the main
army. The garrison was doubtless chiefly raised in the
land itself, and to create and manage it was beyond doubt
the main task of the king of the Bosporus. The coins,
which were struck on occasion of the investiture of such
a king, exhibit doubtless the curule chair and the other
honorary presents usual at such investiture, but also by
their side shield, helmet, sword, battle&ndash;axe, and war&ndash;horse;
it was no peaceful office which this prince undertook. The
first of them, whom Augustus appointed, fell in conflict
with the barbarians, and of his successors, <em>e.g.</em> king Sauromates,
son of Rhoemetalces, fought in the first years of
Severus with the Siracae and the Scythians&mdash;perhaps it
was not quite without reason that he stamped his coins
with the feats of Herakles. By sea, too, he had to be
active, especially in keeping down the piracy which never
ceased in the Black Sea &#40;<a href="#Page_242">p.&nbsp;242</a>&#41;; that Sauromates likewise
is credited with having brought the Taurians to order
and chastised piracy. Roman troops, however, were also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
stationed in the peninsula, perhaps a division of the Pontic
fleet, certainly a detachment of the Moesian army; their
presence even in small numbers showed to the barbarians
that the dreaded legionary stood behind these Greeks. In
another way still the empire protected them; at least in
the later period there were regularly paid from the imperial
chest to the princes of the Bosporus sums of money,
of which they stood in need, in so far as the buying off
of the hostile incursions by stated annual payments probably
became a standing practice here&mdash;in what was not
directly territory of the empire&mdash;still earlier than elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Position of
this vassal&ndash;prince.</span>That the centralisation of the government had its
application also in reference to this prince, and he stood
to the Roman Caesar on a footing not much different from
that of the burgomaster of Athens, is in various ways
apparent; it deserves mention that king Asander and the
queen Dynamis struck gold coins with their name and
their effigy, whereas king Polemon and his immediate successors,
while retaining the right of coining gold, seeing that
this territory as well as the adjoining barbarians were for
long accustomed exclusively to gold currency, were induced
to furnish their gold pieces with the name and the image
of the reigning emperor. In like manner from Polemon&#8217;s
time the prince of this land was at the same time the
chief priest for life of the emperor and of the imperial
house. In other respects the administration and the court
retained the forms introduced under Mithradates after the
model of the Persian grand monarchy, although the chief
secretary &#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχιγραμματεύς</span>&#41; and the chief chamberlain &#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχικοιτωνείτης</span>&#41;
of the court of Panticapaeum stood related to
the leading court&ndash;officers of the great kings, as the enemy
of the Romans Mithradates Eupator to his descendant
Tiberius Julius Eupator, who, on account of his claim to
the Bosporan throne, appeared as a suitor at Rome at the
bar of the emperor Pius.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Trade and
commerce
in the
Bosporus.</span>This northern Greece remained valuable for the empire
on account of its commercial relations. Though these
at this epoch were doubtless less important than in earlier
times,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> yet the mercantile intercourse continued very lively.
In the Augustan period the tribes of the steppes brought
slaves and skins,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> the merchants of civilisation articles of
clothing, wine, and other luxuries to Tanais; in a still
higher degree Phanagoria was the dep&#244;t for the exports of
the natives, Panticapaeum for the imports of the Greeks.
Those troubles in the Bosporus in the Claudian age were
a severe blow for the merchants of Byzantium. That the
Goths began their piratic voyages in the third century by
pressing the Bosporan vessels to lend them involuntary
aid, has been already mentioned &#40;<a href="#Page_244">p.&nbsp;244</a>&#41;. It was doubtless
in consequence of this traffic, indispensable for the
barbarian neighbours themselves, that the citizens of Chersonesus
maintained their ground even after the withdrawal
of the Roman garrisons, and were able subsequently&mdash;when
in Justinian&#8217;s time the power of the empire once
more asserted itself in this direction&mdash;to return as Greeks
into the Greek empire.</p>

<p class="head3">ASIA MINOR.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> great peninsula which is washed on three sides by the
three seas, the Black, the Aegean, and the Mediterranean,
and which is connected towards the east with the Asiatic
continent proper, will, so far as it belongs to the frontier&ndash;territory
of the empire, be dealt with in the next section,
which treats of the region of the Euphrates and the
relations between the Romans and Parthians. Here we
have to set forth the peaceful relations, more especially
of the western districts, under the imperial government.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The natives
and the
colonists.</span>The original, or at any rate pre&ndash;Greek, population of
these wide regions held its ground in many places to a
considerable extent down to the imperial period. The
greatest part of Bithynia certainly belonged to the
formerly discussed Thracian stock; Phrygia, Lydia,
Cilicia, Cappadocia, show very manifold and not easily
unravelled survivals of older linguistic epochs, which in
various forms reach down to the Roman period; strange
names of gods, men, and places meet us everywhere.
But, so far as our view reaches&mdash;and it is but seldom
allowed to penetrate here very deeply&mdash;these elements
appear only losing ground and waning, essentially as
a negation of civilisation or&mdash;what seems to us here
at least to coincide with it&mdash;Hellenising. We shall
return at the fitting place to the individual groups of
this category; so far as concerns the historical development
of Asia Minor in the imperial period there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
but two active nationalities, the two which were the last
immigrants, the Hellenes in the beginnings of the historical
period, and the Celts during the troublous times of the
Diadochi.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Hellenic
and Hellenistic
culture.</span>The history of the Hellenes of Asia Minor, so far
as it forms a part of Roman history, has already been
set forth. In the remote age, when the coasts of the
Mediterranean were first navigated and settled, and the
world began to be apportioned among the progressive
nations at the expense of those left behind, the flood of
Hellenic emigration had poured no doubt over all the
shores of the Mediterranean Sea, but yet nowhere&mdash;not
even towards Italy and Sicily,&mdash;in so broad a stream as
over the Aegean Sea rich in islands, and the adjacent
charming coast of anterior Asia rich in harbours. Thereafter
the west&ndash;Asiatic Greeks themselves had taken an
active part, above all the rest, in the further conquest of
the world, and had helped to settle from Miletus the
coasts of the Black, and from Phocaea and Cnidus those
of the Western, Sea. In Asia Hellenic civilisation
doubtless laid hold of the inhabitants of the interior, the
Mysians, Lydians, Carians, Lycians; and even the Persian
great power remained not unaffected by it. But the
Hellenes themselves possessed nothing but the fringe of
coast, including at the utmost the lower course of the
larger rivers and the islands. They were not able here
to gain continental conquests and a power of their own
by land overagainst the powerful native princes; moreover
the interior of Asia Minor, highlying and in great part
but little capable of cultivation, was not so attractive for
settlement as the coasts, and the communications of the
latter with the interior were difficult. Essentially in
consequence of this, the Asiatic Hellenes attained still
less than the European to inward union and to great
power of their own, and early learned submissiveness in
presence of the lords of the continent. The national
Hellenic idea first came to them from Athens; they
became its allies only after the victory, and did not
remain so in the hour of danger. What Athens had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
wished to provide, and had not been able to furnish
for these clients of the nation, was accomplished by
Alexander; Hellas he was obliged to conquer, Asia
Minor saw in the conqueror simply its deliverer.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Formation
of new
centres.</span>Alexander&#8217;s victory in fact not merely made Asiatic
Hellenism secure, but opened up for it a wide, almost
boundless, future; in the process of continental settlement,
which, in contrast to the merely littoral, marked this second
stage of Hellenic world&ndash;conquest, Asia Minor took part to
a considerable extent. Yet of the great centres for the
newly formed states there was none that came to the
old Greek towns of the coast.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> The new period required
new formations in general, and above all, new towns, to
serve at once as Greek royal residences and as centres
of populations hitherto non&ndash;Greek, that were to be brought
to Greek habits. The great political development
moves around the towns of royal foundation and of royal
name, Thessalonica, Antioch, Alexandria. With their
masters the Romans had to contend; the possession of
Asia Minor they gained almost throughout, as a man
gets an estate from relations or friends, by bequest in a
testament; and, however heavy was the burden at times
of Roman government on the regions thus acquired,
there was not added here the sting of foreign rule.
Doubtless the Achaemenid Mithradates confronted the
Romans in Asia Minor with a national opposition, and
the Roman misrule drove the Hellenes into his arms;
but the Hellenes themselves never undertook anything
similar. Therefore there is little to be told of this great,
rich, and important possession in a political respect; and
all the less, inasmuch as what has been remarked in the
previous section concerning the national relations of the
Hellenes generally to the Romans holds good in substance
also for those of Asia Minor.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The provinces
of
Asia Minor.</span>The Roman administration of Asia Minor was never
organised in a systematic way, but the several territories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
were, just as they came to the empire, established without
material change of their limits as Roman administrative
districts. The states which king Attalus III. of Pergamus
bequeathed to the Romans, formed the province of Asia;
those of king Nicomedes, which likewise fell to them by
inheritance, formed the province of Bithynia; the territory
taken from Mithradates Eupator formed the province of
Pontus united with Bithynia. Crete was occupied by the
Romans on occasion of the great war with the pirates;
Cyrene, which may also be mentioned here, was taken
over by them according to the last will of its ruler. The
same legal title gave to the republic the island of Cyprus;
to which was here added the need for the suppression of
piracy. This had also laid a basis for the formation of
the governorship of Cilicia; the land was annexed to
Rome completely by Pompeius at the same time with
Syria, and the two were administered jointly during the
first century. Possession of all these lands was already
acquired by the republic. In the imperial period a
number of territories were added, which had formerly
belonged but indirectly to the empire: in 729 <span class="smcap lowercase">U.C.</span><span class="sidenote2">25.</span> the
kingdom of Galatia, with which there had been united a
part of Phrygia, Lycaonia, Pisidia, and Pamphylia; in
747 <span class="smcap lowercase">U.C.</span><span class="sidenote2">7.</span> the lordship of king Deiotarus, son of Castor,
which embraced Gangra in Paphlagonia and probably
also Amasia and other neighbouring places; in 17 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
the kingdom of Cappadocia; in 43 the territory of the
confederation of the Lycian towns; in 63 the north&ndash;east
of Asia Minor from the valley of the Iris to the Armenian
frontier; Lesser Armenia and some smaller principalities
in Cilicia probably by Vespasian. Thereby the direct
imperial administration was carried out throughout Asia
Minor. As dependent principalities, there remained only
the Tauric Bosporus, of which we have already spoken,
and Great Armenia, of which the next section will treat.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Senatorial
and imperial
government.</span>When, on the introduction of the imperial government,
the administrative partition was made between it and that
of the senate, the whole territory of Asia Minor, so far as
it was at that time directly under the empire, fell to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
the latter body; the island of Cyprus, which at first
had come under imperial administration, was likewise
transferred, a few years later, to the senate. Thus arose
the four senatorial governorships of Asia, Bithynia and
Pontus, Cyprus, Crete and Cyrene. Only Cilicia, as part
of the Syrian province, was placed at first under imperial
administration. But the territories that subsequently
came to be directly administered as parts of the empire
were here, as throughout the empire, placed under imperial
governors; thus even under Augustus there was formed
from the inland districts of the Galatian kingdom the
province of Galatia, and the coast district of Pamphylia
was assigned to another governor, under which latter
Lycia was also placed under Claudius. Moreover Cappadocia
became an imperial governorship under Tiberius.
Cilicia also naturally remained, when it obtained governors
of its own, under imperial administration. Apart from
the fact that Hadrian exchanged the important province of
Bithynia and Pontus for the unimportant Lycio&ndash;Pamphylian
one, this arrangement remained in force, until towards the
end of the third century the senatorial share in administration
generally was, with the exception of some slight
remnants, superseded. The frontier was in the first
period of the empire formed throughout by the dependent
principalities; after their annexation the imperial frontier
did not, apart from Cyrene, touch any of these administrative
districts, excepting only the Cappadocian, so far
as to this at that time was apportioned also the north&ndash;eastern
border&ndash;district as far as Trapezus;<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> and even this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
governorship bordered not with the foreign land proper,
but in the north with the dependent tribes on the Phasis,
and farther on with the vassal&ndash;kingdom of Armenia, which
belonged <em>de jure</em> and in more than one sense <em>de facto</em> to
the empire.</p>

<p>In order to gain a conception of the condition and
the development of Asia Minor in the first three centuries
of our era, so far as this is possible in the case of a
country as to which we have no direct historical tradition,
we must, looking to the conservative character of the
Roman provincial government, begin with the older
territorial divisions and the previous history of the several
regions.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Asia.</span>The province of Asia was the old kingdom of the
Attalids, the west of Asia Minor as far north as the
Bithynian and as far south as the Lycian frontier; the
eastern districts at first separated from it, the Great Phrygia,
had already in the republican period been again
attached to it &#40;iii.&nbsp;288&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;274.</span>, and the province thenceforth
reached as far as the country of the Galatians and the
Pisidian mountains. Rhodes too and the other smaller
islands of the Aegean Sea belonged to this province. <span class="sidenote">The coast&ndash;towns.</span>The
original Hellenic settlement had, besides the islands and
the coast proper, occupied also the lower valleys of the
larger rivers; Magnesia on the Sipylus, in the valley of
the Hermus, the other Magnesia and Tralles in the valley
of the Maeander, had already before Alexander been
founded as Greek towns, or had at any rate become such;
the Carians, Lydians, Mysians, became early at least half
Hellenes. The Greek rule, when it set in, found not
much to do in the coast districts; Smyrna, which centuries
before had been destroyed by the barbarians of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
interior, rose at that time from its ruins, in order speedily
to become one of the first stars in the brilliant belt of the
cities of Asia Minor; and if the rebuilding of Ilion at
the sepulchral mound of Hector was more a work of piety
than of policy, the laying out of Alexandria on the coast
of the Troas was of enduring importance. Pergamus in
the valley of the Caicus flourished as the court&ndash;residence
of the Attalids.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The interior.</span>In the great work of Hellenising the interior of this
province in keeping with the intentions of Alexander, all
the Hellenic governments, Lysimachus, the Seleucids, the
Attalids vied with each other. The details of the foundations
have disappeared from our tradition still more
than the warlike events of the same epoch; we are left
dependent mainly on the names and the surnames of the
towns; but even these suffice to make known to us the
general outlines of this activity continuing for centuries,
and yet homogeneous and throughout conscious of its aim.
A series of inland townships, Stratonicea in Caria, Peltae,
Blaundus, Docimeium, Cadi in Phrygia, the Mysomacedonians
in the district of Ephesus, Thyatira, Hyrcania,
Nacrasa in the region of the Hermus, the Ascylaces in the
district of Adramytium, are designated in documents or
other credible testimonies as cities of the Macedonians;
and these notices are of a nature so accidental, and the
townships in part so unimportant, that the like designation
certainly extended to a great number of other settlements
in this region; and we may infer an extensive settling
of Greek soldiers in the districts indicated, probably connected
with the protection of anterior Asia against the
Galatians and Pisidians. If, moreover, the coins of the
considerable Phrygian town Synnada combine with the
name of their city that of the Ionians and the Dorians
as well as that of the common Zeus &#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς πάνδημος</span>&#41;, one
of the Alexandrids must have summoned the Greeks in
common to settle there; and the summons was certainly
not confined to this single town. The numerous towns,
chiefly of the interior, the names of which are traceable
to the royal houses of the Seleucids or the Attalids, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
which have otherwise Greek names, need not here be
adduced; there are found in particular among the towns
certainly founded or reorganised by the Seleucids several
that were in later times the most flourishing and most
civilised in the interior, <em>e.g.</em> in southern Phrygia Laodicea,
and above all Apamea, the old Celaenae on the great
military road from the west coast of Asia Minor to the
middle Euphrates, already in the Persian period the entrep&#244;t
for this traffic, and under Augustus, next to Ephesus,
the most considerable city of the province of Asia.
Although every case of assigning a Greek name is not to
be connected with a settlement by Greek colonists, we
may be allowed at any rate to reckon a considerable
portion of these townships among Greek colonies. But
even the urban settlements of non&ndash;Greek origin, which the
Alexandrids found in existence, turned of themselves into
the paths of Hellenising, as indeed the residence of the
Persian governor, Sardes, was organised even by Alexander
himself as a Greek commonwealth.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Its position
under the
Romans.</span>This urban development was completed when the
Romans entered upon the rule of interior Asia; they
themselves did not make special exertions to promote it.
That a great number of the urban communities in the
eastern half of the province reckon their years from that
of the city 670<span class="sidenote2">84.</span>, is due to the fact that then, after the
close of the Mithradatic war, these districts were brought
by Sulla under direct Roman administration &#40;iii.&nbsp;328&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;312.</span>;
these townships did not receive city&ndash;rights only then for
the first time. Augustus occupied the town of Parium on
the Hellespont and the already&ndash;mentioned Alexandria in
Troas with veterans of his army, and assigned to both the
rights of Roman burgess&ndash;communities; the latter was
thenceforth in Greek Asia an Italian island like Corinth
in Greece and Berytus in Syria. But this was nothing
but a provision for soldiers; of the foundation of towns
proper in the Roman province of Asia under the emperors
there is little mention. Among the not numerous towns
named after emperors there it is only perhaps in the case
of Sebaste and Tiberiopolis, both in Phrygia, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Hadrianoi on the Bithynian frontier, that no older name
of the city can be pointed out. Here, in the mountain&ndash;region
between Ida and Olympus, dwelt Cleon in the time
of the triumvirate, and a certain Tilliborus under Hadrian,
both half robber&ndash;chiefs, half popular princes, of whom the
former even played a part in politics; in this asylum of
criminals the foundation of an organised urban community
by Hadrian was at all events a benefit. Otherwise in
this province, with its five hundred urban communities,
the province richest in cities of the whole state, not much
more was left to be done in the way of foundation; there
was room at the most perhaps for division, that is, for
detaching such hamlets as developed themselves <em>de facto</em>
into urban communities, from the earlier communal union
and making them independent, as we can point to a case
of the kind in Phrygia under Constantine I. But from
Hellenising proper the sequestered districts were still far
remote when the Roman government began; especially
in Phrygia the language of the country, perhaps similar in
character to the Armenian, held its ground. If from the
absence of Greek coins and of Greek inscriptions we may
not with certainty infer the absence of Hellenising,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> yet
the fact that the Phrygian coins belong almost throughout
to the Roman imperial period, and the Phrygian inscriptions
as regards the great majority to the later times of
the empire, points to the conclusion that, so far as Hellenic
habits found their way at all into the regions of the
province of Asia that were remote and difficult of access
to civilisation, they did so in the main only under the
emperors. For direct interference on the part of the
imperial administration this process, accomplishing itself
in silence, gave little opportunity, and traces of such interference
we are not able to show. Asia, it is true, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
senatorial province, and we may here bear in mind that
with the government of the senate all initiative fell into
abeyance.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Urban
rivalries.</span>Syria, and still more, Egypt, became merged in their
capitals; the province of Asia and Asia Minor generally
had no single town to show like Antioch and Alexandria,
but their prosperity rested on the numerous middle&ndash;sized
towns. The division of the towns into three classes,
which are distinguished as to the right of voting at the
diet, as to the apportionment of the contributions to be
furnished by the whole province, even as to the number
of town&ndash;physicians and town&ndash;teachers to be appointed,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a>
is eminently peculiar to these regions. The urban rivalries,
which appear in Asia Minor so emphatic and in part so
childish, occasionally even so odious&mdash;as, for example, the
war between Severus and Niger in Bithynia was properly
a war of the two rival capitals Nicomedia and Nicaea&mdash;belong
to the character of Hellenic politics in general, but
especially of those in Asia Minor. We shall mention
further on the emulation as to temples of the emperors;
in a similar way the ranking of the urban deputations at
the common festivals in Asia Minor was a vital question&mdash;Magnesia
on the Maeander calls itself on the coins the
&#8220;seventh city of Asia&#8221; &mdash;and above all the first place was
one so much desired, that the government ultimately
agreed to admit several first cities. It fared similarly
with the designation of &#8220;metropolis.&#8221; The proper metropolis
of the province was Pergamus, the residence of the
Attalids and the seat of the diet. But Ephesus, the <em>de
facto</em> capital of the province, where the governor was
obliged to enter on his office, and which boasts of this
&#8220;right of reception at landing&#8221; on its coins; Smyrna,
in constant rivalship with its Ephesian neighbour, and,
in defiance of the legitimate right of the Ephesians to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
primacy, naming itself on coins &#8220;the first in greatness
and beauty;&#8221; the very ancient Sardis, Cyzicus, and several
others strove after the same honorary right. With these
their wranglings, on account of which the senate and the
emperor were regularly appealed to&mdash;the &#8220;Greek follies,&#8221;
as men were wont to say in Rome&mdash;the people of Asia
Minor were the standing annoyance and the standing
laughing&ndash;stock of the Romans of mark.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Bithynia.</span>Bithynia did not stand on a like level with the Attalid
kingdom. The older Greek colonising had here confined
itself merely to the coast. In the Hellenistic epoch at first
the Macedonian rulers, and later the native dynasty
which walked entirely in their steps, had&mdash;along with a
regulation of the places on the coast, which perhaps on
the whole amounted to a changing of their names&mdash;also
opened up in some measure the interior, in particular
by the two successful foundations of Nicaea &#40;Isnik&#41; and
Prusa on Olympia &#40;Broussa&#41;; of the former it is stated
that the first settlers were of good Macedonian and
Hellenic descent. But in the intensity of the Hellenising
the kingdom of Nicomedes was far behind that of the
citizen prince of Pergamus; in particular the eastern interior
can have been but little settled before Augustus. This
was otherwise in the time of the empire. In the Augustan
age a successful robber&ndash;chief, who became a convert to
order, reconstructed on the Galatian frontier the utterly
decayed township Gordiou Kome, under the name of
Juliopolis; in the same region the towns Bithynion&ndash;Claudiopolis
and Crateia&ndash;Flaviopolis probably attained
Greek civic rights in the course of the first century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
Generally in Bithynia Hellenism took a mighty upward
impulse under the imperial period, and the tough Thracian
stamp of the natives gave a good foundation for it. The
fact that, among the inscribed stones of this province
known in great number, not more than four belong to the
pre&ndash;Roman epoch, cannot well be explained solely from
the circumstance that urban ambition was only fostered
under the emperors. In the literature of the imperial
period a number of the best authors and the least carried
away by exuberant rhetoric, such as the philosopher Dio
of Prusa, the historian Memnon of Heraclea, Arrianus of
Nicomedia, Cassius Dio of Nicaea, belong to Bithynia.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Pontus.</span>The eastern half of the south coast of the Black Sea,
the Roman province of Pontus, had as its basis that
portion of the kingdom of Mithradates, of which Pompeius
took direct possession immediately after the victory. The
numerous smaller principalities, which Pompeius at the
same time gave away in the interior of Paphlagonia and
thence eastward to the Armenian frontier, were, after a
shorter or longer subsistence, on their annexation partly
attached to the same province, partly joined to Galatia
or Cappadocia. The former kingdom of Mithradates had
been far less affected than the western regions either
by the older or by the younger Hellenism. When the
Romans took possession directly or indirectly of this
territory, there were, strictly speaking, no towns of Greek
organisation there; Amasia, the old capital of the
Pontic Achaemenids, and still their burial&ndash;place, was not
such; the two old Greek coast&ndash;towns, Amisus and Sinope
that once commanded the Black Sea, had become royal
residences, and Greek polity would hardly be given to the
few townships laid out by Mithradates, <em>e.g.</em> Eupatoria &#40;iv.
152&#41;. But here, as was already shown in detail &#40;iv.&nbsp;151 f.&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;146.</span>,
the Roman conquest was at the same time the Hellenising;
Pompeius organised the province in such a way as to
make the eleven chief townships of it into towns, and
to distribute the territory among them. Certainly these
artificially created towns with their immense districts&mdash;that
of Sinope had along the coast an extent of 70<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
miles, and bordered on the Halys with that of Amisus&mdash;resembled
more the Celtic cantons than the Hellenic
and Italian urban communities proper. But at any rate
Sinope and Amisus were then reinstated in their old
positions, and other towns in the interior, such as Pompeiopolis,
Nicopolis, Megalopolis, the later Sebasteia, were
called into life. Sinope obtained from the dictator
Caesar the rights of a Roman colony, and beyond doubt
also Italian settlers &#40;iv.&nbsp;574&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;544.</span>. More important for the
Roman administration was Trapezus, an old colony of
Sinope; the town, which in the year 63 was joined to
the province of Cappadocia &#40;<a href="#Page_324">p.&nbsp;324</a>, note&#41;, was both the
station of the Roman Black Sea fleet and in a certain
measure the base of operations for the military corps of this
province, which was the only corps in all Asia Minor.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Cappadocia.</span>Inland Cappadocia was in the Roman power after the
erection of the provinces of Pontus and Syria; of its
annexation in the beginning of the reign of Tiberius,
which was primarily occasioned by the attempt of
Armenia to release itself from the Roman suzerainty, we
shall have to give an account in the following section.
The court, and those immediately connected with it, had
become Hellenised &#40;iii.&nbsp;59&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;57.</span>, somewhat as the German
courts of the eighteenth century adapted themselves to
French habits. The capital, Caesarea, the ancient Mazaca,
like the Phrygian Apamea, an intermediate station for the
great traffic between the ports of the west coast and the
lands of the Euphrates, and in the Roman period, as still
at the present day, one of the most flourishing commercial
cities of Asia Minor, was, at the instigation of Pompeius,
not merely rebuilt after the Mithradatic war, but probably
also furnished at that time with civic rights after the
Greek type. Cappadocia itself was at the beginning of
the imperial period hardly more Greek than Brandenburg
and Pomerania under Frederick the Great were French.
When the country became Roman, it was divided, according
to the statements of the contemporary Strabo, not
into city&ndash;districts, but into ten prefectures, of which only
two had towns, the already&ndash;mentioned capital and Tyana;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
and this arrangement was here on the whole not more
changed than in Egypt, though individual townships subsequently
received Greek civic rights; <em>e.g.</em> the emperor
Marcus made the Cappadocian village, in which his wife
had died, into the town Faustinopolis. It is true that
the Cappadocians now spoke Greek; but the students
from Cappadocia had much to endure abroad on account
of their uncouth accent, and of their defects in pronunciation
and modulation; and, if they learned to speak after
an Attic fashion, their countrymen found their language
affected.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> It was only in the Christian period that the
comrades in study of the emperor Julian, Gregory of
Nazianzus and Basil of Caesarea, gave a better sound
to the Cappadocian name.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Lycia.</span>The Lycian cities in their secluded mountain&ndash;land did
not open their coast for Greek settlement, but did not on
that account debar themselves from Hellenic influence.
Lycia was the only district of Asia Minor in which early
civilising did not set aside the native language, and which,
almost like the Romans, entered into Greek habits without
becoming externally Hellenised. It is characteristic of
their position, that the Lycian confederation as such
joined the Attic naval league and paid its tribute to the
Athenian leading power. The Lycians not merely practised
their art after Hellenic models, but probably also
regulated their political organisation early in the same
way. The conversion of the cities&ndash;league, once subject
to Rhodes, but which had become independent after the
third Macedonian war &#40;ii.&nbsp;325&#41;<span class="sidenote2">ii.&nbsp;307.</span> into a Roman province,
which was ordained by the emperor Claudius on account
of the endless quarrels among the allies, must have
furthered the progress of Hellenism; in the course of the
imperial period the Lycians thereupon became completely
Greeks.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Pamphylia
and Cilicia.</span>The Pamphylian coast&ndash;towns, like Aspendus and Perga,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Greek foundations of the oldest times, subsequently left
to themselves, and attaining under favourable circumstances
prosperous development, had either conserved, or
moulded specially on their own part, the oldest Hellenic
character in such a way that the Pamphylians might be
regarded as an independent nation in language and writing
not much less than the neighbouring Lycians. Then,
when Asia was gained for the Hellenes, they found
gradually their way back into the common Greek civilisation,
and so also into the general political organisation.
The rulers in this region and on the neighbouring Cilician
coast were in the Hellenistic period partly the Egyptians,
whose royal house gave its name to different townships
in Pamphylia and Cilicia, partly the Seleucids, after whom
the most considerable town of west Cilicia was named
Seleucia on the Calycadnus, partly the Pergamenes, of
whose rule Attalia &#40;Adalia&#41; in Pamphylia testifies.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Pisidia and
Isauria.</span>On the other hand the tribes in the mountains of
Pisidia, Isauria and western Cilicia substantially maintained
their independence down to the beginning of the
imperial period. Here hostilities never ceased. Not
merely by land had the civilised governments continued
troubles with the Pisidians and their comrades, but these
pursued still more zealously than robbery by land the
trade of piracy, particularly from western Cilicia, where
the mountains immediately approach the sea. When, on
the decline of the Egyptian naval power, the south coast
of Asia Minor became entirely an asylum of the pirates,
the Romans interfered and erected the province of Cilicia,
which embraced also, or was at any rate intended to
embrace, the Pamphylian coast, for the sake of suppressing
piracy. But what they did showed more what ought to
have been done than that anything was really accomplished;
the intervention took place too late and too
fitfully. Though a blow was once struck against the
corsairs, and Roman troops penetrated even into the
Isaurian mountains, and broke up the pirates&#8217; strongholds
far into the interior &#40;iv.&nbsp;47&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;44.</span>, the Roman republic did
not attain true permanent establishment in these districts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
reluctantly annexed by it. Here everything was left for
the empire to do. Antonius, when he took in hand the
East, entrusted an able Galatian officer, Amyntas, with the
subjugation of the refractory Pisidian region,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> and, when
the latter proved his quality,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> he made him king of Galatia,&mdash;the
region of Asia Minor which was best organised in a
military point of view, and most ready for action&mdash;and at
the same time extended his government from thence as
far as the south coast, and so as to include Lycaonia,
Pisidia, Isauria, Pamphylia, and western Cilicia, while
the civilised east half of Cilicia was left with Syria. Even
when Augustus, after the battle of Actium, entered upon
rule in the East, he left the Celtic prince in his position.
The latter made essential progress as well in the suppression
of the bad corsairs harbouring in the lurking
places of western Cilicia, as also in the extirpation of
the brigands, killed one of the worst of these robber&ndash;chiefs,
Antipater, the ruler of Derbe and Laranda in southern
Lycaonia, built for himself a residence in Isauria, and not
merely drove the Pisidians out from the adjoining Phrygian
territories, but invaded their own land, and took
Cremna in the heart of it. But some years after &#40;729 <span class="smcap lowercase">U.C.</span>&#41;<span class="sidenote2">25.</span>
he lost his life on an expedition against one of the west
Cicilian tribes, the Homonadenses; after he had taken
most of the townships and their prince had fallen, he
perished through a plot directed against him by the wife
of the latter. After this disaster Augustus himself undertook
the difficult business of pacifying the interior of Asia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Minor. If in doing so he, as was already observed &#40;<a href="#Page_324">p.&nbsp;324</a>&#41;,
assigned the small Pamphylian coast&ndash;district to a governor
of its own and separated it from Galatia, this was evidently
done because the mountain&ndash;land lying between the coast
and the Galato&ndash;Lycaonian steppe was so little under control
that the administration of the coast region could not
well be conducted from Galatia. Roman troops were not
stationed in Galatia; yet the levy of the warlike Galatians
must have meant more than in the case of most provincials.
Moreover, as western Cilicia was then placed under Cappadocia,
the troops of this dependent prince had to take
part in the work. The Syrian army carried out the
chastisement in the first place of the Homonadenses; the
governor, Publius Sulpicius Quirinius, advanced some
years later into their territory, cut off their supplies, and
compelled them to submit <em>en masse</em>, whereupon they were
distributed to the surrounding townships and their former
territory was laid waste. The Clitae, another stock settled
in western Cilicia nearer to the coast, met with similar
chastisements in the years 36 and 52; as they refused
obedience to the vassal&ndash;prince placed over them by
Rome, and pillaged land and sea, and as the so&ndash;called
rulers of the land could not dispose of them, the imperial
troops were on both occasions brought in from Syria to
subdue them. These accounts have been accidentally
preserved; numerous similar incidents have certainly been
lost to remembrance.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Pisidian
colonies.</span>But Augustus attempted the pacification of this region
also by way of settlement. The Hellenistic governments
had, so to speak, isolated it; not merely retained or seized
a footing everywhere on the coast, but also founded in the
north&ndash;west a series of towns&mdash;on the Phrygian frontier
Apollonia, alleged to have been founded by Alexander
himself, Seleucia Siderus and Antiochia, both from the
time of the Seleucids, further in Lycaonia, Laodicea
Katakekaumene, and the capital of this district which
doubtless originated at the same time, Iconium. But in
the mountain&ndash;land proper no trace of Hellenistic settlement
is found, and still less did the Roman senate apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
itself to this difficult task. Augustus did so; and only
here in the whole Greek coast we meet a series of colonies
of Roman veterans evidently intended to acquire this
district for peaceful settlement. Of the older settlements
just mentioned, Antiochia was supplied with veterans
and reorganised in Roman fashion, while there were newly
laid out in southern Lycaonia Parlais, in Pisidia itself
the already&ndash;mentioned Cremna, as well as further to
the south Olbasa and Comama. The later governments
did not continue with equal energy the work so begun;
yet under Claudius the &#8220;iron Seleucia&#8221; of Pisidia was
made the &#8220;Claudian;&#8221; while in the interior of western
Cilicia Claudiopolis, and not far from it, perhaps at the
same time, Germanicopolis were called into life, and
Iconium, in the time of Augustus a small place, was
brought to considerable development. The newly&ndash;founded
towns remained indeed unimportant, but still notably
restricted the field of the free inhabitants of the mountains,
and general peace must at length have made its
triumphal entrance also here. As well the plains and
mountain&ndash;terraces of Pamphylia as the mountain&ndash;towns
of Pisidia itself, <em>e.g.</em> Selga and Sagalassus, were during the
imperial period well peopled and the territory carefully
cultivated; the remains of mighty aqueducts and singularly
large theatres, all of them structures of the Roman
imperial period, show, it is true, only mechanical skill, but
bear traces of a peaceful prosperity richly developed.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Isaurians.</span>The government, it is true, never quite mastered
brigandage in these regions, and if in the earlier period
of the empire its ravages were kept in moderate bounds,
the bands once more emerge as a warlike power in the
troubles of the third century. They now pass under the
name of Isaurians, and have their chief seat in the mountains
of Cilicia, from whence they plunder land and sea.
They are mentioned first under Severus Alexander. That
under Gallienus they proclaimed their robber&ndash;chief emperor,
is probably a fable; but certainly under the
emperor Probus such an one, by name Lydius, who for
long had pillaged Lycia and Pamphylia, was subdued in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
the Roman colony Cremna, which he had occupied, after
a long and obstinate siege by a Roman army. In later
times we find a military cordon drawn round their territory,
and a special commanding general appointed for the
Isaurians. Their savage valour even procured for those
of them, who chose to take service at the Byzantine court,
for a time a position there such as the Macedonians had
possessed at the court of the Ptolemies; in fact one from
their ranks, Zeno, died as emperor of Byzantium.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Galatia.</span>Lastly, the region of Galatia, at a remote period the
chief seat of the Oriental rule over anterior Asia, and preserving
in the famed rock&ndash;sculptures of the modern Boghazk&ouml;i,
formerly the royal town of Pteria, reminiscences of
an almost forgotten glory, had in the course of centuries
become in language and manners a Celtic island amidst
the waves of eastern peoples, and remained so in internal
organisation even under the empire. The three Celtic
tribes, which, on the great migration of the nation about
the time of the war between Pyrrhus and the Romans,
had arrived in the heart of Asia Minor, and there, like
the Franks in the East during the middle ages, had consolidated
themselves into a firmly knit soldier&ndash;state, and
after prolonged roving had taken up their definitive abode
on either side of the Halys, had long since left behind the
times when they issued forth thence to pillage Asia Minor,
and were in conflict with the kings of Asia and Pergamus,
provided that they did not serve them as mercenaries.
They too were shattered before the superior power of the
Romans &#40;ii.&nbsp;290&#41;<span class="sidenote2">ii.&nbsp;273.</span>, and became not less subject to them in
Asia than their countrymen in the valley of the Po and
on the Rhone and Seine. But in spite of their sojourn
of several hundred years in Asia Minor, a deep gulf still
separated these Occidentals from the Asiatics. It was
not merely that they retained their native language and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
their nationality, that still each of the three cantons was
governed by its four hereditary princes, and the federal
assembly, to which deputies were sent by all in common,
presided in the sacred oak&ndash;grove as supreme authority
over the Galatian land &#40;ii.&nbsp;232&#41;<span class="sidenote2">ii.&nbsp;219.</span>; nor was it that continued
rudeness as well as warlike valour distinguished them
to advantage as well as to disadvantage from their
neighbours; such contrasts between culture and barbarism
existed elsewhere in Asia Minor, and the
superficial and external Hellenising&mdash;such as neighbourhood,
commercial relations, the Phrygian cultus
adopted by the immigrants, and mercenary service
brought in their train&mdash;must have set in not much later
in Galatia than <em>e.g.</em> in the neighbouring Cappadocia.
The contrast was of a different kind; the Celtic and
the Hellenic invasion came into competition in Asia
Minor, and to the distinction of nationality was added
the spur of rival conquest. This was brought clearly
to light in the Mithradatic crisis; by the side of the
command of Mithradates to murder the Italians went the
massacre of the whole Galatian nobility &#40;iii.&nbsp;322&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;306.</span>, and,
in keeping therewith, the Romans in the wars against
the Oriental liberator of the Hellenes had no more faithful
ally than the Galatians of Asia Minor &#40;iv.&nbsp;56, 149&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;53,&nbsp;143.</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Galatian
kingdom.</span>For that reason the success of the Romans was theirs
also, and the victory gave to them for a time a leading
position in the affairs of Asia Minor. The old tetrarchate
was done away, apparently by Pompeius. One of the new
cantonal princes, who had approved himself most in the
Mithradatic wars, Deiotarus, attached to himself, besides
his own territory, Lesser Armenia and other portions
of the former Mithradatic empire, and became an inconvenient
neighbour to the other Galatian princes, and the
most powerful among the dynasts of Asia Minor
&#40;iv.&nbsp;149&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iv.&nbsp;143.</span>. After the victory of Caesar, to whom he
occupied an attitude of hostility, and whose favour he
was unable to gain even by help rendered against
Pharnaces, the possessions gained by him with or without
consent of the Roman government were for the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
part again withdrawn; the Caesarian Mithradates of
Pergamus, who on the mother&#8217;s side was sprung from
the Galatian royal house, obtained the most of what
Deiotarus lost, and was even placed by his side in
Galatia itself. But, after the latter had shortly afterwards
met his end in the Tauric Chersonese &#40;<a href="#Page_313">p.&nbsp;313</a>&#41;,
and Caesar himself had not long afterwards been
murdered, Deiotarus reinstated himself unbidden in
possession of what he had lost, and, as he knew how
to submit to the Roman party predominant on each
occasion in the East as well as how to change it at the
right time, he died at an advanced age in the year 714<span class="sidenote2">40.</span>
as lord of all Galatia. His descendants were portioned
off with a small lordship in Paphlagonia; his kingdom,
further enlarged towards the south by Lycaonia and all
the country down to the coast of Pamphylia, was
transferred, as was already said, in the year 718<span class="sidenote2">36.</span> by
Antonius to Amyntas, who seems to have conducted the
government already in the last years of Deiotarus as his
secretary and general, and, as such, had before the battle
of Philippi effected the transition from the republican
generals to the triumvirs. His further fortunes have
been already told. Equal to his predecessor in sagacity
and bravery, he served first Antonius, and then Augustus
as chief instrument for the pacification of the territory
not yet subject in Asia Minor, till he there met his
death in the year 729<span class="sidenote2">25.</span>. With him ended the Galatian
kingdom, and it was converted into the Roman province
of Galatia.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The inhabitants.</span>Its inhabitants were called Gallograeci among the
Romans even in the last age of the republic; they were,
adds Livy, a mixed people, as they were called, and
degenerate. A good portion of them must have
descended from the older Phrygian inhabitants of these
regions. Of still more weight is the fact, that the zealous
worship of the gods in Galatia and the priesthood there
have nothing in common with the ritual institutions of
the European Celts; not merely was the Great Mother,
whose sacred symbol the Romans of Hannibal&#8217;s time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
asked and received from the Tolistobogi, of a Phrygian
type, but her priests belonged in part at least to the
Galatian nobility. Nevertheless, even in the Roman
province of Galatia the internal organisation was predominantly
Celtic. The fact that even under Pius the
strict paternal power foreign to Hellenic law subsisted
in Galatia, is a proof of this from the sphere of private
law. In public relations there were in this country still
only the three old communities of the Tectosages, the
Tolistobogi, the Trocmi, who perhaps appended to their
names those of the three chief places, Ancyra, Pessinus,
and Tavium, but were essentially nothing but the well&ndash;known
Gallic cantons, which also indeed were not without
their chief place. If among the Celts of Asia the
conception of the community as town gains the predominance
earlier than among the European,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> and the name
Ancyra more quickly dispossesses that of the Tectosages
than in Europe the name Burdigala dispossesses that of
the Bituriges, and there Ancyra even as foremost place
of the whole country calls itself the &#8220;mother&ndash;city&#8221;
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μητρόπολις</span>, this certainly shows&mdash;what could not in
fact be otherwise&mdash;the influence of Greek neighbourhood
and the incipient process of assimilation, the several
phases of which the superficial information that survives
to us does not allow us to follow out. The Celtic names
keep their hold down to the time of Tiberius; afterwards
they appear only isolated in the houses of rank.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Language
under the
Romans.</span>That the Romans after the erection of the province&mdash;as
in Gaul they allowed only the Latin language&mdash;allowed in
Galatia alongside of this only the Greek in business&ndash;dealings,
was a matter of course. What course was taken earlier
we know not, as we do not meet with pre&ndash;Roman written
monuments in this country at all. As the language
of conversation the Celtic maintained its ground with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
tenacity also in Asia;<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> yet the Greek gradually gained
the upper hand. In the fourth century Ancyra was one
of the chief centres of Greek culture; &#8220;the small towns
in Greek Galatia,&#8221; says the man of letters, Themistius,
who had grown gray in addressing the cultivated public,
&#8220;cannot indeed cope with Antioch; but the people
appropriate to themselves culture more zealously than
the genuine Hellenes, and, wherever the philosopher&#8217;s
cloak appears, they cling to it like the iron to the
magnet.&#8221; Yet the national language may have preserved
itself in the lower circles down even to this period,
particularly beyond the Halys among the Trocmi
evidently much later Hellenised.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> It has already been
mentioned &#40;<a href="#Page_101">p.&nbsp;101</a>&#41; that, according to the testimony
of the far&ndash;travelled church&ndash;father Jerome, still at the
end of the fourth century the Asiatic Galatian spoke
the same language, although corrupt, which was then
spoken in Treves. That as soldiers the Galatians, though
sustaining no comparison with the Occidentals, were
yet far more useful than the Greek Asiatics, is attested
as well by the legion which king Deiotarus raised from
his subjects after the Roman model, and which Augustus
took over with the kingdom and incorporated with the
Roman army under its previous name, as by the fact,
that in the Oriental recruiting of the imperial period
the Galatians were drawn upon by preference just as the
Batavians were in the West.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The Greek
islands.</span>To the extra&ndash;European Hellenes belong further the
two great islands of the eastern Mediterranean, Crete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
and Cyprus, as well as the numerous islets of the sea
between Greece and Asia Minor; the Cyrenaic Pentapolis
also on the opposite African coast is so separated by the
surrounding desert from the interior that it may be in
some measure ranked along with those Greek islands.
These constituent elements, however, of the enormous
mass of lands united under the sceptre of the emperors
do not add essentially new features to the general
historical conception. The minor islands, Hellenised
earlier and more completely than the continent, belong
as regards their essential character more to European
Greece than to the colonial field of Asia Minor; as
indeed we have already several times mentioned the
Hellenic model&ndash;state, Rhodes, in connection with the
former. The islands are chiefly noticed at this epoch,
inasmuch as it was usual in the imperial period to banish
men of the better classes to them by way of punishment.
They chose, where the case was specially severe, rocks like
Gyarus and Donussa; but Andros, Cythnus, Amorgos,
once flourishing centres of Greek culture, were now places
of punishment, while in Lesbos and Samos not seldom
Romans of rank and even members of the imperial house
voluntarily took up a somewhat lengthened abode. Crete
and Cyprus, whose old Hellenism had under the Persian
rule or in complete isolation lost contact with home,
organised themselves&mdash;Cyprus as a dependency of Egypt,
the Cretan towns as autonomous&mdash;in the Hellenistic and
later in the Roman epochs according to the general forms
of Greek polity. In the Cyrenaic towns the system of
the Lagids prevailed; we find in them not merely, as in
the strictly Greek towns, Hellenic burgesses and <em>metoeci</em>,
but alongside of them, as with the Egyptians in Alexandria,
the &#8220;peasants,&#8221; that is the native Africans, and
among the <em>metoeci</em> the Jews form, as they do likewise in
Alexandria, a numerous and privileged class.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Leagues of
the Hellenes
in
Asia Minor.</span>To the Greeks in common the Roman imperial
government never granted a constitution. The Augustan
Amphictiony was restricted, as we saw &#40;<a href="#Page_254">p.&nbsp;254</a>&#41;, to the
Hellenes in Achaia, Epirus, and Macedonia. If the Hadrianic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
Panhellenes in Athens acted as though they were
representative of all the Hellenes, they yet encroached on
the other Greek provinces only in so far as they decreed,
so to speak, honorary Hellenism to individual towns
in Asia &#40;<a href="#Page_267">p.&nbsp;267</a>&#41;; and the fact that they did so, just shows
that the extraneous communities of Greeks were by no
means included among those Panhellenes. If in Asia
Minor there is mention of representation or representatives
of the Hellenes, what is meant by this in the provinces of
Asia and Bithynia organised completely after the Hellenic
manner, is the diet and the president of the diet of these
provinces, in so far as these proceed from the deputies of
the towns belonging to each of them, and all of these
towns are Greek polities;<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> while in the non&ndash;Greek province
of Galatia the representatives of the Greeks sojourning
there, placed alongside of the Galatian diet, are designated
as &#8220;presidents of the Greeks.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Land&ndash;diets
and land
festivals.</span>To the confederation of towns the Roman government
in Asia Minor had no occasion to oppose special
obstacles. In Roman as in pre&ndash;Roman times nine towns
of the Troad performed in common religious functions and
celebrated common festivals.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> The diets of the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
provinces of Asia Minor, which were here as in the whole
empire called into existence as a fixed institution by
Augustus, were not different in themselves from those of
the other provinces. Yet this institution developed itself,
or rather changed its nature, here in a peculiar fashion.
With the immediate purpose of these annual assemblies of
the civic deputies of each province<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a>&mdash;to bring its wishes
to the knowledge of the governor or the government, and
generally to serve as organ of the province&mdash;was here first
combined the celebration of the annual festival for the
governing emperor and the imperial system generally.
Augustus in the year 725<span class="sidenote2">29.</span> allowed the diets of Asia and
Bithynia to erect temples and show divine honour to him
at their places of assembly, Pergamus and Nicomedia.
This new arrangement soon extended to the whole empire,
and the blending of the ritual institution with the administrative
became a leading idea of the provincial organisation
of the imperial period. But as regards pomp of
priests and festivals and civic rivalries, this institution
nowhere developed itself so much as in the province of
Asia and, analogously, in the other provinces of Asia
Minor; and nowhere, consequently, has there subsisted
alongside of, and above, municipal ambition a provincial
ambition of the towns still more than of the individuals,
such as in Asia Minor dominates the whole public life.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Provincial
priests and
Asiarchs.</span>The high priest &#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχιερεύς</span>&#41; of the new temple appointed
from year to year in the province is not merely the most
eminent dignitary of the province, but throughout its bounds
the year is designated after him.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> The system of festivals
and games after the model of the Olympic festival, which
spread more and more as we saw among all the Hellenes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
was associated in Asia Minor predominantly with the
festivals and games of the provincial worship of the
emperor. The conduct of these fell to the president of
the diet, in Asia to the Asiarch, in Bithynia to the Bithyniarch,
and so on; and not less he had chiefly to bear the
costs of the annual festival, although a portion of these,
like the remaining expenses of this equally brilliant and
loyal worship, was covered by voluntary gifts and endowments,
or was apportioned among the several towns.
Hence these presidentships were only accessible to rich
people; the prosperity of the town Tralles is indicated by
the fact, that it never wanted Asiarchs&mdash;the title remained
even after the expiry of the official year&mdash;and the repute
of the Apostle Paul in Ephesus is indicated by his connection
with different Asiarchs there. In spite of the
expense this was an honorary position much sought after,
not on account of the privileges attached to it, <em>e.g.</em> of
exemption from trusteeship, but on account of its outward
splendour; the festal entrance into the town, in
purple dress and with chaplet on the head, preceded by a
procession of boys swinging their vessels of incense, was
in the horizon of the Greeks of Asia Minor what the olive&ndash;branch
of Olympia was among the Hellenes. On several
occasions this or that Asiatic of quality boasts of having
been not merely himself Asiarch but descended also from
Asiarchs. If this cultus was at the outset confined to the
provincial capitals, the municipal ambition, which in the
province of Asia in particular assumed incredible proportions,
very soon broke through those limits. Here already
in the year 23 a second temple was decreed by the province
to the then reigning emperor Tiberius as well as to
his mother and to the senate, and after long quarrelling
of the towns was, by decree of the senate, erected at
Smyrna. The other larger towns followed the example
on later occasions.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> If hitherto the province had had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
only one president and one chief priest, as only one
temple, now not merely had as many chief priests to be
appointed as there were provincial temples, but also,
seeing that the conduct of the temple&ndash;festival and the
execution of the games pertained not to the chief priest
but to the land&ndash;president, and the rival great towns were
chiefly concerned about the festivals and games, there
was given to all the chief priests at the same time the
title and the right of presidency, so that at least in Asia
the Asiarchy and the chief priesthood of the provincial
temples coincided.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> Therewith the diet and the civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
functions, from which the institution had its origin, fell
into the background; the Asiarch was soon nothing
more than the provider of a popular festival annexed to
the divine worship of the former and present emperors, on
which account indeed his wife&mdash;the Asiarchess&mdash;might
and zealously did take part in the celebration.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Superintendence
of
worship
by the provincial
priests.</span>A practical importance, increased in Asia Minor by
the high estimation in which this institution was held,
may have attached to the provincial chief&ndash;priesthood
for the worship of the emperors through the religious
superintendence associated with it. After the diet had
once resolved on the worship of the emperors, and the
government had given its consent, action on the part of
the towns followed as a matter of course; in Asia already
under Augustus at least all the chief places of judicial
circuit had their Caesareum and their emperors&#8217; festival.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a>
It was the right and duty of the chief priest to watch
over the execution of these provincial and municipal
decrees and the practice of the cultus in his district;
what this might mean, is elucidated by the fact, that the
autonomy of the free city of Cyzicus in Asia was set
aside under Tiberius for this among other reasons, that
it had allowed the decree for building the temple of the
god Augustus to remain unfulfilled&mdash;perhaps just because
it as a free town was not under the diet. It is
probable that this superintendence, although it primarily
concerned the emperor&ndash;worship, extended to the affairs of
religion in general.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> Then, when the old and the new
faith began to contend in the empire for the mastery, it
was probably, in the first instance, through the provincial
chief priesthood that the contrast between them was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
converted into conflict. These priests, appointed from
the provincials of mark by the diet of the province, were
by their traditions and by their official duties far more
called and inclined than were the imperial magistrates
to animadvert on neglect of the recognised worship, and,
where dissuasion did not avail, as they had not themselves
a power of punishment, to bring the act punishable by
civil law to the notice of the local or imperial authorities
and to invoke the aid of the secular arm&mdash;above all, to
force the Christians to comply with the demands of
the imperial cultus. In the later period the regents
adhering to the old faith even expressly enjoin these
chief priests personally, and through the priests of the
towns placed under them, to punish contraventions of the
existing religious arrangements, and assign to them
exactly the part which under the emperors of the new
faith is taken by the metropolitan and his urban bishops.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a>
Probably here it was not the heathen organisation that
copied the Christian institutions; but, conversely, the
conquering Christian church that took its hierarchic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
weapons from the arsenal of the enemy. All this
applied, as we have already observed, to the whole
empire; but the very practical consequences of the
provincial regulation of the imperial cultus&mdash;the exercise
of religious superintendence and the persecution of
persons of another faith&mdash;were drawn pre&ndash;eminently in
Asia Minor.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">System of
religion.</span>Alongside of the cultus of the emperors the worship of
the gods proper found its favoured abode in Asia Minor,
and all its extravagances in particular there found a
refuge. The mischief of asylums and of miraculous
cures had here its seat in a quite special sense. Under
Tiberius the limitation of the former was enjoined by
the Roman senate; the god of healing, Asklepios,
nowhere performed more and greater wonders than in
his much&ndash;loved city of Pergamus, which worshipped him
as Zeus Asklepios, and owed to him a good part of its
prosperity in the imperial period. The most active wonder&ndash;workers
of the time of the empire&mdash;the subsequently
canonised Cappadocian Apollonius of Tyana and the
Paphlagonian serpent&ndash;man Alexander of Abonuteichos&mdash;belonged
to Asia Minor. If the general prohibition
of associations was carried out, as we shall see, with
special strictness in Asia Minor, the reason must doubtless
be sought mainly in the religious conditions which gave
special occasion to the abuse of such unions there.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Public
safety.</span>The public safety was left to depend in the main on
the land itself. In the earlier imperial period, apart from
the Syrian command which included eastern Cilicia, there
was stationed in all Asia Minor simply a detachment of
5000 auxiliary troops, which served as a garrison in the
province of Galatia,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> along with a fleet of 40 ships; this
command was destined partly to keep in check the
restless Pisidians, partly to cover the north&ndash;eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
frontier of the empire, and to watch over the coast of
the Black Sea as far as the Crimea. Vespasian raised
this troop to the status of an army corps of two legions
and placed their staffs in the province of Cappadocia on the
upper Euphrates. Besides these forces destined to guard
the frontier there were not then any garrisons of note in
anterior Asia; in the imperial province of Lycia and
Pamphylia, <em>e.g.</em> there lay a single cohort of 500 men, in
the senatorial provinces, at the most, individual soldiers
told off from the imperial guard or from the neighbouring
imperial provinces for special purposes.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> If this testifies,
on the one hand, most emphatically to the internal peace
of these provinces, and clearly brings before our eyes the
enormous contrast of the citizens of Asia Minor with the
constantly unsettled capitals of Syria and Egypt, it
explains, on the other hand, the subsistence, already
noticed in another connection, of brigandage in a country
mountainous throughout and in the interior partly
desolate, particularly on the Myso&ndash;Bithynian frontier
and in the mountain valleys of Pisidia and Isauria.
There was no civic militia proper in Asia Minor. In
spite of the flourishing of gymnastic institutes for boys,
youths, and men, the Hellenes of this period in Asia
remained as unwarlike as in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a><span class="sidenote">Eirenarchs.</span> They restricted
themselves to creating for the maintenance of public
safety civic peace&ndash;masters &#40;Eirenarchs&#41;, and placing at
their disposal a number of civic <em>gens d&#8217;armes</em>, partly
mounted mercenaries of small repute, but which must yet
have been useful, since the emperor Marcus did not
disdain, in the sorely felt want of tried soldiers during
the Marcomanian war, to incorporate these town&ndash;soldiers
of Asia Minor among the imperial troops.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Administration
of
justice.</span>The administration of justice on the part as well of
the civic authorities as of the governors left at this epoch
much to be desired; yet the emergence of the imperial
rule marks a turn in it for the better. The interference
of the supreme power had under the republic confined
itself to the penal control of the public officials, and
exercised this, especially in later times, feebly and
factiously, or rather not at all. Now not merely were
the reins drawn tighter in Rome, inasmuch as the strict
superintendence of its own officers was inseparable from
the unity of military government, and even the imperial
senate was induced to watch more sharply over the
administration of its mandatories; but it became now
possible to set aside the miscarriages of the provincial
courts by way of the newly introduced appeal, or else,
where an impartial trial could not be expected in the
province, to carry the process to Rome before the bar
of the emperor.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> Both of these steps applied also to
the senatorial provinces, and were to all appearance
predominantly felt as a benefit.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The constitution
of
towns in
Asia Minor.</span>As in the case of the Hellenes of Europe, so in Asia
Minor the Roman province was essentially an aggregate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
of urban communities. Here, as in Hellas, the traditional
received forms of democratic polity were in general retained,
<em>e.g.</em> the magistrates continued to be chosen by the
burgesses, but everywhere the determining influence was
placed in the hands of the wealthy, and no free play was
allowed to the pleasure of the multitude any more than
to serious political ambition. Among the limitations of
municipal autonomy it was peculiar to the towns of Asia
Minor, that the already mentioned Eirenarch, the police&ndash;master
of the city, was subsequently nominated by the
governor from a list of ten names proposed by the council
of the city.<span class="sidenote">Logistae.</span> The government&ndash;trusteeship of civic finance&ndash;administration&mdash;the
imperial appointment of one not belonging
to the city itself as a guardian of property &#40;<em>curator
rei publicae</em>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λογιστής</span>&#41;, whose consent the civic authorities
had to procure in the more important dealings with property&mdash;was
never generally ordained, but only for this or
that city according to need; in Asia Minor, however, in
keeping with the importance of its urban development, it
was introduced specially early, <em>i.e.</em> from the beginning of
the second century, and on a specially comprehensive scale.
At least in the third century here, as elsewhere, other
important decrees of the communal administration had
to be laid before the governor to be confirmed. The
Roman government did not insist anywhere, and least
of all in the Hellenic lands, on uniformity of municipal
constitution; in Asia Minor there prevailed great
variety, according, it may be conjectured, in many
cases with the pleasure of the individual burgess&ndash;bodies,
although for the communities belonging to the same
province the law organising each province prescribed
general rules. Whatever institutions of this sort may
be looked upon as diffused in Asia Minor, and predominantly
peculiar to the land, bear no political character,
but are merely significant as regards social
relations, such as the unions spread over all Asia Minor,
partly of the older, partly of the younger citizens,
<span class="sidenote">Gerusia,
Neoi.</span> the Gerusia and the Neoi, clubs for the two classes of
age with corresponding places of gymnastic exercise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
festivals.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> Of autonomous communities there were from
the outset far fewer in Asia Minor than in Hellas
proper; and, in particular, the most important towns of
Asia Minor never had this doubtful distinction, or at
any rate early lost it, such as Cyzicus under Tiberius
&#40;<a href="#Page_348">p.&nbsp;348</a>&#41;, Samos through Vespasian. Asia Minor was just
old subject&ndash;territory and, under its Persian as under its
Hellenic rulers, accustomed to monarchic organisation;
here less than in Hellas did useless recollections and vague
hopes carry men away beyond the limited municipal horizon
of the present, and there was not much of this sort to disturb
the peaceful enjoyment of such happiness in life as
was possible under the existing circumstances.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Urban life.</span>Of this happiness of life there was abundance in
Asia Minor under the Roman imperial government.
&#8220;No province of them all,&#8221; says an author living in
Smyrna under the Antonines, &#8220;has so many towns to
show as ours, and none such towns as our largest. It has
the advantage of a charming country, a favourable climate,
varied products, a position in the centre of the empire,
a girdle of peaceful people all round, good order, rarity
of crime, gentle treatment of slaves, consideration and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
goodwill from the rulers.&#8221; Asia was called, as we have
already said, the province of the five hundred towns; and,
if the arid interior, in part fitted only for pasture, of
Phrygia, Lycaonia, Galatia, and Cappadocia was even
at that time but thinly peopled, the rest of the coast was
not far behind Asia. The enduring prosperity of the
regions capable of cultivation in Asia Minor did not
extend merely to the cities of illustrious name, such as
Ephesus, Smyrna, Laodicea, Apamea; wherever a corner
of the country, neglected under the desolation of the
fifteen hundred years which separate us from that time,
is opened up to investigation, there the first and the most
powerful feeling is that of astonishment, one might almost
say of shame, at the contrast of the wretched and pitiful
present with the happiness and splendour of the past
Roman age.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Cragus,
Sidyma.</span>On a secluded mountain&ndash;top not far from the Lycian
coast, where according to the Greek fable dwelt the
Chimaera, lay the ancient Cragus, probably built only of
beams and clay tiles, and having for that reason no trace
of it left excepting the Cyclopian fortress&ndash;walls at the
foot of the hill. Below the summit spreads a pleasant
fertile valley with fresh Alpine air and southern vegetation,
surrounded by mountains rich in woods and game.
When under the emperor Claudius Lycia became a province,
the Roman government transferred the mountain&ndash;town&mdash;the
&#8220;green Cragus&#8221; of Horace&mdash;to this plain; in the
market&ndash;place of the new town, Sidyma, the remains still
stand of the tetrastyle temple then dedicated to the
emperor, and of a stately colonnade, which a native of
the place who had acquired means as a physician built in
his early home. Statues of the emperors and of deserving
fellow&ndash;citizens adorned the market; there were in the
town a temple to its protecting gods, Artemis and Apollo,
baths, gymnastic institutions &#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνάσια</span>&#41; for the older as
for the younger citizens; from the gates along the main
road, which led steeply down the mountain side to the
harbour Calabatia, there stretched on both sides rows of
stone sepulchral monuments, more stately and more costly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
than those of Pompeii, and for the most part still erect,
while the houses presumably built, like those of the ancient
city, from perishable materials, have disappeared. We
may draw an inference as to the position and habits of
the former inhabitants from a municipal decree recently
found there, probably drawn up under Commodus, as to
constituting the club for the elder citizens; it was composed
of a hundred members, taken one half from the
town&ndash;council and the other from the rest of the citizens,
including not more than three freedmen and one person
of illegitimate birth, all the rest begotten in lawful wedlock
and belonging in part to demonstrably old and
wealthy burgess&ndash;houses. Some of these families attained
to Roman citizenship, one even to the senate of the
empire. But even abroad this senatorial house, as well
as different physicians of Sidyma employed in other
lands and even at the imperial court, remained mindful
of their home, and several of them closed their lives there;
one of these distinguished denizens has put together the
legends of the town and the prophecies concerning it in
a compilation not exactly excellent, but very learned and
very patriotic, and caused these memorabilia to be publicly
exhibited. This Cragus&ndash;Sidyma did not vote among
towns of the first class at the diet of the small Lycian
province, was without a theatre, without honorary titles,
and without those general festivals which in the world, as
it then was, marked a great town; was even, according to
the conception of the ancients, a small provincial town
and thoroughly a creation of the Roman imperial period.
But in the whole Vilajet A&#239;din there is at the present
day no inland place which can be even remotely placed
by the side of this little mountain&ndash;town, such as it was,
as regards civilised existence. What still stands vividly
to&ndash;day before our eyes in this secluded village has disappeared,
with the exception of slight remains, or even without
a trace, in an untold number of other towns under the
devastating hand of man. The coinage of the imperial
period, freely given to the towns in copper, allows us a
certain glance at this abundance; no province can even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
remotely vie with Asia in the number of mints and the
variety of the representations.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Defects of
municipal
administration.</span>No doubt this merging of all interests in the petty
town of one&#8217;s birth was not without its reverse side in
Asia Minor, any more than among the European Greeks.
What was said of their communal administration holds
good in the main also here. The urban finance&ndash;system,
which knows itself to be without right control, lacks
steadiness and frugality and often even honesty; as to
buildings&mdash;sometimes the resources of the town are
exceeded, sometimes even what is most needful is left
undone; the humbler citizens become accustomed to the
largesses of the town&ndash;chest, or of men of wealth, to free oil
in the baths, to public banquets and popular recreations out
of others&#8217; pockets; the good houses become used to the
clientage of the multitude, with its abject demonstrations
of homage, its begging intrigues, its divisions; rivalries
exist, as between town and town &#40;<a href="#Page_329">p.&nbsp;329</a>&#41;, so in every town
between the several circles and the several houses; the
government in Asia Minor dares not to introduce the
formation of poor&ndash;clubs and of voluntary fire&ndash;brigades, such
as everywhere existed in the west, because the spirit of
faction here at once takes possession of every association.
The calm sea easily becomes a swamp, and the lack of
the great pulsation of general interest is clearly discernible
also in Asia Minor.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Prosperity.</span>Asia Minor, especially in its anterior portion, was one of
the richest domains of the great Roman state. It is true
that the misgovernment of the republic, the disasters of
the Mithradatic time thereby produced, thereafter the evil
of piracy, and lastly the many years of civil war which
had financially affected few provinces so severely as these,
had doubtless so utterly disorganised the means of the
communities and of individuals there, that Augustus
resorted to the extreme expedient of striking off all
claims of debt; all the Asiatics, with the exception of
the Rhodians, made use of this dangerous remedy. But
the peaceful government which again set in made up for
much. Not everywhere&mdash;the islands of the Aegean Sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
for example, never thereafter revived&mdash;but in most places,
already when Augustus died, the wounds as well as the
remedies were forgotten; and in this state the land
remained for three centuries down to the epoch of the
Gothic wars. The sums at which the towns of Asia
Minor were assessed, and which they themselves, certainly
under control of the governor, had to allocate and raise,
formed one of the most considerable sources of income
for the imperial exchequer. How the burden of taxation
stood related to the ability of the taxed to pay, we are
unable to ascertain; but permanent overburdening in the
strict sense is not compatible with the circumstances in
which we find the land down to the middle of the third
century. The remissness of the government, still more
perhaps than its intentional forbearance, may have kept
within bounds the fiscal restriction of traffic and the
application of a tax&ndash;screw which was inconvenient not
merely for the taxed. In great calamities, particularly
on occasion of the earthquakes which under Tiberius fearfully
devastated twelve flourishing cities of Asia, especially
Sardis, and under Pius a number of Carian and Lycian
towns and the islands of Cos and Rhodes, private and
above all imperial help was rendered with great liberality,
and bestowed upon the natives of Asia Minor the full
blessing of a great state&mdash;the collective guarantee of all for
all. The construction of roads, which the Romans had
taken in hand on the first erection of the province of Asia
by Manius Aquillius &#40;iii.&nbsp;59&#41;<span class="sidenote2">iii.&nbsp;56.</span>, was seriously prosecuted
during the imperial period in Asia Minor only where
larger garrisons were stationed, particularly in Cappadocia
and the neighbouring Galatia, after Vespasian had instituted
a legionary camp on the middle Euphrates.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> In
the other provinces not much was done for it, partly,
doubtless, in consequence of the laxity of the senatorial
government; wherever roads were here constructed on the
part of the state, it was done on imperial ordinance.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span></p>

<p>This prosperity of Asia Minor was not the work of a
government of superior insight and energetic activity.
The political institutions, the incitements of trade and commerce,
the initiative in literature and art belong throughout
Asia Minor to the old free towns or to the Attalids.
What the Roman government gave to the land, was
essentially the permanence of a state of peace, the toleration
of inward prosperity, the absence of that governing
wisdom which regards every sound pair of arms and
every saved piece of money as rightfully subservient to its
immediate aims&mdash;negative virtues of personages far from
prominent, but often more conducive to the common
weal than the great deeds of the self&ndash;constituted guardians
of mankind.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Trade and
commerce.</span>The prosperity of Asia Minor was in beautiful equipoise,
dependent as much on agriculture as on industry
and commerce. The favours of nature were bestowed in
richest measure, especially on the regions of the coast;
and there are many evidences with how laborious diligence,
even under more difficult circumstances, every at
all useable piece of ground was turned to account, <em>e.g.</em> in
the rocky valley of the Eurymedon in Pamphylia by the
citizens of Selga. The products of the industry of Asia
Minor are too numerous and too manifold to be dwelt
upon in detail;<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> we may mention that the immense pastures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
of the interior, with their flocks of sheep and goats,
made Asia Minor the headquarters of woollen manufactures
and of weaving generally&mdash;it suffices to recall the
Milesian and the Galatian, that is, the Angora, wool, the
Attalic gold&ndash;embroideries, the cloths prepared in the
workshops of Phrygian Laodicea after the Nervian, that is
the Flemish, style. It is well&ndash;known that an insurrection
had almost broken out in Ephesus because the goldsmiths
dreaded injury to their sale of sacred images from the new
Christian faith. In Philadelphia, a considerable town of
Lydia, we know the names of two out of the seven
districts: they are those of the wool&ndash;weavers and the
shoemakers. Probably there is here brought to light
what in the case of the other towns is hidden under older
and more genteel names, that the more considerable towns
of Asia included throughout not merely a multitude of
labourers, but also a numerous manufacturing population.</p>

<p>The money&ndash;dealing and traffic were in Asia Minor
dependent chiefly on its own products. The great foreign
import and export trade of Syria and Egypt was in the
main excluded, though from the eastern lands various
articles were introduced into Asia Minor, <em>e.g.</em> a considerable
number of slaves through the Galatian traders.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> But,
if the Roman merchants were to be found here apparently
in every large and small town, even at places like Ilium
and Assus in Mysia, Prymnessus and Traianopolis in
Phrygia, in such numbers that their associations were in the
habit of taking part along with the town&#8217;s burgesses in
public acts; if in Hierapolis, in the interior of Phrygia, a
manufacturer &#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐργαστής</span>&#41; caused it to be inscribed on his
tomb that he had in his lifetime sailed seventy&ndash;two times
round Cape Malea to Italy, and a Roman poet describes
the merchant of the capital who hastens to the port, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
order not to let his business&ndash;friend from Cibyra, not far
distant from Hierapolis, fall into the hands of rivals,
there is thus opened up a glimpse into a stirring manufacturing
and mercantile life not merely at the seaports.
Language also testifies to the constant intercourse with
Italy; among the Latin words that became current in
Asia Minor not a few proceed from such intercourse, as
indeed in Ephesus even the guild of the wool&ndash;weavers
gives itself a Latin name.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> Teachers of all sorts and
physicians came especially from this quarter to Italy and
the other lands of the Latin tongue, and not merely
gained often considerable wealth, but also brought it back
to their native place; among those to whom the towns of
Asia Minor owe buildings or endowments, the physicians
who had become rich,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> and literati, occupy a prominent
position. Lastly, the emigration of the great families to
Italy affected Asia Minor less and later than the West; it
was easier for people from Vienna and Narbo to transplant
themselves to the capital of the empire than from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
Greek towns; nor was the government in the earlier
period quite inclined to bring the municipals of mark
from Asia Minor to the court, and to introduce them into
the Roman aristocracy.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Literary
activity.</span>If we leave out of view the marvellous period of early
bloom, in which the Ionic epos and the Aeolic lyric
poetry, the beginnings of historical composition and of
philosophy, of plastic art and of painting, had their rise
on these shores, in science as in the practice of art the
great age of Asia Minor was that of the Attalids, which
faithfully cherished the memory of that still greater epoch.
If Smyrna showed divine honours to its citizen Homer,
struck coins for him and named them after him, there was
thus expressed the feeling, which dominated all Ionia and
all Asia Minor, that divine art had come down to earth in
Hellas generally, and in Ionia in particular</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Instruction.</span>How early and to what extent elementary instruction
was an object of public care in these regions is clearly
shown by a decree of the town Teos in Lydia<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> concerning
it. According to this, after the gift of capital by a rich
citizen had provided the town with means, there was to be
instituted in future, alongside of the inspector of gymnastics

&#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παιδονόμος</span>&#41;. Further, there were to be appointed
three paid teachers of writing with salaries, according to
the three classes respectively, of 600, 550, and 500
drachmae, in order that all the free boys and girls might
be instructed in writing; likewise two gymnastic masters,
each with a salary of 500 drachmae; a teacher of music
with a salary of 700 drachmae, who should instruct the
boys of the last two years at school and the youths that
had left school in playing the lute and the cithara; a boxing
master with 300 drachmae, and a teacher for archery
and throwing of the spear with a pay of 250 drachmae.
The teachers of writing and music are to hold a public
examination of the scholars annually in the town&ndash;hall.
Such was the Asia Minor of the time of the Attalids; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
the Roman republic did not continue their work. It did
not cause its victories over the Galatians to be immortalised
by the chisel, and the Pergamene library went
shortly before the battle of Actium to Alexandria; many
of the best germs perished in the devastation of the Mithradatic
and the civil wars. It was only in the time of
the empire that the care of art, and above all of literature,
revived at least outwardly with the prosperity of Asia
Minor. To a primacy proper, such as was possessed by
Athens as a university&ndash;town, by Alexandria in the sphere
of scientific research, and by the frivolous capital of Syria
for the drama and the <em>ballet</em>, none of the numerous cities
of Asia Minor could lay claim in any direction whatever;
but general culture was probably nowhere more widely
diffused and more influential. It must have been very
early the custom in Asia to grant to teachers and physicians
exemption from the civic offices and functions that
involved expense; to this province was directed the edict
of the emperor Pius &#40;<a href="#Page_329">p.&nbsp;329</a>&#41;, which, in order to set limits
to an exemption that was evidently very burdensome
for the city finances, prescribes maximal numbers for it:
<em>e.g.</em> allows towns of the first class to grant this immunity
to the extent of ten physicians, five instructors in rhetoric,
and five in grammar.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Addresses
of the
sophists.</span>The position of Asia Minor as occupying the first rank
in the literary world of the imperial period was based on
the system of the rhetors, or, according to the expression
later in use, the sophists of this epoch&mdash;a system which we
moderns cannot easily realise. The place of written works,
which pretty nearly ceased to have any significance, was
taken by the public discourse, somewhat of the nature of
our modern university and academic addresses, eternally
producing itself anew and preserved only by way of exception,
once heard and applauded, and then for ever forgotten.
The contents were furnished frequently by the occasion
of the birthday of the emperor, the arrival of the governor,
or any analogous event, public or private; still more frequently
without any occasion they talked at large on
everything, which was not practical and not instructive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
The political address had no existence for this age at all,
not even in the Roman senate. The forensic speech was
no longer for the Greeks the goal of oratory, but stood
alongside of the speech for speaking&#8217;s sake as a neglected
and plebeian sister, to which a master of that art might
occasionally condescend. From poetry, philosophy, history,
there was borrowed whatever admitted of being dealt
with by way of common&ndash;place, while these all themselves,
little cultivated in general, least of all in Asia Minor,
and still less esteemed, languish by the side of the pure art
of words and beneath its infection. The great past of the
nation is regarded by these orators, so to speak, as their
special property; they reverence and treat Homer in
some measure as the Rabbins do the books of Moses, and
even in religion they study the most zealous orthodoxy.
These discourses are sustained by all the allowed and
unallowed resources of the theatre, by the art of gesticulation
and of modulation of the voice, by the magnificence
of the orator&#8217;s costume, by the artifices of the virtuoso
and the methods of partisanship, by competition, by the
<em>claque</em>. To the boundless self&ndash;conceit of these word&ndash;artists
corresponds the lively sympathetic interest of the public&mdash;which
is but little inferior to that felt for race&ndash;horses&mdash;and
the expression given to this sympathy quite after the
fashion of the theatre; and the frequency with which
such exhibitions were brought before the cultured in the
larger places entitles them, just like the theatre, to rank
everywhere among the customary doings of urban life.
If perhaps our understanding of this extinct phenomenon
may be somewhat helped by connecting it with the impression
called forth in our most susceptible great cities
by the discourses of their learned bodies, as they fall due,
there is yet wholly wanting in the modern state of things
what was by far the main matter in the ancient world&mdash;the
didactic element, and the connection of the aimless
public discourse with the higher instruction of youth. If
the latter at present, as we say, educates the boy of the
cultured class to be a professor of philology, it educated
him then to be a professor of eloquence, and, in fact, of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
sort of eloquence. For the school&ndash;training conduced more
and more to equip the boy for holding just such discourses,
as we have now described, on his own part, if possible, in
two languages; and, whoever had finished the course with
profit, applauded in similar performances the recollection
of his own time at school.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Asia Minor
leads the
fashion.</span>This production embraced East and West, but Asia Minor
stood in the van and led the fashion. When in the age of
Augustus the school&ndash;rhetoric gained a footing in the Latin
instruction of the youth of the capital, its chief pillars
alongside of Italians and Spaniards were two natives of
Asia Minor, Arellius Fuscus and Cestius Pius. At that
same place, where the grave forensic address maintained
its ground in the better imperial period by the side of
this parasite, an ingenious advocate of the Flavian age
points to the enormous gulf which separates Nicetes of
Smyrna and the other rhetoricians applauded in Ephesus
and Mytilene from Aeschines and Demosthenes. By far
the most, and most noted, of the famous rhetors of this sort
are from the coast of western Asia. We have already
observed how much the supply of schoolmasters for the
whole empire told upon the finances of the towns of Asia
Minor. In the course of the imperial period the number
and the estimation of these sophists were constantly on
the increase, and they gained ground more and more in
the west. The cause of this lies partly doubtless in the
changed attitude of the government, which in the second
century&mdash;especially after the Hadrianic epoch exhibiting
not so much a Hellenising as a bad cosmopolitan type&mdash;stood
less averse to Greek and Oriental habits than
in the first; but chiefly in the ever increasing general
diffusion of higher culture, and the rapidly enlarging
number of institutes for the higher instruction of youth.
The sophistic system thus belongs, at all events especially,
to Asia Minor, and particularly to the Asia Minor of the
second and third centuries; only there may not be found
in this literary primacy any special peculiarity of these
Greeks and of this epoch, or even a national characteristic.
The sophistic system appears everywhere alike, in Smyrna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
and Athens as in Rome and Carthage; the masters of
eloquence were sent out like patterns of lamps, and the
manufacture was organised everywhere in the same way,
Greek or Latin, according to desire, the supply being
raised in accordance with the need. But no doubt those
Greek districts, which took precedence in prosperity and
culture, furnished this article of export of the best quality
and in greatest quantity; this holds true of Asia Minor
for the times of Sulla and Cicero no less than for those
of Hadrian and the Antonines.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Galenus.</span>Here, however, all is not shadow. Those same regions
possess, not indeed among the professional sophists, but
yet among the <em>literati</em> of a different type, who are still
found there in comparatively large numbers, the best
representatives of Hellenism which this epoch has at all
to show, the teacher of philosophy, Dio of Prusa in
Bithynia, under Vespasian and Trajan, and the medical
man Galenus of Pergamus, imperial physician in ordinary at
the courts of Marcus and Severus. What is particularly
pleasing in the case of Galen is the polished manner of
the man of the world and the courtier, in connection with
a general and philosophical culture, such as is frequently
conspicuous in the physicians of this period.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Dio of
Prusa.</span>In purity of sentiment and clear grasp of the position
of things, the Bithynian Dio is nowise inferior to the
scholar of Chaeronea; in plastic power, in elegance and
apt vigour of speech, in earnest meaning underlying lightness
of form, in practical energy, he is superior to him. The
best of his writings&mdash;the fancies of the ideal Hellene before
the invention of the city and of money; the appeal to
the Rhodians, the only surviving representatives of genuine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
Hellenism; the description of the Hellenes of his time in
the solitude of Olbia as in the luxury of Nicomedia and of
Tarsus; the exhortations to the individual as to an earnest
conduct of life, and to all as to their keeping together in
unity&mdash;form the best evidence that even of the Hellenism
of Asia Minor in the time of the empire the word of the
poet holds good: &#8220;The sun even in setting is ever the
same.&#8221;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">3</span></a> After the campaign of Crassus
the conquered land was probably
organised in such a way that the
coast went to the Thracian kingdom,
as Zippel has shown &#40;<cite>R&ouml;m. Illyricum</cite>,
p. 243&#41;, and the western portion was,
just like Thrace, assigned in fief to
the native princes, in place of one of
whom must have come the <em>praefectus
civitatium Moesiae et Triballiae</em> &#40;<cite>C. I.
L.</cite> v.&nbsp;1838&#41;, who was still acting
under Tiberius. The usual assumption
that Moesia was at first combined
with Illyricum, rests only on the circumstance
that in the enumeration of
the provinces apportioned in the year
727 between emperor and senate in
Dio, liii.&nbsp;12 it is not named, and so
was contained in &#8220;Dalmatia.&#8221; But
this enumeration does not extend at
all to the vassal&ndash;states and the procuratorial
provinces, and so far all is in
due keeping with our assumption. On
the other hand, weighty arguments
tell against the usual hypothesis.
Had Moesia been originally a part of
the province of Illyricum, it would have
retained this name; for on the division
of a province the name was usually
retained, and only a defining epithet
added. But the appellation Illyricum,
which Dio doubtless reproduces <em>l.c.</em>,
was always in this connection restricted
to the upper &#40;Dalmatia&#41; and the lower
&#40;Pannonia&#41;. Moreover, if Moesia was
a part of Illyricum, there was no
room left for that Prefect of Moesia
and Triballia, or in other words for
his kingly predecessor. Lastly, it
is far from probable that in 727<span class="sidenote2">27.</span> a
command of such extent and importance
should have been entrusted to a
single senatorial governor. On the
other hand, everything admits of easy
explanation, if small client&ndash;states
arose in Moesia after the war of
Crassus; these were as such from the
outset under the emperor, and, as the
senate did not take part in their successive
annexation and conversion into a governorship, this might easily be
unnoticed in the Annals. It was
completed in or before the year 743<span class="sidenote2">11.</span>,
seeing that the governor, L. Calpurnius
Piso then waging war against the
Thracians, to whom Dio &#40;liv.&nbsp;34&#41;
erroneously assigns the province of
Pamphylia, can only have had as his
province Pannonia or Moesia, and, as
at that time Tiberius was acting as
legate in Pannonia, there is left for
him only Moesia. In 6 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> there
certainly appears an imperial governor
of Moesia.</p></div>

not king, like that of his father
Donnus, but &#8220;president of the cantonal
union&#8221; &#40;<em>praefectus civitatium</em>&#41;, as
he is named on the still standing arch
of Susa erected by him in honour of
Augustus in the year 745&ndash;6<span class="sidenote2">9&ndash;8.</span>. But the
position was beyond doubt held for
life, and, under reservation of the
superior&#8217;s right to confirm it, also
hereditary; so far therefore the union
was certainly a principality, as it is
usually so termed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">5</span></a> We know this road only in the
shape which the emperor Claudius,
the son of the constructor, gave to it;
originally, of course, it cannot have
been called <em>via Claudia</em>, but only
<em>via Augusta</em>, and we can hardly regard
as its terminus in Italy Altinum,
in the neighbourhood of the modern
Venice, since, under Augustus, all the
imperial roads still led to Rome.
That the road ran through the upper
Adige valley is shown by the milestone
found at Meran &#40;<cite>C. I. L.</cite> v.&nbsp;8003&#41;; that
it led to the Danube, is attested; the
connection of the making of this road
with the founding of Augusta Vindelicum,
though this was at first only a
market&ndash;village &#40;<em>forum</em>&#41;, is more than
probable &#40;<cite>C. I. L.</cite> iii.&nbsp;p. 711&#41;; in
what way Augsburg and the Danube
were reached from Meran we do not
know. Subsequently the road was
rectified, so as to leave the Adige at
Bautzen, and to lead up the Eisach
valley over the Brenner to Augsburg.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">8</span></a> That the fall of Drusus took place
in the region of the Saale we may be
allowed to infer from Strabo, vii.&nbsp;1, 3,
p. 291, although he only says that he
perished on the march between Salas
and Rhine, and the identification of
the Salas with the Saale rests solely
on the resemblance of name. From
the scene of the mishap he was then
transported as far as the summer
camp &#40;Seneca, <cite>Cons. ad Marciam</cite> 3:
<em>ipsis illum hostibus aegrum cum veneratione
et pace mutua prosequentibus
nec optare quod expediebat audentibus</em>&#41;,
and in that camp he died &#40;Sueton.,
<cite>Claud.</cite> 1&#41;. This camp lay in the
heart of the barbarian land &#40;Valerius
Max. v.&nbsp;5, 3&#41; and not very far from
the battlefield of Varus &#40;Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite>
ii.&nbsp;7, where the <em>vetus ara Druso sita</em>
is certainly to be referred to the place
where he died&#41;; we may be allowed
to seek it in the region of the Weser.
The dead body was then conveyed to
the winter&ndash;camp &#40;Dio, lv.&nbsp;2&#41; and there
burnt; this spot was regarded, according
to Roman usage, also as the place of
burial, although the depositing of the
ashes took place in Rome, and to
this is to be referred the <em>honorarius
tumulus</em> with the annual obsequies
&#40;Sueton. <cite>l.c.</cite>&#41;. Probably we have to
seek for this place at Vetera. When
a later author &#40;Eutropius, vii.&nbsp;13&#41;
speaks of the <em>monumentum</em> of Drusus
at Mentz, this is doubtless not the
tomb, but the elsewhere mentioned
Tropaeum &#40;Florus, ii.&nbsp;30: <em>Marcomanorum
spoliis et insignibus quendam
editum tumulum in tropaei modum

partly confirmed by Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite> iv.
44, cannot be apprehended otherwise.
Noricum and Raetia must have been
put under this governor as an exceptional
measure, or the course of
operations induced him to pass beyond
the limit of his governorship. The
assumption that he marched through
Bohemia itself, which would involve
still greater difficulties, is not required
by the narrative.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">10</span></a> To a connection in rear of the

Boulogne we might perhaps take the
much disputed notice of Florus, ii.&nbsp;30,
to refer: <em>Bonnam</em> &#40;or <em>Bormam</em>&#41; <em>et Gessoriacum
pontibus iunxit classibusque firmavit</em>, with which is to be compared
the mention by the same author
of forts on the Maas. Bonn may
reasonably have been at that time
the station of the Rhine&ndash;fleet; Boulogne
was in later times still a fleet&ndash;station.
Drusus might well have
occasion to make the shortest and
safest land&ndash;route between the two
stations for the fleet available for
transport, though the writer, probably
bent on striking effect, awakens
by his pointed mode of expression
conceptions which cannot be in that
form correct.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">11</span></a> As to the administrative partition
of Gaul there is, apart from the
separation of the Narbonensis, an
utter absence of accounts, because it
rested only on imperial ordinances,
and nothing in reference to it came
into the records of the senate. But
the first information of the existence
of separate Upper and Lower German
commands is furnished by the campaigns
of Germanicus, and the battle
of Varus can hardly be understood
under that assumption; here, doubtless,
the <em>hiberna inferiora</em> appear,
viz. that of Vetera &#40;Velleius, ii.&nbsp;120&#41;,
and the counterpart to it, the <em>superiora</em>,
can only have been formed by
that of Mentz; but this was not
under a colleague of Varus, but under
his nephew, who was thus subordinate
to him in command. Probably
the partition only took place, in
consequence of the defeat, in the last
years of Augustus.</p></div>

as we know, on German ground, is to
be sought just there, is at least very
probable. That the two Roman
roads running along the Lippe, and
their fortified places of bivouac, led at
least as far as the region of Lippstadt,
the researches of H&ouml;lzermann in particular
have shown. The upper
Lippe has only one confluent of note,
the Alme, and as the village of Elsen
lies not far from where the Alme
falls into the Lippe, some weight may
be here assigned to the similarity of
name. To the view, supported among
others by Schmidt, which places Aliso
at the confluence of the Glenne &#40;and
Liese&#41; with the Lippe, the chief objection
is that the camp <em>ad caput
Lupiae</em> must then have been different
from Aliso, and in general this point
lies too far from the line of the Weser,
while from Elsen the route leads
directly through the D&ouml;ren defile into
the Werra valley. Schmidt, who does
not adhere to the identification of
Aliso and Elsen, remarks generally
&#40;<cite>Westf&auml;lische Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Gesch. und
Alterthumskunde</cite>, xx. p. 259&#41;, that
the heights of Weser &#40;not far from
Elsen&#41;, and generally the left margin
of the valley of the Alme, are the
centre of a semicircle formed by the
mountains in front, and this highlying,
dry region, allowing an exact
look&ndash;out as far as the mountains,
which covers the whole country of
the Lippe and is itself covered in
front by the Alme, is well adapted for
the starting&ndash;point of a march towards
the Weser.</p></div>

connected view of this catastrophe,
explains the course of it sufficiently,
if we only take further into account&mdash;what
Dio certainly does not bring
into prominence&mdash;the general relation
of the summer and winter
camps, and thereby answer the question
justly put by Ranke &#40;<cite>Weltgeschichte</cite>,
iii.&nbsp;2, 275&#41;, how the whole
army could have marched against a
local insurrection. The narrative of
Florus by no means rests on sources
originally different, as that scholar
assumes, but simply on the dramatic
accumulation of motives for action,
such as is characteristic of all historians
of this type. The peaceful
dispensing of justice by Varus and
the storming of the camp are both
known to the better tradition, and
that in their causal connection. The
ridiculous representation of the Germans
breaking in at all the gates into
the camp, while Varus is sitting on
the judgment&ndash;seat and the herald is
summoning the parties before him, is
not tradition, but a picture manufactured
from it. That this is in utter
antagonism to the description by
Tacitus of the three bivouacs, as well
as to sound reason, is obvious.</p></div>

calculated exactly, inasmuch as among
them there may have been double divisions
&#40;<em>miliariae</em>&#41;; but the army cannot
have numbered much over 20,000
men. On the other hand, there appears no reason for assuming a
material difference of the effective
strength from the normal. The
numerous detachments which are
mentioned &#40;Dio, lvi. 19&#41; serve to
account for the comparatively small
number of the <em>auxilia</em>, which were
always by preference employed for
this duty.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">20</span></a> As Germanicus, coming from the
Ems, lays waste the territory between
the Ems and Lippe, that is, the
region of M&uuml;nster, and not far from
it lies the <em>Teutoburgiensis saltus</em>, where
Varus&#8217;s army perished &#40;Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite>
i. 61&#41;, it is most natural to understand
this description, which does not suit
the flat M&uuml;nster region, of the range
bounding the M&uuml;nster region on the
north&ndash;east, the Osning; but it may
also be deemed applicable to the
Wiehen mountains somewhat farther
to the north, parallel with the Osning,
and stretching from Minden to the
source of the Hunte. We do not
know at what point on the Weser
the summer camp stood; but in accordance
with the position of Aliso
near Paderborn, and with the connections
subsisting between this and
the Weser, it was probably somewhere
near Minden. The direction
of the march on the return may have
been any other excepting only the
nearest way to Aliso; and the catastrophe
consequently occurred not on
the military line of communication
between Minden and Paderborn itself,
but at a greater or less distance from
it. Varus may have marched from
Minden somewhat in the direction
of Osnabr&uuml;ck, then after the attack
have attempted from thence to reach
Paderborn, and have met with his
end on this march in one of those
two ranges of hills. For centuries
there have been found in the district
of Venne at the source of the
Hunte a surprisingly large number
of Roman gold, silver, and copper
coins, such as circulated in the time
of Augustus, while later coins hardly
occur there at all &#40;comp. the proofs in
Paul H&ouml;fer, <cite>der Feldzug des Germanicus
im Jahre 16</cite>, Gotha, 1884, p. 82, f.&#41;
The coins thus found cannot belong
to one store of coins on account of
their scattered occurrence and of the
difference of metals, nor to a centre
of traffic on account of their proximity
as regards time; they look quite like
the leavings of a great extirpated army,
and the accounts before us as to the
battle of Varus may be reconciled
with this locality. As to the year of
the catastrophe there should never
have been any dispute; the shifting
of it to the year 10 is a mere mistake.
The season of the year is in
some measure determined by the fact
that between the arrangement to celebrate
the Illyrian victory and the
arrival of the unfortunate news in
Rome there lay only five days, and
that arrangement probably had in
view the victory of 3d Aug., though
it did not immediately follow on the
latter. Accordingly the defeat must
have taken place somewhere in September or October, which also accords
with the circumstance that the
last march of Varus was evidently
the march back from the summer to
the winter camp.</p></div>

state of war; but nothing at all is
reported from the nominal campaigns of the summers of 12, 13, and 14,

14 appears as the first undertaken by
Germanicus. It is true that Germanicus
had been proclaimed as Imperator

Augustus &#40;<cite>Mon. Ancyr.</cite> p. 17&#41;; but
there is nothing to hinder our referring

was in Rome for the administration
of the consulate, which he retained
throughout the year, and which was
still at that time treated in earnest;
this explains why Tiberius, as has
now been proved &#40;Hermann Schulz,
<cite>Quaest. Ovidianae</cite>, Greifswald, 1883,

to the Rhine. The two others,
although in the meanwhile employed
elsewhere on several occasions, were
still, at the beginning of the reign of

and with them, instead
of the Fourth, the First Adiutrix newly
instituted by Galba &#40;Tacitus, <cite>Hist.</cite> i.

ii.&nbsp;2477&#41;; the second must have been
one of those three, and was probably
the First Adiutrix, as this soon after
the year 88 takes part in the Danubian
wars of Domitian, and is under Trajan stationed in upper Germany,
which suggests the conjecture that it
was one of the several legions brought
in 88 from Spain to upper Germany,
and on this occasion came away from
Spain. In Lusitania no legions were

of <em>peregrini</em> had to solicit
from the senate the right to make
Latin the language of business; but
for the imperial period this no longer
held good. On the contrary, at this
time probably the converse was of
frequent occurrence. For example,
the right of coining was allowed on
the footing that the legend had to be
Latin. In like manner public buildings
erected by non&ndash;burgesses were
described in Latin; thus an inscription
of Ilipa in Andalusia &#40;<cite>C. I. L.</cite>

That the wearing of the toga was
allowed even to non&ndash;Romans, and
was a sign of a loyal disposition, is
shown as well by Strabo&#8217;s expression

by Agricola&#8217;s behaviour in Britain
&#40;Tacitus, <cite>Agric.</cite> 21&#41;.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">33</span></a> These remarkable arrangements
are clear, especially from the lists of
Spanish places in Pliny, and have
been well exhibited by Detlefsen
&#40;<cite>Philologus</cite>, xxxii., 606 f.&#41;. The
terminology no doubt varies. As the
designations <em>civitas</em>, <em>populus</em>, <em>gens</em>,
belong to the independent community,
they pertain <em>de jure</em> to these portions;
thus, <em>e.g.</em> there is mention of the <em>X
civitates</em> of the Autrigones, of the <em>XXII
populi</em> of the Asturians, of the <em>gens
Zoelarum</em> &#40;<cite>C. I. L.</cite> ii.&nbsp;2633&#41;, which
is just one of these twenty&ndash;two tribes.
The remarkable document which we
possess concerning these Zoelae &#40;<cite>C. I.
L.</cite> ii.&nbsp;2633&#41; informs us that this <em>gens</em>
was again divided into <em>gentilitates</em>,
which latter are also themselves called
<em>gentes</em>, as this same document and
other testimonies &#40;<cite>Eph. Ep.</cite> ii.&nbsp;p. 243&#41;
prove. <em>Civis</em> is also found in reference
to one of the Cantabrian <em>populi</em> &#40;<cite>Eph.
Ep.</cite> ii.&nbsp;p. 243&#41;. But even for the
larger canton, which indeed was once
the political unit, there are no other
designations than these, strictly speaking,
retrospective and incorrect; <em>gens</em>
in particular is employed for it even
in the technical style &#40;<em>e.g.</em>, <cite>C. I. L.</cite>
ii.&nbsp;4233 <em>Intercat&#91;iensis&#93; ex gente Vaccaeorum</em>&#41;.
That the commonwealth in
Spain was based on those small districts,
not on the cantons, is clear as
well from the terminology itself as
from the fact that Pliny in iii.&nbsp;3, 18,
places overagainst those 293 places
the <em>civitates contributae aliis</em>; moreover
it is shown by the official <em>at
census accipiendos civitatium XXIII
Vasconum et Vardulorum</em> &#40;<cite>C. I. L.</cite>
vi. 1463&#41; compared with the <em>censor

is unsuited for a community not
organised as a town, those Spanish
communities, which still after Vespasian&#8217;s
time lacked urban organisation,
must either have been excluded from
the bestowal of Latin rights or have
had special modifications to meet
their case. The latter may be regarded
as having more probability.
Inscriptions, even of the <em>gentes</em>, subsequent
to Vespasian&#8217;s time, show a
Latin form of name, as <cite>C. I. L.</cite> ii.
2633, and <cite>Eph. Ep.</cite> ii.&nbsp;322; and if
isolated ones from this period should
be found with non&ndash;Roman names, it
must always be a question whether
this is not simply due to actual negligence.
Presumptive proofs of non&ndash;Roman
communal organisation, comparatively
frequent in the scanty
inscriptions that certainly date before
Vespasian &#40;<cite>C. I. L.</cite> ii.&nbsp;172, 1953,

by me in inscriptions that are certainly

reaches decidedly beyond the Pyrenees,
though the interpretation of
individual coin&ndash;legends, which are
among others referred to Perpignan
and Narbonne, is not certain. As all
these coinings took place under Roman
authorisation, this suggests the
question whether this portion of the
subsequent Narbonensis was not at an
earlier date&mdash;namely before the founding
of Narbo &#40;636 <span class="smcap lowercase">U.C.</span>&#41;<span class="sidenote2">118.</span>&mdash;under the
governor of Hither Spain. There are
no Aquitanian coins with Iberian
legends any more than from north&ndash;western
Spain, probably because the
Roman supremacy, under whose protection
this coinage grew up, did not,
so long as the latter lasted, <em>i.e.</em> perhaps
up to the Numantine war,
embrace those regions.</p></div>

the professors of rhetoric and of the

exception of the Segusiavi, all these
are absent from the Lyons diet. Such
minor cantons not wholly merged into
the leading places may have subsisted
in great number in Gaul at the
time of the conquest. If, according
to Josephus &#40;<cite>Bell. Jud.</cite> ii.&nbsp;16, 4&#41;,
three hundred and five Gallic cantons
and twelve hundred towns obeyed the
Romans; these may be the figures that
were reckoned up for Caesar&#8217;s successes
in arms; if the small Iberian tribes in
Aquitania and the client&ndash;cantons in
the Celtic land were included in the
reckoning, such numbers might well
be the result.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_46_46" id="Footnote_46_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_46"><span class="label">46</span></a> This is indicated not only by the
inscription in Boissieu, p. 609, where
the words <em>tot&#91;i&#93;us cens&#91;us Galliarum&#93;</em>
are brought into connection with the
name of one of the altar&ndash;priests,
but also by the honorary inscription
erected by the three Gauls to an
imperial official <em>a censibus accipiendis</em>
&#40;Henzen, 6944&#41;. He appears to have
conducted the revision of the land&ndash;register
for the whole country, just
as formerly Drusus did, while the
valuation itself took place by commissaries
for the individual districts. A
<em>sacerdos Romae et Augusti</em> of the Tarraconensis
is praised <em>ob curam tabulari
censualis fideliter administratam</em> &#40;<cite>C.
I. L.</cite> ii.&nbsp;4248&#41;; thus doubtless the
diets of all provinces were invested
with the apportionment of the taxes.
The imperial finance&ndash;administration
of the three Gauls was at least, as a
rule, so divided that the two western
provinces &#40;Aquitania and Lugudunensis&#41;
were placed under one procurator,
Belgica and the two Germanies under
another; yet there were probably not
legally fixed powers for this purpose.
A regular taking part in the levy may
not be inferred from the discussion
held by Hadrian&mdash;evidently as an
extraordinary step&mdash;with representatives
of all the Spanish districts
&#40;<cite>vita</cite>, 12&#41;.</p></div>

freedman of the three Gauls &#40;Henzen,

<em>inquisitor Galliarum</em>, <em>iudex arcae
Galliarum</em>, no other province, so far
as I know, furnishes analogies; and
of these institutions, had they been
general, the inscriptions elsewhere
would certainly have preserved traces.
These arrangements appear to point
to a self&ndash;administering and self&ndash;taxing
body &#40;the <em>adlector</em>, the meaning of
which term is not clear, occurs as an
official in <em>collegia</em>, <cite>C. I. L.</cite> vi. 355;
Orelli, 2406&#41;; probably this chest
defrayed the doubtless not inconsiderable
expenditure for the temple&ndash;buildings
and for the annual festival.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">48</span></a> As the total number of the communities
recorded on the altar at
Lyons, Strabo &#40;iv.&nbsp;3, 2, p. 192&#41;
specifies sixty, and as the number of
the Aquitanian communities in the
Celtic portion north of the Garonne
fourteen &#40;iv.&nbsp;1, 1, p. 177&#41;. Tacitus
&#40;<cite>Ann.</cite> iii.&nbsp;44&#41; names as the total
number of the Gallic cantons sixty&ndash;four,
and so does, although in an
incorrect connection, the scholiast on
the <cite>Aeneid</cite>, i. 286. A like total
number is pointed to by the list given
in Ptolemy from the second century,
which adduces for Aquitania seventeen,
for the Lugudunensis twenty&ndash;five,
for the Belgica twenty&ndash;two
cantons. Of his Aquitanian cantons
thirteen fall to the region between
the Loire and Garonne, four to that
between the Garonne and the Pyrenees.
In the later one from the fifth century,
which is well known under the name
of <em>Notitia Galliarum</em>, twenty&ndash;six fall
to Aquitania, twenty&ndash;four to the
Lugudunensis &#40;exclusive of Lyons&#41;,
twenty&ndash;seven to Belgica. All these
numbers are presumably correct, each
for its time. Between the erection
of the altar in 742<span class="sidenote2">12.</span> and the time of Tacitus &#40;for to this his statement is
doubtless to be referred&#41;, four cantons
may have been added, just as the
shifting of the numbers from the second
to the fifth century may be referred
to individual changes still in good
part demonstrable.
</p>
<p>
Considering the importance of these
arrangements, it will not be superfluous
to exhibit them in detail, at least
for the two western provinces. In the
purely Celtic middle province the three
lists given by Pliny &#40;first century&#41;, Ptolemy
&#40;second century&#41;, and the <em>Notitia</em>
&#40;fifth century&#41;, agree in twenty&ndash;one
names: <em>Abrincates</em>&mdash;<em>Andecavi</em>&mdash;<em>Aulerci
Cenomani</em>&mdash;<em>Aulerci Diablintes</em>&mdash;<em>Aulerci
Eburovici</em>&mdash;<em>Baiocasses</em>
&#40;<em>Bodiocasses</em> Plin., <em>Vadicasii</em> Ptol.&#41;&mdash;<em>Carnutes</em>&mdash;<em>Coriosolites</em>
&#40;beyond doubt
the <em>Samnitae</em> of Ptolemy&#41;&mdash;<em>Haedui</em>&mdash;<em>Lexovii</em>&mdash;<em>Meldae</em>&mdash;<em>Namnetes</em>&mdash;<em>Osismii</em>&mdash;<em>Parisii</em>&mdash;<em>Redones</em>&mdash;<em>Senones</em>&mdash;<em>Tricassini</em>&mdash;<em>Turones</em>&mdash;<em>Veliocasses</em>
&#40;<em>Rotomagenses</em>&#41;&mdash;<em>Veneti</em>&mdash;<em>Unelli</em> &#40;<em>Constantia</em>&#41;;
in three more: <em>Caletae</em>&mdash;<em>Segusiavi</em>&mdash;<em>Viducasses</em>,
Pliny and
Ptolemy agree, while they are wanting
in the <em>Notitia</em>, because in the
meanwhile the <em>Caletae</em> were put together
with the Veliocasses or the
Rotomagenses, the Viducasses with
the Baiocasses, and the Segusiavi
were merged in Lyons. On the other
hand, instead of the three that have
disappeared, there appear two new
ones that have arisen by division:
<em>Aureliani</em> &#40;Orleans&#41;, a branch from
the <em>Carnutes</em> &#40;Chartres&#41;, and <em>Autessiodurum</em>
&#40;Auxerre&#41;, a branch from the
<em>Senones</em> &#40;Sens&#41;. There are left in
Pliny two names, <em>Boi</em>&mdash;<em>Atesui</em>; in
Ptolemy one, <em>Arvii</em>; in the <em>Notitia</em> one,
<em>Saii</em>. For Celtic Aquitania the three
lists agree in eleven names: <em>Arverni</em>&mdash;<em>Bituriges
Cubi</em>&mdash;<em>Bituriges Vivisci</em>
&#40;<em>Burdigalenses</em>&#41;&mdash;<em>Cadurci</em>&mdash;<em>Gabales</em>&mdash;<em>Lemovici</em>&mdash;<em>Nitiobriges</em>
&#40;<em>Aginnenses</em>&#41;&mdash;<em>Petrucorii</em>&mdash;<em>Pictones</em>&mdash;<em>Ruteni</em>&mdash;<em>Santones</em>;
the second and third
agree in the 12th of <em>Vellauni</em>, which
must have dropped out in Pliny;
Pliny alone has &#40;apart from the problematic
<em>Aquitani</em>&#41; two names more,
<em>Ambilatri</em> and <em>Anagnutes</em>; Ptolemy
one otherwise unknown, <em>Datii</em>; perhaps
Strabo&#8217;s number of fourteen is
to be made up by two of these. The
<em>Notitia</em> has, besides these eleven,
other two, based on splitting up the
<em>Albigenses</em> &#40;Albi on the Tarn&#41;, and the
<em>Ecolismenses</em> &#40;<em>Angoul&#234;me</em>&#41;. The lists
of the eastern cantons stand related
in a similar way. Although subordinate
differences emerge, which
cannot be here discussed, the character
and the continuity of the Gallic
cantonal division are clearly apparent.</p></div>

division; but we still possess the uncouth

effected this change in Rome, beyond
doubt in company with a number of
his countrymen, although he has preferred
not to add that it was so:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">The oldest trace of the administrative
separation of Iberian Aquitania from
the Gallic is the naming of the
&#8220;district of Lactora&#8221; &#40;Lectoure&#41;
alongside of Aquitania in an inscription
from Trajan&#8217;s time &#40;<cite>C. I. L.</cite> v.
875: <em>procurator provinciarum Luguduniensis
et Aquitanicae, item Lactorae</em>&#41;.
This inscription certainly of
itself proves the diversity of the two
territories rather than the formal
severance of the one from the other;
but it may be otherwise shown that
soon after Trajan the latter was
carried out. For the fact that the
separated district was originally
divided into nine cantons, as these
verses say, is confirmed by the name
that thenceforth continued in use,
<em>Novempopulana</em>; but under Pius the
district numbers already eleven communities
&#40;for the <em>dilectator per Aquitanicae
XI populos</em>, Boissieu, <em>Lyon</em>,
p. 246, certainly belongs to this connection&#41;,
in the fifth century twelve,
for the <em>Notitia</em> enumerates so many
under the Novempopulana. This
increase is to be explained similarly
to that discussed at <a href="#Page_95">p.&nbsp;95</a>, note 2.
The division does not relate to the
governorship; on the contrary, both
the Celtic and the Iberian Aquitania
remained under the same legate. But
the Novempopulana obtained under
Trajan its own diet, while the Celtic
districts of Aquitania, after as before,
sent deputies to the diet of Lyons.</p></div>

three governors is without parallel
elsewhere in Roman administration.
The relation of Africa and Numidia
offers doubtless an external analogy,
but was politically conditioned by the
position of the senatorial governor to
the imperial military commandant,
while the three governors of Belgica
were uniformly imperial; and it is
not at all easy to see why the two
Germanic ones had districts within
the Belgica assigned to them instead
of districts of their own. Nothing
but the taking back of the frontier,
while the hitherto subsisting name was
retained&mdash;just as the Transdanubian
Dacia continued subsequently to subsist
in name as Cis&ndash;Danubian&mdash;explains
this singular peculiarity.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_63_63" id="Footnote_63_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_63"><span class="label">63</span></a> The strength of the <em>auxilia</em> of the
upper army may be fixed for the epoch
of Domitian and Trajan with tolerable
certainty at about 10,000 men. A
document of the year 90 enumerates
four <em>alae</em> and fourteen <em>cohortes</em> of this
army; to these is to be added at least
one cohort &#40;<em>I Germanorum</em>&#41;, which, it
can be shown, did garrison&ndash;duty there
as well in the year 82 as in the year
116; whether two <em>alae</em> which were
there in the year 82, and at least
three cohorts which were there in
116, and which are absent from the
list of the year 90, were doing garrison
work there in 90 or not, is
doubtful, but most of them probably
were away from the province before
90 or only came into it after 90. Of
those nineteen <em>auxilia</em> one was certainly
&#40;<em>coh. I Damascenorum</em>&#41;, another perhaps
&#40;<em>ala I Flavia gemina</em>&#41;, a double
division. At the minimum, therefore,
the figure indicated above results
as the normal state of the <em>auxilia</em>
of this army, and it cannot have been
materially exceeded. But the <em>auxilia</em>
of lower Germany, whose garrisons
were less extended, may well have
been smaller in number.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">65</span></a><em>Limes</em> &#40;from <em>limus</em>, across&#41; is a
technical expression foreign to the
state of things under our &#91;German&#93; law,
and hence not to be reproduced in
our language, derived from the fact
that the Roman division of land,
which excludes all natural boundaries,
separates the squares, into which the
ground coming under the head of
private property is divided, by intermediate
paths of a definite breadth;
these intermediate paths are the
<em>limites</em>, and so far the word always
denotes at once the boundary drawn
by man&#8217;s hand, and the road constructed
by man&#8217;s hand. The word
retains this double signification even
in application to the state &#40;Rudorff,
<cite>Grom. Inst.</cite> p. 289, puts the matter
incorrectly&#41;; <em>limes</em> is not every imperial
frontier, but only that which
is marked out by human hands, and
arranged at the same time for being
patrolled and having posts stationed
for frontier&ndash;defence &#40;<cite>Vita Hadriani</cite>, 12;
<em>locis in quibus barbari non fluminibus,
sed limitibus dividuntur</em>&#41;, such as we
find in Germany and in Africa.
Therefore there are applied to the
laying&ndash;out of this <em>limes</em> the terms
that serve to designate the construction
of roads, <em>aperire</em> &#40;Velleius, ii.&nbsp;121,
which is not to be understood, as
M&uuml;llenhoff, <cite>Zeitschr. f. d. Alterth.</cite>,
new series, ii.&nbsp;p. 32, would have
it, like our opening of a turnpike&#41;,
<em>munire</em>, <em>agere</em> &#40;Frontinus, <cite>Strat.</cite> i. 3,
10: <em>limitibus per <span class="smcap">CXX</span> m. p. actis</em>&#41;.
Therefore the <em>limes</em> is not merely a
longitudinal line, but also of a certain
breadth &#40;Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite> i. 50; <em>castra
in limite locat</em>&#41;. Hence the construction
of the <em>limes</em> is often combined
with that of the <em>agger</em>&mdash;that is, of the
road&ndash;embankment &#40;Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite> ii.
7: <em>cuncta novis limitibus aggeribusque
permunita</em>&#41;, and the shifting
of it with the transference of frontier&ndash;posts
&#40;Tacitus, <cite>Germ.</cite> 29: <em>limite acto
promotisque praesidiis</em>&#41;. The Limes
is thus the imperial frontier&ndash;road,
destined for the regulation of frontier&ndash;intercourse,
inasmuch as the crossing
of it was allowed only at certain
points corresponding to the bridges
of the river boundary, and elsewhere
forbidden. This was doubtless effected
in the first instance by patrolling
the line, and, so long as this was
done, the <em>limes</em> remained a boundary
road. It remained so too, when it
was fortified on both sides, as was
done in Britain and at the mouth of
the Danube; the Britannic wall is also
termed <em>limes</em> &#40;<a href="#Page_187">p.&nbsp;187</a>, note 2&#41;. Posts
might also be stationed at the allowed
points of crossing, and the intervening
spaces of the frontier&ndash;roads might be
in some way rendered impassable. In
this sense the biographer of Hadrian
says in the above&ndash;quoted passage that
at the <em>limites</em> he <em>stipitibus magnis in modum muralis saepis funditus iactis
atque conexis barbaros separavit</em>. By
this means the frontier&ndash;road was converted
into a frontier&ndash;barricade provided
with certain passages through
it, and such was the <em>limes</em> of
upper Germany in the developed shape
to be set forth in the sequel. We
may add that the word is not used
with this special import in the time
of the republic; and beyond doubt
this conception of the <em>limes</em> only
originated with the institution of the
chain of posts enclosing the state,
where natural boundaries were wanting&mdash;a
protection of the imperial
frontier, which was foreign to the
republic, but was the foundation of the
Augustan military system, and above
all, of the Augustan system of tolls.</p></div>

to the time of Germanicus, as <em>gens

with the distinction between the

Roman would be the western; the
free, the eastern; if the Frisians
generally reach as far as the Ems
&#40;Ptolem. iii.&nbsp;11, 7&#41;, those subsequently
Roman may have settled perhaps to
the westward of the Yssel. We may
not put them elsewhere than on the
coast that still bears their name; the

stands isolated, and is beyond doubt
incorrect.</p></div>

been lost; its time and place admit
of being determined. As the coins
give to Domitian the title <em>Germanicus</em>
after the beginning of the year 84
&#40;Eckhel, vi. 378, 397&#41;, the campaign
falls in the year 83. Accordant with
this is the levy of the Usipes, which
falls on this same year, and their
desperate attempt at flight &#40;Tacitus,
<cite>Agr.</cite> 28; comp. Martialis, vi. 60&#41;.
It was an aggressive war &#40;Suetonius,
<cite>Dom.</cite> 6: <em>expeditio sponte suscepta</em>;
Zonaras, xi. 19; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λεηλατήσας τινὰ
τῶν πέραν Ῥήνου τῶν ἐνσπόνδων</span>&#41;.
The shifting of the line of posts is
attested by Frontinus, who took part
in the war, <cite>Strat.</cite> ii.&nbsp;11, 7: <em>cum in
finibus Cubiorum</em> &#40;name unknown and
probably corrupt&#41; <em>castella poneret</em>, and
i. 3, 10: <em>limitibus per cxx. m. p. actis</em>,
which is here brought into immediate
connection with the military operations,
and hence may not be separated
from the Chattan war itself and referred
to the <em>agri decumates</em>, which
had for long been in the Roman
power. The measure of 108 miles
is very conceivable for the military
line which Domitian planned at the
Taunus &#40;according to Cohausen&#8217;s estimates,
<cite>R&ouml;m. Grenzwall</cite>, p. 8, the later
Limes from the Rhine round the
Taunus as far as the Main is set down
at 137 miles&#41;, but is much too small
to admit of its being referred to the
line of connection from thence to
Ratisbon.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">75</span></a> The Germans &#40;Suetonius, <cite>Dom.</cite> 6&#41;
could only be the Chatti, and their
earlier allies, perhaps in the first instance
just the Usipes and those sharing
their fate. The insurrection broke out
in Mentz, which alone was a double
camp of two legions. Saturninus
was assailed from Raetia by the
troops of L. Appius Maximus Norbanus.
For the epigram of Martial,
ix. 84, cannot be understood otherwise,
the more especially as his conqueror,
of senatorial rank as he was,
could not administer a regular command
in Raetia and Vindelicia, and
could only be led into this region by
a case of war emerging, as indeed
the <em>sacrilegi furores</em> clearly point to the
insurrection. The tiles of this same
Appius, which have been found in
the provinces of upper Germany and
Aquitania, do not warrant the making
him legate of the Lugdunensis, as
Asbach &#40;<cite>Westdeutsche Zeitschrift</cite>, iii.
9&#41;, suggests, but must be referred to
the epoch after the defeat of Antonius
&#40;<cite>Hermes</cite>, xix. 438&#41;. Where
the battle was fought remains doubtful;
the region of Vindonissa most
naturally suggests itself, to which
point Saturninus may have gone to
meet Norbanus. Had Norbanus
encountered the insurgents only at
Mentz, which in itself seems conceivable,
these would have had the
crossing of the Rhine in their power,
and the contingent of the Germans
could not have been hindered by the
breaking&ndash;up of the Rhine from reinforcing
them.</p></div>

list &#40;<cite>Notitia dignitatum</cite>, ed. Seeck,

primae redactae trans castellum Montiacese:
nam lxxx.leugas trans Renum

sub Gallieno imperatore a barbaris occupatae
sunt</em>. That the Usipes afterwards
dwelt in this region, is confirmed
by Tacitus, <cite>Hist.</cite> iv.&nbsp;37, <cite>Germ.</cite> 32;
that they belonged to the empire in
the year 83, but had perhaps been
made subject only shortly before, is
plain from the narrative, <cite>Agr.</cite> 28.
The Tubantes and Chasuarii are
placed by Ptolemy, ii.&nbsp;11, 11, in
the vicinity of the Chatti; that they
shared the fate of the Usipes is
accordingly probable. No certain
identification of the other two corrupt
names has hitherto been found;
perhaps the Tencteri had a place
here, or some of the small tribes
named with these only in Ptolemy, ii.
11, 6. The notice in its original form
named Belgica simply, as the province
was only divided by Diocletian, and
named it rightly in so far as the two
Germanies belonged geographically to
Belgica. The specified measurement
carries us, if we follow the Kinzig
valley to the north&ndash;east, beyond Fulda
nearly to Hersfeld. Inscriptions have
been found here far eastward beyond
the Rhine, as far as the Wetterau;
Friedberg and Butzbach were military
positions strongly garrisoned; at
Altenstadt between Friedberg and B&uuml;dingen there has been found an
inscription of the year 242 &#40;Brambach,
<cite>C. I. Rh.</cite> 1410&#41; pointing to
protection of the frontier &#40;<em>collegium

&#40;for the latter word is at anyrate
to be connected with <em>agri</em>&#41; occurring
only in Tacitus, <cite>Germ.</cite> 29,
means, is uncertain. It is possible
that the territory regarded in the
earlier imperial period certainly as
property of the state or rather of the
emperor, like the old <em>ager occupatorius</em>
of the republic, might be used
by the first who took possession upon
payment of the tenth; but neither is
it linguistically proved that <em>decumas</em>
can mean &#8220;liable for a tenth,&#8221; nor
are we acquainted with such arrangements
in the imperial period. Moreover
it should not be overlooked that
the description of Tacitus refers to
the time before the institution of the
line of the Neckar; it does not suit
the latter period any more than does
the designation, which doubtless is not
clear, but is at any rate certainly connected
with the earlier legal relation.</p></div>

by the cultus of Roma falling into

from Miltenberg to Grosskrotzenburg,
of about thirty Roman miles. In the
case of the older line of the Neckar
the rampart is considerably shorter,

Hadrian blocked the imperial
frontier&ndash;roads by palisades against the
barbarians &#40;<a href="#Page_122">p.&nbsp;122</a>&#41; relates in part and
perhaps primarily to the upper Germanic,
the wall, of which remains are
extant, was not his work; whether
this may have carried palisades or not,
no report would mention these and
pass over the wall itself. Dio. lxix.
9, says that Hadrian revised the defence
of the frontier throughout the
empire. The designation of the pale
&#91;<em>Pfahl</em>&#93; or pale&ndash;ditch &#91;<em>Pfahlgraben</em>&#93;
cannot be Roman; in Latin the
stakes, which, driven into the wall of
the camp, form a palisade&ndash;chain for it,
are called not <em>pali</em>, but <em>valli</em> or <em>sudes</em>,
just as the wall itself is never other
than <em>vallum</em>. If the designation in
use from of old for this purpose apparently
along the whole line among
the Germans was really borrowed
from the palisades, it must have been
of Germanic origin, and can only have
proceeded from the time when this
wall stood before their eyes in its integrity
and significance. Whether
the &#8220;region&#8221; Palas which Ammianus
mentions &#40;xviii.&nbsp;2, 15&#41; is connected

<p><a name="Footnote_86_86" id="Footnote_86_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86_86"><span class="label">86</span></a> The oldest dated evidence for the

of <em>vicus Aurelii</em> &#40;Oehringen&#41; of the
year 169 &#40;Brambach, <cite>C. I. Rh.</cite> 1558&#41;,
doubtless only private, but certainly
not set up before the construction of
this fort belonging to the Miltenberg&ndash;Lorch
line; little later is that of Jagsthausen,
likewise belonging to that
line, of the year 179 &#40;<cite>C. I. Rh.</cite> 1618&#41;.
Accordingly <em>vicus Aurelii</em> might take
its name from Marcus, not from Caracalla,
though it is attested of the latter
that he constructed various forts in

himself &#40;Dio, lxxvi. 13&#41;.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_87_87" id="Footnote_87_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_87"><span class="label">87</span></a> As to the distribution of the
upper German troops there is a want
of sufficient information, but not entirely
of data on which to rest. Of
the two headquarters in upper Germany,
that of Strassburg can be shown
to have been after the construction of
the line of the Neckar occupied but
weakly, and was probably more an
administrative than a military centre
&#40;<cite>Westdeutsches Correspondenzblatt</cite>,
1884, p. 132&#41;. On the other hand,
the garrison of Mentz always demanded
a considerable portion of the aggregate
strength, all the more because it
was probably the only compact body of troops on a large scale in all upper
Germany. The other troops were
distributed partly to the Limes, whose
forts, according to Cohausen&#8217;s estimate
&#40;<cite>R&ouml;m. Grenzwall</cite>, p. 335&#41;, were
on an average five miles apart from
one another, and so in all about fifty;
partly to the interior forts, especially on
the line of the Odenwald from G&uuml;ndelsheim
to W&ouml;rth; that the latter, at
least in part, remained occupied even
after the laying out of the outer Limes,
is at least probable. Owing to the
inequality in size of the forts still measurable,
it is difficult to say what number
of troops was required to make
them capable of defence. Cohausen
&#40;<cite>l.c.</cite> p. 340&#41; reckons to a middle&ndash;sized
fort, including the reserve, 720
men. As the usual cohort of the
legion as of the auxiliaries numbered
500 men, and the fort&ndash;buildings must
necessarily have had regard to this
fact, the garrison of the fort in the
event of siege must be estimated on an
average at least at this number. After
the reduction the upper German army
could not possibly have held the forts,
even of the Limes alone, simultaneously
in this strength. Much less could it,
even before the reduction, have kept
the lines between the forts even barely
occupied with its 30,000 men &#40;<a href="#Page_119">p.&nbsp;119</a>&#41;; and, if this was not possible,
the simultaneous occupation of all the
forts had in fact no object. To all
appearance each fort was planned in
such a way that, when duly garrisoned,
it could be held; but, as a rule&mdash;and on
this frontier the state of peace was the
rule&mdash;the individual fort was not on a
war&ndash;footing, but only furnished with
troops, in so far that posts might be
stationed in the watch&ndash;towers, and
the roads as well as the byways might
be kept under inspection. The standing
garrisons of the forts were, it may
be conjectured, very much weaker
than is usually assumed. We possess
from antiquity but a single record
of such a garrison; it is of the year
155, and relates to the fort of Kutlowitza,
to the north of Sofia &#40;<cite>Eph.
Epigr.</cite> iv.&nbsp;p. 524&#41;, for which the army
of lower Moesia, and in fact the 11th
legion, furnished the garrison. This
troop numbered at that time, besides
the centurion in command, only 76
men. The Raetian army was, at
least before Marcus, still less in a
position to occupy extensive lines;
it numbered then at the most 10,000
men, and had, besides the Raetian
Limes, to supply also the line of the
Danube from Ratisbon to Passau.</p></div>

the Raetian Limes have but little cleared
up the destination of this work; this
only is made out that it was less
adapted than the analogous upper German
one for military occupation. A
weaker frontier&ndash;bar of that sort may
reasonably, even before the Marcomanian
war, have been chosen to face
the Hermunduri; nor does what
Tacitus says of their intercourse in
Augusta Vindelicum by any means exclude
the existence at that time of a Raetian Limes. Only in that case we
should expect that it would not end at
Lorch, but would join the line of the
Neckar; and in some measure it does
this, inasmuch as at Lorch instead of
the Limes comes the Rems, which falls
into the Neckar at Canstatt.</p></div>

added the seven or eight legions introduced

Victrix, 8th and 10th Gemina, 11th,

probably added in the year 88 the 1st

to upper Germany &#40;<a href="#Page_65">p.&nbsp;65</a> note&#41;. That
under Trajan the 1st Adiutrix and the
11th were stationed in upper Germany
is shown by the inscription of
Baden&ndash;Baden &#40;Brambach, <cite>C. I. Rh.</cite>

<p><a name="Footnote_91_91" id="Footnote_91_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_91"><span class="label">91</span></a> Traian was sent by Nerva in the
year 96 or 97 as legate to Germany,
probably to the upper, as at that time
Vestricius Spurinna seems to have presided
over the lower. Nominated here
as co&ndash;regent in October of the year 97, he
received the accounts of Nerva&#8217;s death
and of his nomination as the Augustus
in February 98 at Cologne. He may
have remained there during the winter
and the following summer; in the
winter 98&ndash;99 he was on the Danube.
The words of Eutropius, viii.&nbsp;2: <em>urbes
trans Rhenum in Germania reparavit</em>
&#40;whence the often misused notice in
Orosius, vii.&nbsp;12, 2, has been copied&#41;,
which can only be referred to the
upper province, but naturally apply
not to the legate, but to the Caesar or
the Augustus, obtain a confirmation
through the <em>civitas Ulpia s</em>&#40;<em>altus?</em>&#41;
<em>N</em>&#40;<em>icerini?</em>&#41; <em>Lopodunum</em> of the inscriptions.
The &#8220;restoration&#8221; may stand
in contrast not to the institutions of
Domitian, but to the irregular germs
of urban arrangements in the Decumates&ndash;land
before the shifting of the
military frontier. There is no indication
pointing to warlike events under
Trajan; that he planned and gave his
name &#40;Ammianus, xvii.&nbsp;1, 11&#41; to a
<em>castellum in Alamannorum solo</em>&mdash;according
to the connection, on the
Main not far from Mentz&mdash;is as little
proof of such events as the circumstance
that a later poet &#40;Sidonius,
<cite>Carm.</cite> vii.&nbsp;115&#41;, mixing up old and
new, makes Agrippina under him the
terror of the Sugambri&mdash;that is, in his
sense, of the Franks.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_92_92" id="Footnote_92_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_92"><span class="label">92</span></a> Not merely the causal connection,
but even the chronological succession
of these important events is
obscure. The account, relatively the
best, in Zosimus, i. 29, describes the
Germanic war as the cause why Valerian
immediately on ascending the
throne in 253 made his son joint&ndash;ruler
with equal rights; and Valerian bears
the title <em>Germanicus maximus</em> as
early as 256 &#40;<cite>C. I. L.</cite> viii.&nbsp;2380;
likewise in 259 <cite>C. I. L.</cite> xi. 826&#41;,
perhaps even if the coin in Cohen, n.
54, is to be trusted, the title <em>Germanicus
maximus ter</em>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_93_93" id="Footnote_93_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_93_93"><span class="label">93</span></a> That the Germans, against whom
Gallienus had to fight, are to be
sought at least chiefly on the lower
Rhine, is shown by the residence of
his son in Agrippina, where he can
only have remained behind as nominal
representative of his father. His
biographer also, c. 8, names the
Franks.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_94_94" id="Footnote_94_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_94_94"><span class="label">94</span></a> It is difficult to form a conception
of the degree of historical falsification
which prevails in a portion of
the Imperial Biographies; it will not
be amiss to present here a specimen
of it in the account of Postumus.
He is here called &#40;no doubt in an inserted
document&#41; <em>Iulius Postumus</em>
&#40;<em>Tyr.</em> 6&#41;, on the coins and inscriptions
<em>M. Cassianius Latinius Postumus</em>,
in the epitomised Victor, 32,
Cassius Labienus Postumus.&mdash;He
reigns seven years &#40;<cite>Gall.</cite> 4&#41;; <em>Tyr.</em> 3,
5; the coins name his <em>tr. p. X.</em>, and
Eutropius, ix. 10, gives him ten years.&mdash;His
opponent is called <em>Lollianus</em>, according
to the coins <em>Ulpius Cornelius
Laelianus</em>, <em>Laelianus</em> in Eutropius ix.
9 &#40;according to the one class of manuscripts,
while the other follows the
interpolation of the biographers&#41; and
in Victor &#40;c. 33&#41;, <em>Aelianus</em> in the epitome
of Victor.&mdash;Postumus and Victorinus
rule jointly according to the
biographer; but there are no coins
common to both, and consequently
these confirm the report in Victor
and Eutropius that Victorinus was the
successor of Postumus.&mdash;It is a peculiarity
of this class of falsifications
that they reach their culmination in
the documents inserted. The Cologne
epitaph of the two Victorini &#40;<em>Tyr.</em> 7&#41;,
<em>hic duo Victorini tyranni</em> &#40;!&#41; <em>siti sunt</em>
criticises itself. The alleged commission
of Valerian, whereby the
latter communicates to the Gauls the
nomination of Postumus, not only
praises prophetically the gifts of Postumus
as a ruler, but names also
various impossible offices; a <em>Transrhenani
limitis dux et Galliae praeses</em>
at no time existed, and Postumus
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχὴν ἐν Κελτοῖς στρατιωτῶν
ἐμπεπιστευμένος</span> &#40;Zosimus, i. 38&#41; can
only have been <em>praeses</em> of one of the
two Germanies, or, if his command
was an extraordinary one, <em>dux per
Germanias</em>. Equally impossible is, in
the same quasi&ndash;document, the <em>tribunatus
Vocontiorum</em> of the son, an
evident imitation of the tribunates, as
they emerge in the <em>Notitia Dign.</em> of the
time of Honorius.&mdash;Against Postumus
and Victorinus, under whom the Gauls
and the Franks fight, Gallienus
marches with Aureolus, afterwards
his opponent, and the later emperor
Claudius; he himself is wounded by
a shot from an arrow, but is victorious,
without any change being produced
by the victory. Of this war
the other accounts know nothing.
Postumus falls in the military insurrection
instigated by the so&ndash;called
Lollianus, while according to the report
in Victor and Eutropius, Postumus
becomes master of this Mentz
insurrection, but then the soldiers kill
him because he will not deliver up
Mentz to them for plunder. As to
the elevation of Postumus, by the
side of the narrative which agrees in
the main with the ordinary one, that
Postumus had perfidiously set aside
the son of Gallienus entrusted to his
guardianship, stands another evidently
invented to clear him, according to
which the people in Gaul did this,
and then offered the crown to Postumus.
The tendency to eulogise one
who had spared Gaul the fate of the
Danubian lands and of Asia and had
saved it from the Germans, comes here and everywhere &#40;most obviously
at <em>Tyr.</em> 5&#41; to light; with which is connected
the fact that this report knows
nothing of the loss of the right bank
of the Rhine and of the expeditions
of the Franks to Gaul, Spain, and
Africa. It is further significant that
the alleged progenitor of the Constantinian
house is here provided with
an honourable secondary part. This
narrative, not confused but thoroughly
falsified, must be completely set aside;
the reports on the one hand in Zosimus,
on the other in the Latins drawing
from a common source&mdash;Victor
and Eutropius, short and confused as
they are, can alone be taken into
account.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_95_95" id="Footnote_95_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_95_95"><span class="label">95</span></a> The rule of Postumus lasted ten
years &#40;<a href="#Page_164">p.&nbsp;164</a>, note 1&#41;. That the elder
son of Gallienus was already dead in
259, we learn from the inscription of
Modena, <cite>C. I. L.</cite> xi. 826; the
revolt of Postumus thus falls certainly
in or before this year. As the
captivity of Tetricus cannot well be
placed later than 272, immediately
after the second expedition against
Zenobia, and the three Gallic rulers
reigned, Postumus for ten years,
Victorinus for two &#40;Eutropius, ix. 9&#41;,
Tetricus for two &#40;Victor, 35&#41;, this
brings the revolt of Postumus to
somewhere about 259; yet such
numbers are frequently somewhat
deranged. When the duration of
the expeditions of the Germans into
Spain under Gallienus is definitely
stated at twelve years &#40;Orosius, vii.
41, 2&#41;, this appears to be superficially
reckoned according to the Chronicle
of Jerome. The usual exact numbers
are unattested and deceptive.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_96_96" id="Footnote_96_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_96_96"><span class="label">96</span></a> According to the biographer,
c. 14, 15, Probus brought the Germans
of the right bank of the Rhine
into dependence, so that they were
tributary to the Romans and defended
the frontier for them &#40;<em>omnes jam barbari
vobis arant, vobis jam serviunt et
contra interiores gentes militant</em>&#41;; the
right of bearing arms is left to them
for the time, but the idea is, on
further successes, to push forward the
frontier and erect a province of Germania.
Even as free fancies of a
Roman of the fourth century&mdash;more
they are not&mdash;these utterances have a
certain interest.</p></div>

relations between Rome and Britain
in the time before the conquest are
to be regarded essentially as arising
out of the restoration and guarantee
&#40;<cite>B. G.</cite> v.&nbsp;22&#41; of the principality of
the Trinovantes by Caesar. That
king Dubnovellaunus, who along with
another quite unknown Britannic prince
sought protection with Augustus, ruled
chiefly in Essex, is shown by his coins
&#40;my <cite>Mon. Ancyr.</cite> 2d ed., p. 138 f.&#41;.
We have to seek also mainly there
the Britannic princes who sent to
Augustus and recognised his supremacy
&#40;for such apparently we must take to
be the meaning of Strabo, iv.&nbsp;5, 3,
p. 200; comp. Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite> ii.&nbsp;24&#41;.
Cunobelinus, according to the coins
the son of king Tasciovanus, of whom
history is silent, dying as it would
seem in advanced years between 40
and 43, and thus contemporary in
his government with the later years
of Augustus and with Tiberius and
Gaius, resided in Camalodunum &#40;Dio,
lx. 21&#41;; around him and his sons the
preliminary history of the invasion
turns. To what quarter Bericus, who
came to Claudius &#40;Dio, lx. 19&#41;, belonged
we do not know, and other
British dynasts may have followed the
example of those of Colchester; but
these stand at the head.</p></div>

Tacitus concerning this war, <cite>Ann.</cite> xiv.
31&ndash;39, is hardly to be found even in
this most unmilitary of all authors.
We are not told where the troops
were stationed, and where the battles
were fought; but we get, instead, signs
and wonders enough and empty
words only too many. The important
facts, which are mentioned in the
life of Agricola, 31, are wanting in the
main narrative, especially the storming
of the camp. That Paullinus
coming from Mona should think not
of saving the Romans in the south&ndash;east,
but of uniting his troops, is intelligible;
but not why, if he wished to
sacrifice Londinium, he should march
thither on that account. If he really
went thither, he can only have appeared
there with a personal escort,
without the corps which he had with
him in Mona&mdash;which indeed has no
meaning. The bulk of the Roman
troops, as well those brought back
from Mona as those still in existence
elsewhere, can, after the extirpation
of the 9th legion, only have been
stationed on the line Deva&mdash;Viroconium&mdash;Isca;
Paullinus fought the
battle with the two legions stationed
in the first two of these camps, the
14th and the &#40;incomplete&#41; 20th. That
Paullinus fought because he was obliged
to fight, is stated by Dio, lxii.
1&ndash;12, and although his narrative cannot
be otherwise used to correct that
of Tacitus, this much seems required
by the very state of the case.</p></div>

as widely spread as it is untenable;
the cohort&ndash;camps on Hadrian&#8217;s wall,
as shown to us by the inscriptions of
the second century, still subsisted in
the main unchanged at the end of the
third &#40;for to this epoch belongs the
relative section of the <em>Notitia</em>&#41;. The
two structures subsisted side by side,
after the more recent was added; the
mass of monuments at the wall of
Severus also shows evidently that it
continued to be occupied up to the
end of the Roman rule in Britain.
</p>
<p>
The building of Severus can only
be referred to the northern structure.
In the first place, the structure of
Hadrian was of such a nature that
any sort of restoration of it could not
possibly be conceived as a new building,
as is said of the wall of Severus;
while the structure of Pius was a mere
earthen rampart &#40;<em>murus cespiticius</em>,
<em>Vita</em>, c. 5&#41;, and such an assumption
in its case creates less difficulty.
Secondly, the length of Severus&#8217;s wall
32 miles &#40;Victor, <cite>Epit.</cite> 20; the impossible
number 132 is an error of our
MSS. of Eutropius, viii.&nbsp;19&mdash;where
Paulus has preserved the correct number;
which error has been then taken
over by Hieronymus, <cite>Abr.</cite> 2221;
Orosius, vii.&nbsp;17, 7; and Cassiodorus
on the year 207&#41;, does not suit Hadrian&#8217;s
wall of 80 miles; but the structure
of Pius, which, according to the data
of inscriptions, was about 40 miles
long, may well be meant, as the terminal
points of the structure of Severus
on the two seas may very well have
been different and situated closer.
Lastly, if, according to Dio, lxxvi. 12,
the Caledonians dwell to the north
and the Maeates to the south of the
wall which divides the island into
two parts, the dwelling&ndash;places of the
latter are indeed not otherwise known
&#40;comp. lxxv.&nbsp;5&#41;, but cannot possibly,
even according to the description
which Dio gives of their district, be
placed to the south of Hadrian&#8217;s wall,
and those of the Caledonians have
extended up to the latter. Thus what
is here meant is the line from Glasgow
to Edinburgh.</p></div>

on the Danube itself in the
year 50, follows from Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite>
xii.&nbsp;29; otherwise it would not have
been necessary to send a legion thither
to receive the accession of the Suebi.
The laying out also of the Claudian
Savaria suits better, if the town was
then Norican, than if it already belonged
to Pannonia; and, as the
assignment of this town to Pannonia
coincides certainly as to time with the
like severance of Carnuntum and with
the transference of the legion thither,
all this may probably have taken place
only in the period after Claudius. The
small number also of inscriptions of
Italici found in the camps of the
Danube &#40;<cite>Eph. Ep.</cite> v.&nbsp;p. 225&#41; points
to their later origin. Certainly there
have been found in Carnuntum some
epitaphs of soldiers of the 15th legion
which, from their outward form and
from the absence of cognomen, appear
to be older &#40;Hirschfeld, <cite>Arch.
Epigraph. Mittheilungen</cite>, v.&nbsp;217&#41;.
Such determinations of date cannot
claim full certainty, where a decade is
concerned; nevertheless it must be
conceded that the former arguments
also furnish no full proofs, and the
translocation may have begun earlier, possibly under Nero. For the construction
or extension of this camp by
Vespasian we have the evidence of
the inscription, attesting such a structure,
of Carnuntum, dating from the
year 73 &#40;Hirschfeld, <cite>l.c.</cite>&#41;.</p></div>

felt blanks of the Roman imperial
history that the standing quarters of
the two legions, which formed under
the Julio&ndash;Claudian emperors the garrison
of Moesia, the 4th Scythica and
the 5th Macedonica &#40;at least these
were stationed there in the year 33;
<cite>C. I. L.</cite> iii.&nbsp;1698&#41; cannot hitherto be
pointed out with certainty. Probably
they were Viminacium and Singidunum
in what was afterwards upper
Moesia. Among the legion&ndash;camps of
lower Moesia, of which that of
Troesmis in particular has numerous
monuments to show, none appear to
be older than Hadrian&#8217;s time; the
remains of the upper&ndash;Moesian are
hitherto so scanty that they at least
do not hinder our carrying back their
origin a century further. When the
king of Thrace in the year 18 takes
arms against the Bastarnae and
Scythians &#40;Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite> ii.&nbsp;65&#41;, this
could not have been put forward even
as a pretext, had lower&ndash;Moesian legionary
camps been already at that time
in existence. This very narrative shows
that the warlike power of this vassal&ndash;prince
was not inconsiderable, and
that the setting aside of an uncompliant
king of Thrace demanded caution.</p></div>

state &#40;Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite> xii.&nbsp;29; <cite>Hist.</cite>
iii.&nbsp;5, 21&#41;, must be referred, not merely,
as might appear from Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite>
ii.&nbsp;63, to the dwellings of the people
that went over with Maroboduus and
Catualda, but to the whole territory
of the Marcomani and Quadi, is shown
clearly by the second report, <cite>Ann.</cite>
xii.&nbsp;29, 30, since here, as opponents
of Vannius alongside of his own insurgent
subjects, there appear the peoples
bordering on Bohemia to the west and
north, the Hermunduri and Lugii.
As boundary towards the east Pliny
<em>l.c.</em> designates the region of Carnuntum
&#40;<em>Germanorum ibi confinium</em>&#41;
more exactly the river Marus or
Duria, which separates the Suebi
and the <em>regnum Vannianum</em> from
their eastern neighbours, whether we
may refer the <em>dirimens eos</em> with M&uuml;llenhoff
&#40;<cite>Sitzungsberichte der Berliner
Akademie</cite> 1883, p. 871&#41; to the Jazyges,
or, as is more natural, to the
Bastarnae. In reality both doubtless
bordered, the Jazyges on the south,
the Bastarnae on the north, with
the Quadi of the March valley. Accordingly
the Marus is the March,
and the demarcation is formed by the
small Carpathians that stretch between
the March and the Waag. If
thus those retainers were settled <em>inter
flumen Marum et Cusum</em>, then the
Cusus not elsewhere mentioned is,
provided the statement is correct, not
the Waag, or even, as M&uuml;llenhoff
supposed, the Eipel falling into the
Danube below Gran, but an affluent
of the Danube westward of the March,
perhaps the Gusen near Linz. The
narrative in Tacitus xii.&nbsp;29, 30, also
requires the territory of Vannius to
have reached to the west even beyond
the March. The subscription to the
first book of the <cite>Meditations</cite> of the
emperor Marcus <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐν Κουάδοις πρὸς τῷ
Γρανούᾳ</span>, proves doubtless that then
the state of the Quadi stretched as
far as the river Gran; but this state
is not coincident with the <em>regnum
Vannianum</em>.</p></div>

about the year 70 two legions, the

in room of which latter during its
participation in the Armenian war for
some time the 7th Gemina came in &#40;<cite>C. I. L.</cite> iii.&nbsp;p. 482&#41;. Of the two legions
added later, 1st Adiutrix and 2d Adiutrix,
the first still at the beginning of
the reign of Trajan lay in upper Germany
&#40;<a href="#Page_159">p.&nbsp;159</a>, note 1&#41;, and can only

the second stationed under Vespasian

under Domitian &#40;<a href="#Page_174">p.&nbsp;174</a>, note 4&#41;.
The Moesian army numbered after
the union with the Dalmatian under
Vespasian probably but four legions,
consequently as many as the two
armies together previously&mdash;the later
upper&ndash;Moesian, 4th Flavia and 7th
Claudia, and the later lower&ndash;Moesian,
1st Italica and 5th Macedonica. The
positions shifted by the marching to

&#40;Marquardt, <cite>Staatsverw.</cite> ii.&nbsp;435&#41;,
which temporarily brought these legions
to Moesia, need not deceive us.

as well as according to the delineations
and plans of Dr. C. Schuchhardt
communicated to me, three barriers
were here constructed. The south&ndash;most
and probably oldest is a simple
earthen wall with &#40;singularly&#41; a fosse
in front of it towards the south;
whether of Roman origin may be
doubtful. The two other lines are
an earthen wall, even now at many
places as high as three m&egrave;tres, and a
lower wall, once lined with stones,
which often run close beside each
other and elsewhere again are miles
apart. We might hold them as the
two lines of defence of a fortified
road, though in the eastern half the
earthen wall, in the more southern
half the stone&ndash;wall, is the more
northerly, and they cross in the
middle. At one spot the earthen
wall &#40;here more southerly&#41; forms the
rear of a fort constructed behind the
stone&ndash;wall. The earthen wall is
covered on the north side by a deep,
on the south side by a shallow, fosse;
each fosse is closed off by a bank. A
fosse lies also in front of the stone&ndash;wall
to the north. Behind the earthen
wall, and mostly resting on it, are
found forts distant from each other
seven hundred and fifty m&egrave;tres; others
at irregular distances of the like kind
behind the stone&ndash;wall. All the lines
keep behind the Karasu&ndash;lakes as the
natural basis of defence; from the
point where this ceases, they are
carried as far as the sea with slight
regard to the character of the ground.
The town Tomis lies outside of the
wall and to the north of it; but its
fortress&ndash;walls are put in connection
with the barrier&ndash;fortification by a
special wall.</p></div>

Goths in the biography of Caracalla,
c. 10, rests on a misunderstanding.
If really a senator allowed himself
the malicious jest of assigning to the
murderer of Geta the name Geticus,
because he on his march from the
Danube to the east had conquered
some Getic hordes &#40;<em>tumultuariis proeliis</em>&#41;,
he meant Dacians, not the
Goths, scarcely at that time dwelling
there and hardly known to the
Roman public, whose identification
with the Getae was certainly only a
later invention.&mdash;We may add that
the statement that the emperor
Maximinus &#40;235&ndash;238&#41; was the son of
a Goth settled in the neighbouring
Thrace, carries us still further back;
yet not much weight is to be attached
to it.</p></div>

Menophilus, is fixed by coins certainly
to the time of Gordian, and
with probability to 238&ndash;240 &#40;Borghesi,

of the Gothic war and the
destruction of Istros are fixed by
Dexippus &#40;<cite>vita Max. et Balb.</cite> 16&#41;
at 238, it is natural to bring into
connection with these events the undertaking
of tribute; at any rate it
was then renewed. The vain sieges
of Marcianopolis and Philippopolis by
the Goths &#40;Dexippus, <em>fr.</em> 18, 19&#41;

the former under Philippus, but is in

navium milibus perrupto Bosporo et
litoribus Propontidis Scythicarum gentium
catervae transgressae ediderunt
quidem acerbas terra marique strages:
sed amissa suorum parte maxima
reverterunt</em>; whereupon the catastrophe
of the Decii is narrated, and
into this is inwoven the further notice:
<em>obsessae Pamphyliae civitates</em> &#40;to which
must belong the siege of Side in
Dexippus himself, fr. 23&#41;, <em>insul&aelig;
populat&aelig; complures</em>, as also the siege
of Cyzicus. If in this retrospect all
is not confused&mdash;which cannot well
be assumed to be the case with Ammianus&mdash;this
falls before those naval
expeditions which begin with the
siege of Pityus, and are more a part
of the migration of peoples than piratical
raids. The number of the ships
might indeed be transferred hither by
error of memory from the expedition
of the year 269. To the same connection
belongs the notice in Zosimus,
i. 28, as to the Scythian expeditions
into Asia and Cappadocia as far as
Ephesus and Pessinus. The account
as to Ephesus in the biography of
Gallienus, c. 6, is the same, but
transposed as to time.</p></div>

we should not expect complete understanding
of the matter; but his voucher
Dexippus, who was a contemporary
and took part in the matter, knew well why he termed the Bithynian
expedition the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δευτέρα ἔφοδος</span> &#40;Zos.
i. 35&#41;; and even in Zosimus we
discern clearly the contrast, intended
by Dexippus, between the expedition
of the Borani against Pityus
and Trapezus and the traditional
piratic voyages. In the biography of
Gallienus the Scythian expedition to
Cappadocia, narrated at c. 11, under
the year 264, must be that to Trapezus,
just as the Bithynian therewith connected
must be that which Zosimus
terms the second; here indeed everything
is confused.</p></div>

i. 39, and the biographer of Gallienus,
c. 13. <em>Fr.</em> 22 is a portion of his
own narrative. In the continuator
of Dio, on whom Zonaras depends,
the event is placed under Claudius,
through error or through falsification,
which grudged this victory to Gallienus.
The biography of Gallienus narrates
the incident apparently twice, first
shortly in c. 6 under the year 262;
then better, under or after 265, in
c. 13.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_145_145" id="Footnote_145_145"></a><a href="#FNanchor_145_145"><span class="label">145</span></a> In our traditional accounts this
expedition appears as a pure sea&ndash;voyage,
undertaken with &#40;probably&#41;
2000 ships &#40;so the biography of
Claudius; the numbers 6000 and
900, between which the tradition in
Zosimus, i. 42, wavers, are probably
both corrupt&#41; and 320,000 men. It
is, however, far from credible that
Dexippus, to whom these statements
must be traced back, can have put
the latter figure in this way. On the
other hand, considering the direction
of the expedition, in the first instance
against Tomis and Marcianopolis, it
is more than probable that in it the
procedure described by Zos. i. 34 was
followed, and a portion marched by
land; and under this supposition even
a contemporary might well estimate
the number of assailants at that figure.
The course of the campaign, particularly
the place of the decisive battle,
shows that they had by no means to
do merely with a fleet.</p></div>

427 ff.&#41;. The union was formed at
that time of seventeen tribes with&mdash;together&mdash;twenty&ndash;four

them belonging to Greece proper or
Thessaly; Aetolia, Epirus, Macedonia
were wanting. After the remodelling
by Augustus &#40;Pausanias, x. 8&#41; this organisation
continued to subsist in
other respects, except only that by
restriction of the disproportionately
numerous Thessalian votes those of
the tribes hitherto represented were
reduced to eighteen; to these were
now added Nicopolis in Epirus with
six, and Macedonia likewise with six
votes. Moreover the six votes of
Nicopolis were to be given on each
occasion, just as this continued to be
the case, for the two of Delphi and
the one of Athens; whereas the other
votes were given by the groups, so
that, <em>e.g.</em> the one vote of the Peloponnesian
Dorians alternated between
Argos, Sicyon, Corinth, and Megara.
The Amphictionies were even now
not a collective representation of the
European Hellenes, in so far as the tribes earlier excluded in Greece
proper, a portion of the Peloponnesians,
and the Aetolians not attached
to Nicopolis, were not represented in
it.</p></div>

presidents of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοινὸν τῶν Ἀχαιῶν</span>,
whose home is made out, are from
Argos, Messene, Corone in Messenia
&#40;Foucart&ndash;Lebas, ii.&nbsp;305&#41;, and there
have been hitherto found among them
not merely no citizens of the freed
communities, such as Athens and
Sparta, but also none of those belonging
to the confederation of the Boeotians
and allies &#40;<a href="#Page_259">p.&nbsp;259</a>&#41;. Perhaps
this <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοινόν</span> was legally restricted to
the territory, which the Romans called
the republic of Achaia&mdash;that is, that
of the Achaean league at its overthrow&mdash;and
the Boeotians and allies
were united with the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοινόν</span> proper of
the Achaeans into that wider league,
whose existence and diets in Argos
are vouched for by the inscriptions of
Acraephia mentioned in the next note.
We may add that alongside of this
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοινόν</span> of the Achaeans there subsisted
a still narrower one of the district of
Achaia in the proper sense, whose
representatives met in Aegium &#40;Pausanias,
vii.&nbsp;24, 4&#41;, just as the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοινὸν
τῶν Ἀρκάδων</span> &#40;<cite>Arch. Zeit.</cite> 1879, p.
139, n. 274&#41;, and numerous others.
If, according to Pausanias, v.&nbsp;12, 6,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἱ πάντες Ἕλληνες</span> set up statues in
Olympia to Trajan, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἱ ἐς τὸ Ἀχαικὸν τελοῦσαι πόλεις</span> to Hadrian, and no
misunderstanding has here crept in,
the latter dedication must have taken
place at the diet of Aegium.</p></div>

n. 31&#41;. But this very document,
along with the contemporary one,
<cite>C. I. Gr.</cite> 1625, furnishes a proof
that the union under the emperor
Gaius, instead of this doubtless strictly
official appellation, designated itself
also on the one hand as union of the
Achaeans, on the other as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ κοινὸν

is nowhere so glaringly
prominent as in those Boeotian petty
country&ndash;towns; but even in Olympia,
where the union especially set up its
memorials, it names itself for the
most part no doubt <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ κοινὸν τῶν
Ἀχαιῶν</span>, but shows often enough the
same tendency; <em>e.g.</em> when <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ κοινὸν

to Caesar Marcus <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ τοῦ κοινοῦ τῶν

the president of the Greek towns belonging

with the non&ndash;Greeks. But, as the
name of Hellenes is employed in
Greece in a certain contrast to the

is certainly suggested by the same
tendency which was most clearly marked in the Panhellenes of Argos.

to titles and rank, Pius tells the

Pergamenes had given to them the
new title; that the Smyrnaeans had
doubtless merely by accident omitted
it, and would certainly in future be
ready to do what was correct, if they&mdash;the
Ephesians&mdash;would accord to
them their right titles. To a small
Lycian town, which applied to the

resolution adopted by it, the latter replied

that excellent ordinances require only
praise, not confirmation; the latter is
implied in the case. The rhetorical

dark. If the robber&ndash;chief generally&mdash;and

common to the bad romance&ndash;writers

the possession would have

Trajan&#8217;s time under the governor of
Bithynia, follows from Plin. <cite>ad
Trai.</cite> 43. From the congratulations
of the Byzantines to the legates of
Moesia we cannot infer their having
belonged to this governorship, which
from their situation was hardly possible;
the relations to the governor of
Moesia may be explained from the
commercial connections of the city
with the Moesian ports. That Byzantium
was in the year 53 under the
senate, and so did not belong to
Thrace, is plain from Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite>
xii.&nbsp;62. Cicero &#40;<cite>in Pis.</cite> 35, 86; <cite>de
prov.&nbsp;cons.</cite> 4, 6&#41; does not attest its
having belonged to Macedonia under
the republic, since the town was then
free. This freedom seems, as in the
case of Rhodes, to have been often
given and often taken away. Cicero,
<em>l.c.</em>, ascribes freedom to it; in the
year 53 it is tributary, Pliny &#40;<cite>H. N.</cite>
iv.&nbsp;11, 46&#41; adduces it as a free city;
Vespasian withdraws its freedom &#40;Suetonius,

<p><a name="Footnote_204_204" id="Footnote_204_204"></a><a href="#FNanchor_204_204"><span class="label">204</span></a> This is proved by the absence of
coins of the inland Thracian towns,
which could be assigned by metal and
style to the older period. That a
number of Thracian, especially Odrysian,
princes coined in part even at a
very early period, proves only that
they ruled over places on the coast
with a Greek or half&ndash;Greek population.
A similar judgment must be
formed as to the tetradrachms of
the &#8220;Thracians,&#8221; which stand quite
isolated &#40;Sallet, <cite>Num. Zeitschrift</cite>, iii.
241&#41;.&mdash;The inscriptions also found in
the interior of Thrace are throughout
of Roman times. The decree of a
town not named found at Bessapara,
now Tatar Bazarjik, to the west of
Philippopolis, by Dumont &#40;<cite>Inscr. de la
Thrace</cite>, p. 7&#41;, is indeed assigned to
a good Macedonian time, but only
from the character of the writing,
which is perhaps deceptive.</p></div>

The young citizen of rank with a

though not acquainted with Phocylides,
knows Homer by heart, wears
mantle and trousers after the Scythian
fashion, and a knife in his girdle.
The townsmen all wear long hair and
a long beard, and only one has shorn
both, which is suspected in him as a
token of servile attitude towards the
Romans. Thus a century later matters
there looked quite such as Ovid describes
them at Tomis.</p></div>

the year 41 made king of Bosporus,
traced back his descent to Eupator
&#40;Dio, lx. 8; Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite> xii.&nbsp;18&#41;,

Cotys &#40;Tacitus, <em>l.c.</em>&#41;. Their father
was called Aspurgus &#40;<cite>C. I. Gr.</cite> ii.&nbsp;p.
95&#41;, but need not on that account
have been an Aspurgian &#40;Strabo, xi.
2, 19, p. 415&#41;. Of a subsequent
change of dynasty there is no mention;
king Eupator in the time of
Pius &#40;Lucian, <cite>Alex.</cite> 57; <em>vita Pii</em>, 9&#41;
points to the same house. Probably,
we may add, these later Bosporan
kings, as well as the immediate successors
of Polemon not even known to
us by name, stood in relations of
affinity to the Polemonids, as indeed
the first Polemon himself had as his
wife a granddaughter of Eupator.
The Thracian royal names, such as
Cotys and Rhascuporis, which are common
in the Bosporan royal house, connect
themselves doubtless with the son&ndash;in&ndash;law
of Polemon, the Thracian king
Cotys. The appellation Sauromates,
which frequently occurs after the end of
the first century, has doubtless arisen
through intermarriage with Sarmatian
princely houses, but, of course, does
not prove that those who bore it were
themselves Sarmatians. If Zosimus,
i. 31, blames the petty and unworthy
princes who attained to government
after the extinction of the old royal
family, for the fact that the Goths
under Valerian could carry out their
piratical expeditions in Bosporan
ships, this may be correct, and in the
first instance Pharnaces may be meant,
of whom there are coins from the years
254 and 255. But even these, too,
are marked with the image of the
Roman emperor, and later there are
again found the old family names &#40;all
the Bosporan kings are Tiberii Julii&#41;,
and the old surnames, such as Sauromates
and Rhascuporis. Taken as a
whole, the old traditions as well as
the Roman protectorate were still at
that time here retained.</p></div>

that several of the Panticapaean princes
ruled as far as Tanais, and particularly
the last, Pharnaces, Asander, Polemon,
this seems more exception than
rule. In the inscription quoted in the

concerning the two rival brothers,
Mithradates and Cotys, the neighbouring

Aorsi, are under rulers of their own not
legally dependent on the Roman prince
of Panticapaeum.&mdash;As to titles, the
older Panticapaean princes are wont
to call themselves archons of the Bosporus,
that is, of Panticapaeum, and
of Theudosia, and kings of the Sindi
and of all the Maitae and other non&ndash;Greek
tribes. In like manner what is,
so far as I know, the oldest among the

names Aspurgos, son of Asandrochos

who some years afterwards was deposed

Cotys; he lived afterwards in Rome,
and perished in the confusions of the
four&ndash;emperor&ndash;year &#40;Plutarch, <cite>Galba</cite>,
13, 15&#41;. The state of the matter,
however, is not clear either from the
hints in Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite> xii.&nbsp;15 &#40;comp.
Plin. <cite>H. N.</cite> vi. 5, 17&#41;, or from the
report &#40;confused by the interchange of the two, Mithradates of Bosporus,
and Mithradates of Iberia&#41; in Petrus
Patricius <em>fr.</em> 3. The Chersonese tales in
the late Constantinus Porphyrogenitus,
<cite>de adm. imp.</cite> c. 53, do not, of course,
come into account. The bad Bosporan
king Sauromates, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρισκωνόρου</span> &#40;not
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ῥησκοπόρου</span>&#41; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">υἱός</span>, who with the Sarmatians
wages war against the emperors
Diocletian and Constantius,
as well as against the Chersonese faithful
to the empire, has evidently arisen
from a confusion of names between
the Bosporan king and people; and
just as historical as the variation on
the history of David and Goliath, is
the despatch of the mighty king of the
Bosporans, Sauromates, by the small
Chersonesite Pharnaces. The kings&#8217;
names alone, <em>e.g.</em> besides those named,
the Asander, who comes in after the
extinction of the family of the Sauromatae,
suffice. The civic privileges
and the localities of the city, for the explanation
of which these <em>mirabilia</em> are
invented, certainly deserve attention.</p></div>

the vassal states and even of the
provinces changed more than in the
north&ndash;east of Asia Minor. Direct
imperial administration was introduced
here for the districts of king
Polemon, to which Zela, Neocaesarea,
Trapezus belonged, in the year 63;
for Lesser Armenia, we do not know
exactly when, probably at the beginning
of the reign of Vespasian. The
last vassal king of Lesser Armenia,
of whom there is mention, was the
Herodian Aristobulus &#40;Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite>
xiii.&nbsp;7, xiv.&nbsp;26; Josephus, <cite>Ant.</cite> xx.
8, 4&#41;, who still possessed it in the
year 60; in the year 75 the district
was Roman &#40;<cite>C. I. L.</cite> iii.&nbsp;306&#41;, and
probably one of the legions garrisoning
Cappadocia from Vespasian&#8217;s time
was stationed from the first in the
Lesser&ndash;Armenian Satala. Vespasian
combined the regions mentioned, as
well as Galatia and Cappadocia, into
one large governorship. At the end
of the reign of Domitian we find
Galatia and Cappadocia separated
and the north&ndash;eastern provinces attached to Galatia. Under Trajan
at first the whole district is once more
in one hand, subsequently &#40;<cite>Eph. Ep.
V.</cite> n. 1345&#41; it is divided in such a
way that the north&ndash;east coast belongs
to Cappadocia. On that footing it
remained, at least in so far that
Trapezus and so also Lesser Armenia
were thenceforth constantly under this
governor. Consequently&mdash;apart from
a short interruption under Domitian&mdash;the
legate of Galatia had nothing
to do with the defence of the frontier,
and this, as was implied in the nature
of the case, was always combined
with the command of Cappadocia
and of its legions.</p></div>

in particular we must take note
that it was the promised land of municipal
vanity, and our memorials, including

and, if one of them has several to
show, the number is appended. In
this institution one may clearly discern
how the imperial worship obtained its full elaboration in Asia
Minor. In reality the <em>neocorate</em> is
general, applicable to any deity and
any town; titularly, as an honorary
surname of the town, it meets us with
vanishing exceptions only in the imperial
cultus of Asia Minor&mdash;only
some Greek towns of the neighbouring
provinces, such as Tripolis in
Syria, Thessalonica in Macedonia,
participated in it.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_243_243" id="Footnote_243_243"></a><a href="#FNanchor_243_243"><span class="label">243</span></a> However little the original diversity
of the presidency of the diet and
the provincial chief&ndash;priesthood for the
cultus of the emperor can be called
in question, yet not merely in the case
of the former does the magisterial
character of the president, still clearly
recognisable in Hellas, whence the
organisation of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοινά</span> generally
proceeds, fall completely into the
shade in Asia Minor, but here in
fact, where the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοινόν</span> has several
ritual centres, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀσιάρχης</span> and the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχιερεὺς τῆς Ἀσίας</span> seem to have
amalgamated. The president of the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοινόν</span> never bears in Asia Minor the
title of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρατηγός</span>, which sharply emphasises
the civil office, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρξας τοῦ

&#40;<cite>C. I. Gr.</cite> 4380<em>&#7503;</em>⁴, p. 1168&#41; is rare;
the compounds <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀσιάρχης, Λυκιάρχης</span>,
analogous to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἑλλαδάρχης</span> of
Achaia, are already in Strabo&#8217;s time
the usual designation. That in the
minor provinces, like Galatia and
Lycia, the Archon and the Archiereus
of the province remained separate, is
certain. But in Asia the existence of
Asiarchs for Ephesus and Smyrna is
established by inscriptions &#40;Marquardt,
<cite>Staatsverw.</cite> i. 514&#41;, while yet according
to the nature of the institution
there could only be one Asiarch for
the whole province. Here, too, the
Agonothesia of the Archiereus is attested
&#40;Galen on Hippocrates <em>de part.</em>
18, 2, p. 567, K&uuml;hn: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παρ&#8217; ἡμῖν ἐν
Περγάμῳ τῶν ἀρχιερέων τὰς καλουμένας
μονομαχίας ἐπιτελούντων</span>&#41;, while it is
the very essence of the Asiarchate.
To all appearance the rivalries of the
towns have here led to the result,
that, after there were several temples
of the emperor dedicated by the province
in different towns, the Agonothesia
was taken from the real president
of the diet, and, instead, the
titular Asiarchate and the Agonothesia
were committed to the chief priest of
each temple. In that case the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀσιάρχης
καὶ ἀρχιερεὺς ιγʹ πόλεων</span> is explained on
the coins of the thirteen Ionic towns
&#40;Mionnet, iii.&nbsp;61, 1&#41;, and on Ephesian
inscriptions the same Ti. Julius Reginus
may be named sometimes <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀσιάρχης
βʹ ναῶν τῶν ἐν Ἐφέσῳ</span> &#40;Wood,
<cite>Inscr. from the great theatre</cite>, p. 18&#41;,
sometimes <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχιερεὺς βʹ ναῶν τῶν ἐν
Ἐφέσῳ</span> &#40;<em>ib.</em> n. 8. 14, similarly 9&#41;.&mdash;Only
in this way, too, are the institutions
of the fourth century to be comprehended.
Here a chief priest appears
in every province, in Asia with
the title of Asiarch, in Syria with
that of Syriarch, and so forth. If
the amalgamation of the Archon and
the Archiereus had already begun earlier in the province of Asia, nothing
was more natural than now, on the
diminution of the provinces, to combine
them everywhere in this way.</p></div>

an almost constant absence in the
designation of the provincial priests
of express reference to the worship of
the emperors; there was good reason
for that absence, if they were expected
to play in their spheres the part of
the Pontifex Maximus in Rome.</p></div>

military help at the disposal of the
chief priest of the individual province
&#40;Eusebius, <cite>Hist. Eccl.</cite> viii.&nbsp;14, 9&#41;;
and the famous letter of Julian &#40;<em>Ep.</em>
49, comp. <em>Ep.</em> 63&#41; to the Galatarch
of the time gives a clear view of his
obligations. He is to superintend
the whole religious matters of the
province; to preserve his independence
in contradistinction to the
governor, not to dance attendance
upon him, not to allow him to appear
in the temple with military escort, to
receive him not in front of, but in, the
temple, within which he is lord and
the governor a private man. Of the
subsidies which the government has
settled on the province &#40;30,000
bushels of corn and 60,000 sextarii
of wine&#41;, he is to expend the fifth
part on the poor persons who become
clients of the heathen priests, and to
employ the rest otherwise on charitable
objects; in every town of the province,
if possible, with the aid of private
persons, to call into existence hospitals
&#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξενοδοχεῖα</span>&#41;, not merely for heathens,
but for everybody, and no longer to
allow the Christians the monopoly
of good works. He is to urge all
the priests of the province by example
and exhortation generally to maintain
a religious walk, to avoid the
frequenting of theatres and taverns,
and in particular to frequent the
temples diligently with their family
and their attendants, or else, if they
should not amend their ways, to
depose them. It is a pastoral letter
in the best form, only with the address
altered, and with quotations from
Homer instead of the Bible. Clearly
as these arrangements bear on their
face the stamp of heathenism already
collapsing, and certainly as in this
extent they are foreign to the earlier
epoch, the foundation at any rate&mdash;the
general superintendence of the
chief priest of the province over
matters of worship&mdash;by no means
appears as a new institution.</p></div>

62&#41;, in the year 741&ndash;742 <span class="smcap lowercase">U.C.</span><span class="sidenote2">13&ndash;12.</span>, some
apparently respectable burgesses had
during three nights assailed the house
of one with whom they had a personal
feud; in repelling the attack one of
the slaves of the besieged house had
killed one of the assailants by a vessel
thrown from the window. The occupants
of the besieged house were
thereupon accused of manslaughter,
but, as they had public opinion against
them, they dreaded the civic tribunal
and desired the matter to be decided
by the verdict of the emperor Augustus.
The latter had the case investigated
by a commissioner, and acquitted the
accused, of which he informed the
authorities in Cnidus, with the remark
that they would not have handled the
matter impartially, and directed them
to act in accordance with his verdict.
This was certainly, as Cnidus was a
free town, an encroachment on its
sovereign rights, as also in Athens
appeal to the emperor and even to
the proconsul was in Hadrian&#8217;s time
allowable &#40;<a href="#Page_262">p.&nbsp;262</a>, note 2&#41;. But any
one who considers the state of things
as to justice in a Greek town of this

doubt that, while such encroachment
gave doubtless occasion to various unjust
decisions, it much more frequently
prevented them.</p></div>

i. 71&#41;, according to which council
and people resolve, as the law requires,
to institute a Gerusia, and to
elect to it 50 Buleutae and 50 other
citizens, who then appoint a gymnasiarch
for the new Gerusia. This gymnasiarch,
who meets us elsewhere, as
well as the Hymnode of the Gerusia
&#40;Menadier, <cite>qua condic. Ephesii usi

of this body known to us,
the only ones characteristic of its
nature. Analogous, but of less estimation,
are the <em>collegia</em> of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νέοι</span>,

To the two overseers of the
places of gymnastic exercise for the

of the Ephebi form the contrast
&#40;Menadier, p. 91&#41;. Common repasts
and festivals &#40;to which the Hymnodes

wanting, particularly in the case of the
Gerusia. It was not a provision for
the poor, nor yet a <em>collegium</em> reserved
for the municipal aristocracy; but
characteristic for the mode of civil
intercourse among the Greeks, with
whom the gymnasium was nearly
what the citizens&#8217; assembly&ndash;rooms are
in our small towns.</p></div>

&#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχιατρός</span>, which title first

such influence that he combined

he procured not merely for his brother
and uncle the Roman franchise and
posts as officers of equestrian rank,
and for himself, besides the horse of
a knight and the rank of officer, the
decoration of the golden chaplet and
the spear on occasion of the triumph
over Britain, but also for his native
place freedom from taxation. His
tomb stands on the island, and his
grateful countrymen set up statues to
him and to his, and struck in memory
of him coins with his effigy. He it
is who is alleged to have put an end
to Claudius, when dead&ndash;sick, by
further poisoning, and accordingly, as
equally valuable to him and to his successor,
he is termed on his monuments
not merely, as usual, &#8220;friend
of the emperor&#8221; &#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φιλοσεβαστός</span>&#41;, but
specially friend of Claudius &#40;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φιλοκλαύδιος</span>&#41;

according to certain restoration&#41;.
His brother, whom he followed in
this position, drew a salary of 500,000
sesterces &#40;&#163;5000&#41;, but assured the
emperor that he had only taken the
position to please him, as his town&ndash;practice
brought in to him 100,000
sesterces more. In spite of the enormous
sums which the brothers had
expended on Naples in particular, as
well as on Cos, they left behind
an estate of 30,000,000 sesterces
&#40;&#163;325,000&#41;.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
