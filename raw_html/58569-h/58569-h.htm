<h2>
BEYOND THE HORIZON<br />
<br />
<a name="ACT_ONE" id="ACT_ONE"></a>ACT ONE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene One</span></h3>

<p><i>A section of country highway. The road runs diagonally from the left,
forward, to the right, rear, and can be seen in the distance winding
toward the horizon like a pale ribbon between the low, rolling hills
with their freshly plowed fields clearly divided from each other,
checkerboard fashion, by the lines of stone walls and rough snake
fences.</i></p>

<p><i>The forward triangle cut off by the road is a section of a field from
the dark earth of which myriad bright-green blades of fall-sown rye are
sprouting. A straggling line of piled rocks, too low to be called a
wall, separates this field from the road.</i></p>

<p><i>To the rear of the road is a ditch with a sloping, grassy bank on the
far side. From the center of this an old, gnarled apple tree, just
budding into leaf, strains its twisted branches heavenwards, black
against the pallor of distance. A snake-fence sidles from left to right
along the top of the bank, passing beneath the apple tree.</i></p>

<p><i>The hushed twilight of a day in May is just beginning. The horizon
hills are still rimmed by a faint line of flame, and the sky above them
glows with the crimson flush of the sunset. This fades gradually as the
action of the scene progresses.</i></p>

<p><i>At the rise of the curtain</i>, <small>ROBERT MAYO</small> <i>is discovered sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span> on the
fence. He is a tall, slender young man of twenty-three. There is a touch
of the poet about him expressed in his high forehead and wide, dark
eyes. His features are delicate and refined, leaning to weakness in the
mouth and chin. He is dressed in gray corduroy trousers pushed into high
laced boots, and a blue flannel shirt with a bright colored tie. He is
reading a book by the fading sunset light. He shuts this, keeping a
finger in to mark the place, and turns his head toward the horizon,
gazing out over the fields and hills. His lips move as if he were
reciting something to himself.</i></p>

<p><i>His brother</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>comes along the road from the right, returning
from his work in the fields. He is twenty-seven years old, an opposite
type to</i> <small>ROBERT</small>&mdash;<i>husky, sun-bronzed, handsome in a large-featured,
manly fashion&mdash;a son of the soil, intelligent in a shrewd way, but with
nothing of the intellectual about him. He wears overalls, leather boots,
a gray flannel shirt open at the neck, and a soft, mud-stained hat
pushed back on his head. He stops to talk to</i> <small>ROBERT</small>, <i>leaning on the
hoe he carries</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>seeing</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>has not noticed his presence&mdash;in a loud
shout</i>) Hey there! (<small>ROBERT</small> <i>turns with a start. Seeing who it is, he
smiles</i>) Gosh, you do take the prize for daydreaming! And I see you’ve
toted one of the old books along with you. (<i>He crosses the ditch and
sits on the fence near his brother</i>) What is it this time&mdash;poetry, I’ll
bet. (<i>He reaches for the book</i>) Let me see.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>handing it to him rather reluctantly</i>) Look out you don’t get
it full of dirt.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>glancing at his hands</i>) That isn’t dirt&mdash;i<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span>t’s good clean
earth. (<i>He turns over the pages. His eyes read something and he gives
an exclamation of disgust</i>) Hump! (<i>With a provoking grin at his brother
he reads aloud in a doleful, sing-song voice</i>) “I have loved wind and
light and the bright sea. But holy and most sacred night, not as I love
and have loved thee.” (<i>He hands the book back</i>) Here! Take it and bury
it. I suppose it’s that year in college gave you a liking for that kind
of stuff. I’m darn glad I stopped at High School, or maybe I’d been
crazy too. (<i>He grins and slaps</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>on the back affectionately</i>)
Imagine me reading poetry and plowing at the same time! The team’d run
away, I’ll bet.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>laughing</i>) Or picture me plowing.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> You should have gone back to college last fall, like I know you
wanted to. You’re fitted for that sort of thing&mdash;just as I ain’t.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> You know why I didn’t go back, Andy. Pa didn’t like the idea,
even if he didn’t say so; and I know he wanted the money to use
improving the farm. And besides, I’m not keen on being a student, just
because you see me reading books all the time. What I want to do now is
keep on moving so that I won’t take root in any one place.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Well, the trip you’re leaving on tomorrow will keep you moving
all right. (<i>At this mention of the trip they both fall silent. There is
a pause. Finally</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>goes on, awkwardly, attempting to speak
casually</i>) Uncle says you’ll be gone three years.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> About that, he figures.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>moodily</i>) That’s a long time.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Not so long when you come to consider it. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span> know the <i>Sunda</i>
sails around the Horn for Yokohama first, and that’s a long voyage on a
sailing ship; and if we go to any of the other places Uncle Dick
mentions&mdash;India, or Australia, or South Africa, or South
America&mdash;they’ll be long voyages, too.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> You can have all those foreign parts for all of me. (<i>After a
pause</i>) Ma’s going to miss you a lot, Rob.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Yes&mdash;and I’ll miss her.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> And Pa ain’t feeling none too happy to have you go&mdash;though he’s
been trying not to show it.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> I can see how he feels.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> And you can bet that I’m not giving any cheers about it. (<i>He
puts one hand on the fence near</i> <small>ROBERT</small>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>putting one hand on top of</i> <small>ANDREW’S</small> <i>with a gesture almost of
shyness</i>) I know that, too, Andy.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I’ll miss you as much as anybody, I guess. You see, you and I
ain’t like most brothers&mdash;always fighting and separated a lot of the
time, while we’ve always been together&mdash;just the two of us. It’s
different with us. That’s why it hits so hard, I guess.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with feeling</i>) It’s just as hard for me, Andy&mdash;believe that! I
hate to leave you and the old folks&mdash;but&mdash;I feel I’ve got to. There’s
something calling me&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He points to the horizon</i>) Oh, I can’t just
explain it to you, Andy.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> No need to, Rob. (<i>Angry at himself</i>) Hell! You want to
go&mdash;that’s all there is to it; and I wouldn’t have you miss this chance
for the world.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> It’s fine of you to feel that way, Andy.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Huh! I’d be a nice son-of-a-gun if I didn’t, wouldn’t I? When I
know how you need this sea trip to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span> make a new man of you&mdash;in the body,
I mean&mdash;and give you your full health back.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>a trifle impatiently</i>) All of you seem to keep harping on my
health. You were so used to seeing me lying around the house in the old
days that you never will get over the notion that I’m a chronic invalid.
You don’t realize how I’ve bucked up in the past few years. If I had no
other excuse for going on Uncle Dick’s ship but just my health, I’d stay
right here and start in plowing.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Can’t be done. Farming ain’t your nature. There’s all the
difference shown in just the way us two feel about the farm. You&mdash;well,
you like the home part of it, I expect; but as a place to work and grow
things, you hate it. Ain’t that right?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Yes, I suppose it is. For you it’s different. You’re a Mayo
through and through. You’re wedded to the soil. You’re as much a product
of it as an ear of corn is, or a tree. Father is the same. This farm is
his life-work, and he’s happy in knowing that another Mayo, inspired by
the same love, will take up the work where he leaves off. I can
understand your attitude, and Pa’s; and I think it’s wonderful and
sincere. But I&mdash;well, I’m not made that way.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> No, you ain’t; but when it comes to understanding, I guess I
realize that you’ve got your own angle of looking at things.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>musingly</i>) I wonder if you do, really.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>confidently</i>) Sure I do. You’ve seen a bit of the world,
enough to make the farm seem small, and you’ve got the itch to see it
all.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> It’s more than that, Andy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Oh, of course. I know you’re going to learn navigation, and all
about a ship, so’s you can be an officer. That’s natural, too. There’s
fair pay in it, I expect, when you consider that you’ve always got a
home and grub thrown in; and if you’re set on traveling, you can go
anywhere you’re a mind to without paying fare.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with a smile that is half sad</i>) It’s more than that, Andy.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Sure it is. There’s always a chance of a good thing coming your
way in some of those foreign ports or other. I’ve heard there are great
opportunities for a young fellow with his eyes open in some of those new
countries that are just being opened up. (<i>Jovially</i>) I’ll bet that’s
what you’ve been turning over in your mind under all your quietness!
(<i>He slaps his brother on the back with a laugh</i>) Well, if you get to be
a millionaire all of a sudden, call ’round once in a while and I’ll pass
the plate to you. We could use a lot of money right here on the farm
without hurting it any.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>forced to laugh</i>) I’ve never considered that practical side of
it for a minute, Andy.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Well, you ought to.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> No, I oughtn’t. (<i>Pointing to the horizon&mdash;dreamily</i>) Supposing
I was to tell you that it’s just Beauty that’s calling me, the beauty of
the far off and unknown, the mystery and spell of the East which lures
me in the books I’ve read, the need of the freedom of great wide spaces,
the joy of wandering on and on&mdash;in quest of the secret which is hidden
over there, beyond the horizon? Suppose I told you that was the one and
only reason for my going?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I should say you were nutty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>frowning</i>) Don’t, Andy. I’m serious.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Then you might as well stay here, because we’ve got all you’re
looking for right on this farm. There’s wide space enough, Lord knows;
and you can have all the sea you want by walking a mile down to the
beach; and there’s plenty of horizon to look at, and beauty enough for
anyone, except in the winter. (<i>He grins</i>) As for the mystery and spell,
I haven’t met ’em yet, but they’re probably lying around somewheres.
I’ll have you understand this is a first class farm with all the
fixings. (<i>He laughs</i>)</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>joining in the laughter in spite of himself</i>) It’s no use
talking to you, you chump!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> You’d better not say anything to Uncle Dick about spells and
things when you’re on the ship. He’ll likely chuck you overboard for a
Jonah. (<i>He jumps down from fence</i>) I’d better run along. I’ve got to
wash up some as long as Ruth’s Ma is coming over for supper.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>pointedly&mdash;almost bitterly</i>) And Ruth.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>confused&mdash;looking everywhere except at</i> <small>ROBERT</small>&mdash;<i>trying to
appear unconcerned</i>) Yes, Ruth’ll be staying too. Well, I better hustle,
I guess, and&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He steps over the ditch to the road while he is
talking</i>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>who appears to be fighting some strong inward
emotion&mdash;impulsively</i>) Wait a minute, Andy! (<i>He jumps down from the
fence</i>) There is something I want to&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He stops abruptly, biting his
lips, his face coloring</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>facing him; half-defiantly</i>) Yes?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>confusedly</i>) No&mdash;&mdash; never mind&mdash;&mdash; it doesn’t matter, it was
nothing.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>after a pause, during which he stares fixedly at</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span> <small>ROBERT’S</small>
<i>averted face</i>) Maybe I can guess&mdash;&mdash; what you were going to say&mdash;&mdash; but
I guess you’re right not to talk about it. (<i>He pulls</i> <small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>hand
from his side and grips it tensely; the two brothers stand looking into
each other’s eyes for a minute</i>) We can’t help those things, Rob. (<i>He
turns away, suddenly releasing</i> <small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>hand</i>) You’ll be coming along
shortly, won’t you?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>dully</i>) Yes.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> See you later, then. (<i>He walks of down the road to the left.</i>
<small>ROBERT</small> <i>stares after him for a moment; then climbs to the fence rail
again, and looks out over the hills, an expression of deep grief on his
face. After a moment or so</i>, <small>RUTH</small> <i>enters hurriedly from the left. She
is a healthy, blonde, out-of-door girl of twenty, with a graceful,
slender figure. Her face, though inclined to roundness, is undeniably
pretty, its large eyes of a deep blue set off strikingly by the
sun-bronzed complexion. Her small, regular features are marked by a
certain strength&mdash;an underlying, stubborn fixity of purpose hidden in
the frankly-appealing charm of her fresh youthfulness. She wears a
simple white dress but no hat</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>seeing him</i>) Hello, Rob!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>startled</i>) Hello, Ruth!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>jumps the ditch and perches on the fence beside him</i>) I was
looking for you.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>pointedly</i>) Andy just left here.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> I know. I met him on the road a second ago. He told me you were
here. (<i>Tenderly playful</i>) I wasn’t looking for Andy, Smarty, if that’s
what you mean. I was looking for <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Because I’m going away tomorrow?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span></p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Because your mother was anxious to have you come home and asked me
to look for you. I just wheeled Ma over to your house.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>perfunctorily</i>) How is your mother?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>a shadow coming over her face</i>) She’s about the same. She never
seems to get any better or any worse. Oh, Rob, I do wish she’d try to
make the best of things that can’t be helped.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Has she been nagging at you again?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>nods her head, and then breaks forth rebelliously</i>) She never
stops nagging. No matter what I do for her she finds fault. If only Pa
was still living&mdash;&mdash; (<i>She stops as if ashamed of her outburst</i>) I
suppose I shouldn’t complain this way. (<i>She sighs</i>) Poor Ma, Lord knows
it’s hard enough for her. I suppose it’s natural to be cross when you’re
not able ever to walk a step. Oh, I’d like to be going away some
place&mdash;like you!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> It’s hard to stay&mdash;and equally hard to go, sometimes.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> There! If I’m not the stupid body! I swore I wasn’t going to speak
about your trip&mdash;until after you’d gone; and there I go, first thing!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Why didn’t you want to speak of it?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Because I didn’t want to spoil this last night you’re here. Oh,
Rob, I’m going to&mdash;we’re all going to miss you so awfully. Your mother
is going around looking as if she’d burst out crying any minute. You
ought to know how I feel. Andy and you and I&mdash;why it seems as if we’d
always been together.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with a wry attempt at a smile</i>) You and Andy<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span> will still have
each other. It’ll be harder for me without anyone.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> But you’ll have new sights and new people to take your mind off;
while we’ll be here with the old, familiar place to remind us every
minute of the day. It’s a shame you’re going&mdash;just at this time, in
spring, when everything is getting so nice. (<i>With a sigh</i>) I oughtn’t
to talk that way when I know going’s the best thing for you. You’re
bound to find all sorts of opportunities to get on, your father says.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>heatedly</i>) I don’t give a damn about that! I wouldn’t take a
voyage across the road for the best opportunity in the world of the kind
Pa thinks of. (<i>He smiles at his own irritation</i>) Excuse me, Ruth, for
getting worked up over it; but Andy gave me an overdose of the practical
considerations.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>slowly, puzzled</i>) Well, then, if it isn’t&mdash;&mdash; (<i>With sudden
intensity</i>) Oh, Rob, why <i>do</i> you want to go?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>turning to her quickly, in surprise&mdash;slowly</i>) Why do you ask
that, Ruth?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dropping her eyes before his searching glance</i>) Because&mdash;&mdash;
(<i>Lamely</i>) It seems such a shame.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>insistently</i>) Why?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Oh, because&mdash;everything.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> I could hardly back out now, even if I wanted to. And I’ll be
forgotten before you know it.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>indignantly</i>) You won’t! I’ll never forget&mdash;&mdash; (<i>She stops and
turns away to hide her confusion</i>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>softly</i>) Will you promise me that?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>evasively</i>) Of course. It’s mean of you to think that any of us
would forget so easily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>disappointedly</i>) Oh!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>with an attempt at lightness</i>) But you haven’t told me your
reason for leaving yet?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>moodily</i>) I doubt if you’ll understand. It’s difficult to
explain, even to myself. Either you feel it, or you don’t. I can
remember being conscious of it first when I was only a kid&mdash;you haven’t
forgotten what a sickly specimen I was then, in those days, have you?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>with a shudder</i>) Let’s not think about them.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> You’ll have to, to understand. Well, in those days, when Ma was
fixing meals, she used to get me out of the way by pushing my chair to
the west window and telling me to look out and be quiet. That wasn’t
hard. I guess I was always quiet.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>compassionately</i>) Yes, you always were&mdash;and you suffering so
much, too!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>musingly</i>) So I used to stare out over the fields to the
hills, out there&mdash;(<i>He points to the horizon</i>) and somehow after a time
I’d forget any pain I was in, and start dreaming. I knew the sea was
over beyond those hills,&mdash;the folks had told me&mdash;and I used to wonder
what the sea was like, and try to form a picture of it in my mind.
(<i>With a smile</i>) There was all the mystery in the world to me then about
that&mdash;far-off sea&mdash;and there still is! It called to me then just as it
does now. (<i>After a slight pause</i>) And other times my eyes would follow
this road, winding off into the distance, toward the hills, as if it,
too, was searching for the sea. And I’d promise myself that when I grew
up and was strong, I’d follow that road, and it and I would find the
sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span> together. (<i>With a smile</i>) You see, my making this trip is only
keeping that promise of long ago.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>charmed by his low, musical voice telling the dreams of his
childhood</i>) Yes, I see.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Those were the only happy moments of my life then, dreaming
there at the window. I liked to be all alone&mdash;those times. I got to know
all the different kinds of sunsets by heart. And all those sunsets took
place over there&mdash;(<i>He points</i>) beyond the horizon. So gradually I came
to believe that all the wonders of the world happened on the other side
of those hills. There was the home of the good fairies who performed
beautiful miracles. I believed in fairies then. (<i>With a smile</i>) Perhaps
I still do believe in them. Anyway, in those days they were real enough,
and sometimes I could actually hear them calling to me to come out and
play with them, dance with them down the road in the dusk in a game of
hide-and-seek to find out where the sun was hiding himself. They sang
their little songs to me, songs that told of all the wonderful things
they had in their home on the other side of the hills; and they promised
to show me all of them, if I’d only come, come! But I couldn’t come
then, and I used to cry sometimes and Ma would think I was in pain. (<i>He
breaks off suddenly with a laugh</i>) That’s why I’m going now, I suppose.
For I can still hear them calling. But the horizon is as far away and as
luring as ever. (<i>He turns to her&mdash;softly</i>) Do you understand now, Ruth?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>spellbound, in a whisper</i>) Yes.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> You feel it then?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Yes, yes, I do! (<i>Unconsciously she snuggles close against his
side. His arm steals about her as if he were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> aware of the action</i>)
Oh, Rob, how could I help feeling it? You tell things so beautifully!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>suddenly realizing that his arm is around her, and that her
head is resting on his shoulder, gently takes his arm away.</i> <small>RUTH</small>,
<i>brought back to herself, is overcome with confusion</i>) So now you know
why I’m going. It’s for that reason&mdash;that and one other.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> You’ve another? Then you must tell me that, too.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>looking at her searchingly. She drops her eyes before his
gaze</i>) I wonder if I ought to! You’ll promise not to be angry&mdash;whatever
it is?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>softly, her face still averted</i>) Yes, I promise.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>simply</i>) I love you. That’s the other reason.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>hiding her face in her hands</i>) Oh, Rob!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> I wasn’t going to tell you, but I feel I have to. It can’t
matter now that I’m going so far away, and for so long&mdash;perhaps forever.
I’ve loved you all these years, but the realization never came ’til I
agreed to go away with Uncle Dick. Then I thought of leaving you, and
the pain of that thought revealed to me in a flash&mdash;that I loved you,
had loved you as long as I could remember. (<i>He gently pulls one of</i>
<small>RUTH’S</small> <i>hands away from her face</i>) You mustn’t mind my telling you this,
Ruth. I realize how impossible it all is&mdash;and I understand; for the
revelation of my own love seemed to open my eyes to the love of others.
I saw Andy’s love for you&mdash;and I knew that you must love him.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>breaking out storming</i>) I don’t! I don’t love Andy! I don’t!
(<small>ROBERT</small> <i>stares at her in stupid astonishment</i>. <small>RUTH</small> <i>weeps
hysterically</i>) Whatever&mdash;put such a fool notion into&mdash;into your head?
(<i>She suddenly throws her arms about his neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span> and hides her head on his
shoulder</i>) Oh, Rob! Don’t go away! Please! You mustn’t, now! You can’t!
I won’t let you! It’d break my&mdash;my heart!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>The expression of stupid bewilderment giving way to one of
overwhelming joy. He presses her close to him&mdash;slowly and tenderly</i>) Do
you mean that&mdash;that you love me?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>sobbing</i>) Yes, yes&mdash;of course I do&mdash;what d’you s’pose? (<i>She
lifts up her head and looks into his eyes with a tremulous smile</i>) You
stupid thing! (<i>He kisses her</i>) I’ve loved you right along.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>mystified</i>) But you and Andy were always together!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Because you never seemed to want to go any place with me. You were
always reading an old book, and not paying any attention to me. I was
too proud to let you see I cared because I thought the year you had away
to college had made you stuck-up, and you thought yourself too educated
to waste any time on me.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>kissing her</i>) And I was thinking&mdash;&mdash; (<i>With a laugh</i>) What
fools we’ve both been!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>overcome by a sudden fear</i>) You won’t go away on the trip, will
you, Rob? You’ll tell them you can’t go on account of me, won’t you? You
can’t go now! You can’t!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>bewildered</i>) Perhaps&mdash;you can come too.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Oh, Rob, don’t be so foolish. You know I can’t. Who’d take care of
ma? Don’t you see I couldn’t go&mdash;on her account? (<i>She clings to him
imploringly</i>) Please don’t go&mdash;not now. Tell them you’ve decided not to.
They won’t mind. I know your mother and father’ll be glad. They’ll all
be. They don’t want you to go so far away from them. Please, Rob!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span> We’ll
be so happy here together where it’s natural and we know things. Please
tell me you won’t go!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>face to face with a definite, final decision, betrays the
conflict going on within him</i>) But&mdash;Ruth&mdash;I&mdash;Uncle Dick&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> He won’t mind when he knows it’s for your happiness to stay. How
could he? (<i>As</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>remains silent she bursts into sobs again</i>) Oh,
Rob! And you said&mdash;you loved me!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>conquered by this appeal&mdash;an irrevocable decision in his
voice</i>) I won’t go, Ruth. I promise you. There! Don’t cry! (<i>He presses
her to him, stroking her hair tenderly. After a pause he speaks with
happy hopefulness</i>) Perhaps after all Andy was right&mdash;righter than he
knew&mdash;when he said I could find all the things I was seeking for here,
at home on the farm. I think love must have been the secret&mdash;the secret
that called to me from over the world’s rim&mdash;the secret beyond every
horizon; and when I did not come, it came to me. (<i>He clasps</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>to
him fiercely</i>) Oh, Ruth, our love is sweeter than any distant dream!
(<i>He kisses her passionately and steps to the ground, lifting</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>in
his arms and carrying her to the road where he puts her down</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>with a happy laugh</i>) My, but you’re strong!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Come! We’ll go and tell them at once.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dismayed</i>) Oh, no, don’t, Rob, not ’til after I’ve gone. There’d
be bound to be such a scene with them all together.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>kissing her&mdash;gayly</i>) As you like&mdash;Little Miss Common Sense!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Let’s go, then. (<i>She takes his hand, and they start<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span> to go off
left.</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>suddenly stops and turns as though for a last look at the
hills and the dying sunset flush</i>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>looking upward and pointing</i>) See! The first star. (<i>He bends
down and kisses her tenderly</i>) <i>Our</i> star!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>in a soft murmur</i>) Yes. Our very own star. (<i>They stand for a
moment looking up at it, their arms around each other. Then</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>takes
his hand again and starts to lead him away</i>) Come, Rob, let’s go. (<i>His
eyes are fixed again on the horizon as he half turns to follow her.</i>
<small>RUTH</small> <i>urges</i>) We’ll be late for supper, Rob.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>shakes his head impatiently, as though he were throwing off
some disturbing thought&mdash;with a laugh</i>) All right. We’ll run then. Come
on! (<i>They run of laughing as</i></p>

<h3>ACT ONE<br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Scene Two</span></h3>

<p><i>The sitting room of the Mayo farm house about nine o’clock the same
night. On the left, two windows looking out on the fields. Against the
wall between the windows, an old-fashioned walnut desk. In the left
corner, rear, a sideboard with a mirror. In the rear wall to the right
of the sideboard, a window looking out on the road. Neat to the window a
door leading out into the yard. Farther right, a black horse-hair sofa,
and another door opening on a bedroom. In the corner, a straight-backed
chair. In the right wall, near the middle, an open doorway leading to
the kitchen. Farther forward a double-heater stove with coal scuttle,
etc. In the center of the newly carpeted floor, an oak dining-room table
with a red cover. In the center of the table, a large oil reading lamp.
Four chairs, three rockers with crocheted tidies on their backs, and one
straight-backed, are placed about the table. The walls are papered a
dark red with a scrolly-figured pattern.</i></p>

<p><i>Everything in the room is clean, well-kept, and in its exact place, yet
there is no suggestion of primness about the whole. Rather the
atmosphere is one of the orderly comfort of a simple, hard-earned
prosperity, enjoyed and maintained by the family as a unit.</i></p>

<p><small>JAMES MAYO</small>, <i>his wife, her brother</i>, <small>CAPTAIN DICK SCOTT</small>, <i>and</i> <small>ANDREW</small>
<i>are discovered</i>. <small>MAYO</small> <i>is his son</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>over again in body and
face&mdash;an</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>sixty-five years old with a short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span> square, white
beard</i>. <small>MRS. MAYO</small> <i>is a slight, round-faced, rather prim-looking woman
of fifty-five who had once been a school teacher. The labors of a
farmer’s wife have bent but not broken her, and she retains a certain
refinement of movement and expression foreign to the</i> <small>MAYO</small> <i>part of the
family. Whatever of resemblance</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>has to his parents may be
traced to her. Her brother, the</i> <small>CAPTAIN</small>, <i>is short and stocky, with a
weather-beaten, jovial face and a white mustache&mdash;a typical old salt,
loud of voice and given to gesture. He is fifty-eight years old.</i></p>

<p><small>JAMES MAYO</small> <i>sits in front of the table. He wears spectacles, and a farm
journal which he has been reading lies in his lap.</i> <small>THE CAPTAIN</small> <i>leans
forward from a chair in the rear, his hands on the table in front of
him</i>. <small>ANDREW</small> <i>is tilted back on the straight-backed chair to the left,
his chin sank forward on his chest, staring at the carpet, preoccupied
and frowning</i>.</p>

<p><i>As the Curtain rises the</i> <small>CAPTAIN</small> <i>is just finishing the relation of
some sea episode. The others are pretending an interest which is belied
by the absent-minded expressions on their faces.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><small>THE CAPTAIN.</small> (<i>chuckling</i>) And that mission woman, she hails me on the
dock as I was acomin’ ashore, and she says&mdash;with her silly face all
screwed up serious as judgment&mdash;“Captain,” she says, “would you be so
kind as to tell me where the sea-gulls sleeps at nights?” Blow me if
them warn’t her exact words! (<i>He slaps the table with the palm of his
hands and laughs loudly. The others force smiles</i>) Ain’t that just like
a fool woman’s question? And I looks at her serious as I could, “Ma’m,”
says I, “I couldn’t rightly answer that question. I ain’t never seed a
sea-gull in his bunk yet. The next time I hears one snorin’,” I says,
“I’ll make a note of where he’s turned in, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span> write you a letter ’bout
it.” And then she calls me a fool real spiteful and tacks away from me
quick. (<i>He laughs again uproariously</i>) So I got rid of her that way.
(<i>The others smile but immediately relapse into expressions of gloom
again</i>).</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>absent-mindedly&mdash;feeling that she has to say something</i>)
But when it comes to that, where <i>do</i> sea-gulls sleep, Dick?</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>slapping the table</i>) Ho! Ho! Listen to her, James. ’Nother one!
Well, if that don’t beat all hell&mdash;’scuse me for cussin’, Kate.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>with a twinkle in his eyes</i>) They unhitch their wings, Katey,
and spreads ’em out on a wave for a bed.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> And then they tells the fish to whistle to ’em when it’s time to
turn out. Ho! Ho!</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>with a forced smile</i>) You men folks are too smart to live,
aren’t you? (<i>She resumes her knitting</i>. <small>MAYO</small> <i>pretends to read his
paper</i>; <small>ANDREW</small> <i>stares at the floor</i>).</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>looks from one to the other of them with a puzzled air. Finally
he is unable to bear the thick silence a minute longer, and blurts
out</i>): You folks look as if you was settin’ up with a corpse. (<i>With
exaggerated concern</i>) God A’mighty, there ain’t anyone dead, be there?</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>sharply</i>) Don’t play the dunce, Dick! You know as well as we do
there ain’t no great cause to be feelin’ chipper.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>argumentatively</i>) And there ain’t no cause to be wearin’
mourning, either, I can make out.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>indignantly</i>) How can you talk that way, Dick Scott, when
you’re taking our Robbie away from us, in the middle of the night, you
might say, just to get on that old<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span> boat of yours on time! I think you
might wait until morning when he’s had his breakfast.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>appealing to the others hopelessly</i>) Ain’t that a woman’s way
o’ seein’ things for you? God A’mighty, Kate, I can’t give orders to the
tide that it’s got to be high just when it suits me to have it. I ain’t
gettin’ no fun out o’ missin’ sleep and leavin’ here at six bells
myself. (<i>Protestingly</i>) And the <i>Sunda</i> ain’t an old ship&mdash;leastways,
not very old&mdash;and she’s good’s she ever was.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>her lips trembling</i>) I wish Robbie weren’t going.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>looking at her over his glasses&mdash;consolingly</i>) There, Katey!</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>rebelliously</i>) Well, I do wish he wasn’t!</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> You shouldn’t be taking it so hard, ’s far as I kin see. This
vige’ll make a man of him. I’ll see to it he learns how to navigate, ’n’
study for a mate’s c’tificate right off&mdash;and it’ll give him a trade for
the rest of his life, if he wants to travel.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> But I don’t want him to travel all his life. You’ve got to
see he comes home when this trip is over. Then he’ll be all well, and
he’ll want to&mdash;to marry&mdash;(<small>ANDREW</small> <i>sits forward in his chair with an
abrupt movement</i>)&mdash;and settle down right here. (<i>She stares down at the
knitting in her lap&mdash;after a pause</i>) I never realized how hard it was
going to be for me to have Robbie go&mdash;or I wouldn’t have considered it a
minute.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> It ain’t no good goin’ on that way, Kate, now it’s all settled.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>on the verge of tears</i>) It’s all right for <i>you</i> to talk.
You’ve never had any children. You don’t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span> what it means to be
parted from them&mdash;and Robbie my youngest, too. (<small>ANDREW</small> <i>frowns and
fidgets in his chair</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>suddenly turning to them</i>) There’s one thing none of you seem
to take into consideration&mdash;that Rob wants to go. He’s dead set on it.
He’s been dreaming over this trip ever since it was first talked about.
It wouldn’t be fair to him not to have him go. (<i>A sudden uneasiness
seems to strike him</i>) At least, not if he still feels the same way about
it he did when he was talking to me this evening.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>with an air of decision</i>) Andy’s right, Katey. That ends all
argyment, you can see that. (<i>Looking at his big silver watch</i>) Wonder
what’s happened to Robert? He’s been gone long enough to wheel the
widder to home, certain. He can’t be out dreamin’ at the stars his last
night.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>a bit reproachfully</i>) Why didn’t you wheel Mrs. Atkins back
tonight, Andy? You usually do when she and Ruth come over.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>avoiding her eyes</i>) I thought maybe Robert wanted to tonight.
He offered to go right away when they were leaving.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> He only wanted to be polite.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>gets to his feet</i>) Well, he’ll be right back, I guess. (<i>He
turns to his father</i>) Guess I’ll go take a look at the black cow,
Pa&mdash;see if she’s ailing any.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> Yes&mdash;better had, son. (<small>ANDREW</small> <i>goes into the kitchen on the
right</i>).</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>as he goes out&mdash;in a low tone</i>) There’s the boy that would make
a good, strong sea-farin’ man&mdash;if he’d a mind to.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>sharply</i>) Don’t you put no such fool notions in Andy’s head,
Dick&mdash;or you ’n’ me’s goin’ to fall out. (<i>Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span> smiles</i>) You
couldn’t tempt him, no ways. Andy’s a Mayo bred in the bone, and he’s a
born farmer, and a damn good one, too. He’ll live and die right here on
this farm, like I expect to. (<i>With proud confidence</i>) And he’ll make
this one of the slickest, best-payin’ farms in the state, too, afore he
gits through!</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> Seems to me it’s a pretty slick place right now.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>shaking his head</i>) It’s too small. We need more land to make it
amount to much, and we ain’t got the capital to buy it. (<small>ANDREW</small> <i>enters
from the kitchen. His hat is on, and he carries a lighted lantern in his
hand. He goes to the door in the rear leading out</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>opens the door and pauses</i>) Anything else you can think of to
be done, Pa?</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> No, nothin’ I know of. (<small>ANDREW</small> <i>goes out, shutting the door</i>).</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>after a pause</i>) What’s come over Andy tonight, I wonder? He
acts so strange.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> He does seem sort o’ glum and out of sorts. It’s ’count o’ Robert
leavin’, I s’pose. (<i>To</i> <small>SCOTT</small>) Dick, you wouldn’t believe how them boys
o’ mine sticks together. They ain’t like most brothers. They’ve been
thick as thieves all their lives, with nary a quarrel I kin remember.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> No need to tell me that. I can see how they take to each other.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>pursuing her train of thought</i>) Did you notice, James, how
queer everyone was at supper? Robert seemed stirred up about something;
and Ruth was so flustered and giggly; and Andy sat there dumb, looking
as if he’d lost his best friend; and all of them only nibbled at their
food.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span></p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> Guess they was all thinkin’ about tomorrow, same as us.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>shaking her head</i>) No. I’m afraid somethin’s
happened&mdash;somethin’ else.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> You mean&mdash;’bout Ruth?</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> Yes.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>after a pause&mdash;frowning</i>) I hope her and Andy ain’t had a
serious fallin’-out. I always sorter hoped they’d hitch up together
sooner or later. What d’you say, Dick? Don’t you think them two’d pair
up well?</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>nodding his head approvingly</i>) A sweet, wholesome couple they’d
make.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> It’d be a good thing for Andy in more ways than one. I ain’t what
you’d call calculatin’ generally, and I b’lieve in lettin’ young folks
run their affairs to suit themselves; but there’s advantages for both o’
them in this match you can’t overlook in reason. The Atkins farm is
right next to ourn. Jined together they’d make a jim-dandy of a place,
with plenty o’ room to work in. And bein’ a widder with only a daughter,
and laid up all the time to boot, Mrs. Atkins can’t do nothin’ with the
place as it ought to be done. She needs a man, a first-class farmer, to
take hold o’ things; and Andy’s just the one.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>abruptly</i>) I don’t think Ruth loves Andy.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> You don’t? Well, maybe a woman’s eyes is sharper in such things,
but&mdash;they’re always together. And if she don’t love him now, she’ll
likely come around to it in time. (<i>As</i> <small>MRS. MAYO</small> <i>shakes her head</i>) You
seem mighty fixed in your opinion, Katey. How d’you know?</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> It’s just&mdash;what I feel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span></p><p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>a light breaking over him</i>) You don’t mean to say&mdash;(<small>MRS. MAYO</small>
<i>nods</i>. <small>MAYO</small> <i>chuckles scornfully</i>) Shucks! I’m losin’ my respect for
your eyesight, Katey. Why, Robert ain’t got no time for Ruth, ’cept as a
friend!</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>warningly</i>) Sss-h-h! (<i>The door from the yard opens, and</i>
<small>ROBERT</small> <i>enters. He is smiling happily, and humming a song to himself,
but as he comes into the room an undercurrent of nervous uneasiness
manifests itself in his bearing</i>).</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> So here you be at last! (<small>ROBERT</small> <i>comes forward and sits on</i> <small>ANDY’S</small>
<i>chair</i>. <small>MAYO</small> <i>smiles slyly at his wife</i>) What have you been doin’ all
this time&mdash;countin’ the stars to see if they all come out right and
proper?</p>

<p>ROBERT. There’s only one I’ll ever look for any more, Pa.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>reproachfully</i>) You might’ve even not wasted time lookin’ for
that one&mdash;your last night.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>as if she were speaking to a child</i>) You ought to have worn
your coat a sharp night like this, Robbie.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>disgustedly</i>) God A’mighty, Kate, you treat Robert as if he was
one year old!</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>notices</i> <small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>nervous uneasiness</i>) You look all worked
up over something, Robbie. What is it?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>swallowing hard, looks quickly from one to the other of
them&mdash;then begins determinedly</i>) Yes, there <i>is</i> something&mdash;something I
must tell you&mdash;all of you. (<i>As he begins to talk</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>enters
quietly from the rear, closing the door behind him, and setting the
lighted lantern on the floor. He remains standing by the door, his arms
folded, listening to</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>with a repressed expression of pain on his
face</i>. <small>ROBERT</small> <i>is so much taken up with what he is going to say that he
does not notice</i> <small>ANDREW’S</small> <i>presence</i>.) Something I discovered only this
evening&mdash;very beautiful and wonderful&mdash;something I did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span> take into
consideration previously because I hadn’t dared to hope that such
happiness could ever come to me. (<i>Appealingly</i>) You must all remember
that fact, won’t you?</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>frowning</i>) Let’s get to the point, son.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with a trace of defiance</i>) Well, the point is this, Pa: I’m
not going&mdash;I mean&mdash;I can’t go tomorrow with Uncle Dick&mdash;or at any future
time, either.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>with a sharp sigh of joyful relief</i>) Oh, Robbie, I’m so
glad!</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>astounded</i>) You ain’t serious, be you, Robert? (<i>Severely</i>)
Seems to me it’s a pretty late hour in the day for you to be upsettin’
all your plans so sudden!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> I asked you to remember that until this evening I didn’t know
myself. I had never dared to dream&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>irritably</i>) What is this foolishness you’re talkin’ of?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>flushing</i>) Ruth told me this evening that&mdash;she loved me. It
was after I’d confessed I loved her. I told her I hadn’t been conscious
of my love until after the trip had been arranged, and I realized it
would mean&mdash;leaving her. That was the truth. I <i>didn’t</i> know until then.
(<i>As if justifying himself to the others</i>) I hadn’t intended telling her
anything but&mdash;suddenly&mdash;I felt I must. I didn’t think it would matter,
because I was going away. And I thought she loved&mdash;someone else.
(<i>Slowly&mdash;his eyes shining</i>) And then she cried and said it was I she’d
loved all the time, but I hadn’t seen it.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>rushes over and throws her arms about him</i>) I knew it! I
was just telling your father when you came in&mdash;and, Oh, Robbie, I’m so
happy you’re not going!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>kissing her</i>) I knew you’d be glad, Ma.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>bewilderedly</i>) Well, I’ll be damned! You do beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span> all for
gettin’ folks’ minds all tangled up, Robert. And Ruth too! Whatever got
into her of a sudden? Why, I was thinkin’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>hurriedly&mdash;in a tone of warning</i>) Never mind what you were
thinking, James. It wouldn’t be any use telling us that now.
(<i>Meaningly</i>) And what you were hoping for turns out just the same
almost, doesn’t it?</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>thoughtfully&mdash;beginning to see this side of the argument</i>) Yes;
I suppose you’re right, Katey. (<i>Scratching his head in puzzlement</i>) But
how it ever come about! It do beat anything ever I heard. (<i>Finally he
gets up with a sheepish grin and walks over to</i> <small>ROBERT</small>) We’re glad you
ain’t goin’, your Ma and I, for we’d have missed you terrible, that’s
certain and sure; and we’re glad you’ve found happiness. Ruth’s a fine
girl and’ll make a good wife to you.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>much moved</i>) Thank you, Pa. (<i>He grips his father’s hand in
his</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>his face tense and drawn comes forward and holds out his hand,
forcing a smile</i>) I guess it’s my turn to offer congratulations, isn’t
it?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with a startled cry when his brother appears before him so
suddenly</i>) Andy! (<i>Confused</i>) Why&mdash;I&mdash;I didn’t see you. Were you here
when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I heard everything you said; and here’s wishing you every
happiness, you and Ruth. You both deserve the best there is.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>taking his hand</i>) Thanks, Andy, it’s fine of you to&mdash;&mdash; (<i>His
voice dies away as he sees the pain in</i> <small>ANDREW’S</small> <i>eyes</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>giving his brother’s hand a final grip</i>) Good luck<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span> to you
both! (<i>He turns away and goes back to the rear where he bends over the
lantern, fumbling with it to hide his emotion from the others</i>).</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>to the</i> <small>CAPTAIN</small>, <i>who has been too flabbergasted by</i>
<small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>decision to say a word</i>) What’s the matter, Dick? Aren’t you
going to congratulate Robbie?</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>embarrassed</i>) Of course I be! (<i>He gets to his feet and shakes</i>
<small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>hand, muttering a vague</i>) Luck to you, boy. (<i>He stands
beside</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>as if he wanted to say something more but doesn’t know
how to go about it</i>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Thanks, Uncle Dick.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> So you’re not acomin’ on the <i>Sunda</i> with me? (<i>His voice
indicates disbelief</i>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> I can’t, Uncle&mdash;not now. I wouldn’t miss it for anything else in
the world under any other circumstances. (<i>He sighs unconsciously</i>) But
you see I’ve found&mdash;a bigger dream. (<i>Then with joyous high spirits</i>) I
want you all to understand one thing&mdash;I’m not going to be a loafer on
your hands any longer. This means the beginning of a new life for me in
every way. I’m going to settle right down and take a real interest in
the farm, and do my share. I’ll prove to you, Pa, that I’m as good a
Mayo as you are&mdash;or Andy, when I want to be.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>kindly but skeptically</i>) That’s the right spirit, Robert. Ain’t
none of us doubts your willin’ness, but you ain’t never learned&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Then I’m going to start learning right away, and you’ll teach
me, won’t you?</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>mollifyingly</i>) Of course I will, boy, and be glad to, only you’d
best go easy at first.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>who has listened to this conversation in mingled<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span> consternation
and amazement</i>) You don’t mean to tell me you’re goin’ to let him stay,
do you, James?</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> Why, things bein’ as they be, Robert’s free to do as he’s a mind
to.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> <i>Let him!</i> The very idea!</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>more and more ruffled</i>) Then all I got to say is, you’re a
soft, weak-willed critter to be permittin’ a boy&mdash;and women, too&mdash;to be
layin’ your course for you wherever they damn pleases.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>slyly amused</i>) It’s just the same with me as ’twas with you,
Dick. You can’t order the tides on the seas to suit you, and I ain’t
pretendin’ I can reg’late love for young folks.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>scornfully</i>) Love! They ain’t old enough to know love when they
sight it! Love! I’m ashamed of you, Robert, to go lettin’ a little
huggin’ and kissin’ in the dark spile your chances to make a man out o’
yourself. It ain’t common sense&mdash;no siree, it ain’t&mdash;not by a hell of a
sight! (<i>He pounds the table with his fists in exasperation</i>).</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>laughing provokingly at her brother</i>) A fine one you are to
be talking about love, Dick&mdash;an old cranky bachelor like you. Goodness
sakes!</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>exasperated by their joking</i>) I’ve never been a damn fool like
most, if that’s what you’re steerin’ at.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>tauntingly</i>) Sour grapes, aren’t they, Dick? (<i>She laughs.</i>
<small>ROBERT</small> <i>and his father chuckle</i>. <small>SCOTT</small> <i>sputters with annoyance</i>) Good
gracious, Dick, you do act silly, flying into a temper over nothing.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>indignantly</i>) Nothin’! You talk as if I wasn’t concerned nohow
in this here business. Seems to me I’ve got a right to have my say.
Ain’t I made all arrangements with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span> owners and stocked up with some
special grub all on Robert’s account?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> You’ve been fine, Uncle Dick; and I appreciate it. Truly.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> ’Course; we all does, Dick.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>unplacated</i>) I’ve been countin’ sure on havin’ Robert for
company on this vige&mdash;to sorta talk to and show things to, and teach,
kinda, and I got my mind so set on havin’ him I’m goin’ to be double
lonesome this vige. (<i>He pounds on the table, attempting to cover up
this confession of weakness</i>) Darn all this silly lovin’ business,
anyway. (<i>Irritably</i>) But all this talk ain’t tellin’ me what I’m to do
with that sta’b’d cabin I fixed up. It’s all painted white, an’ a bran
new mattress on the bunk, ’n’ new sheets ’n’ blankets ’n’ things. And
Chips built in a book-case so’s Robert could take his books along&mdash;with
a slidin’ bar fixed across’t it, mind, so’s they couldn’t fall out no
matter how she rolled. (<i>With excited consternation</i>) What d’you suppose
my officers is goin’ to think when there’s no one comes aboard to occupy
that sta’b’d cabin? And the men what did the work on it&mdash;what’ll <i>they</i>
think? (<i>He shakes his finger indignantly</i>) They’re liable as not to
suspicion it was a woman I’d planned to ship along, and that she gave me
the go-by at the last moment! (<i>He wipes his perspiring brow in anguish
at this thought</i>). Gawd A’mighty! They’re only lookin’ to have the laugh
on me for something like that. They’re liable to b’lieve anything, those
fellers is!</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>with a wink)</i> Then there’s nothing to it but for you to get
right out and hunt up a wife somewheres for that spick ’n’ span cabin.
She’ll have to be a pretty one, too, to match it. (<i>He looks at his
watch with exaggerated concern</i>) You ain’t got much time to find her,
Dick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span></p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>as the others smile&mdash;sulkily</i>) You kin go to thunder, Jim Mayo!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>comes forward from where he has been standing by the door,
rear, brooding. His face is set in a look of grim determination</i>) You
needn’t worry about that spare cabin, Uncle Dick, if you’ve a mind to
take me in Robert’s place.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>turning to him quickly</i>) Andy! (<i>He sees at once the fixed
resolve in his brother’s eyes, and realizes immediately the reason for
it&mdash;in consternation</i>) Andy, you mustn’t!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> You’ve made your decision, Rob, and now I’ve made mine. You’re
out of this, remember.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>hurt by his brother’s tone</i>) But Andy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Don’t interfere, Rob&mdash;that’s all I ask. (<i>Turning to his uncle</i>)
You haven’t answered my question, Uncle Dick.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>clearing his throat, with an uneasy side glance at</i> <small>JAMES MAYO</small>
<i>who is staring at his elder son as if he thought he had suddenly gone
mad</i>) O’ course, I’d be glad to have you, Andy.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> It’s settled then. I can pack the little I want to take in a few
minutes.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> Don’t be a fool, Dick. Andy’s only joking you.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>disgruntedly</i>) It’s hard to tell who’s jokin’ and who’s not in
this house.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>firmly</i>) I’m not joking, Uncle Dick. (<i>As</i> <small>SCOTT</small> <i>looks at him
uncertainly</i>) You needn’t be afraid I’ll go back on my word.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>hurt by the insinuation he feels in</i> <small>ANDREW’S</small> <i>tone</i>) Andy!
That isn’t fair!</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>frowning</i>) Seems to me this ain’t no subject to joke over&mdash;not
for Andy.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>facing his father</i>) I agree with you, Pa, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span> tell you
again, once and for all, that I’ve made up my mind to go.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>dumbfounded&mdash;unable to doubt the determination in</i> <small>ANDREW’S</small>
<i>voice&mdash;helplessly</i>) But why, son? Why?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>evasively</i>) I’ve always wanted to go.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Andy!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>half angrily</i>) You shut up, Rob! (<i>Turning to his father
again</i>) I didn’t ever mention it because as long as Rob was going I knew
it was no use; but now Rob’s staying on here, there isn’t any reason for
me not to go.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>breathing hard</i>) No reason? Can you stand there and say that to
me, Andrew?</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>hastily&mdash;seeing the gathering storm</i>) He doesn’t mean a
word of it, James.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>making a gesture to her to keep silence</i>) Let me talk, Katey.
(<i>In a more kindly tone</i>) What’s come over you so sudden, Andy? You
know’s well as I do that it wouldn’t be fair o’ you to run off at a
moment’s notice right now when we’re up to our necks in hard work.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>avoiding his eyes</i>) Rob’ll hold his end up as soon as he
learns.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> Robert was never cut out for a farmer, and you was.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> You can easily get a man to do my work.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>restraining his anger with an effort</i>) It sounds strange to hear
you, Andy, that I always thought had good sense, talkin’ crazy like
that. (<i>Scornfully</i>) Get a man to take your place! You ain’t been
workin’ here for no hire, Andy, that you kin give me your notice to quit
like you’ve done. The farm is your’n as well as mine. You’ve always
worked on it with that understanding; and what you’re sayin’ you intend
doin’ is just skulkin’ out o’ your rightful responsibility.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>looking at the floor&mdash;simply</i>) I’m sorry, Pa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span> (<i>After a
slight pause</i>) It’s no use talking any more about it.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>in relief</i>) There! I knew Andy’d come to his senses!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Don’t get the wrong idea, Ma. I’m not backing out.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> You mean you’re goin’ in spite of&mdash;everythin’?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Yes. I’m going. I’ve got to. (<i>He looks at his father
defiantly</i>) I feel I oughn’t to miss this chance to go out into the
world and see things, and&mdash;I want to go.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>with bitter scorn</i>) So&mdash;you want to go out into the world and
see thin’s! (<i>His voice raised and quivering with anger</i>) I never
thought I’d live to see the day when a son o’ mine ’d look me in the
face and tell a bare-faced lie! (<i>Bursting out</i>) You’re a liar, Andy
Mayo, and a mean one to boot!</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> James!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Pa!</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> Steady there, Jim!</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>waving their protests aside</i>) He is and he knows it.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>his face flushed</i>) I won’t argue with you, Pa. You can think
as badly of me as you like.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>shaking his finger at</i> <small>ANDY</small>, <i>in a cold rage</i>) You know I’m
speakin’ truth&mdash;that’s why you’re afraid to argy! You lie when you say
you want to go ’way&mdash;and see thin’s! You ain’t got no likin’ in the
world to go. I’ve watched you grow up, and I know your ways, and they’re
my ways. You’re runnin’ against your own nature, and you’re goin’ to be
a’mighty sorry for it if you do. ’S if I didn’t know your real reason
for runnin’ away! And runnin’ away’s the only words to fit it. You’re
runnin’ away ’cause you’re put out and riled ’cause your own brother’s
got Ruth ’stead o’ you, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>his face crimson&mdash;tensely</i>) Stop, Pa! I won’t stand hearing
that&mdash;not even from you!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span></p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>rushing to</i> <small>ANDY</small> <i>and putting her arms about him
protectingly</i>) Don’t mind him, Andy dear. He don’t mean a word he’s
saying! (<small>ROBERT</small> <i>stands rigidly, his hands clenched, his face contracted
by pain</i>. <small>SCOTT</small> <i>sits dumbfounded and open-mouthed</i>. <small>ANDREW</small> <i>soothes his
mother who is on the verge of tears</i>).</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>in angry triumph</i>) It’s the truth, Andy Mayo! And you ought to
be bowed in shame to think of it!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>protestingly</i>) Pa!</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>coming from</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>to his father; puts her hands on his
shoulders as though to try and push him back in the chair from which he
has risen</i>) Won’t you be still, James? Please won’t you?</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>looking at</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>over his wife’s shoulder&mdash;stubbornly</i>) The
truth&mdash;God’s truth!</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> Sh-h-h! (<i>She tries to put a finger across his lips, but he
twists his head away</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>who has regained control over himself</i>) You’re wrong, Pa, it
isn’t truth. (<i>With defiant assertiveness</i>) I don’t love Ruth. I never
loved her, and the thought of such a thing never entered my head.</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>with an angry snort of disbelief</i>) Hump! You’re pilin’ lie on
lie!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>losing his temper&mdash;bitterly</i>) I suppose it’d be hard for you
to explain anyone’s wanting to leave this blessed farm except for some
outside reason like that. But I’m sick and tired of it&mdash;whether you want
to believe me or not&mdash;and that’s why I’m glad to get a chance to move
on.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Andy! Don’t! You’re only making it worse.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>sulkily</i>) I don’t care. I’ve done my share of work here. I’ve
earned my right to quit when I want to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span> (<i>Suddenly overcome with anger
and grief; with rising intensity</i>) I’m sick and tired of the whole damn
business. I hate the farm and every inch of ground in it. I’m sick of
digging in the dirt and sweating in the sun like a slave without getting
a word of thanks for it. (<i>Tears of rage starting to his
eyes&mdash;hoarsely</i>) I’m through, through for good and all; and if Uncle
Dick won’t take me on his ship, I’ll find another. I’ll get away
somewhere, somehow.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>in a frightened voice</i>) Don’t you answer him, James. He
doesn’t know what he’s saying. Don’t say a word to him ’til he’s in his
right senses again. Please James, don’t&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>pushes her away from him; his face is drawn and pale with the
violence of his passion. He glares at</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>as if he hated him</i>) You
dare to&mdash;you dare to speak like that to me? You talk like that ’bout
this farm&mdash;the Mayo farm&mdash;where you was born&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He clenches
his fist above his head and advances threateningly on</i> <small>ANDREW</small>) You
damned whelp!</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>with a shriek</i>) James! (<i>She covers her face with her hands
and sinks weakly into</i> <small>MAYO’S</small> <i>chair</i>. <small>ANDREW</small> <i>remains standing
motionless, his face pale and set</i>).</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>starting to his feet and stretching his arms across the table
toward</i> <small>MAYO</small>) Easy there, Jim!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>throwing himself between father and brother</i>) Stop! Are you
mad?</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>grabs</i> <small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>arm and pushes him aside&mdash;then stands for a
moment gasping for breath before</i> <small>ANDREW</small>. <i>He points to the door with a
shaking finger</i>) Yes&mdash;go!&mdash;go!&mdash;You’re no son o’ mine&mdash;no son o’ mine!
You can go to hell if<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span> you want to! Don’t let me find you here&mdash;in the
mornin’&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;I’ll <i>throw</i> you out!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Pa! For God’s sake! (<small>MRS. MAYO</small> <i>bursts into noisy sobbing</i>).</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>he gulps convulsively and glares at</i> <small>ANDREW</small>) You go&mdash;tomorrow
mornin’&mdash;and by God&mdash;don’t come back&mdash;don’t dare come back&mdash;by God, not
while I’m livin’&mdash;or I’ll&mdash;I’ll&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He shakes over his muttered threat
and strides toward the door rear, right</i>).</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>rising and throwing her arms around him&mdash;hysterically</i>)
James! James! Where are you going?</p>

<p><small>MAYO.</small> (<i>incoherently</i>) I’m goin’&mdash;to bed, Katey. It’s late, Katey&mdash;it’s
late. (<i>He goes out</i>).</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>following him, pleading hysterically</i>) James! Take back
what you’ve said to Andy. James! (<i>She follows him out.</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>and
the</i> <small>CAPTAIN</small> <i>stare after them with horrified eyes</i>. <small>ANDREW</small> <i>stands
rigidly looking straight in front of him, his fists clenched at his
sides</i>).</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>the first to find his voice&mdash;with an explosive sigh</i>) Well, if
he ain’t the devil himself when he’s roused! You oughtn’t to have talked
to him that way, Andy ’bout the damn farm, knowin’ how touchy he is
about it. (<i>With another sigh</i>) Well, you won’t mind what he’s said in
anger. He’ll be sorry for it when he’s calmed down a bit.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>in a dead voice</i>) You don’t know him. (<i>Defiantly</i>) What’s
said is said and can’t be unsaid; and I’ve chosen.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with violent protest</i>) Andy! You can’t go! This is all so
stupid&mdash;and terrible!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>coldly</i>) I’ll talk to you in a minute, Rob. (<i>Crushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span> by his
brother’s attitude</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>sinks down into a chair, holding his head in
his hands</i>).</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>comes and slaps</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>on the back</i>) I’m damned glad you’re
shippin’ on, Andy. I like your spirit, and the way you spoke up to him.
(<i>Lowering his voice to a cautious whisper</i>) The sea’s the place for a
young feller like you that isn’t half dead ’n’ alive. (<i>He gives</i> <small>ANDY</small>
<i>a final approving slap</i>) You ’n’ me’ll get along like twins, see if we
don’t. I’m goin’ aloft to turn in. Don’t forget to pack your dunnage.
And git some sleep, if you kin. We’ll want to sneak out extra early
b’fore they’re up. It’ll do away with more argyments. Robert can drive
us down to the town, and bring back the team. (<i>He goes to the door in
the rear, left</i>) Well, good night.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Good night. (<small>SCOTT</small> <i>goes out. The two brothers remain silent for
a moment. Then</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>comes over to his brother and puts a hand on his
back. He speaks in a low voice, full of feeling</i>) Buck up, Rob. It ain’t
any use crying over spilt milk; and it’ll all turn out for the
best&mdash;let’s hope. It couldn’t be helped&mdash;what’s happened.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>wildly</i>) But it’s a lie, Andy, a lie!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Of course it’s a lie. You know it and I know it,&mdash;but that’s all
ought to know it.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Pa’ll never forgive you. Oh, the whole affair is so
senseless&mdash;and tragic. Why did you think you must go away?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> You know better than to ask that. You know why. (<i>Fiercely</i>) I
can wish you and Ruth all the good luck in the world, and I do, and I
mean it; but you can’t expect me to stay around here and watch you two
together, day after day&mdash;and me alone. I couldn’t stand it&mdash;not after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span>all the plans I’d made to happen on this place thinking&mdash;&mdash; (<i>his voice
breaks</i>) thinking she cared for me.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>putting a hand on his brother’s arm</i>) God! It’s horrible! I
feel so guilty&mdash;to think that I should be the cause of your suffering,
after we’ve been such pals all our lives. If I could have foreseen
what’d happen, I swear to you I’d have never said a word to Ruth. I
swear I wouldn’t have, Andy!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I know you wouldn’t; and that would’ve been worse, for Ruth
would’ve suffered then. (<i>He pats his brother’s shoulder</i>) It’s best as
it is. It had to be, and I’ve got to stand the gaff, that’s all. Pa’ll
see how I felt&mdash;after a time. (<i>As</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>shakes his head</i>)&mdash;and if he
don’t&mdash;well, it can’t be helped.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> But think of Ma! God, Andy, you can’t go! You can’t!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>fiercely</i>) I’ve got to go&mdash;to get away! I’ve got to, I tell
you. I’d go crazy here, bein’ reminded every second of the day what a
fool I’d made of myself. I’ve got to get away and try and forget, if I
can. And I’d hate the farm if I stayed, hate it for bringin’ things
back. I couldn’t take interest in the work any more, work with no
purpose in sight. Can’t you see what a hell it’d be? You love her too,
Rob. Put yourself in my place, and remember I haven’t stopped loving
her, and couldn’t if I was to stay. Would that be fair to you or to her?
Put yourself in my place. (<i>He shakes his brother fiercely by the
shoulder</i>) What’d you do then? Tell me the truth! You love her. What’d
you do?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>chokingly</i>) I’d&mdash;I’d go, Andy! (<i>He buries his face in his
hands with a shuddering sob</i>) God!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>seeming to relax suddenly all over his body&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span> a low, steady
voice</i>) Then you know why I got to go; and there’s nothing more to be
said.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>in a frenzy of rebellion</i>) Why did this have to happen to us?
It’s damnable! (<i>He looks about him wildly, as if his vengeance were
seeking the responsible fate</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>soothingly&mdash;again putting his hands on his brother’s
shoulder</i>) It’s no use fussing any more, Rob. It’s done. (<i>Forcing a
smile</i>) I guess Ruth’s got a right to have who she likes. She made a
good choice&mdash;and God bless her for it!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Andy! Oh, I wish I could tell you half I feel of how fine you
are!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>interrupting him quickly</i>) Shut up! Let’s go to bed. I’ve got
to be up long before sun-up. You, too, if you’re going to drive us down.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Yes. Yes.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>turning down the lamp</i>) And I’ve got to pack yet. (<i>He yawns
with utter weariness</i>) I’m as tired as if I’d been plowing twenty-four
hours at a stretch. (<i>Dully</i>) I feel&mdash;dead. (<small>ROBERT</small> <i>covers his face
again with his hands</i>. <small>ANDREW</small> <i>shakes his head as if to get rid of his
thoughts, and continues with a poor attempt at cheery briskness</i>) I’m
going to douse the light. Come on. (<i>He slaps his brother on the back.</i>
<small>ROBERT</small> <i>does not move</i>. <small>ANDREW</small> <i>bends over and blows out the lamp. His
voice comes from the darkness</i>) Don’t sit there mourning, Rob. It’ll all
come out in the wash. Come on and get some sleep. Everything’ll turn out
all right in the end. (<small>ROBERT</small> <i>can be heard stumbling to his feet, and
the dark figures of the two brothers can be seen groping their way
toward the doorway in the rear as</i></p>

<h2>BEYOND THE HORIZON<br /><br />
<a name="ACT_TWO" id="ACT_TWO"></a>ACT TWO</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene One</span></h3>

<p><i>Same as Act One, Scene Two. Sitting room of the farm house about half
past twelve in the afternoon of a hot, sun-baked day in mid-summer,
three years later. All the windows are open, but no breeze stirs the
soiled white curtains. A patched screen door is in the rear. Through it
the yard can be seen, its small stretch of lawn divided by the dirt path
leading to the door from the gate in the white picket fence which
borders the road.</i></p>

<p><i>The room has changed, not so much in its outward appearance as in its
general atmosphere. Little significant details give evidence of
carelessness, of inefficiency, of an industry gone to seed. The chairs
appear shabby from lack of paint; the table cover is spotted and askew;
holes show in the curtains; a child’s doll, with one arm gone, lies
under the table; a hoe stands in a corner; a man’s coat is flung on the
couch in the rear; the desk is cluttered up with odds and ends; a number
of books are piled carelessly on the sideboard. The noon enervation of
the sultry, scorching day seems to have penetrated indoors, causing even
inanimate objects to wear an aspect of despondent exhaustion.</i></p>

<p><i>A place is set at the end of the table, left, for someone’s dinner.
Through the open door to the kitchen comes the clatter of dishes being
washed, interrupted at intervals by a woman’s irritated voice and the
peevish whining of a child.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span></p>

<p><i>At the rise of the curtain</i> <small>MRS. MAYO</small> <i>and</i> <small>MRS. ATKINS</small> <i>are discovered
sitting facing each other</i>, <small>MRS. MAYO</small> <i>to the rear</i> <small>MRS. ATKINS</small> <i>to the
right of the table</i>. <small>MRS. MAYO’S</small> <i>face has lost all character,
disintegrated, become a weak mask wearing a helpless, doleful expression
of being constantly on the verge of comfortless tears. She speaks in an
uncertain voice, without assertiveness, as if all power of willing had
deserted her.</i> <small>MRS. ATKINS</small> <i>is in her wheel chair. She is a thin,
pale-faced, unintelligent looking woman of about forty-eight, with hard,
bright eyes. A victim of partial paralysis for many years, condemned to
be pushed from day to day of her life in a wheel chair, she has
developed the selfish, irritable nature of the chronic invalid. Both
women are dressed in black.</i> <small>MRS. ATKINS</small> <i>knits nervously as she talks.
A ball of unused yarn, with needles stuck through it, lies on the table
before</i> <small>MRS. MAYO</small>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>with a disapproving glance at the place set on the
table</i>) Robert’s late for his dinner again, as usual. I don’t see why
Ruth puts up with it, and I’ve told her so. Many’s the time I’ve said to
her “It’s about time you put a stop to his nonsense. Does he suppose
you’re runnin’ a hotel&mdash;with no one to help with things?” But she don’t
pay no attention. She’s as bad as he is, a’most&mdash;thinks she knows better
than an old, sick body like me.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>dully</i>) Robbie’s always late for things. He can’t help it,
Sarah.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>with a snort</i>) Can’t help it! How you do go on, Kate,
findin’ excuses for him! Anybody can help anything they’ve a mind to&mdash;as
long as they’ve got health, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span> ain’t rendered helpless like me&mdash;(<i>She
adds as a pious afterthought</i>)&mdash;through the will of God.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> Robbie can’t.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> Can’t! It do make me mad, Kate Mayo, to see folks that God
gave all the use of their limbs to potterin’ round and wastin’ time
doin’ everything the wrong way&mdash;and me powerless to help and at their
mercy, you might say. And it ain’t that I haven’t pointed the right way
to ’em. I’ve talked to Robert thousands of times and told him how things
ought to be done. You know that, Kate Mayo. But d’you s’pose he takes
any notice of what I say? Or Ruth, either&mdash;my own daughter? No, they
think I’m a crazy, cranky old woman, half dead a’ready, and the sooner
I’m in the grave and out o’ their way the better it’d suit them.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> You mustn’t talk that way, Sarah. They’re not as wicked as
that. And you’ve got years and years before you.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> You’re like the rest, Kate. You don’t know how near the end
I am. Well, at least I can go to my eternal rest with a clear
conscience. I’ve done all a body could do to avert ruin from this house.
On their heads be it!</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>with hopeless indifference</i>) Things might be worse. Robert
never had any experience in farming. You can’t expect him to learn in a
day.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>snappily</i>) He’s had three years to learn, and he’s
gettin’ worse ’stead of better. Not on’y your place but mine too is
driftin’ to rack and ruin, and I can’t do nothin’ to prevent.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>with a spark of assertiveness</i>) You can’t say but Robbie
works hard, Sarah.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span></p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> What good’s workin’ hard if it don’t accomplish anythin’,
I’d like to know?</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> Robbie’s had bad luck against him.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> Say what you’ve a mind to, Kate, the proof of the puddin’s
in the eatin’; and you can’t deny that things have been goin’ from bad
to worse ever since your husband died two years back.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>wiping tears from her eyes with her handkerchief</i>) It was
God’s will that he should be taken.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>triumphantly</i>) It was God’s punishment on James Mayo for
the blasphemin’ and denyin’ of God he done all his sinful life! (<small>MRS.
MAYO</small> <i>begins to weep softly</i>) There, Kate, I shouldn’t be remindin’ you,
I know. He’s at peace, poor man, and forgiven, let’s pray.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>wiping her eyes&mdash;simply</i>) James was a good man.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>ignoring this remark</i>) What I was sayin’ was that since
Robert’s been in charge things’ve been goin’ down hill steady. You don’t
know <i>how</i> bad they are. Robert don’t let on to you what’s happenin’;
and you’d never see it yourself if ’twas under your nose. But, thank the
Lord, Ruth still comes to me once in a while for advice when she’s
worried near out of her senses by his goin’s-on. Do you know what she
told me last night? But I forgot, she said not to tell you&mdash;still I
think you’ve got a right to know, and it’s my duty not to let such
things go on behind your back.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>wearily</i>) You can tell me if you want to.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>bending over toward her&mdash;in a low voice</i>) Ruth was almost
crazy about it. Robert told her he’d have to mortgage the farm&mdash;said he
didn’t know how he’d pull through<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span> ’til harvest without it, and he can’t
get money any other way. (<i>She straightens up&mdash;indignantly</i>) Now what do
you think of your Robert?</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>resignedly</i>) If it has to be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> You don’t mean to say you’re goin’ to sign away your farm,
Kate Mayo&mdash;after me warnin’ you?</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small>&mdash;I’ll do what Robbie says is needful.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>holding up her hands</i>) Well, of all the foolishness!&mdash;&mdash;
well, it’s your farm, not mine, and I’ve nothin’ more to say.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> Maybe Robbie’ll manage till Andy gets back and sees to
things. It can’t be long now.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>with keen interest</i>) Ruth says Andy ought to turn up any
day. When does Robert figger he’ll get here?</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> He says he can’t calculate exactly on account o’ the <i>Sunda</i>
being a sail boat. Last letter he got was from England, the day they
were sailing for home. That was over a month ago, and Robbie thinks
they’re overdue now.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> We can give praise to God then that he’ll be back in the
nick o’ time. He ought to be tired of travelin’ and anxious to get home
and settle down to work again.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> Andy <i>has</i> been working. He’s head officer on Dick’s boat, he
wrote Robbie. You know that.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> That foolin’ on ships is all right for a spell, but he must
be right sick of it by this.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>musingly</i>) I wonder if he’s changed much. He used to be so
fine-looking and strong. (<i>With a sigh</i>) Three years! It seems more like
three hundred. (<i>Her eyes filling&mdash;piteously</i>) Oh, if James could only
have lived ’til he came back&mdash;and forgiven him!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span></p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> He never would have&mdash;not James Mayo! Didn’t he keep his
heart hardened against him till the last in spite of all you and Robert
did to soften him?</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>with a feeble flash of anger</i>) Don’t you dare say that!
(<i>Brokenly</i>) Oh, I know deep down in his heart he forgave Andy, though
he was too stubborn ever to own up to it. It was that brought on his
death&mdash;breaking his heart just on account of his stubborn pride. (<i>She
wipes her eyes with her handkerchief and sobs</i>).</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>piously</i>) It was the will of God. (<i>The whining crying of
the child sounds from the kitchen.</i> <small>MRS. ATKINS</small> <i>frowns irritably</i>) Drat
that young one! Seems as if she cries all the time on purpose to set a
body’s nerves on edge.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>wiping her eyes</i>) It’s the heat upsets her. Mary doesn’t
feel any too well these days, poor little child!</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> She gets it right from her Pa&mdash;bein’ sickly all the time.
You can’t deny Robert was always ailin’ as a child. (<i>She sighs
heavily</i>) It was a crazy mistake for them two to get married. I argyed
against it at the time, but Ruth was so spelled with Robert’s wild
poetry notions she wouldn’t listen to sense. Andy was the one would have
been the match for her.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> I’ve often thought since it might have been better the other
way. But Ruth and Robbie seem happy enough together.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> At any rate it was God’s work&mdash;and His will be done. (<i>The
two women sit in silence for a moment.</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>enters from the kitchen,
carrying in her arms her two year old daughter</i>, <small>MARY</small>, <i>a pretty but
sickly and ænemic looking child with a tear-stained face</i>. <small>RUTH</small> <i>has
aged appreciably. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span> face has lost its youth and freshness. There is a
trace in her expression of something hard and spiteful. She sits in the
rocker in front of the table and sighs wearily. She wears a gingham
dress with a soiled apron tied around her waist</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Land sakes, if this isn’t a scorcher! That kitchen’s like a
furnace. Phew! (<i>She pushes the damp hair back from her forehead</i>).</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> Why didn’t you call me to help with the dishes?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>shortly</i>) No. The heat in there’d kill you.</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>sees the doll under the table and struggles on her mother’s
lap</i>) Dolly, Mama! Dolly!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>pulling her back</i>) It’s time for your nap. You can’t play with
Dolly now.</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>commencing to cry whiningly</i>) Dolly!</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>irritably</i>) Can’t you keep that child still? Her racket’s
enough to split a body’s ears. Put her down and let her play with the
doll if it’ll quiet her.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>lifting</i> <small>MARY</small> <i>to the floor</i>) There! I hope you’ll be satisfied
and keep still. (<small>MARY</small> <i>sits down on the floor before the table and plays
with the doll in silence</i>. <small>RUTH</small> <i>glances at the place set on the table</i>)
It’s a wonder Rob wouldn’t try to get to meals on time once in a while.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>dully</i>) Something must have gone wrong again.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>wearily</i>) I s’pose so. Something’s always going wrong these
days, it looks like.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>snappily</i>) It wouldn’t if you possessed a bit of spunk.
The idea of you permittin’ him to come in to meals at all hours&mdash;and you
doin’ the work! I never heard of such a thin’. You’re too easy goin’,
that’s the trouble.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span></p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Do stop your nagging at me, Ma! I’m sick of hearing you. I’ll do
as I please about it; and thank you for not interfering. (<i>She wipes her
moist forehead&mdash;wearily</i>) Phew! It’s too hot to argue. Let’s talk of
something pleasant. (<i>Curiously</i>) Didn’t I hear you speaking about Andy
a while ago?</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> We were wondering when he’d get home.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>brightening</i>) Rob says any day now he’s liable to drop in and
surprise us&mdash;him and the Captain. It’ll certainly look natural to see
him around the farm again.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> Let’s hope the farm’ll look more natural, too, when he’s
had a hand at it. The way thin’s are now!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>irritably</i>) Will you stop harping on that, Ma? We all know
things aren’t as they might be. What’s the good of your complaining all
the time?</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> There, Kate Mayo! Ain’t that just what I told you? I can’t
say a word of advice to my own daughter even, she’s that stubborn and
self-willed.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>putting her hands over her ears&mdash;in exasperation</i>) For goodness
sakes, Ma!</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> (<i>dully</i>) Never mind. Andy’ll fix everything when he comes.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>hopefully</i>) Oh, yes, I know he will. He always did know just the
right thing ought to be done. (<i>With weary vexation</i>) It’s a shame for
him to come home and have to start in with things in such a topsy-turvy.</p>

<p><small>MRS. MAYO.</small> Andy’ll manage.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>sighing</i>) I s’pose it isn’t Rob’s fault things go wrong with
him.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>scornfully</i>) Hump! (<i>She fans herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span> nervously</i>) Land
o’ Goshen, but it’s bakin’ in here! Let’s go out in under the trees in
back where there’s a breath of fresh air. Come, Kate. (<small>MRS. MAYO</small> <i>gets
up obediently and starts to wheel the invalid’s chair toward the screen
door</i>) You better come too, Ruth. It’ll do you good. Learn him a lesson
and let him get his own dinner. Don’t be such a fool.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>going and holding the screen door open for them&mdash;listlessly</i>) He
wouldn’t mind. He doesn’t eat much. But I can’t go anyway. I’ve got to
put baby to bed.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> Let’s go, Kate. I’m boilin’ in here. (<small>MRS. MAYO</small> <i>wheels her
out and off left</i>. <small>RUTH</small> <i>comes back and sits down in her chair</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>mechanically</i>) Come and let me take off your shoes and
stockings, Mary, that’s a good girl. You’ve got to take your nap now.
(<i>The child continues to play as if she hadn’t heard, absorbed in her
doll. An eager expression comes over</i> <small>RUTH’S</small> <i>tired face. She glances
toward the door furtively&mdash;then gets up and goes to the desk. Her
movements indicate a guilty fear of discovery. She takes a letter from a
pigeon-hole and retreats swiftly to her chair with it. She opens the
envelope and reads the letter with great interest, a flush of excitement
coming to her cheeks.</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>walks up the path and opens the screen
door quietly and comes into the room. He, too, has aged. His shoulders
are stooped as if under too great a burden. His eyes are dull and
lifeless, his face burned by the sun and unshaven for days. Streaks of
sweat have smudged the layer of dust on his cheeks. His lips drawn down
at the corners, give him a hopeless, resigned expression. The three
years have accentuated the weakness of his mouth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span> chin. He is
dressed in overalls, laced boots, and a flannel shirt open at the
neck</i>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>throwing his hat over an the sofa&mdash;with a great sigh of
exhaustion</i>) Phew! The sun’s hot today! (<small>RUTH</small> <i>is startled. At first she
makes an instinctive motion as if to hide the letter in her bosom. She
immediately thinks better of this and sits with the letter in her hands
looking at him with defiant eyes. He bends down and kisses her</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>feeling of her cheek&mdash;irritably</i>) Why don’t you shave? You look
awful.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>indifferently</i>) I forgot&mdash;and it’s too much trouble this
weather.</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>throwing aside her doll, runs to him with a happy cry</i>) Dada!
Dada!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>swinging her up above his head&mdash;lovingly</i>) And how’s this
little girl of mine this hot day, eh?</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>screeching happily</i>) Dada! Dada!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>in annoyance</i>) Don’t do that to her! You know it’s time for her
nap and you’ll get her all waked up; then I’ll be the one that’ll have
to sit beside her till she falls asleep.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>sitting down in the chair on the left of table and cuddling</i>
<small>MARY</small> <i>on his lap</i>) You needn’t bother. I’ll put her to bed.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>shortly</i>) You’ve got to get back to your work, I s’pose.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with a sigh</i>) Yes, I was forgetting. (<i>He glances at the open
letter on</i> <small>RUTH’S</small> <i>lap</i>) Reading Andy’s letter again? I should think
you’d know it by heart by this time.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>coloring as if she’d been accused of something<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span>&mdash;defiantly</i>)
I’ve got a right to read it, haven’t I? He says it’s meant for all of
us.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with a trace of irritation</i>) Right? Don’t be so silly. There’s
no question of right. I was only saying that you must know all that’s in
it after so many readings.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Well, I don’t. (<i>She puts the letter on the table and gets wearily
to her feet</i>) I s’pose you’ll be wanting your dinner now.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>listlessly</i>) I don’t care. I’m not hungry.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> And here I been keeping it hot for you!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>irritably</i>) Oh, all right then. Bring it in and I’ll try to
eat.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> I’ve got to get her to bed first. (<i>She goes to lift</i> <small>MARY</small> <i>off
his lap</i>) Come, dear. It’s after time and you can hardly keep your eyes
open now.</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>crying</i>) No, no! (<i>Appealing to her father</i>) Dada! No!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>accusingly to</i> <small>ROBERT</small>) There! Now see what you’ve done! I told
you not to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>shortly</i>) Let her alone, then. She’s all right where she is.
She’ll fall asleep on my lap in a minute if you’ll stop bothering her.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>hotly</i>) She’ll not do any such thing! She’s got to learn to mind
me! (<i>Shaking her finger at</i> <small>MARY</small>) You naughty child! Will you come with
Mama when she tells you for your own good?</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>clinging to her father</i>) No, Dada!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>losing her temper</i>) A good spanking’s what you need, my young
lady&mdash;and you’ll get one from me if you don’t mind better, d’you hear?
(<small>MARY</small> <i>starts to whimper frightenedly</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with sudden anger</i>) Leave her alone! How often have I told you
not to threaten her with whipping? I won’t have it. (<i>Soothing the
wailing</i> <small>MARY</small>) There! There, little girl! Baby mustn’t cry. Dada won’t
like you if you do. Dada’ll hold you and you must promise to go to sleep
like a good little girl. Will you when Dada asks you?</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>cuddling up to him</i>) Yes, Dada.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>looking at them, her pale face set and drawn</i>) A fine one you
are to be telling folks how to do things! (<i>She bites her lips. Husband
and wife look into each other’s eyes with something akin to hatred in
their expressions; then</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>turns away with a shrug of affected
indifference</i>) All right, take care of her then, if you think it’s so
easy. (<i>She walks away into the kitchen</i>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>smoothing</i> <small>MARY’S</small> <i>hair&mdash;tenderly</i>) We’ll show Mama you’re a
good little girl, won’t we?</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>crooning drowsily</i>) Dada, Dada.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Let’s see: Does your mother take off your shoes and stockings
before your nap?</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>nodding with half-shut eyes</i>) Yes, Dada.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>taking of her shoes and stockings</i>) We’ll show Mama we know
how to do those things, won’t we? There’s one old shoe off&mdash;and there’s
the other old shoe&mdash;and here’s one old stocking&mdash;and there’s the other
old stocking. There we are, all nice and cool and comfy. (<i>He bends down
and kisses her</i>) And now will you promise to go right to sleep if Dada
takes you to bed? (<small>MARY</small> <i>nods sleepily</i>) That’s the good little girl.
(<i>He gathers her up in his arms carefully and carries her into the
bedroom. His voice can be heard faintly as he lulls the child to sleep.</i>
<small>RUTH</small> <i>comes out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span> kitchen and gets the plate from the table. She
hears the voice from the room and tiptoes to the door to look in. Then
she starts for the kitchen but stands for a moment thinking, a look of
ill-concealed jealousy on her face. At a noise from inside she hurriedly
disappears into the kitchen. A moment later</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>re-enters. He comes
forward and picks up the shoes and stockings which he shoves carelessly
under the table. Then, seeing no one about, he goes to the sideboard and
selects a book. Coming back to his chair, he sits down and immediately
becomes absorbed in reading.</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>returns from the kitchen bringing
his plate heaped with food, and a cup of tea. She sets those before him
and sits down in her former place.</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>continues to read, oblivious
to the food on the table</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>after watching him irritably for a moment</i>) For heaven’s sakes,
put down that old book! Don’t you see your dinner’s getting cold?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>closing his book</i>) Excuse me, Ruth. I didn’t notice. (<i>He
picks up his knife and fork and begins to eat gingerly, without
appetite</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> I should think you might have some feeling for me, Rob, and not
always be late for meals. If you think it’s fun sweltering in that oven
of a kitchen to keep things warm for you, you’re mistaken.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> I’m sorry, Ruth, really I am. Something crops up every day to
delay me. I mean to be here on time.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>with a sigh</i>) Mean-tos don’t count.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with a conciliating smile</i>) Then punish me, Ruth. Let the food
get cold and don’t bother about me.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> I’d have to wait just the same to wash up after you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> But I can wash up.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> A nice mess there’d be then!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with an attempt at lightness</i>) The food is lucky to be able to
get cold this weather. (<i>As</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>doesn’t answer or smile he opens his
book and resumes his reading, forcing himself to take a mouthful of food
every now and then</i>. <small>RUTH</small> <i>stares at him in annoyance</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> And besides, you’ve got your own work that’s got to be done.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>absent-mindedly, without taking his eyes from the book</i>) Yes,
of course.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>spitefully</i>) Work you’ll never get done by reading books all the
time.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>shutting the book with a snap</i>) Why do you persist in nagging
at me for getting pleasure out of reading? Is it because&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He checks
himself abruptly</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>coloring</i>) Because I’m too stupid to understand them, I s’pose
you were going to say.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>shame-facedly</i>) No&mdash;no. (<i>In exasperation</i>) Why do you goad me
into saying things I don’t mean? Haven’t I got my share of troubles
trying to work this cursed farm without your adding to them? You know
how hard I’ve tried to keep things going in spite of bad luck&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>scornfully</i>) Bad luck!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> And my own very apparent unfitness for the job, I was going to
add; but you can’t deny there’s been bad luck to it, too. Why don’t you
take things into consideration? Why can’t we pull together? We used to.
I know it’s hard on you also. Then why can’t we help each other instead
of hindering?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span></p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>sullenly</i>) I do the best I know how.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>gets up and puts his hand on her shoulder</i>) I know you do. But
let’s both of us try to do better. We can both improve. Say a word of
encouragement once in a while when things go wrong, even if it is my
fault. You know the odds I’ve been up against since Pa died. I’m not a
farmer. I’ve never claimed to be one. But there’s nothing else I can do
under the circumstances, and I’ve got to pull things through somehow.
With your help, I can do it. With you against me&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He shrugs his
shoulders. There is a pause. Then he bends down and kisses her
hair&mdash;with an attempt at cheerfulness</i>) So you promise that; and I’ll
promise to be here when the clock strikes&mdash;and anything else you tell me
to. Is it a bargain?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) I s’pose so. (<i>They are interrupted by the sound of a
loud knock at the kitchen door</i>) There’s someone at the kitchen door.
(<i>She hurries out. A moment later she reappears</i>) It’s Ben.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>frowning</i>) What’s the trouble now, I wonder? (In a loud voice)
Come on in here, Ben. (<small>BEN</small> <i>slouches in from the kitchen. He is a
hulking, awkward young fellow with a heavy, stupid face and shifty,
cunning eyes. He is dressed in overalls, boots, etc., and wears a
broad-brimmed hat of coarse straw pushed back on his head</i>) Well, Ben,
what’s the matter?</p>

<p><small>BEN.</small> (<i>drawlingly</i>) The mowin’ machine’s bust.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Why, that can’t be. The man fixed it only last week.</p>

<p><small>BEN.</small> It’s bust just the same.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> And can’t you fix it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span></p>

<p><small>BEN.</small> No. Don’t know what’s the matter with the goll-darned thing.
’Twon’t work, anyhow.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>getting up and going for his hat</i>) Wait a minute and I’ll go
look it over. There can’t be much the matter with it.</p>

<p><small>BEN.</small> (<i>impudently</i>) Don’t make no diff’rence t’ me whether there be or
not. I’m quittin’.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>anxiously</i>) You don’t mean you’re throwing up your job here?</p>

<p><small>BEN.</small> That’s what! My month’s up today and I want what’s owin’ t’ me.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> But why are you quitting now, Ben, when you know I’ve so much
work on hand? I’ll have a hard time getting another man at such short
notice.</p>

<p><small>BEN.</small> That’s for you to figger. I’m quittin’.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> But what’s your reason? You haven’t any complaint to make about
the way you’ve been treated, have you?</p>

<p><small>BEN.</small> No. ’Tain’t that. (<i>Shaking his finger</i>) Look-a-here. I’m sick o’
being made fun at, that’s what; an’ I got a job up to Timms’ place; an’
I’m quittin’ here.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Being made fun of? I don’t understand you. Who’s making fun of
you?</p>

<p><small>BEN.</small> They all do. When I drive down with the milk in the mornin’ they
all laughs and jokes at me&mdash;that boy up to Harris’ and the new feller up
to Slocum’s, and Bill Evans down to Meade’s, and all the rest on ’em.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> That’s a queer reason for leaving me flat. Won’t they laugh at
you just the same when you’re working for Timms?</p>

<p><small>BEN.</small> They wouldn’t dare to. Timms is the best farm here<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span>abouts. They was
laughin’ at me for workin’ for <i>you</i>, that’s what! “How’re things up to
the Mayo place?” they hollers every mornin’. “What’s Robert doin’
now&mdash;pasturin’ the cattle in the cornlot? Is he seasonin’ his hay with
rain this year, same as last?” they shouts. “Or is he inventin’ some
’lectrical milkin’ engine to fool them dry cows o’ his into givin’ hard
cider?” (<i>Very much ruffled</i>) That’s like they talks; and I ain’t goin’
to put up with it no longer. Everyone’s always knowed me as a
first-class hand hereabouts, and I ain’t wantin’ ’em to get no different
notion. So I’m quittin’ you. And I wants what’s comin’ to me.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>coldly</i>) Oh, if that’s the case, you can go to the devil.
You’ll get your money tomorrow when I get back from town&mdash;not before!</p>

<p><small>BEN.</small> (<i>turning to doorway to kitchen</i>) That suits me. (<i>As he goes out
he speaks back over his shoulder</i>) And see that I do get it, or there’ll
be trouble. (<i>He disappears and the slamming of the kitchen door is
heard</i>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>as</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>comes from where she has been standing by the
doorway and sits down dejectedly in her old place</i>) The stupid damn
fool! And now what about the haying? That’s an example of what I’m up
against. No one can say I’m responsible for that.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> He wouldn’t dare act that way with anyone else! (<i>Spitefully, with
a glance at</i> <small>ANDREW’S</small> <i>letter on the table</i>) It’s lucky Andy’s coming
back.</p>

<p>ROBERT. (<i>without resentment</i>) Yes, Andy’ll see the right thing to do in
a jiffy. (<i>With an affectionate smile</i>) I wonder if the old chump’s
changed much? He doesn’t seem to from his letters, does he? (<i>Shaking
his head</i>) But just the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span> I doubt if he’ll want to settle down to a
hum-drum farm life, after all he’s been through.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>resentfully</i>) Andy’s not like you. He likes the farm.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>immersed in his own thoughts&mdash;enthusiastically</i>) Gad, the
things he’s seen and experienced! Think of the places he’s been! All the
wonderful far places I used to dream about! God, how I envy him! What a
trip! (<i>He springs to his feet and instinctively goes to the window and
stares out at the horizon</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>bitterly</i>) I s’pose you’re sorry now you didn’t go?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>too occupied with his own thoughts to hear her&mdash;vindictively</i>)
Oh, those cursed hills out there that I used to think promised me so
much! How I’ve grown to hate the sight of them! They’re like the walls
of a narrow prison yard shutting me in from all the freedom and wonder
of life! (<i>He turns back to the room with a gesture of loathing</i>)
Sometimes I think if it wasn’t for you, Ruth, and&mdash;(<i>his voice
softening</i>)&mdash;little Mary, I’d chuck everything up and walk down the road
with just one desire in my heart&mdash;to put the whole rim of the world
between me and those hills, and be able to breathe freely once more!
(<i>He sinks down into his chair and smiles with bitter self-scorn</i>) There
I go dreaming again&mdash;- my old fool dreams.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>in a low, repressed voice&mdash;her eyes smoldering</i>) You’re not the
only one!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>buried in his own thoughts&mdash;bitterly</i>) And Andy, who’s had the
chance&mdash;what has he got out of it? His letters read like the diary of
a&mdash;of a farmer! “We’re in Singapore now. It’s a dirty hole of a place
and hotter than hell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span> Two of the crew are down with fever and we’re
short-handed on the work. I’ll be damn glad when we sail again, although
tacking back and forth in these blistering seas is a rotten job too!”
(<i>Scornfully</i>) That’s about the way he summed up his impressions of the
East.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>her repressed voice trembling</i>) You needn’t make fun of Andy.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> When I think&mdash;but what’s the use? You know I wasn’t making fun
of Andy personally, but his attitude toward things is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>her eyes flashing&mdash;bursting into uncontrollable rage</i>) You was
too making fun of him! And I ain’t going to stand for it! You ought to
be ashamed of yourself! (<small>ROBERT</small> <i>stares at her in amazement. She
continues furiously</i>) A fine one to talk about anyone else&mdash;after the
way you’ve ruined everything with your lazy loafing!&mdash;and the stupid way
you do things!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>angrily</i>) Stop that kind of talk, do you hear?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> You findin’ fault&mdash;with your own brother who’s ten times the man
you ever was or ever will be! You’re jealous, that’s what! Jealous
because he’s made a man of himself, while you’re nothing but a&mdash;but
a&mdash;&mdash; (<i>She stutters incoherently, overcome by rage</i>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Ruth! Ruth! You’ll be sorry for talking like that.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> I won’t! I won’t never be sorry! I’m only saying what I’ve been
thinking for years.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>aghast</i>) Ruth! You can’t mean that!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> What do you think&mdash;living with a man like you&mdash;having to suffer
all the time because you’ve never been man enough to work and do things
like other people. But no! You never own up to that. You think you’re so
much better<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span> than other folks, with your college education, where you
never learned a thing, and always reading your stupid books instead of
working. I s’pose you think I ought to be <i>proud</i> to be your wife&mdash;a
poor, ignorant thing like me! (<i>Fiercely</i>) But I’m not. I hate it! I
hate the sight of you. Oh, if I’d only known! If I hadn’t been such a
fool to listen to your cheap, silly, poetry talk that you learned out of
books! If I could have seen how you were in your true self&mdash;like you are
now&mdash;I’d have killed myself before I’d have married you! I was sorry for
it before we’d been together a month. I knew what you were really
like&mdash;when it was too late.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>his voice raised loudly</i>) And now&mdash;I’m finding out what you’re
really like&mdash;what a&mdash;a creature I’ve been living with. (<i>With a harsh
laugh</i>) God! It wasn’t that I haven’t guessed how mean and small you
are&mdash;but I’ve kept on telling myself that I must be wrong&mdash;like a
fool!&mdash;like a damned fool!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> You were saying you’d go out on the road if it wasn’t for me.
Well, you can go, and the sooner the better! I don’t care! I’ll be glad
to get rid of you! The farm’ll be better off too. There’s been a curse
on it ever since you took hold. So go! Go and be a tramp like you’ve
always wanted. It’s all you’re good for. I can get along without you,
don’t you worry. (<i>Exulting fiercely</i>) Andy’s coming back, don’t forget
that! He’ll attend to things like they should be. He’ll show what a man
can do! I don’t need you. Andy’s coming!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>they are both standing</i>. <small>ROBERT</small> <i>grabs her by the shoulders
and glares into her eyes</i>) What do you mean? (<i>He shakes her violently</i>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span>What are you thinking of? What’s in your evil mind, you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash; (<i>His
voice is a harsh shout</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>in a defiant scream</i>) Yes I do mean it! I’d say it if you was to
kill me! I do love Andy. I do! I do! I always loved him. (<i>Exultantly</i>)
And he loves me! He loves me! I know he does. He always did! And you
know he did, too! So go! Go if you want to!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>throwing her away from him. She staggers back against the
table&mdash;thickly</i>) You&mdash;you slut! (<i>He stands glaring at her as she leans
back, supporting herself by the table, gasping for breath. A loud
frightened whimper sounds from the awakened child in the bedroom. It
continues. The man and woman stand looking at one another in horror, the
extent of their terrible quarrel suddenly brought home to them. A pause.
The noise of a horse and carriage comes from the road before the house.
The two, suddenly struck by the same premonition, listen to it
breathlessly, as to a sound heard in a dream. It stops. They hear</i>
<small>ANDY’S</small> <i>voice from the road shouting a long hail</i>&mdash;“<i>Ahoy there!</i>”)</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>with a strangled cry of joy</i>) Andy! Andy! (<i>She rushes and grabs
the knob of the screen door, about to fling it open</i>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>in a voice of command that forces obedience</i>) Stop! (<i>He goes
to the door and gently pushes the trembling</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>away from it. The
child’s crying rises to a louder pitch</i>) I’ll meet Andy. You better go
in to Mary, Ruth. (<i>She looks at him defiantly for a moment, but there
is something in his eyes that makes her turn and walk slowly into the
bedroom</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDY’S VOICE.</small> (<i>in a louder shout</i>) Ahoy there, Rob!</p>

<h3>ACT TWO<br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Scene Two</span></h3>

<p><i>The top of a hill on the farm. It is about eleven o’clock the next
morning. The day is hot and cloudless. In the distance the sea can be
seen.</i></p>

<p><i>The top of the hill slopes downward slightly toward the left. A big
boulder stands in the center toward the rear. Further right, a large oak
tree. The faint trace of a path leading upward to it from the left
foreground can be detected through the bleached, sun-scorched grass.</i></p>

<p><small>ROBERT</small> <i>is discovered sitting on the boulder, his chin resting on his
hands, staring out toward the horizon seaward. His face is pale and
haggard, his expression one of utter despondency.</i> <small>MARY</small> <i>is sitting on
the grass near him in the shade, playing with her doll, singing happily
to herself. Presently she casts a curious glance at her father, and,
propping her doll up against the tree, comes over and clambers to his
side.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>pulling at his hand&mdash;solicitously</i>) Dada sick?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>looking at her with a forced smile</i>) No, dear. Why?</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> Play wif Mary.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>gently</i>) No, dear, not today. Dada doesn’t feel like playing
today.</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>protestingly</i>) Yes, Dada!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> No, dear. Dada does feel sick&mdash;a little. He’s got a bad
headache.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span></p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> Mary see. (<i>He bends his head. She pats his hair</i>) Bad head.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>kissing her&mdash;with a smile</i>) There! It’s better now, dear,
thank you. (<i>She cuddles up close against him. There is a pause during
which each of them looks out seaward</i>) (<i>Finally</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>turns to her
tenderly</i>) Would you like Dada to go away?&mdash;far, far away?</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>tearfully</i>) No! No! No, Dada, no!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Don’t you like Uncle Andy&mdash;the man that came yesterday&mdash;not the
old man with the white mustache&mdash;the other?</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> Mary loves Dada.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with fierce determination</i>) He won’t go away, baby. He was
only joking. He couldn’t leave his little Mary. (<i>He presses the child
in his arms</i>).</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>with an exclamation of pain</i>) Oh! Hurt!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> I’m sorry, little girl. (<i>He lifts her down to the grass</i>) Go
play with Dolly, that’s a good girl; and be careful to keep in the
shade. (<i>She reluctantly leaves him and takes up her doll again. A
moment later she points down the hill to the left</i>).</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> Mans, Dada.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>looking that way</i>) It’s your Uncle Andy. (<i>A moment later</i>
<small>ANDREW</small> <i>comes up from the left, whistling cheerfully. He has changed but
little in appearance, except for the fact that his face has been deeply
bronzed by his years in the tropics; but there is a decided change in
his manner. The old easy-going good-nature seems to have been partly
lost in a breezy, business-like briskness of voice and gesture. There is
an authoritative note in his speech as though he were accustomed to give
orders and have them obeyed as a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span> course. He is dressed in the
simple blue uniform and cap of a merchant ship’s officer</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Here you are, eh?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Hello, Andy.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>going over to</i> <small>MARY</small>) And who’s this young lady I find you all
alone with, eh? Who’s this pretty young lady? (<i>He tickles the laughing,
squirming</i> <small>MARY</small>, <i>then lifts her up at arm’s length over his head</i>)
Upsy&mdash;daisy! (<i>He sets her down on the ground again</i>) And there you are!
(<i>He walks over and sits down on the boulder beside</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>who moves
to one side to make room for him</i>) Ruth told me I’d probably find you up
top-side here; but I’d have guessed it, anyway. (<i>He digs his brother in
the ribs affectionately</i>) Still up to your old tricks, you old beggar! I
can remember how you used to come up here to mope and dream in the old
days.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with a smile</i>) I come up here now because it’s the coolest
place on the farm. I’ve given up dreaming.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>grinning</i>) I don’t believe it. You can’t have changed that
much. (<i>After a pause&mdash;with boyish enthusiasm</i>) Say, it sure brings back
old times to be up here with you having a chin all by our lonesomes
again. I feel great being back home.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> It’s great for us to have you back.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>after a pause&mdash;meaningly</i>) I’ve been looking over the old
place with Ruth. Things don’t seem to be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>his face flushing&mdash;interrupts his brother shortly</i>) Never mind
the damn farm! Let’s talk about something interesting. This is the first
chance I’ve had to have a word with you alone. Tell me about your trip.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Why, I thought I told you everything in my letters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>smiling</i>) Your letters were&mdash;sketchy, to say the least.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Oh, I know I’m no author. You needn’t be afraid of hurting my
feelings. I’d rather go through a typhoon again than write a letter.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with eager interest</i>) Then you were through a typhoon?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Yes&mdash;in the China sea. Had to run before it under bare poles for
two days. I thought we were bound down for Davy Jones, sure. Never
dreamed waves could get so big or the wind blow so hard. If it hadn’t
been for Uncle Dick being such a good skipper we’d have gone to the
sharks, all of us. As it was we came out minus a main top-mast and had
to beat back to Hong-Kong for repairs. But I must have written you all
this.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> You never mentioned it.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Well, there was so much dirty work getting things ship-shape
again I must have forgotten about it.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>looking at</i> <small>ANDREW</small>&mdash;<i>marveling</i>) Forget a typhoon? (<i>with a
trace of scorn</i>) You’re a strange combination, Andy. And is what you’ve
told me all you remember about it?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Oh, I could give you your bellyful of details if I wanted to
turn loose on you. It was all-wool-and-a-yard-wide-Hell, I’ll tell you.
You ought to have been there. I remember thinking about you at the worst
of it, and saying to myself: “This’d cure Rob of them ideas of his about
the beautiful sea, if he could see it.” And it would have too, you bet!
(<i>He nods emphatically</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>dryly</i>) The sea doesn’t seem to have impressed you very
favorably.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I should say it didn’t! I’ll never set foot on a ship again if I
can help it&mdash;except to carry me some place I can’t get to by train.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> But you studied to become an officer!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Had to do something or I’d gone mad. The days were like years.
(<i>He laughs</i>) And as for the East you used to rave about&mdash;well, you
ought to see it, and <i>smell</i> it! One walk down one of their filthy
narrow streets with the tropic sun beating on it would sicken you for
life with the “wonder and mystery” you used to dream of.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>shrinking from his brother with a glance of aversion</i>) So all
you found in the East was a stench?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> <i>A</i> stench! Ten thousand of them!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> But you did like some of the places, judging from your
letters&mdash;Sydney, Buenos Aires&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Yes, Sydney’s a good town. (<i>Enthusiastically</i>) But Buenos
Aires&mdash;there’s the place for you. Argentine’s a country where a fellow
has a chance to make good. You’re right I like it. And I’ll tell you,
Rob, that’s right where I’m going just as soon as I’ve seen you folks a
while and can get a ship. I can get a berth as second officer, and I’ll
jump the ship when I get there. I’ll need every cent of the wages
Uncle’s paid me to get a start at something in B. A.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>staring at his brother&mdash;slowly</i>) So you’re not going to stay
on the farm?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Why sure not! Did you think I was? There wouldn’t be any sense.
One of us is enough to run this little place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">{81}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> I suppose it does seem small to you now.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>not noticing the sarcasm in</i> <small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>voice</i>) You’ve no idea,
Rob, what a splendid place Argentine is. I had a letter from a marine
insurance chap that I’d made friends with in Hong-Kong to his brother,
who’s in the grain business in Buenos Aires. He took quite a fancy to
me, and what’s more important, he offered me a job if I’d come back
there. I’d have taken it on the spot, only I couldn’t leave Uncle Dick
in the lurch, and I’d promised you folks to come home. But I’m going
back there, you bet, and then you watch me get on! (<i>He slaps</i> <small>ROBERT</small>
<i>on the back</i>) But don’t you think it’s a big chance, Rob?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> It’s fine&mdash;for you, Andy.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> We call this a farm&mdash;but you ought to hear about the farms down
there&mdash;ten square miles where we’ve got an acre. It’s a new country
where big things are opening up&mdash;and I want to get in on something big
before I die. I’m no fool when it comes to farming, and I know something
about grain. I’ve been reading up a lot on it, too, lately. (<i>He
notices</i> <small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>absent-minded expression and laughs</i>) Wake up, you
old poetry book worm, you! I know my talking about business makes you
want to choke me, doesn’t it?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with an embarrassed smile</i>) No, Andy, I&mdash;I just happened to
think of something else. (<i>Frowning</i>) There’ve been lots of times lately
that I’ve wished I had some of your faculty for business.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>soberly</i>) There’s something I want to talk about, Rob,&mdash;the
farm. You don’t mind, do you?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> No.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I walked over it this morning with Ruth&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span> she told me about
things&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Evasively</i>) I could see the place had run down; but you
mustn’t blame yourself. When luck’s against anyone&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Don’t, Andy! It <i>is</i> my fault. You know it as well as I do. The
best I’ve ever done was to make ends meet.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>after a pause</i>) I’ve got over a thousand saved, and you can
have that.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>firmly</i>) No. You need that for your start in Buenos Aires.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I don’t. I can&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>determinedly</i>) No, Andy! Once and for all, no! I won’t hear of
it!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>protestingly</i>) You obstinate old son of a gun!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Oh, everything’ll be on a sound footing after harvest. Don’t
worry about it.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>doubtfully</i>) Maybe. (<i>After a pause</i>) It’s too bad Pa couldn’t
have lived to see things through. (<i>With feeling</i>) It cut me up a
lot&mdash;hearing he was dead. He never&mdash;softened up, did he&mdash;about me, I
mean?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> He never understood, that’s a kinder way of putting it. He does
now.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>after a pause</i>) You’ve forgotten all about what&mdash;caused me to
go, haven’t you, Rob? (<small>ROBERT</small> <i>nods but keeps his face averted</i>) I was a
slushier damn fool in those days than you were. But it was an act of
Providence I did go. It opened my eyes to how I’d been fooling myself.
Why, I’d forgotten all about&mdash;that&mdash;before I’d been at sea six months.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">{83}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>turns and looks into</i> <small>ANDREW’S</small> <i>eyes searchingly</i>) You’re
speaking of&mdash;Ruth?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>confused</i>) Yes. I didn’t want you to get false notions in your
head, or I wouldn’t say anything. (<i>Looking</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>squarely in the
eyes</i>) I’m telling you the truth when I say I’d forgotten long ago. It
don’t sound well for me, getting over things so easy, but I guess it
never really amounted to more than a kid idea I was letting rule me. I’m
certain now I never was in love&mdash;I was getting fun out of thinking I
was&mdash;and being a hero to myself. (<i>He heaves a great sigh of relief</i>)
There! Gosh, I’m glad that’s off my chest. I’ve been feeling sort of
awkward ever since I’ve been home, thinking of what you two might think.
(<i>A trace of appeal in his voice</i>) You’ve got it all straight now,
haven’t you, Rob?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>in a low voice</i>) Yes, Andy.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> And I’ll tell Ruth, too, if I can get up the nerve. She must
feel kind of funny having me round&mdash;after what used to be&mdash;and not
knowing how I feel about it.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>slowly</i>) Perhaps&mdash;for her sake&mdash;you’d better not tell her.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> For her sake? Oh, you mean she wouldn’t want to be reminded of
my foolishness? Still, I think it’d be worse if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>breaking out&mdash;in an agonized voice</i>) Do as you please, Andy;
but for God’s sake, let’s not talk about it! (<i>There is a pause.</i> <small>ANDREW</small>
<i>stares at</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>in hurt stupefaction.</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>continues after a
moment in a voice which he vainly attempts to keep calm</i>) Excuse me,
Andy. This rotten headache has my nerves shot to pieces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>mumbling</i>) It’s all right, Rob&mdash;long as you’re not sore at me.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Where did Uncle Dick disappear to this morning?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> He went down to the port to see to things on the <i>Sunda</i>. He
said he didn’t know exactly when he’d be back. I’ll have to go down and
tend to the ship when he comes. That’s why I dressed up in these togs.</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>pointing down the hill to the left</i>) See! Mama! Mama! (<i>She
struggles to her feet.</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>appears at left. She is dressed in white,
shows she has been fixing up. She looks pretty, flushed and full of
life</i>).</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>running to her mother</i>) Mama!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>kissing her</i>) Hello, dear! (<i>She walks toward the rock and
addresses</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>coldly</i>) Jake wants to see you about something. He
finished working where he was. He’s waiting for you at the road.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>getting up&mdash;wearily</i>) I’ll go down right away. (<i>As he looks
at</i> <small>RUTH</small>, <i>noting her changed appearance, his face darkens with pain</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> And take Mary with you, please. (<i>To</i> <small>MARY</small>) Go with Dada, that’s a
good girl. Grandma has your dinner most ready for you.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>shortly</i>) Come, Mary!</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>taking his hand and dancing happily beside him</i>) Dada! Dada!
(<i>They go down the hill to the left.</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>looks after them for a
moment, frowning&mdash;then turns to</i> <small>ANDY</small> <i>with a smile</i>) I’m going to sit
down. Come on, Andy. It’ll be like old times. (<i>She jumps lightly to the
top of the rock and sits down</i>) It’s so fine and cool up here after the
house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>half-sitting on the side of the boulder</i>) Yes. It’s great.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> I’ve taken a holiday in honor of your arrival. (<i>Laughing
excitedly</i>) I feel so free I’d like to have wings and fly over the sea.
You’re a man. You can’t know how awful and stupid it is&mdash;cooking and
washing dishes all the time.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>making a wry face</i>) I can guess.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Besides, your mother just insisted on getting your first dinner to
home, she’s that happy at having you back. You’d think I was planning to
poison you the flurried way she shooed me out of the kitchen.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> That’s just like Ma, bless her!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> She’s missed you terrible. We all have. And you can’t deny the
farm has, after what I showed you and told you when we was looking over
the place this morning.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>with a frown</i>) Things are run down, that’s a fact! It’s too
darn hard on poor old Rob.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>scornfully</i>) It’s his own fault. He never takes any interest in
things.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>reprovingly</i>) You can’t blame him. He wasn’t born for it; but
I know he’s done his best for your sake and the old folks and the little
girl.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>indifferently</i>) Yes, I suppose he has. (<i>Gayly</i>) But thank the
Lord, all those days are over now. The “hard luck” Rob’s always blaming
won’t last long when you take hold, Andy. All the farm’s ever needed was
someone with the knack of looking ahead and preparing for what’s going
to happen.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Yes, Rob hasn’t got that. He’s frank to own up to that himself.
I’m going to try and hire a good man for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span> him&mdash;an experienced farmer&mdash;to
work the place on a salary and percentage. That’ll take it off of Rob’s
hands, and he needn’t be worrying himself to death any more. He looks
all worn out, Ruth. He ought to be careful.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>absent-mindedly</i>) Yes, I s’pose. (<i>Her mind is filled with
premonitions by the first part of his statement</i>) Why do you want to
hire a man to oversee things? Seems as if now that you’re back it
wouldn’t be needful.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Oh, of course I’ll attend to everything while I’m here. I mean
after I’m gone.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>as if she couldn’t believe her ears</i>) Gone!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Yes. When I leave for the Argentine again.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>aghast</i>) You’re going away to sea!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Not to sea, no; I’m through with the sea for good as a job. I’m
going down to Buenos Aires to get in the grain business.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> But&mdash;that’s far off&mdash;isn’t it?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>easily</i>) Six thousand miles more or less. It’s quite a trip.
(<i>With enthusiasm</i>) I’ve got a peach of a chance down there, Ruth. Ask
Rob if I haven’t. I’ve just been telling him all about it.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>a flush of anger coming over her face</i>) And didn’t he try to
stop you from going?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>in surprise</i>) No, of course not. Why?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>slowly and vindictively</i>) That’s just like him&mdash;not to.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>resentfully</i>) Rob’s too good a chum to try and stop me when he
knows I’m set on a thing. And he could see just as soon’s I told him
what a good chance it was.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dazedly</i>) And you’re bound on going?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Sure thing. Oh, I don’t mean right off. I’ll have to wait for a
ship sailing there for quite a while, likely. Anyway, I want to stay to
home and visit with you folks a spell before I go.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dumbly</i>) I s’pose. (<i>With sudden anguish</i>) Oh, Andy, you can’t
go! You can’t. Why we’ve all thought&mdash;we’ve all been hoping and praying
you was coming home to stay, to settle down on the farm and see to
things. You mustn’t go! Think of how your Ma’ll take on if you go&mdash;and
how the farm’ll be ruined if you leave it to Rob to look after. You can
see that.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>frowning</i>) Rob hasn’t done so bad. When I get a man to direct
things the farm’ll be safe enough.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>insistently</i>) But your Ma&mdash;think of her.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> She’s used to me being away. She won’t object when she knows
it’s best for her and all of us for me to go. You ask Rob. In a couple
of years down there I’ll make my pile, see if I don’t; and then I’ll
come back and settle down and turn this farm into the crackiest place in
the whole state. In the meantime, I can help you both from down there.
(<i>Earnestly</i>) I tell you, Ruth, I’m going to make good right from the
minute I land, if working hard and a determination to get on can do it;
and I <i>know</i> they can! (<i>Excitedly&mdash;in a rather boastful tone</i>) I tell
you, I feel ripe for bigger things than settling down here. The trip did
that for me, anyway. It showed me the world is a larger proposition than
ever I thought it was in the old days. I couldn’t be content any more
stuck here like a fly in molasses. It all seems trifling, somehow. You
ought to be able to understand what I feel.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) Yes&mdash;I s’pose I ought. (<i>After a pause&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span> sudden
suspicion forming in her mind</i>) What did Rob tell you&mdash;about me?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Tell? About you? Why, nothing.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>staring at him intensely</i>) Are you telling me the truth, Andy
Mayo? Didn’t he say&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; (<i>She stops confusedly</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>surprised</i>) No, he didn’t mention you, I can remember. Why?
What made you think he did?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>wringing her hands</i>) Oh, I wish I could tell if you’re lying or
not!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>indignantly</i>) What’re you talking about? I didn’t used to lie
to you, did I? And what in the name of God is there to lie for?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>still unconvinced</i>) Are you sure&mdash;will you swear&mdash;it isn’t the
reason&mdash;&mdash; (<i>She lowers her eyes and half turns away from him</i>) The same
reason that made you go last time that’s driving you away again? ’Cause
if it is&mdash;I was going to say&mdash;you mustn’t go&mdash;on that account. (<i>Her
voice sinks to a tremulous, tender whisper as she finishes</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>confused&mdash;forces a laugh</i>) Oh, is that what you’re driving at?
Well, you needn’t worry about that no more&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Soberly</i>) I don’t blame
you, Ruth, feeling embarrassed having me around again, after the way I
played the dumb fool about going away last time.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>her hope crushed&mdash;with a gasp of pain</i>) Oh, Andy!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>misunderstanding</i>) I know I oughtn’t to talk about such
foolishness to you. Still I figure it’s better to get it out of my
system so’s we three can be together same’s years ago, and not be
worried thinking one of us might have the wrong notion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span></p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Andy! Please! Don’t!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Let me finish now that I’ve started. It’ll help clear things up.
I don’t want you to think once a fool always a fool, and be upset all
the time I’m here on my fool account. I want you to believe I put all
that silly nonsense back of me a long time ago&mdash;and now&mdash;it
seems&mdash;well&mdash;as if you’d always been my sister, that’s what, Ruth.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>at the end of her endurance&mdash;laughing hysterically</i>) For God’s
sake, Andy&mdash;won’t you please stop talking! (<i>She again hides her face in
her hands, her bowed shoulders trembling</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>ruefully</i>) Seem’s if I put my foot in it whenever I open my
mouth today. Rob shut me up with almost the same words when I tried
speaking to him about it.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>fiercely</i>) You told him&mdash;what you’ve told me?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>astounded</i>) Why sure! Why not?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>shuddering</i>) Oh, my God!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>alarmed</i>) Why? Shouldn’t I have?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>hysterically</i>) Oh, I don’t care what you do! I don’t care! Leave
me alone! (<small>ANDREW</small> <i>gets up and walks down the hill to the left,
embarrassed, hurt, and greatly puzzled by her behavior</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>after a pause&mdash;pointing down the hill</i>) Hello! Here they come
back&mdash;and the Captain’s with them. How’d he come to get back so soon, I
wonder? That means I’ve got to hustle down to the port and get on board.
Rob’s got the baby with him. (<i>He comes back to the boulder.</i> <small>RUTH</small>
<i>keeps her face averted from him</i>) Gosh, I never saw a father so tied up
in a kid as Rob is! He just watches every move she makes. And I don’t
blame him. You both got a right to feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span> proud of her. She’s surely a
little winner. (<i>He glances at</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>to see if this very obvious
attempt to get back in her good graces is having any effect</i>) I can see
the likeness to Rob standing out all over her, can’t you? But there’s no
denying she’s your young one, either. There’s something about her
eyes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>piteously</i>) Oh, Andy, I’ve a headache! I don’t want to talk!
Leave me alone, won’t you please?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>stands staring at her for a moment&mdash;then walks away saying in
a hurt tone</i>): Everybody hereabouts seems to be on edge today. I begin
to feel as if I’m not wanted around. (<i>He stands near the path, left,
kicking at the grass with the toe of his shoe. A moment later</i> <small>CAPTAIN
DICK SCOTT</small> <i>enters, followed by</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>carrying</i> <small>MARY</small>. <i>The</i> <small>CAPTAIN</small>
<i>seems scarcely to have changed at all from the jovial, booming person
he was three years before. He wears a uniform similar to</i> <small>ANDREW’S</small>. <i>He
is puffing and breathless from his climb and mops wildly at his
perspiring countenance.</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>casts a quick glance at</i> <small>ANDREW</small>,
<i>noticing the latter’s discomfited look, and then turns his eyes on</i>
<small>RUTH</small> <i>who, at their approach, has moved so her back is toward them, her
chin resting on her hands as she stares out seaward</i>).</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> Mama! Mama! (<small>ROBERT</small> <i>puts her down and she runs to her mother.</i>
<small>RUTH</small> <i>turns and grabs her up in her arms with a sudden fierce
tenderness, quickly turning away again from the others. During the
following scene she keeps</i> <small>MARY</small> <i>in her arms</i>).</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>wheezily</i>) Phew! I got great news for you, Andy. Let me get my
wind first. Phew! God A’mighty, mountin’ this damned hill is worser’n
goin’ aloft to the skys’l yard in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span> blow. I got to lay to a while. (<i>He
sits down on the grass, mopping his face</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I didn’t look for you this soon, Uncle.</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> I didn’t figger it, neither; but I run across a bit o’ news down
to the Seamen’s Home made me ’bout ship and set all sail back here to
find you.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>eagerly</i>) What is it, Uncle?</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> Passin’ by the Home I thought I’d drop in an’ let ’em know I’d be
lackin’ a mate next trip count o’ your leavin’. Their man in charge o’
the shippin’ asked after you ’special curious. “Do you think he’d
consider a berth as Second on a steamer, Captain?” he asks. I was goin’
to say no when I thinks o’ you wantin’ to get back down south to the
Plate agen; so I asks him: “What is she and where’s she bound?” “She’s
the <i>El Paso</i>, a brand new tramp,” he says, “and she’s bound for Buenos
Aires.”</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>his eyes lighting up&mdash;excitedly</i>) Gosh, that is luck! When
does she sail?</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> Tomorrow mornin’. I didn’t know if you’d want to ship away agen
so quick an’ I told him so. “Tell him I’ll hold the berth open for him
until late this afternoon,” he says. So there you be, an’ you can make
your own choice.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I’d like to take it. There may not be another ship for Buenos
Aires with a vacancy in months. (<i>His eyes roving from</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>to</i> <small>RUTH</small>
<i>and back again&mdash;uncertainly</i>) Still&mdash;damn it all&mdash;tomorrow morning is
soon. I wish she wasn’t leaving for a week or so. That’d give me a
chance&mdash;it seems hard to go right away again when I’ve just got home.
And yet it’s a chance in a thousand&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Appealing to</i> <small>ROBERT</small>) What do
you think, Rob? What would you do?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>forcing a smile</i>) He who hesitates, you know. (<i>Frowning</i>)
It’s a piece of good luck thrown in your way&mdash;and&mdash;I think you owe it to
yourself to jump at it. But don’t ask me to decide for you.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>turning to look at</i> <small>ANDREW</small>&mdash;<i>in a tone of fierce resentment</i>)
Yes, go, Andy! (<i>She turns quickly away again. There is a moment of
embarrassed silence</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>thoughtfully</i>) Yes, I guess I will. It’ll be the best thing
for all of us in the end, don’t you think so, Rob? (<small>ROBERT</small> <i>nods but
remains silent</i>).</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> (<i>getting to his feet</i>) Then, that’s settled.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>now that he has definitely made a decision his voice rings
with hopeful strength and energy</i>) Yes, I’ll take the berth. The sooner
I go the sooner I’ll be back, that’s a certainty; and I won’t come back
with empty hands next time. You bet I won’t!</p>

<p><small>SCOTT.</small> You ain’t got so much time, Andy. To make sure you’d best leave
here soon’s you kin. I got to get right back aboard. You’d best come
with me.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I’ll go to the house and repack my bag right away.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>quietly</i>) You’ll both be here for dinner, won’t you?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>worriedly</i>) I don’t know. Will there be time? What time is it
now, I wonder?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>reproachfully</i>) Ma’s been getting dinner especially for you,
Andy.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>flushing&mdash;shame-facedly</i>) Hell! And I was forgetting! Of
course I’ll stay for dinner if I missed every damned ship in the world.
(<i>He turns to the</i> <small>CAPTAIN</small>&mdash;<i>briskly</i>) Come on, Uncle. Walk down with me
to the house and you can tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span> me more about this berth on the way. I’ve
got to pack before dinner. (<i>He and the</i> <small>CAPTAIN</small> <i>start down to the
left</i>. <small>ANDREW</small> <i>calls back over his shoulder</i>) You’re coming soon, aren’t
you, Rob?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Yes. I’ll be right down. (<small>ANDREW</small> <i>and the</i> <small>CAPTAIN</small> <i>leave</i>. <small>RUTH</small>
<i>puts</i> <small>MARY</small> <i>on the ground and hides her face in her hands. Her
shoulders shake as if she were sobbing.</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>stares at her with a
grim, somber expression</i>. <small>MARY</small> <i>walks backward toward</i> <small>ROBERT</small>, <i>her
wondering eyes fixed on her mother</i>).</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>her voice vaguely frightened, taking her father’s hand</i>) Dada,
Mama’s cryin’, Dada.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>bending down and stroking her hair&mdash;in a voice he endeavors to
keep from being harsh</i>) No, she isn’t, little girl. The sun hurts her
eyes, that’s all. Aren’t you beginning to feel hungry, Mary?</p>

<p><small>MARY.</small> (<i>decidedly</i>) Yes, Dada.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>meaningly</i>) It must be your dinner time now.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>in a muffled voice</i>) I’m coming, Mary. (<i>She wipes her eyes
quickly and, without looking at</i> <small>ROBERT</small>, <i>comes and takes</i> <small>MARY’S</small>
<i>hand&mdash;in a dead voice</i>) Come on and I’ll get your dinner for you. (<i>She
walks out left, her eyes fixed on the ground, the skipping</i> <small>MARY</small>
<i>tugging at her hand</i>. <small>ROBERT</small> <i>waits a moment for them to get ahead and

BEYOND THE HORIZON<br />
<br /><a name="ACT_THREE" id="ACT_THREE"></a>ACT THREE
</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene One</span></h3>

<p><i>Same as Act Two, Scene One&mdash;The sitting room of the farm house about
six o’clock in the morning of a day toward the end of October five years
later. It is not yet dawn, but as the action progresses the darkness
outside the windows gradually fades to gray.</i></p>

<p><i>The room, seen by the light of the shadeless oil lamp with a smoky
chimney which stands on the table, presents an appearance of decay, of
dissolution. The curtains at the windows are torn and dirty and one of
them is missing. The closed desk is gray with accumulated dust as if it
had not been used in years. Blotches of dampness disfigure the wall
paper. Threadbare trails, leading to the kitchen and outer doors, show
in the faded carpet. The top of the coverless table is stained with the
imprints of hot dishes and spilt food. The rung of one rocker has been
clumsily mended with a piece of plain board. A brown coating of rust
covers the unblacked stove. A pile of wood is stacked up carelessly
against the wall by the stove.</i></p>

<p><i>The whole atmosphere of the room, contrasted with that of former years,
is one of an habitual poverty too hopelessly resigned to be any longer
ashamed or even conscious of itself.</i></p>

<p><i>At the rise of the curtain</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>is discovered sitting by the stove,
with hands outstretched to the warmth as if the air in the room were
damp and cold. A heavy shawl is wrapped about her shoulders,
half-concealing her dress of deep mourning. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span> has aged horribly. Her
pale, deeply lined face has the stony lack of expression of one to whom
nothing more can ever happen, whose capacity for emotion has been
exhausted. When she speaks her voice is without timbre, low and
monotonous. The negligent disorder of her dress, the slovenly
arrangement of her hair, now streaked with gray, her muddied shoes run
down at the heel, give full evidence of the apathy in which she lives.</i></p>

<p><i>Her mother is asleep in her wheel chair beside the stove toward the
rear, wrapped up in a blanket.</i></p>

<p><i>There is a sound from the open bedroom door in the rear as if someone
were getting out of bed.</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>turns in that direction, with a look of
dull annoyance. A moment later</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>appears in the doorway, leaning
weakly against it for support. His hair is long and unkempt, his face
and body emaciated. There are bright patches of crimson over his check
bones and his eyes are burning with fever. He is dressed in corduroy
pants, a flannel shirt, and wears worn carpet slippers on his bare
feet.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) S-s-s-h-! Ma’s asleep.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>speaking with an effort</i>) I won’t wake her. (<i>He walks weakly
to a rocker by the side of the table and sinks down in it exhausted</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>staring at the stove</i>) You better come near the fire where it’s
warm.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> No. I’m burning up now.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> That’s the fever. You know the doctor told you not to get up and
move round.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>irritably</i>) That old fossil! He doesn’t know anything. Go to
bed and stay there&mdash;that’s his only prescription.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>indifferently</i>) How are you feeling now?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>buoyantly</i>) Better! Much better than I’ve felt in ages. Really
I’m fine now&mdash;only very weak. It’s the turning point, I guess. From now
on I’ll pick up so quick I’ll surprise you&mdash;and no thanks to that old
fool of a country quack, either.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> He’s always tended to us.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Always helped us to die, you mean! He “tended” to Pa and Ma
and&mdash;(<i>his voice breaks</i>)&mdash;and to&mdash;Mary.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) He did the best he knew, I s’pose. (<i>After a pause</i>)
Well, Andy’s bringing a specialist with him when he comes. That ought to
suit you.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>bitterly</i>) Is that why you’re waiting up all night?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Yes.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> For Andy?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>without a trace of feeling</i>) Somebody had got to. It’s only
right for someone to meet him after he’s been gone five years.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with bitter mockery</i>) Five years! It’s a long time.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Yes.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>meaningly</i>) To <i>wait</i>!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>indifferently</i>) It’s past now.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Yes, it’s past. (<i>After a pause</i>) Have you got his two telegrams
with you? (<small>RUTH</small> <i>nods</i>) Let me see them, will you? My head was so full
of fever when they came I couldn’t make head or tail to them.
(<i>Hastily</i>) But I’m feeling fine now. Let me read them again. (<small>RUTH</small>
<i>takes them from the bosom of her dress and hands them to him</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Here. The first one’s on top.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>opening it</i>) New York. “Just landed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span> steamer. Have
important business to wind up here. Will be home as soon as deal is
completed.” (<i>He smiles bitterly</i>) Business first was always Andy’s
motto (<i>He reads</i>) “Hope you are all well. Andy.” (<i>He repeats
ironically</i>) “Hope you are all well!”</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) He couldn’t know you’d been took sick till I answered
that and told him.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>contritely</i>) Of course he couldn’t. I’m a fool. I’m touchy
about nothing lately. Just what did you say in your reply?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>inconsequentially</i>) I had to send it collect.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>irritably</i>) What did you say was the matter with me?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> I wrote you had lung trouble.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>flying into a petty temper</i>) You <i>are</i> a fool! How often have
I explained to you that it’s <i>pleurisy</i> is the matter with me. You can’t
seem to get it in your head that the pleura is outside the lungs, not in
them!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>callously</i>) I only wrote what Doctor Smith told me.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>angrily</i>) He’s a damned ignoramus!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) Makes no difference. I had to tell Andy something,
didn’t I?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>after a pause, opening the other telegram</i>) He sent this last
evening. Let’s see. (<i>He reads</i>) “Leave for home on midnight train. Just
received your wire. Am bringing specialist to see Rob. Will motor to
farm from Port.” (<i>He calculates</i>) What time is it now?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Round six, must be.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> He ought to be here soon. I’m glad he’s bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span> a doctor who
knows something. A specialist will tell you in a second that there’s
nothing the matter with my lungs.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>stolidly</i>) You’ve been coughing an awful lot lately.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>irritably</i>) What nonsense! For God’s sake, haven’t you ever
had a bad cold yourself? (<small>RUTH</small> <i>stares at the stove in silence</i>. <small>ROBERT</small>
<i>fidgets in his chair. There is a pause. Finally</i> <small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>eyes are
fixed on the sleeping</i> <small>MRS. ATKINS</small>) Your mother is lucky to be able to
sleep so soundly.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Ma’s tired. She’s been sitting up with me most of the night.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>mockingly</i>) Is she waiting for Andy, too? (<i>There is a pause.</i>
<small>ROBERT</small> <i>sighs</i>) I couldn’t get to sleep to save my soul. I counted ten
million sheep if I counted one. No use! I gave up trying finally and
just laid there in the dark thinking. (<i>He pauses, then continues in a
tone of tender sympathy</i>) I was thinking about you, Ruth&mdash;of how hard
these last years must have been for you. (<i>Appealingly</i>) I’m sorry,
Ruth.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>in a dead voice</i>) I don’t know. They’re past now. They were hard
on all of us.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Yes; on all of us but Andy. (<i>With a flash of sick jealousy</i>)
Andy’s made a big success of himself&mdash;the kind he wanted. (<i>Mockingly</i>)
And now he’s coming home to let us admire his greatness.
(<i>Frowning&mdash;irritably</i>) What am I talking about? My brain must be sick,
too. (<i>After a pause</i>) Yes, these years have been terrible for both of
us. (<i>His voice is lowered to a trembling whisper</i>) Especially the last
eight months since Mary&mdash;died. (<i>He forces back a sob with a convulsive
shudder&mdash;then breaks out in a passionate agony</i>) Our last hope of
happiness! I could curse God from the bottom of my soul&mdash;if there was a
God! (<i>He is racked by a violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span> fit of coughing and hurriedly puts his
handkerchief to his lips</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>without looking at him</i>) Mary’s better off&mdash;being dead.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>gloomily</i>) We’d all be better off for that matter. (<i>With a
sudden exasperation</i>) You tell that mother of yours she’s got to stop
saying that Mary’s death was due to a weak constitution inherited from
me. (<i>On the verge of tears of weakness</i>) It’s got to stop, I tell you!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>sharply</i>) S-h-h! You’ll wake her; and then she’ll nag at me&mdash;not
you.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>coughs and lies back in his chair weakly&mdash;a pause</i>) It’s all
because your mother’s down on me for not begging Andy for help.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>resentfully</i>) You might have. He’s got plenty.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> How can <i>you</i> of all people think of taking money from <i>him</i>?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) I don’t see the harm. He’s your own brother.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>shrugging his shoulders</i>) What’s the use of talking to you?
Well, <i>I</i> couldn’t. (<i>Proudly</i>) And I’ve managed to keep things going,
thank God. You can’t deny that without help I’ve succeeded in&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He
breaks off with a bitter laugh</i>) My God, what am I boasting of? Debts to
this one and that, taxes, interest unpaid! I’m a fool! (<i>He lies back in
his chair closing his eyes for a moment, then speaks in a low voice</i>)
I’ll be frank, Ruth. I’ve been an utter failure, and I’ve dragged you
with me. I couldn’t blame you in all justice&mdash;for hating me.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>without feeling</i>) I don’t hate you. It’s been my fault too, I
s’pose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> No. You couldn’t help loving&mdash;Andy.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) I don’t love anyone.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>waving her remark aside</i>) You needn’t deny it. It doesn’t
matter. (<i>After a pause&mdash;with a tender smile</i>) Do you know Ruth, what
I’ve been dreaming back there in the dark? (<i>With a short laugh</i>) I was
planning our future when I get well. (<i>He looks at her with appealing
eyes as if afraid she will sneer at him. Her expression does not change.
She stares at the stove. His voice takes on a note of eagerness</i>) After
all, why shouldn’t we have a future? We’re young yet. If we can only
shake off the curse of this farm! It’s the farm that’s ruined our lives,
damn it! And now that Andy’s coming back&mdash;I’m going to sink my foolish
pride, Ruth! I’ll borrow the money from him to give us a good start in
the city. We’ll go where people live instead of stagnating, and start
all over again. (<i>Confidently</i>) I won’t be the failure there that I’ve
been here, Ruth. You won’t need to be ashamed of me there. I’ll prove to
you the reading I’ve done can be put to some use. (<i>Vaguely</i>) I’ll
write, or something of that sort. I’ve always wanted to write.
(<i>Pleadingly</i>) You’ll want to do that, won’t you, Ruth?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) There’s Ma.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> She can come with us.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> She wouldn’t.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>angrily</i>) So that’s your answer! (<i>He trembles with violent
passion. His voice is so strange that</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>turns to look at him in
alarm</i>) You’re lying, Ruth! Your mother’s just an excuse. You want to
stay here. You think that because Andy’s coming back that&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He
chokes and has an attack of coughing</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span></p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>getting up&mdash;in a frightened voice</i>) What’s the matter? (<i>She
goes to him</i>) I’ll go with you, Rob. Stop that coughing for goodness’
sake! It’s awful bad for you. (<i>She soothes him in dull tones</i>) I’ll go
with you to the city&mdash;soon’s you’re well again. Honest I will, Rob, I
promise! (<small>ROB</small> <i>lies back and closes his eyes. She stands looking down at
him anxiously</i>) Do you feel better now?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Yes. (<small>RUTH</small> <i>goes back to her chair. After a pause he opens his
eyes and sits up in his chair. His face is flushed and happy</i>) Then you
<i>will</i> go, Ruth?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Yes.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>excitedly</i>) We’ll make a new start, Ruth&mdash;just you and I. Life
owes us some happiness after what we’ve been through. (<i>Vehemently</i>) It
must! Otherwise our suffering would be meaningless&mdash;and that is
unthinkable.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>worried by his excitement</i>) Yes, yes, of course, Rob, but you
mustn’t&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Oh, don’t be afraid. I feel completely well, really I do&mdash;now
that I can hope again. Oh if you knew how glorious it feels to have
something to look forward to! Can’t you feel the thrill of it, too&mdash;the
vision of a new life opening up after all the horrible years?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Yes, yes, but do be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Nonsense! I won’t be careful. I’m getting back all my strength.
(<i>He gets lightly to his feet</i>) See! I feel light as a feather. (<i>He
walks to her chair and bends down to kiss her smilingly</i>) One kiss&mdash;the
first in years, isn’t it?&mdash;to greet the dawn of a new life together.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>submitting to his kiss&mdash;worriedly</i>) Sit down, Rob, for goodness’
sake!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with tender obstinacy&mdash;stroking her hair</i>) I won’t sit down.
You’re silly to worry. (<i>He rests one hand on the back of her chair</i>)
Listen. All our suffering has been a test through which we had to pass
to prove ourselves worthy of a finer realization. (<i>Exultingly</i>) And we
did pass through it! It hasn’t broken us! And now the dream is to come
true! Don’t you see?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>looking at him with frightened eyes as if she thought he had
gone mad</i>) Yes, Rob, I see; but won’t you go back to bed now and rest?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> No. I’m going to see the sun rise. It’s an augury of good
fortune. (<i>He goes quickly to the window in the rear left, and pushing
the curtains aside, stands looking out.</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>springs to her feet and
comes quickly to the table, left, where she remains watching</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>in
a tense, expectant attitude. As he peers out his body seems gradually to
sag, to grow limp and tired. His voice is mournful as he speaks</i>) No sun
yet. It isn’t time. All I can see is the black rim of the damned hills
outlined against a creeping grayness. (<i>He turns around; letting the
curtains fall back, stretching a hand out to the wall to support
himself. His false strength of a moment has evaporated, leaving his face
drawn and hollow-eyed. He makes a pitiful attempt to smile</i>) That’s not
a very happy augury, is it? But the sun’ll come&mdash;soon. (<i>He sways
weakly</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>hurrying to his side and supporting him</i>) Please go to bed,
won’t you, Rob? You don’t want to be all wore out when the specialist
comes, do you?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>quickly</i>) No. That’s right. He mustn’t think I’m sicker than I
am. And I feel as if I could sleep now&mdash;(<i>Cheerfully</i>)&mdash;a good, sound,
restful sleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span></p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>helping him to the bedroom door</i>) That’s what you need most.
(<i>They go inside. A moment later she reappears calling back</i>) I’ll shut
this door so’s you’ll be quiet. (<i>She closes the door and goes quickly
to her mother and shakes her by the shoulder</i>) Ma! Ma! Wake up!</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>coming out of her sleep with a start</i>) Glory be! What’s
the matter with you?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> It was Rob. He’s just been talking to me out here. I put him back
to bed. (<i>Now that she is sure her mother is awake her fear passes and
she relapses into dull indifference. She sits down in her chair and
stares at the stove&mdash;dully</i>) He acted&mdash;funny; and his eyes looked so&mdash;so
wild like.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>with asperity</i>) And is that all you woke me out of a
sound sleep for, and scared me near out of my wits?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> I was afraid. He talked so crazy. I couldn’t quiet him. I didn’t
want to be alone with him that way. Lord knows what he might do.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>scornfully</i>) Humph! A help I’d be to you and me not able
to move a step! Why didn’t you run and get Jake?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) Jake isn’t here. He quit last night. He hasn’t been paid
in three months.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>indignantly</i>) I can’t blame him. What decent person’d
want to work on a place like this? (<i>With sudden exasperation</i>) Oh, I
wish you’d never married that man!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>wearily</i>) You oughtn’t to talk about him now when he’s sick in
his bed.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>working herself into a fit of rage</i>) You know very well,
Ruth Mayo, if it wasn’t for me helpin’ you on the sly out of my savin’s,
you’d both been in the poor house&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span> all ’count of his pigheaded
pride in not lettin’ Andy know the state thin’s were in. A nice thin’
for me to have to support him out of what I’d saved for my last
days&mdash;and me an invalid with no one to look to!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Andy’ll pay you back, Ma. I can tell him so’s Rob’ll never know.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>with a snort</i>) What’d Rob think you and him was livin’
on, <i>I</i>’d like to know?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) He didn’t think about it, I s’pose. (<i>After a slight
pause</i>) He said he’d made up his mind to ask Andy for help when he
comes. (<i>As a clock in the kitchen strikes six</i>) Six o’clock. Andy ought
to get here directly.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> D’you think this special doctor’ll do Rob any good?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>hopelessly</i>) I don’t know. (<i>The two women remain silent for a
time staring dejectedly at the stove</i>).</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>shivering irritably</i>) For goodness’ sake put some wood on
that fire. I’m most freezin’!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>pointing to the door in the rear</i>) Don’t talk so loud. Let him
sleep if he can. (<i>She gets wearily from the chair and puts a few pieces
of wood in the stove</i>) This is the last of the wood. I don’t know who’ll
cut more now that Jake’s left. (<i>She sighs and walks to the window in
the rear, left, pulls the curtains aside, and looks out</i>) It’s getting
gray out. (<i>She comes back to the stove</i>) Looks like it’d be a nice day.
(<i>She stretches out her hands to warm them</i>) Must’ve been a heavy frost
last night. We’re paying for the spell of warm weather we’ve been
having. (<i>The throbbing whine of a motor sounds from the distance
outside</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span></p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>sharply</i>) S-h-h! Listen! Ain’t that an auto I hear?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>without interest</i>) Yes. It’s Andy, I s’pose.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>with nervous irritation</i>) Don’t sit there like a silly
goose. Look at the state of this room! What’ll this strange doctor think
of us? Look at that lamp chimney all smoke! Gracious sakes, Ruth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>indifferently</i>) I’ve got a lamp all cleaned up in the kitchen.</p>

<p><small>MRS. ATKINS.</small> (<i>peremptorily</i>) Wheel me in there this minute. I don’t
want him to see me looking a sight. I’ll lay down in the room the other
side. You don’t need me now and I’m dead for sleep. (<small>RUTH</small> <i>wheels her
mother off right. The noise of the motor grows louder and finally ceases
as the car stops on the road before the farmhouse.</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>returns from
the kitchen with a lighted lamp in her hand which she sets on the table
beside the other. The sound of footsteps on the path is heard&mdash;then a
sharp rap on the door.</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>goes and opens it.</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>enters,
followed by</i> <small>DOCTOR FAWCETT</small> <i>carrying a small black bag.</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>has
changed greatly. His face seems to have grown highstrung, hardened by
the look of decisiveness which comes from being constantly under a
strain where judgments on the spur of the moment are compelled to be
accurate. His eyes are keener and more alert. There is even a suggestion
of ruthless cunning about them. At present, however, his expression is
one of tense anxiety.</i> <small>DOCTOR FAWCETT</small> <i>is a short, dark, middle-aged man
with a Vandyke beard. He wears glasses</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Hello, Andy! I’ve been waiting&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>kissing her hastily</i>) I got here as soon as I could.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span> (<i>He
throws of his cap and heavy overcoat on the table, introducing</i> <small>RUTH</small>
<i>and the</i> <small>DOCTOR</small> <i>as he does so. He is dressed in an expensive business
suit and appears stouter</i>) My sister-in-law, Mrs. Mayo&mdash;Doctor Fawcett.
(<i>They bow to each other silently.</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>casts a quick glance about
the room</i>) Where’s Rob?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>pointing</i>) In there.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I’ll take your coat and hat, Doctor. (<i>As he helps the</i> <small>DOCTOR</small>
<i>with his things</i>) Is he very bad, Ruth?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) He’s been getting weaker.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Damn! This way, Doctor. Bring the lamp, Ruth. (<i>He goes into the
bedroom, followed by the</i> <small>DOCTOR</small> <i>and</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>carrying the clean lamp</i>.
<small>RUTH</small> <i>reappears almost immediately closing the door behind her, and goes
slowly to the outside door, which she opens, and stands in the doorway
looking out. The sound of</i> <small>ANDREW’S</small> <i>and</i> <small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>voices comes from
the bedroom. A moment later</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>re-enters, closing the door softly.
He comes forward and sinks down in the rocker on the right of table,
leaning his head on his hand. His face is drawn in a shocked expression
of great grief. He sighs heavily, staring mournfully in front of him.</i>
<small>RUTH</small> <i>turns and stands watching him. Then she shuts the door and returns
to her chair by the stove, turning it so she can face him</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>glancing up quickly&mdash;in a harsh voice</i>) How long has this been
going on?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> You mean&mdash;how long has he been sick?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>shortly</i>) Of course! What else?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> It was last summer he had a bad spell first, but he’s been ailin’
ever since Mary died&mdash;eight months ago.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>harshly</i>) Why didn’t you let me know&mdash;cable me? Do you want
him to die, all of you? I’m damned if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span> doesn’t look that way! (<i>His
voice breaking</i>) Poor old chap! To be sick in this out-of-the-way hole
without anyone to attend to him but a country quack! It’s a damned
shame!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) I wanted to send you word once, but he only got mad when
I told him. He was too proud to ask anything, he said.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Proud? To ask <i>me</i>? (<i>He jumps to his feet and paces nervously
back and forth</i>) I can’t understand the way you’ve acted. Didn’t you see
how sick he was getting? Couldn’t you realize&mdash;why, I nearly dropped in
my tracks when I saw him! He looks&mdash;(<i>He shudders</i>)&mdash;terrible! (<i>With
fierce scorn</i>) I suppose you’re so used to the idea of his being
delicate that you took his sickness as a matter of course. God, if I’d
only known!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>without emotion</i>) A letter takes so long to get where you
were&mdash;and we couldn’t afford to telegraph. We owed everyone already, and
I couldn’t ask Ma. She’d been giving me money out of her savings till
she hadn’t much left. Don’t say anything to Rob about it. I never told
him. He’d only be mad at me if he knew. But I had to, because&mdash;God knows
how we’d have got on if I hadn’t.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> You mean to say&mdash;&mdash; (<i>His eyes seem to take in the
poverty-stricken appearance of the room for the first time</i>) You sent
that telegram to me collect. Was it because&mdash;&mdash; (<small>RUTH</small> <i>nods silently.</i>
<small>ANDREW</small> <i>pounds on the table with his fist</i>) Good God! And all this time
I’ve been&mdash;why I’ve had everything! (<i>He sits down in his chair and
pulls it close to</i> <small>RUTH’S</small>&mdash;<i>impulsively</i>) But&mdash;I can’t get it through my
head. Why? Why? What has happened? How did it ever come about? Tell me!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">{111}</a></span></p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) There’s nothing much to tell. Things kept getting worse,
that’s all&mdash;and Rob didn’t seem to care. He never took any interest
since way back when your Ma died. After that he got men to take charge,
and they nearly all cheated him&mdash;he couldn’t tell&mdash;and left one after
another. Then after Mary died he didn’t pay no heed to anything any
more&mdash;just stayed indoors and took to reading books again. So I had to
ask Ma if she wouldn’t help us some.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>surprised and horrified</i>) Why, damn it, this is frightful! Rob
must be mad not to have let me know. Too proud to ask help of <i>me</i>!
What’s the matter with him in God’s name? (<i>A sudden, horrible suspicion
entering his mind</i>) Ruth! Tell me the truth. His mind hasn’t gone back
on him, has it?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) I don’t know. Mary’s dying broke him up terrible&mdash;but
he’s used to her being gone by this, I s’pose.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>looking at her queerly</i>) Do you mean to say <i>you’re</i> used to
it?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>in a dead tone</i>) There’s a time comes&mdash;when you don’t mind any
more&mdash;anything.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>looks at her fixedly for a moment&mdash;with great pity</i>) I’m
sorry, Ruth&mdash;if I seemed to blame you. I didn’t realize&mdash;&mdash; The sight of
Rob lying in bed there, so gone to pieces&mdash;it made me furious at
everyone. Forgive me, Ruth.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> There’s nothing to forgive. It doesn’t matter.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>springing to his feet again and pacing up and down</i>) Thank God
I came back before it was too late. This doctor will know exactly what
to do. That’s the first thing to think of. When Rob’s on his feet again
we can get the farm working on a sound basis once more. I’ll see to
that&mdash;before I leave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span></p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> You’re going away again?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I’ve got to.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> You wrote Rob you was coming back to stay this time.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I expected to&mdash;until I got to New York. Then I learned certain
facts that make it necessary. (<i>With a short laugh</i>) To be candid, Ruth,
I’m not the rich man you’ve probably been led to believe by my
letters&mdash;not now. I was when I wrote them. I made money hand over fist
as long as I stuck to legitimate trading; but I wasn’t content with
that. I wanted it to come easier, so like all the rest of the idiots, I
tried speculation. Oh, I won all right! Several times I’ve been almost a
millionaire&mdash;on paper&mdash;and then come down to earth again with a bump.
Finally the strain was too much. I got disgusted with myself and made up
my mind to get out and come home and forget it and really live again.
(<i>He gives a harsh laugh</i>) And now comes the funny part. The day before
the steamer sailed I saw what I thought was a chance to become a
millionaire again. (<i>He snaps his fingers</i>) That easy! I plunged. Then,
before things broke, I left&mdash;I was so confident I couldn’t be wrong. But
when I landed in New York&mdash;I wired you I had business to wind up, didn’t
I? Well, it was the business that wound me up! (<i>He smiles grimly,
pacing up and down, his hands in his pockets</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) You found&mdash;you’d lost everything?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>sitting down again</i>) Practically. (<i>He takes a cigar from his
pocket, bites the end off, and lights it</i>) Oh, I don’t mean I’m dead
broke. I’ve saved ten thousand from the wreckage, maybe twenty. But
that’s a poor showing for five years’ hard work. That’s why I’ll have to
go back. (<i>Confidently</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span> I can make it up in a year or so down
there&mdash;and I don’t need but a shoestring to start with. (<i>A weary
expression comes over his face and he sighs heavily</i>) I wish I didn’t
have to. I’m sick of it all.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> It’s too bad&mdash;things seem to go wrong so.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>shaking off his depression&mdash;briskly</i>) They might be much
worse. There’s enough left to fix the farm O. K. before I go. I won’t
leave ’til Rob’s on his feet again. In the meantime I’ll make things fly
around here. (<i>With satisfaction</i>) I need a rest, and the kind of rest I
need is hard work in the open&mdash;just like I used to do in the old days.
(<i>Stopping abruptly and lowering his voice cautiously</i>) Not a word to
Rob about my losing money! Remember that, Ruth! You can see why. If he’s
grown so touchy he’d never accept a cent if he thought I was hard up;
see?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Yes, Andy. (<i>After a pause, during which</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>puffs at his
cigar abstractedly, his mind evidently busy with plans for the future,
the bedroom door is opened and</i> <small>DOCTOR FAWCETT</small> <i>enters, carrying a bag.
He closes the door quietly behind him and comes forward, a grave
expression on his face.</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>springs out of his chair</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Ah, Doctor! (<i>He pushes a chair between his own and</i> <small>RUTH’S</small>)
Won’t you have a chair?</p>

<p><small>FAWCETT.</small> (<i>glancing at his watch</i>) I must catch the nine o’clock back to
the city. It’s imperative. I have only a moment. (<i>Sitting down and
clearing his throat&mdash;in a perfunctory, impersonal voice</i>) The case of
your brother, Mr. Mayo, is&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He stops and glances at</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>and says
meaningly to</i> <small>ANDREW</small>) Perhaps it would be better if you and I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>with dogged resentment</i>) I know what you mean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span> Doctor.
(<i>Dully</i>) Don’t be afraid I can’t stand it. I’m used to bearing trouble
by this; and I can guess what you’ve found out. (<i>She hesitates for a
moment&mdash;then continues in a monotonous voice</i>) Rob’s going to die.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>angrily</i>) Ruth!</p>

<p><small>FAWCETT.</small> (<i>raising his hand as if to command silence</i>) I am afraid my
diagnosis of your brother’s condition forces me to the same conclusion
as Mrs. Mayo’s.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>groaning</i>) But, Doctor, surely&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>FAWCETT.</small> (<i>calmly</i>) Your brother hasn’t long to live&mdash;perhaps a few
days, perhaps only a few hours. It’s a marvel that he’s alive at this
moment. My examination revealed that both of his lungs are terribly
affected.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>brokenly</i>) Good God! (<small>RUTH</small> <i>keeps her eyes fixed on her lap in
a trance-like stare</i>).</p>

<p><small>FAWCETT.</small> I am sorry I have to tell you this. If there was anything that
could be done&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> There isn’t anything?</p>

<p><small>FAWCETT.</small> (<i>shaking his head</i>) It’s too late. Six months ago there might
have&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>in anguish</i>) But if we were to take him to the mountains&mdash;or
to Arizona&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>FAWCETT.</small> That might have prolonged his life six months ago. (<small>ANDREW</small>
<i>groans</i>) But now&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He shrugs his shoulders significantly</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>appalled by a sudden thought</i>) Good heavens, you haven’t told
him this, have you, Doctor?</p>

<p><small>FAWCETT.</small> No. I lied to him. I said a change of climate&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He looks at
his watch again nervously</i>) I must leave you. (<i>He gets up</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>getting to his feet&mdash;insistently</i>) But there must still be
some chance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>FAWCETT.</small> (<i>as if he were reassuring a child</i>) There is always that last
chance&mdash;the miracle. (<i>He puts on his hat and coat&mdash;bowing to</i> <small>RUTH</small>)
Good-by, Mrs. Mayo.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>without raising her eyes&mdash;dully</i>) Good-by.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>mechanically</i>) I’ll walk to the car with you, Doctor. (<i>They
go out of the door.</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>sits motionlessly. The motor is heard
starting and the noise gradually recedes into the distance.</i> <small>ANDREW</small>
<i>re-enters and sits down in his chair, holding his head in his hands</i>)
Ruth! (<i>She lifts her eyes to his</i>) Hadn’t we better go in and see him?
God! I’m afraid to! I know he’ll read it in my face. (<i>The bedroom door
is noiselessly opened and</i> <small>ROBERT</small> <i>appears in the doorway. His cheeks
are flushed with fever, and his eyes appear unusually large and
brilliant.</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>continues with a groan</i>) It can’t be, Ruth. It can’t
be as hopeless as he said. There’s always a fighting chance. We’ll take
Rob to Arizona. He’s <i>got</i> to get well. There <i>must</i> be a chance!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>in a gentle tone</i>) Why must there, Andy? (<small>RUTH</small> <i>turns and
stares at him with terrified eyes</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>whirling around</i>) Rob! (<i>Scoldingly</i>) What are you doing out
of bed? (<i>He gets up and goes to him</i>) Get right back now and obey the
Doc, or you’re going to get a licking from me!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>ignoring these remarks</i>) Help me over to the chair, please,
Andy.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Like hell I will! You’re going right back to bed, that’s where
you’re going, and stay there! (<i>He takes hold of</i> <small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>arm</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>mockingly</i>) Stay there ’til I die, eh, Andy? (<i>Coldly</i>) Don’t
behave like a child. I’m sick of lying down. I’ll be more rested sitting
up. (<i>As</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>hesitates&mdash;violently</i>) I swear I’ll get out of bed
every time you put me there. You’ll have to sit on my chest, and that
wouldn’t help my health any. Come on, Andy. Don’t play the fool. I want
to talk to you, and I’m going to. (<i>With a grim smile</i>) A dying man has
some rights, hasn’t he?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>with a shudder</i>) Don’t talk that way, for God’s sake! I’ll
only let you sit down if you’ll promise that. Remember. (<i>He helps</i>
<small>ROBERT</small> <i>to the chair between his own and</i> <small>RUTH’S</small>) Easy now! There you
are! Wait, and I’ll get a pillow for you. (<i>He goes into the bedroom.</i>
<small>ROBERT</small> <i>looks at</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>who shrinks away from him in terror</i>. <small>ROBERT</small>
<i>smiles bitterly</i>. <small>ANDREW</small> <i>comes back with the pillow which he places
behind</i> <small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>back</i>) How’s that?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with an affectionate smile</i>) Fine! Thank you! (<i>As</i> <small>ANDREW</small>
<i>sits down</i>) Listen, Andy. You’ve asked me not to talk&mdash;and I won’t
after I’ve made my position clear. (<i>Slowly</i>) In the first place I know
I’m dying. (<small>RUTH</small> <i>bows her head and covers her face with her hands. She
remains like this all during the scene between the two brothers</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Rob! That isn’t so!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>wearily</i>) It <i>is</i> so! Don’t lie to me. After Ruth put me to
bed before you came, I saw it clearly for the first time. (<i>Bitterly</i>)
I’d been making plans for our future&mdash;Ruth’s and mine&mdash;so it came hard
at first&mdash;the realization. Then when the doctor examined me, I
knew&mdash;although he tried to lie about it. And then to make sure I
listened at the door to what he told you. So don’t mock me with fairy
tales about<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span> Arizona, or any such rot as that. Because I’m dying is no
reason you should treat me as an imbecile or a coward. Now that I’m sure
what’s happening I can say Kismet to it with all my heart. It was only
the silly uncertainty that hurt. (<i>There is a pause.</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>looks
around in impotent anguish, not knowing what to say</i>. <small>ROBERT</small> <i>regards
him with an affectionate smile</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>finally blurts out</i>) It isn’t foolish. You <i>have</i> got a
chance. If you heard all the Doctor said that ought to prove it to you.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Oh, you mean when he spoke of the miracle? (<i>Dryly</i>) I don’t
believe in miracles&mdash;in my case. Besides, I know more than any doctor on
earth <i>could</i> know&mdash;because I <i>feel</i> what’s coming. (<i>Dismissing the
subject</i>) But we’ve agreed not to talk of it. Tell me about yourself,
Andy. That’s what I’m interested in. Your letters were too brief and far
apart to be illuminating.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I meant to write oftener.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with a faint trace of irony</i>) I judge from them you’ve
accomplished all you set out to do five years ago?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> That isn’t much to boast of.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>surprised</i>) Have you really, honestly reached that conclusion?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Well, it doesn’t seem to amount to much now.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> But you’re rich, aren’t you?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>with a quick glance at</i> <small>RUTH</small>) Yes, I s’pose so.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> I’m glad. You can do to the farm all I’ve undone. But what did
you do down there? Tell me. You went in the grain business with that
friend of yours?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Yes. After two years I had a share in it. I sold<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span> out last year.
(<i>He is answering</i> <small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>questions with great reluctance</i>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> And then?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I went in on my own.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Still in grain?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Yes.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> What’s the matter? You look as if I were accusing you of
something.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I’m proud enough of the first four years. It’s after that I’m
not boasting of. I took to speculating.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> In wheat?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Yes.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> And you made money&mdash;gambling?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Yes.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>thoughtfully</i>) I’ve been wondering what the great change was
in you. (<i>After a pause</i>) You&mdash;a farmer&mdash;to gamble in a wheat pit with
scraps of paper. There’s a spiritual significance in that picture, Andy.
(<i>He smiles bitterly</i>) I’m a failure, and Ruth’s another&mdash;but we can
both justly lay some of the blame for our stumbling on God. But you’re
the deepest-dyed failure of the three, Andy. You’ve spent eight years
running away from yourself. Do you see what I mean? You used to be a
creator when you loved the farm. You and life were in harmonious
partnership. And now&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He stops as if seeking vainly for words</i>) My
brain is muddled. But part of what I mean is that your gambling with the
thing you used to love to create proves how far astray&mdash;&mdash; So you’ll be
punished. You’ll have to suffer to win back&mdash;&mdash; (<i>His voice grows weaker
and he sighs wearily</i>) It’s no use. I can’t say it. (<i>He lies back and
closes his eyes, breathing pantingly</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>slowly</i>) I think I know what you’re driving at, Rob&mdash;and it’s
true, I guess. (<small>ROBERT</small> <i>smiles gratefully and stretches out his hand,
which</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>takes in his</i>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> I want you to promise me to do one thing, Andy, after&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I’ll promise anything, as God is my Judge!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Remember, Andy, Ruth has suffered double her share. (<i>His voice
faltering with weakness</i>) Only through contact with suffering, Andy,
will you&mdash;awaken. Listen. You must marry Ruth&mdash;afterwards.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>with a cry</i>) Rob! (<small>ROBERT</small> <i>lies back, his eyes closed, gasping
heavily for breath</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>making signs to her to humor him&mdash;gently</i>) You’re tired out,
Rob. You better lie down and rest a while, don’t you think? We can talk
later on.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>with a mocking smile</i>) Later on! You always were an optimist,
Andy! (<i>He sighs with exhaustion</i>) Yes, I’ll go and rest a while. (<i>As</i>
<small>ANDREW</small> <i>comes to help him</i>) It must be near sunrise, isn’t it?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> It’s after six.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>As</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>helps him into the bedroom</i>) Shut the door, Andy.
I want to be alone. (<small>ANDREW</small> <i>reappears and shuts the door softly. He
comes and sits down on his chair again, supporting his head on his
hands. His face is drawn with the intensity of his dry-eyed anguish</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>glancing at him&mdash;fearfully</i>) He’s out of his mind now, isn’t he?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> He may be a little delirious. The fever would do that. (<i>With
impotent rage</i>) God, what a shame! And<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span> there’s nothing we can do but
sit and&mdash;wait! (<i>He springs from his chair and walks to the stove</i>).</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) He was talking&mdash;wild&mdash;like he used to&mdash;only this time it
sounded&mdash;unnatural, don’t you think?</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I don’t know. The things he said to me had truth in them&mdash;even
if he did talk them way up in the air, like he always sees things.
Still&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He glances down at</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>keenly</i>) Why do you suppose he
wanted us to promise we’d&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Confusedly</i>) You know what he said.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) His mind was wandering, I s’pose.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>with conviction</i>) No&mdash;there was something back of it.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> He wanted to make sure I’d be all right&mdash;after he’d gone, I
expect.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> No, it wasn’t that. He knows very well I’d naturally look after
you without&mdash;anything like that.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> He might be thinking of&mdash;something happened five years back, the
time you came home from the trip.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> What happened? What do you mean?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) We had a fight.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> A fight? What has that to do with me?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> It was about you&mdash;in a way.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>amazed</i>) About <i>me</i>?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Yes, mostly. You see I’d found out I’d made a mistake about Rob
soon after we were married&mdash;when it was too late.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Mistake? (<i>Slowly</i>) You mean&mdash;you found out you didn’t love Rob?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Yes.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Good God!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121">{121}</a></span></p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> And then I thought that when Mary came it’d be different, and I’d
love him; but it didn’t happen that way. And I couldn’t bear with his
blundering and book-reading&mdash;and I grew to hate him, almost.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Ruth!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> I couldn’t help it. No woman could. It had to be because I loved
someone else, I’d found out. (<i>She sighs wearily</i>) It can’t do no harm
to tell you now&mdash;when it’s all past and gone&mdash;and dead. <i>You</i> were the
one I really loved&mdash;only I didn’t come to the knowledge of it ’til too
late.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>stunned</i>) Ruth! Do you know what you’re saying?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> It was true&mdash;then. (<i>With sudden fierceness</i>) How could I help it?
No woman could.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Then&mdash;you loved me&mdash;that time I came home?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>doggedly</i>) I’d known your real reason for leaving home the first
time&mdash;everybody knew it&mdash;and for three years I’d been thinking&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> That I loved you?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Yes. Then that day on the hill you laughed about what a fool you’d
been for loving me once&mdash;and I knew it was all over.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Good God, but I never thought&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He stops, shuddering at his
remembrance</i>) And did Rob&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> That was what I’d started to tell. We’d had a fight just before
you came and I got crazy mad&mdash;and I told him all I’ve told you.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>gaping at her speechlessly for a moment</i>) You told Rob&mdash;you
loved me?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> Yes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>shrinking away from her in horror</i>) You&mdash;you&mdash;you mad fool,
you! How could you do such a thing?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> I couldn’t help it. I’d got to the end of bearing things&mdash;without
talking.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Then Rob must have known every moment I stayed here! And yet he
never said or showed&mdash;God, how he must have suffered! Didn’t you know
how much he loved you?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) Yes. I knew he liked me.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Liked you! What kind of a woman are you? Couldn’t you have kept
silent? Did you have to torture him? No wonder he’s dying! And you’ve
lived together for five years with this between you?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> We’ve lived in the same house.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Does he still think&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> I don’t know. We’ve never spoke a word about it since that day.
Maybe, from the way he went on, he s’poses I care for you yet.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> But you don’t. It’s outrageous. It’s stupid! You don’t love me!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>slowly</i>) I wouldn’t know how to feel love, even if I tried, any
more.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>brutally</i>) And I don’t love you, that’s sure! (<i>He sinks into
his chair, his head between his hands</i>) It’s damnable such a thing
should be between Rob and me. Why, I love Rob better’n anybody in the
world and always did. There isn’t a thing on God’s green earth I
wouldn’t have done to keep trouble away from him. And I have to be the
very one&mdash;it’s damnable! How am I going to face him again? What can I
say to him now? (<i>He groans with anguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span> rage. After a pause</i>) He
asked me to promise&mdash;what am I going to do?</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> You can promise&mdash;so’s it’ll ease his mind&mdash;and not mean anything.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> What? Lie to him now&mdash;when he’s dying? (<i>Determinedly</i>) No! It’s
<i>you</i> who’ll have to do the lying, since it must be done. You’ve got a
chance now to undo some of all the suffering you’ve brought on Rob. Go
in to him! Tell him you never loved me&mdash;it was all a mistake. Tell him
you only said so because you were mad and didn’t know what you were
saying! Tell him something, anything, that’ll bring him peace!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) He wouldn’t believe me.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>furiously</i>) You’ve got to make him believe you, do you hear?
You’ve got to&mdash;now&mdash;hurry&mdash;you never know when it may be too late. (<i>As
she hesitates&mdash;imploringly</i>) For God’s sake, Ruth! Don’t you see you owe
it to him? You’ll never forgive yourself if you don’t.</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>dully</i>) I’ll go. (<i>She gets wearily to her feet and walks slowly
toward the bedroom</i>) But it won’t do any good. (<small>ANDREW’S</small> <i>eyes are fixed
on her anxiously. She opens the door and steps inside the room. She
remains standing there for a minute. Then she calls in a frightened
voice</i>) Rob! Where are you? (<i>Then she hurries back, trembling with
fright</i>) Andy! Andy! He’s gone!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>misunderstanding her&mdash;his face pale with dread</i>) He’s not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>interrupting him&mdash;hysterically</i>) He’s gone! The bed’s empty. The
window’s wide open. He must have crawled out into the yard!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>springing to his feet. He rushes into the bedroom and returns
immediately with an expression of alarmed amazement on his face</i>) Come!
He can’t have gone far! (<i>Grabbing his hat he takes</i> <small>RUTH’S</small> <i>arm and
shoves her toward the door</i>) Come on! (<i>Opening the door</i>) Let’s hope to
God&mdash;&mdash; (<i>The door closes behind them, cutting off his words as</i></p>

<h3>ACT THREE
<br /><br /><span class="smcap">Scene Two</span></h3>

<p><i>Same as Act One, Scene One&mdash;A section of country highway. The sky to
the east is already alight with bright color and a thin, quivering line
of flame is spreading slowly along the horizon rim of the dark hills.
The roadside, however, is still steeped in the grayness of the dawn,
shadowy and vague. The field in the foreground has a wild uncultivated
appearance as if it had been allowed to remain fallow the preceding
summer. Parts of the snake-fence in the rear have been broken down. The
apple tree is leafless and seems dead.</i></p>

<p><small>ROBERT</small> <i>staggers weakly in from the left. He stumbles into the ditch and
lies there for a moment; then crawls with a great effort to the top of
the bank where he can see the sun rise, and collapses weakly.</i> <small>RUTH</small>
<i>and</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>come hurriedly along the road from the left.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>stopping and looking about him</i>) There he is! I knew it! I
knew we’d find him here.</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>trying to raise himself to a sitting position as they hasten
to his side&mdash;with a wan smile</i>) I thought I’d given you the slip.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>with kindly bullying</i>) Well you didn’t, you old scoundrel, and
we’re going to take you right back where you belong&mdash;in bed. (<i>He makes
a motion to lift</i> <small>ROBERT</small>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span></p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Don’t, Andy. Don’t, I tell you!</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> You’re in pain?</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>simply</i>) No. I’m dying. (<i>He falls back weakly.</i> <small>RUTH</small> <i>sinks
down beside him with a sob and pillows his head on her lap.</i> <small>ANDREW</small>
<i>stands looking down at him helplessly. <small>ROBERT</small> moves his head restlessly
on</i> <small>RUTH’S</small> <i>lap</i>) I couldn’t stand it back there in the room. It seemed
as if all my life&mdash;I’d been cooped in a room. So I thought I’d try to
end as I might have&mdash;if I’d had the courage&mdash;alone&mdash;in a ditch by the
open road&mdash;watching the sun rise.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> Rob! Don’t talk. You’re wasting your strength. Rest a while and
then we’ll carry you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Still hoping, Andy? Don’t. I know. (<i>There is a pause during
which he breathes heavily, straining his eyes toward the horizon</i>) The
sun comes so slowly. (<i>With an ironical smile</i>) The doctor told me to go
to the far-off places&mdash;and I’d be cured. He was right. That was always
the cure for me. It’s too late&mdash;for this life&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He has a fit of
coughing which racks his body</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>with a hoarse sob</i>) Rob! (<i>He clenches his fist in an impotent
rage against Fate</i>) God! God! (<small>RUTH</small> <i>sobs brokenly and wipes</i> <small>ROBERT’S</small>
<i>lips with her handkerchief</i>).</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> (<i>in a voice which is suddenly ringing with the happiness of
hope</i>) You mustn’t feel sorry for me. Don’t you see I’m happy at
last&mdash;free&mdash;free!&mdash;freed from the farm&mdash;free to wander on and
on&mdash;eternally! (<i>He raises himself on his elbow, his face radiant, and
points to the horizon</i>) Look! Isn’t it beautiful beyond the hills? I can
hear the old voices calling me to come&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Exultantly</i>) And this time
I’m going! It isn’t the end. It’s a free beginning&mdash;the start of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span>
voyage! I’ve won to my trip&mdash;the right of release&mdash;beyond the horizon!
Oh, you ought to be glad&mdash;glad&mdash;for my sake! (<i>He collapses weakly</i>)
Andy! (<small>ANDREW</small> <i>bends down to him</i>) Remember Ruth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> I’ll take care of her, I swear to you, Rob!</p>

<p><small>ROBERT.</small> Ruth has suffered&mdash;remember, Andy&mdash;only through sacrifice&mdash;the
secret beyond there&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He suddenly raises himself with his last
remaining strength and points to the horizon where the edge of the sun’s
disc is rising from the rim of the hills</i>) The sun! (<i>He remains with
his eyes fixed on it for a moment. A rattling noise throbs from his
throat. He mumbles</i>) Remember! (<i>And falls back and is still.</i> <small>RUTH</small>
<i>gives a cry of horror and springs to her feet, shuddering, her hands
over her eyes.</i> <small>ANDREW</small> <i>bends on one knee beside the body, placing a
hand over</i> <small>ROBERT’S</small> <i>heart, then he kisses his brother reverentially on
the forehead and stands up</i>).</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>facing</i> <small>RUTH</small>, <i>the body between them&mdash;in a dead voice</i>) He’s
dead. (<i>With a sudden burst of fury</i>) God damn you, you never told him!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>piteously</i>) He was so happy without my lying to him.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>pointing to the body&mdash;trembling with the violence of his
rage</i>) This is your doing, you damn woman, you coward, you murderess!</p>

<p><small>RUTH.</small> (<i>sobbing</i>) Don’t, Andy! I couldn’t help it&mdash;and he knew how I’d
suffered, too. He told you&mdash;to remember.</p>

<p><small>ANDREW.</small> (<i>stares at her for a moment, his rage ebbing away, an
expression of deep pity gradually coming over his face. Then he glances
down at his brother and speaks brokenly in a compassionate voice</i>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128">{128}</a></span>Forgive me, Ruth&mdash;for his sake&mdash;and I’ll remember&mdash;&mdash; (<small>RUTH</small> <i>lets her
hands fall from her face and looks at him uncomprehendingly. He lifts
his eyes to hers and forces out falteringly</i>) I&mdash;you&mdash;we’ve both made a
mess of things! We must try to help each other&mdash;and&mdash;in time&mdash;we’ll come
to know what’s right&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Desperately</i>) And perhaps we&mdash;&mdash; (<i>But</i> <small>RUTH</small>,
<i>if she is aware of his words, gives no sign. She remains silent, gazing
at him dully with the sad humility of exhaustion, her mind already
sinking back into that spent calm beyond the further troubling of any
hope</i>).</p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
