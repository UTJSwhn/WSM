<h3>I</h3>

<p>It was a beautiful autumn day towards the
end of the thirties. There was in Upsala at
that time a high, yellow, two-storied house,
which stood quite alone in a little meadow on the
outskirts of the town. It was a rather desolate
and dismal-looking house, but was rendered less
so by the Virginia-creepers which grew there in
profusion, and which had crept so high up the
yellow wall on the sunny side of the house that
they completely surrounded the three windows
on the upper story.</p>

<p>At one of these windows a student was sitting,
drinking his morning coffee. He was a tall,
handsome fellow, of distinguished appearance.
His hair was brushed back from his forehead; it
curled prettily, and a lock was continually falling
into his eyes. He wore a loose, comfortable suit,
but looked rather smart all the same.</p>

<p>His room was well furnished. There was a
good sofa and comfortable chairs, a large writing-table,
a capital bookcase, but hardly any
books.</p>

<p>Before he had finished his coffee another student
entered the room. The new-comer was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
totally different-looking man. He was a short,
broad-shouldered fellow, squarely built and
strong, ugly, with a large head, thin hair, and
coarse complexion.</p>

<p>'Hede,' he said, 'I have come to have a serious
talk with you.'</p>

<p>'Has anything unpleasant happened to you?'</p>

<p>'Oh no, not to me,' the other answered; 'it is
really you it concerns.' He sat silent for a while,
and looked down. 'It is so awfully unpleasant
having to tell you.'</p>

<p>'Leave it alone, then,' suggested Hede.</p>

<p>He felt inclined to laugh at his friend's solemnity.</p>

<p>'I can't leave it alone any longer,' said his
visitor. 'I ought to have spoken to you long ago,
but it is hardly my place. You understand? I
can't help thinking you will say to yourself:
"There's Gustaf Alin, son of one of our cottagers,
thinks himself such a great man now that he can
order me about."'</p>

<p>'My dear fellow,' Hede said, 'don't imagine I
think anything of the kind. My father's father
was a peasant's son.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but no one thinks of that now,' Alin answered.
He sat there, looking awkward and
stupid, resuming every moment more and more
of his peasant manners, as if that could help him
out of his difficulty. 'When I think of the difference
there is between your family and mine, I feel
as if I ought to keep quiet; but when I remember
that it was your father who, by his help in days
gone by, enabled me to study, then I feel that I
must <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Punctuation added">speak.</span>'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Hede looked at him with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>'You had better speak out and have done with
it,' he said.</p>

<p>'The thing is,' Alin said, 'I have heard people
say that you don't do any work. They say you
have hardly opened a book during the four terms
you have been at the University. They say you
don't do anything but play on the violin the
whole day; and that I can quite believe, for you
never wanted to do anything else when you were
at school in Falu, although there you were
obliged to work.'</p>

<p>Hede straightened himself a little in his chair.
Alin grew more and more uncomfortable, but he
continued with stubborn resolution:</p>

<p>'I suppose you think that anyone owning an
estate like Munkhyttan ought to be able to do as
he likes&mdash;work if he likes, or leave it alone. If he
takes his exam., good; if he does not take his
exam., what does it matter? for in any case you
will never be anything but a landed proprietor
and iron-master. You will live at Munkhyttan
all your life. I understand quite well that is what
you must think.'</p>

<p>Hede was silent, and Alin seemed to see him
surrounded by the same wall of distinction which
in Alin's eyes had always surrounded his father,
the Squire, and his mother.</p>

<p>'But, you see, Munkhyttan is no longer what it
used to be when there was iron in the mine,' he
continued cautiously. 'The Squire knew that
very well, and that was why it was arranged before
his death that you should study. Your poor
mother knows it, too, and the whole parish knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
it. The only one who does not know anything
is you, Hede.'</p>

<p>'Don't you think I know,' Hede said a little
irritably, 'that the iron-mine cannot be worked
any longer?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes,' Alin said, 'I dare say you know that
much, but you don't know that it is all up with
the property. Think the matter over, and you
will understand that one cannot live from farming
alone at Vesterdalarne. I cannot understand
why your mother has kept it a secret from you.
But, of course, she has the sole control of the
estate, so she need not ask your advice about anything.
Everybody at home knows that she is
hard up. They say she drives about borrowing
money. I suppose she did not want to disturb
you with her troubles, but thought that she could
keep matters going until you had taken your degree.
She will not sell the estate before you have
finished, and made yourself a new home.'</p>

<p>Hede rose, and walked once or twice up and
down the floor. Then he stopped opposite Alin.</p>

<p>'But what on earth are you driving at, Alin?
Do you want to make me believe that we are not
rich?'</p>

<p>'I know quite well that, until lately, you have
been considered rich people at home,' Alin said.
'But you can understand that things must come
to an end when it is a case of always spending and
never earning anything. It was a different thing
when you had the mine.'</p>

<p>Hede sat down again.</p>

<p>'My mother would surely have told me if there
were anything the matter,' he said. 'I am grateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
to you, Alin; but you have allowed yourself
to be frightened by some silly stories.'</p>

<p>'I thought that you did not know anything,'
Alin continued obstinately. 'At Munkhyttan
your mother saves and works in order to get
the money to keep you at Upsala, and to make
it cheerful and pleasant for you when you are at
home in the vacations. And in the meantime you
are here doing nothing, because you don't know
there is trouble coming. I could not stand any
longer seeing you deceiving each other. Her
ladyship thought you were studying, and you
thought she was rich. I could not let you destroy
your prospects without saying anything.'</p>

<p>Hede sat quietly for a moment, and meditated.
Then he rose and gave Alin his hand with rather
a sad smile.</p>

<p>'You understand that I feel you are speaking
the truth, even if I <em>will</em> not believe you?
Thanks.'</p>

<p>Alin joyfully shook his hand.</p>

<p>'You must know, Hede, that if you will only
work no harm is done. With your brains, you
can take your degree in three or four years.'</p>

<p>Hede straightened himself.</p>

<p>'Do not be uneasy, Alin,' he said; 'I am
going to work hard now.'</p>

<p>Alin rose and went towards the door, but hesitated.
Before he reached it he turned round.</p>

<p>'There was something else I wanted,' he said.
He again became embarrassed. 'I want you to
lend me your violin until you have commenced
reading in earnest.'</p>

<p>'Lend you my violin?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes; pack it up in a silk handkerchief, and
put it in the case, and let me take it with me,
or otherwise you will read to no purpose. You
will begin to play as soon as I am out of the
room. You are so accustomed to it now you
cannot resist if you have it here. One cannot
get over that kind of thing unless someone helps
one; it gets the mastery over one.'</p>

<p>Hede appeared unwilling.</p>

<p>'This is madness, you know,' he said.</p>

<p>'No, Hede, it is not. You know you have inherited
it from the Squire. It runs in your blood.
Ever since you have been your own master here
in Upsala you have done nothing else but play.
You live here in the outskirts of the town simply
not to disturb anyone by your playing. You
cannot help yourself in this matter. Let me have
the violin.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Hede, 'before I could not help
playing, but now Munkhyttan is at stake; I am
more fond of my home than of my violin.'</p>

<p>But Alin was determined, and continued to ask
for the violin.</p>

<p>'What is the good of it?' Hede said. 'If I
want to play, I need not go many steps to borrow
another violin.'</p>

<p>'I know that,' Alin replied, 'but I don't think
it would be so bad with another violin. It is
your old Italian violin which is the greatest danger
for you. And besides, I would suggest your
locking yourself in for the first few days&mdash;only
until you have got fairly started.'</p>

<p>He begged and begged, but Hede resisted; he
would not stand anything so unreasonable as being
a prisoner in his own room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Alin grew crimson.</p>

<p>'I must have the violin with me,' he said, 'or
it is no use at all.' He spoke eagerly and excitedly.
'I had not intended to say anything
about it, but I know that it concerns more than
Munkhyttan. I saw a young girl at the Promotion
Ball in the spring who, people said, was engaged
to you. I don't dance, you know, but I
liked to watch her when she was dancing, looking
radiant like one of the lilies of the field. And
when I heard that she was engaged to you, I felt
sorry for her.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Because I knew that you would never succeed
if you continued as you had begun. And
then I swore that she should not have to spend
her whole life waiting for one who never came.
She should not sit and wither whilst waiting for
you. I did not want to meet her in a few years
with sharpened features and deep wrinkles round
her mouth&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly; Hede's glance had
rested so searchingly upon him.</p>

<p>But Gunnar Hede had already understood
that Alin was in love with his <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fianc&eacute;e</span></em>. It moved
him deeply that Alin under these circumstances
tried to save him, and, influenced by this feeling,
he yielded and gave him the violin.</p>

<p>When Alin had gone, Hede read desperately
for a whole hour, but then he threw away his
book.</p>

<p>It was not of much good his reading. It would
be three or four years before he could be finished,
and who could guarantee that the estate would
not be sold in the meantime?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>He felt almost with terror how deeply he loved
the old home. It was like witchery. Every
room, every tree, stood clearly before him. He
felt he could not part with any of it if he were
to be happy. And he was to sit quietly with his
books whilst all this was about to pass away from
him.</p>

<p>He became more and more restless; he felt
the blood beating in his temples as if in a fever.
And then he grew quite beside himself because
he could not take his violin and play himself calm
again.</p>

<p>'My God!' he said, 'Alin will drive me mad.
First to tell me all this, and then to take away
my violin! A man like I must feel the bow between
his fingers in sorrow and in joy. I must
do something; I must get money, but I have not
an idea in my head. I cannot think without my
violin.'</p>

<p>He could not endure the feeling of being
locked in. He was so angry with Alin, who had
thought of this absurd plan, that he was afraid
he might strike him the next time he came.</p>

<p>Of course he would have played, if he had had
the violin, for that was just what he needed. His
blood rushed so wildly, that he was nearly going
out of his mind.</p>

<p>Just as Hede was longing most for his violin
a wandering musician began to play outside. It
was an old blind man. He played out of tune
and without expression, but Hede was so overcome
by hearing a violin just at this moment
that he listened with tears in his eyes and with
his hands folded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>The next moment he flung open the window
and climbed to the ground by the help of the
creepers. He had no compunction at leaving
his work. He thought the violin had simply
come to comfort him in his misfortune.</p>

<p>Hede had probably never before begged so
humbly for anything as he did now, when he
asked the old blind man to lend him his violin.
He stood the whole time with his cap in his hand,
although the old man was blind.</p>

<p>The musician did not seem to understand what
he wanted. He turned to the young girl who
was leading him. Hede bowed to the poor girl
and repeated his request. She looked at him, as
if she must have eyes for them both. The glance
from her big eyes was so steady that Hede
thought he could feel where it struck him. It
began with his collar, and it noticed that the frills
of his shirt were well starched, then it saw that
his coat was brushed, next that his boots were
polished.</p>

<p>Hede had never before been subjected to such
close scrutiny. He saw clearly that he would not
pass muster before those eyes.</p>

<p>But it was not so, all the same. The young
girl had a strange way of smiling. Her face
was so serious, that one had the impression when
she smiled that it was the first and only time she
had ever looked happy; and now one of these
rare smiles passed over her lips. She took the
violin from the old man and handed it to
Hede.</p>

<p>'Play the waltz from "Freisch&uuml;tz," then,' she
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Hede thought it was strange that he should
have to play a waltz just at that moment, but, as
a matter of fact, it was all the same to him what
he played, if he could only have a bow in his
hand. That was all he wanted. The violin at
once began to comfort him; it spoke to him in
faint, cracked tones.</p>

<p>'I am only a poor man's violin,' it said; 'but
such as I am, I am a comfort and help to a poor
blind man. I am the light and the colour and
the brightness in his life. It is I who must comfort
him in his poverty and old age and blindness.'</p>

<p>Hede felt that the terrible depression that had
cowed his hopes began to give way.</p>

<p>'You are young and strong,' the violin said to
him. 'You can fight and strive; you can hold
fast that which tries to escape you. Why are you
downcast and without courage?'</p>

<p>Hede had played with lowered eyes; now he
threw back his head and looked at those who
stood around him. There was quite a crowd of
children and people from the street, who had
come into the yard to listen to the music. It appeared,
however, that they had not come solely
for the sake of the music. The blind man and
his companion were not the only ones in the
troupe.</p>

<p>Opposite Hede stood a figure in tights and
spangles, and with bare arms crossed over his
chest. He looked old and worn, but Hede
could not help thinking that he looked a devil of
a fellow with his high chest and long moustaches.
And beside him stood his wife, little and fat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
not so very young either, but beaming with joy
over her spangles and flowing gauze skirts.</p>

<p>During the first bars of the music they stood
still and counted, then a gracious smile passed
over their faces, and they took each other's
hands and began to dance on a small carpet.
And Hede saw that during all the equilibristic
tricks they now performed the woman stood almost
still, whilst her husband did all the work.
He sprang over her, and twirled round her, and
vaulted over her. The woman scarcely did
anything else but kiss her hand to the spectators.</p>

<p>But Hede did not really take much notice of
them. His bow began to fly over the strings.
It told him that there was happiness in fighting
and overcoming. It almost deemed him happy
because everything was at stake for him. Hede
stood there, playing courage and hope into himself,
and did not think of the old tight-rope
dancers.</p>

<p>But suddenly he saw that they grew restless.
They no longer smiled; they left off kissing their
hands to the spectators; the acrobat made mistakes,
and his wife began to sway to and fro in
waltz time.</p>

<p>Hede played more and more eagerly. He left
off 'Freisch&uuml;tz' and rushed into an old 'Nixie
Polka,' one which generally sent all the people
mad when played at the peasant festivals.</p>

<p>The old tight-rope dancers quite lost their
heads. They stood in breathless astonishment,
and at last they could resist no longer. They
sprang into each other's arms, and then they began
to dance a waltz in the middle of the carpet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>How they danced! dear me, how they danced!
They took small, tripping steps, and whirled
round in a small circle; they hardly went outside
the carpet, and their faces beamed with joy
and delight. There was the happiness of youth
and the rapture of love over these two old people.</p>

<p>The whole crowd was jubilant at seeing them
dance. The serious little companion of the blind
man smiled all over her face, and Hede grew
much excited.</p>

<p>Just fancy what an effect his violin could have!
It made people quite forget themselves. It was
a great power to have at his disposal. Any moment
he liked he could take possession of his
kingdom. Only a couple of years' study abroad
with a great master, and he could go all over the
world, and by his playing earn riches and honour
and fame.</p>

<p>It seemed to Hede that these acrobats must
have come to tell him this. That was the road
he should follow; it lay before him clear and
smooth. He said to himself: 'I will&mdash;I <em>will</em> become
a musician! I <em>must</em> be one! This is better
than studying. I can charm my fellow-men with
my violin; I can become rich.'</p>

<p>Hede stopped playing. The acrobats at once
came up and complimented him. The man said
his name was Blomgren. That was his real
name; he had other names when he performed.
He and his wife were old circus people. Mrs.
Blomgren in former days had been called Miss
Viola, and had performed on horseback; and
although they had now left the circus, they were
still true artists&mdash;artists body and soul. That he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
had probably already noticed; that was why they
could not resist his violin.</p>

<p>Hede walked about with the acrobats for a
couple of hours. He could not part with the
violin, and the old artists' enthusiasm for their
profession appealed to him. He was simply testing
himself. 'I want to find out whether there
is the proper stuff for an artist in me. I want to
see if I can call forth enthusiasm. I want to
see whether I can make children and idlers follow
me from house to house.'</p>

<p>On their way from house to house Mr. Blomgren
threw an old threadbare mantle around him,
and Mrs. Blomgren enveloped herself in a brown
cloak. Thus arrayed, they walked at Hede's side
and talked.</p>

<p>Mr. Blomgren would not speak of all the
honour he and Mrs. Blomgren had received during
the time they had performed in a real circus;
but the <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">directeur</span></em> had given Mrs. Blomgren her
dismissal under the pretence that she was getting
too stout. Mr. Blomgren had not been dismissed:
he had himself resigned his position.
Surely no one could think that Mr. Blomgren
would remain with a <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">directeur</span></em> who had dismissed
his wife!</p>

<p>Mrs. Blomgren loved her art, and for her sake
Mr. Blomgren had made up his mind to live as a
free artist, so that she could still continue to perform.
During the winter, when it was too cold
to give performances in the street, they performed
in a tent. They had a very comprehensive
repertoire. They gave pantomimes, and
were jugglers and conjurers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>The circus had cast them off, but Art had not,
said Mr. Blomgren. They served Art always.
It was well worth being faithful to Art, even unto
death. Always artists&mdash;always. That was Mr.
Blomgren's opinion, and it was also Mrs. Blomgren's.</p>

<p>Hede walked quietly and listened. His
thoughts flew restlessly from plan to plan. Sometimes
events happen which become like symbols,
like signs, which one must obey. There must be
some meaning in what had now happened to
him. If he could only understand it rightly, it
might help him towards arriving at a wise resolution.</p>

<p>Mr. Blomgren asked the student to notice the
young girl who was leading the blind man. Had
he ever before seen such eyes? Did he not think
that such eyes must mean something? Could
one have those eyes without being intended for
something great?</p>

<p>Hede turned round and looked at the little pale
girl. Yes, she had eyes like stars, set in a sad
and rather thin face.</p>

<p>'Our Lord knows always what He is about,'
said Mrs. Blomgren; 'and I also believe that He
has some reason for letting such an artist as Mr.
Blomgren perform in the street. But what was
He thinking about when He gave that girl those
eyes and that smile?'</p>

<p>'I will tell you something,' said Mr. Blomgren;
'she has not the slightest talent for Art.
And with those eyes!'</p>

<p>Hede had a suspicion that they were not talking
to him, but simply for the benefit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
young girl. She was walking just behind them,
and could hear every word.</p>

<p>'She is not more than thirteen years old, and
not by any means too old to learn something;
but, impossible&mdash;impossible, without the slightest
talent! If one does not want to waste one's
time, sir, teach her to sew, but not to stand on
her head. Her smile makes people quite mad
about her,' Mr. Blomgren continued. 'Simply
on account of her smile she has had many offers
from families wishful to adopt her. She could
grow up in a well-to-do home if she would only
leave her grandfather. But what does she want
with a smile that makes people mad about her,
when she will never appear either on horseback
or on a trapeze?'</p>

<p>'We know other artists,' said Mrs. Blomgren,
'who pick up children in the street and train them
for the profession when they cannot perform any
longer themselves. There is more than one who
has been lucky enough to create a star and obtain
immense salaries for her. But Mr. Blomgren
and I have never thought of the money; we have
only thought of some day seeing Ingrid flying
through a hoop whilst the whole circus resounded
with applause. For us it would have
been as if we were beginning life over again.'</p>

<p>'Why do we keep her grandfather?' said Mr.
Blomgren. 'Is he an artist fit for us? We
could, no doubt, have got a previous member of
a Hofkapell if we had wished. But we love that
child; we cannot do without her; we keep the
old man for her sake.'</p>

<p>'Is it not naughty of her that she will not allow
us to make an artist of her?' they said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Hede turned round. The little girl's face wore
an expression of suffering and patience. He
could see that she knew that anyone who could
not dance on the tight-rope was a stupid and
contemptible person.</p>

<p>At the same moment they came to another
house, but before they began their performance
Hede sat down on an overturned wheelbarrow
and began to preach. He defended the poor
little girl. He reproached Mr. and Mrs. Blomgren
for wishing to hand her over to the great,
cruel public, who would love and applaud her
for a time, but when she grew old and worn out,
they would let her trudge along the streets in
rain and cold. No; he or she was artist enough,
who made a fellow-being happy. Ingrid should
only have eyes and smiles for one, should keep
them for one only; and this one should never
leave her, but give her a safe home as long as he
lived.</p>

<p>Tears came into Hede's eyes whilst he spoke.
He spoke more to himself than to the others.
He felt it suddenly as something terrible to be
thrust out into the world, to be severed from the
quiet home-life. He saw that the great, star-like
eyes of the girl began to sparkle. It seemed as
if she had understood every single word. It
seemed as if she again felt the right to live.</p>

<p>But Mr. Blomgren and his wife had become
very serious. They pressed Hede's hand and
promised him that they would never again try
and persuade the little girl to become an artist.
She should be allowed to lead the life she wished.
He had touched them. They were artists&mdash;artists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
body and soul; they understood what he
meant when he spoke of love and faithfulness.</p>

<p>Then Hede parted from them and went home.
He no longer tried to find any secret meaning
in his adventure. After all, it had meant nothing
more than that he should save this poor sorrowful
child from always grieving over her incapacity.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Munkhyttan, the home of Gunnar Hede, was
situated in a poor parish in the forests of Vesterdalarne.
It was a large, thinly-populated parish,
with which Nature had dealt very stingily. There
were stony, forest-covered hills, and many
small lakes. The people could not possibly
have earned a livelihood there had they not had
the right to travel about the country as pedlars.
But to make up for it, the whole of this poor
district was full of old tales of how poor peasant
lads and lassies had gone into the world with a
pack of goods on their backs, to return in gilded
coaches, with the boxes under the seats filled
with money.</p>

<p>One of the very best stories was about Hede's
grandfather. He was the son of a poor musician,
and had grown up with his violin in his
hand, and when he was seventeen years old he
had gone out into the world with his pack on
his back. But wherever he went his violin had
helped him in his business. He had by turns
gathered people together by his music and sold
them silk handkerchiefs, combs, and pins. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
his trading had been brought about with music
and merriment, and things had gone so well with
him that he had at last been able to buy Munkhyttan,
with its mine and ironworks, from the
poverty-stricken Baron who then owned the
property. Then he became the Squire, and the
pretty daughter of the Baron became his wife.</p>

<p>From that time the old family, as they were
always called, had thought of nothing else but
beautifying the place. They removed the main
building on to the beautiful island which lay on
the edge of a small lake, round which lay their
fields and their mines. The upper story had
been added in their time, for they wanted to have
plenty of room for their numerous guests; and
they had also added the two large flights of
steps outside. They had planted ornamental
trees all over the fir-covered island. They had
made small winding pathways in the stony soil,
and on the most beautiful spots they had built
small pavilions, hanging like large birds'-nests
over the lake. The beautiful French roses that
grew on the terrace, the Dutch furniture, the
Italian violin, had all been brought to the house
by them. And it was they who had built the
wall protecting the orchard from the north wind,
and the conservatory.</p>

<p>The old family were merry, kind-hearted, old-fashioned
people. The Squire's wife certainly
liked to be a little aristocratic; but that was not at
all in the old Squire's line. In the midst of all
the luxury which surrounded him he never
forgot what he had been, and in the room where
he transacted his business, and where people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
came and went, the pack and the red-painted,
home-made violin were hung right above the
old man's desk.</p>

<p>Even after his death the pack and the violin
remained in the same place. And every time
the old man's son and grandson saw them their
hearts swelled with gratitude. It was these two
poor implements that had created Munkhyttan,
and Munkhyttan was the best thing in the world.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason might be&mdash;and it was
probably because it seemed natural to the place
that one lived a good, genial life there, free from
trouble&mdash;Hede's family clung to the place with
greater love than was good for it. And more
especially Gunnar Hede was so strongly attached
to it that people said that it was incorrect
to say of him that he owned an estate.
On the contrary, it was an old estate in Vesterdalarne
that owned Gunnar Hede.</p>

<p>If he had not made himself a slave of an old
rambling manor-house and some acres of land
and forest, and some stunted apple-trees, he
would probably have continued his studies, or,
better still, gone abroad to study music, which,
after all, was no doubt his proper vocation in
this world. But when he returned from Upsala,
and it became clear to him that they really would
have to sell the estate if he could not soon earn
a lot of money, he decided upon giving up all
his other plans, and made up his mind to go
out into the world as a pedlar, as his grandfather
before him had done.</p>

<p>His mother and his <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fianc&eacute;e</span></em> besought him
rather to sell the place than to sacrifice himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
for it in this manner, but he was not to be moved.
He put on peasant's attire, bought goods, and
began to travel about the country as a pedlar.
He thought that if he only traded a couple of
years he could earn enough to pay the debt and
save the estate.</p>

<p>And as far as the latter was concerned he
was successful enough. But he brought upon
himself a terrible misfortune.</p>

<p>When he had walked about with his pack for
a year or so he thought that he would try and
earn a large sum of money at one stroke. He
went far north and bought a large flock of
goats, about a couple of hundred. And he
and a comrade intended to drive them down to
a large fair in Vermland, where goats cost twice
as much as in the north. If he succeeded in
selling all his goats, he would do a very good
business.</p>

<p>It was in the beginning of November, and
there had not yet been any snow, when Hede
and his comrade set out with their goats. The
first day everything went well with them, but
the second day, when they came to the great
Fifty-Mile Forest, it began to snow. Much
snow fell, and it stormed and blew severely. It
was not long before it became difficult for the
animals to make their way through the snow.
Goats are certainly both plucky and hardy animals,
and the herd struggled on for a considerable
time; but the snow-storm lasted two days
and two nights, and it was terribly cold.</p>

<p>Hede did all he could to save the animals,
but after the snow began to fall he could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
them neither food nor water. And when they
had worked their way through deep snow for
a whole day they became very footsore. Their
feet hurt them, and they would not go any
longer. The first goat that threw itself down
by the roadside and would not get up again
and follow the herd Hede lifted on to his
shoulder so as not to leave it behind. But when
another and again another lay down he could
not carry them. There was nothing to do but
to look the other way and go on.</p>

<p>Do you know what the Fifty-Mile Forest is
like? Not a farmhouse, not a cottage, mile after
mile, only forest; tall-stemmed fir-trees, with
bark as hard as wood, and high branches; no
young trees with soft bark and soft twigs that
the animals could eat. If there had been no
snow, they could have got through the forest
in a couple of days; now they could not get
through it at all. All the goats were left there,
and the men too nearly perished. They did
not meet a single human being the whole time.
No one helped them.</p>

<p>Hede tried to throw the snow to one side
so that the goats could eat the moss; but the
snow fell so thickly, and the moss was frozen
fast to the ground. And how could he get food
for two hundred animals in this way?</p>

<p>He bore it bravely until the goats began to
moan. The first day they were a lively, rather
noisy herd. He had had hard work to make
them all keep together, and prevent them from
butting each other to death. But when they
seemed to understand that they could not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
saved their nature changed, and they completely
lost their courage. They all began to bleat and
moan, not faintly and peevishly, as goats usually
do, but loudly, louder and louder as the danger
increased. And when Hede heard their cries he
felt quite desperate.</p>

<p>They were in the midst of the wild, desolate
forest; there was no help whatever obtainable.
Goat after goat dropped down by the roadside.
The snow gathered round them and covered
them. When Hede looked back at this row of
drifts by the wayside, each hiding the body of
an animal, of which one could still see the projecting
horns and the hoofs, then his brain began
to give way.</p>

<p>He rushed at the animals, which allowed
themselves to be covered by the snow, swung
his whip over them, and hit them. It was the
only way to save them, but they did not stir.
He took them by the horns and dragged them
along. They allowed themselves to be dragged,
but they did not move a foot themselves. When
he let go his hold of their horns, they licked
his hands, as if beseeching him to help them.
As soon as he went up to them they licked his
hands.</p>

<p>All this had such a strong effect upon Hede
that he felt he was on the point of going out
of his mind.</p>

<p>It is not certain, however, that things would
have gone so badly with him had he not, after
it was all over in the forest, gone to see one
whom he loved dearly. It was not his mother,
but his sweetheart. He thought himself that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
he had gone there because he ought to tell
her at once that he had lost so much money
that he would not be able to marry for many
years. But no doubt he went to see her solely
to hear her say that she loved him quite as
much in spite of his misfortunes. He thought
that she could drive away the memory of the
Fifty-Mile Forest.</p>

<p>She could, perhaps, have done this, but she
would not. She was already displeased because
Hede went about with a pack and looked like
a peasant; she thought that for that reason
alone it was difficult to love him as much as
before. Now, when he told her that he must
still go on doing this for many years, she said
that she could no longer wait for him. This
last blow was too much for Hede; his mind
gave way.</p>

<p>He did not grow quite mad, however; he retained
so much of his senses that he could attend
to his business. He even did better than others,
for it amused people to make fun of him; he
was always welcome at the peasants' houses.
People plagued and teased him, but that was
in a way good for him, as he was so anxious
to become rich. And in the course of a few
years he had earned enough to pay all his debts,
and he could have lived free from worry on his
estate. But this he did not understand; he
went about half-witted and silly from farm to
farm, and he had no longer any idea to what
class of people he really belonged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Raglanda was the name of a parish in the
north of East Vermland, near the borders of
Dalarne, where the Dean had a large house,
but the pastor only a small and poor one. But
poor as they were at the small parsonage, they
had been charitable enough to adopt a poor
girl. She was a little girl, Ingrid by name,
and she had come to the parsonage when she
was thirteen years old.</p>

<p>The pastor had accidentally seen her at a
fair, where she sat crying outside the tent of
some acrobats. He had stopped and asked her
why she was crying, and she had told him that
her blind grandfather was dead, and that she
had no relatives left. She now travelled with
a couple of acrobats, and they were good to
her, but she cried because she was so stupid
that she could never learn to dance on the tight-rope
and help to earn any money.</p>

<p>There was a sorrowful grace over the child
which touched the pastor's heart. He said at
once to himself that he could not allow such a
little creature to go to the bad amongst these
wandering tramps. He went into the tent, where
he saw Mr. and Mrs. Blomgren, and offered to
take the child home with him. The old acrobats
began to weep, and said that although the girl
was entirely unfitted for the profession, they
would so very much like to keep her; but at
the same time they thought she would be happier
in a real home with people who lived in the same
place all the year round, and therefore they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
willing to give her up to the pastor if he would
only promise them that she should be like one
of his own children.</p>

<p>This he had promised, and from that time the
young girl had lived at the parsonage. She was
a quiet, gentle child, full of love and tender care
for those around her. At first her adopted
parents loved her very dearly, but as she grew
older she developed a strong inclination to lose
herself in dreams and fancies. She lived in a
world of visions, and in the middle of the day
she could let her work fall and be lost in dreams.
But the pastor's wife, who was a clever and
hard-working woman, did not approve of this.
She found fault with the young girl for being
lazy and slow, and tormented her by her severity
so that she became timid and unhappy.</p>

<p>When she had completed her nineteenth year,
she fell dangerously ill. They did not quite
know what was the matter with her, for this
happened long ago, when there was no doctor
at Raglanda, but the girl was very ill. They
soon saw she was so ill that she could not live.</p>

<p>She herself did nothing but pray to God that
He would take her away from this world. She
would so like to die, she said.</p>

<p>Then it seemed as if our Lord would try
whether she was in earnest. One night she felt
that she grew stiff and cold all over her body,
and a heavy lethargy fell upon her. 'I think
this must be death,' she said to herself.</p>

<p>But the strange thing was that she did not
quite lose consciousness. She knew that she lay
as if she were dead, knew that they wrapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
her in her shroud and laid her in her coffin,
but she felt no fear of being buried, although
she was still alive. She had but the one thought
that she was happy because she was about to
die and leave this troublesome life.</p>

<p>The only thing she was uneasy about was
lest they should discover that she was not really
dead and would not bury her. Life must have
been very bitter to her, inasmuch as she felt
no fear of death whatever.</p>

<p>But no one discovered that she was living.
She was conveyed to the church, carried to the
churchyard, and lowered into the grave.</p>

<p>The grave, however, was not filled in; she
had been buried before the service on Sunday
morning, as was the custom at Raglanda. The
mourners had gone into church after the funeral,
and the coffin was left in the open grave; but
as soon as the service was over they would
come back, and help the grave-digger to fill
in the grave.</p>

<p>The young girl knew everything that happened,
but felt no fear. She had not been able
to make the slightest movement to show that
she was alive, even if she had wanted to; but
even if she had been able to move, she would
not have done so; the whole time she was happy
because she was as good as dead.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, one could hardly say
that she was alive. She had neither the use of
her mind nor of her senses. It was only that
part of the soul which dreams dreams during
the night that was still living within her.</p>

<p>She could not even think enough to realize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
how terrible it would be for her to awake when
the grave was filled in. She had no more power
over her mind than has one who dreams.</p>

<p>'I should like to know,' she thought, 'if there
is anything in the whole wide world that could
make me wish to live.'</p>

<p>As soon as that thought rushed through her
it seemed to her as if the lid of the coffin, and
the handkerchief which had been placed over
her face, became transparent, and she saw before
her riches and beautiful raiment, and lovely
gardens with delicious fruits.</p>

<p>'No, I do not care for any of these things,'
she said, and she closed her eyes for their
glories.</p>

<p>When she again looked up they had disappeared,
but instead she saw quite distinctly a
little angel of God sitting on the edge of the
grave.</p>

<p>'Good-morning, thou little angel of God,' she
said to him.</p>

<p>'Good-morning, Ingrid,' the angel said.
'Whilst thou art lying here doing nothing, I
would like to speak a little with thee about days
gone by.'</p>

<p>Ingrid heard distinctly every word the angel
said; but his voice was not like anything she
had ever heard before. It was more like a
stringed instrument; it was not like singing,
but like the tones of a violin or the clang of
a harp.</p>

<p>'Ingrid,' the angel said, 'dost thou remember,
whilst thy grandfather was still living, that thou
once met a young student, who went with thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
from house to house playing the whole day on
thy grandfather's violin?'</p>

<p>The girl's face was lighted by a smile.</p>

<p>'Dost thou think I have forgotten this?' she
said. 'Ever since that time no day has passed
when I have not thought of him.'</p>

<p>'And no night when thou hast not dreamt
of him?'</p>

<p>'No, not a night when I have not dreamt of
him.'</p>

<p>'And thou wilt die, although thou rememberest
him so well,' said the angel. 'Then thou
wilt never be able to see him again.'</p>

<p>When he said this it was as if the dead girl
felt all the happiness of love, but even that could
not tempt her.</p>

<p>'No, no,' she said; 'I am afraid to live; I
would rather die.'</p>

<p>Then the angel waved his hand, and Ingrid
saw before her a wide waste of desert. There
were no trees, and the desert was barren and
dry and hot, and extended in all directions
without any limits. In the sand there lay, here
and there, objects which at the first glance
looked like pieces of rock, but when she examined
them more closely, she saw they were
the immense living animals of fairy tales, with
huge claws and great jaws, with sharp teeth;
they lay in the sand, watching for prey. And
between these terrible animals the student came
walking along. He went quite fearlessly, without
suspecting that the figures around him were
living.</p>

<p>'But warn him! do warn him!' Ingrid said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
to the angel in unspeakable fear. 'Tell him that
they are living, and that he must take care.'</p>

<p>'I am not allowed to speak to him,' said the
angel with his clear voice; 'thou must thyself
warn him.'</p>

<p>The apparently dead girl felt with horror that
she lay powerless, and could not rush to save
the student. She made one futile effort after
the other to raise herself, but the impotence of
death bound her. But then at last, at last, she
felt her heart begin to beat, the blood rushed
through her veins, the stiffness of death was
loosened in her body. She arose and hastened
towards him.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It is quite certain the sun loves the open
places outside the small village churches. Has
no one ever noticed that one never sees so
much sunshine as during the morning service
outside a small, whitewashed church? Nowhere
else does one see such radiant streams of light,
nowhere else is the air so devoutly quiet. The
sun simply keeps watch that no one remains
on the church hill gossiping. It wants them all
to sit quietly in church and listen to the sermon&mdash;that
is why it sends such a wealth of sunny
rays on to the ground outside the church wall.</p>

<p>Perhaps one must not take it for granted
that the sun keeps watch outside the small
churches every Sunday; but so much is certain,
that the morning Ingrid had been placed
in the grave in the churchyard at Raglanda,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
it spread a burning heat over the open space
outside the church. Even the flint stones
looked as if they might take fire as they lay
and sparkled in the wheel-ruts. The short,
down-trodden grass curled, so that it looked
like dry moss, whilst the yellow dandelions
which grew amongst the grass spread themselves
out on their long stems, so that they
became as large as asters.</p>

<p>A man from Dalarne came wandering along
the road&mdash;one of those men who go about selling
knives and scissors. He was clad in a
long, white sheep-skin coat, and on his back
he had a large black leather pack. He had
been walking with this burden for several hours
without finding it too hot, but when he had
left the highroad, and came to the open place
outside the church, he stopped and took off
his hat in order to dry the perspiration from
his forehead.</p>

<p>As the man stood there bare-headed, he
looked both handsome and clever. His forehead
was high and white, with a deep wrinkle
between the eyebrows; the mouth was well
formed, with thin lips. His hair was parted
in the middle; it was cut short at the back,
but hung over his ears, and was inclined to
curl. He was tall, and strongly, but not coarsely,
built; in every respect well proportioned. But
what was wrong about him was his glance,
which was unsteady, and the pupils of his eyes
rolled restlessly, and were drawn far into the
sockets, as if to hide themselves. There was
something drawn about the mouth, something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
dull and heavy, which did not seem to belong
to the face.</p>

<p>He could not be quite right, either, or he
would not have dragged that heavy pack about
on a Sunday. If he had been quite in his
senses, he would have known that it was of
no use, as he could not sell anything in any
case. None of the other men from Dalarne
who walked about from village to village bent
their backs under this burden on a Sunday,
but they went to the house of God free and
erect as other men.</p>

<p>But this poor fellow probably did not know
it was a holy day until he stood in the sunshine
outside the church and heard the singing.
He was sensible enough at once to understand
that he could not do any business, and
then his brain began to work as to how he
should spend the day.</p>

<p>He stood for a long time and stared in front
of him. When everything went its usual course,
he had no difficulty in managing. He was not
so bad but that he could go from farm to farm
all through the week and attend to his business,
but he never could get accustomed to
the Sunday&mdash;that always came upon him as a
great, unexpected trouble.</p>

<p>His eyes became quite fixed, and the muscles
of his forehead swelled.</p>

<p>The first thought that took shape in his brain
was that he should go into the church and
listen to the singing, but he would not accept
this suggestion. He was very fond of singing,
but he dared not go into the church. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
was not afraid of human beings, but in some
churches there were such quaint, uncanny pictures,
which represented creatures of which he
would rather not think.</p>

<p>At last his brain worked round to the thought
that, as this was a church, there would probably
also be a churchyard, and when he could
take refuge in a churchyard all was well. One
could not offer him anything better. If on his
wanderings he saw a churchyard, he always went
in and sat there awhile, even if it were in the
middle of a workaday week.</p>

<p>Now that he wanted to go to the churchyard
a new difficulty suddenly arose. The
burial-place at Raglanda does not lie quite
near the church, which is built on a hill, but
on the other side of the road; and he could
not get to the entrance of the churchyard without
passing along the road where the horses
of the church-goers were standing tied up.</p>

<p>All the horses stood with their heads deep
in bundles of hay and nosebags, chewing. There
was no question of their being able to do the
man any harm, but he had his own ideas as
to the danger of going past such a long row of
animals.</p>

<p>Two or three times he made an attempt, but
his courage failed him, so that he was obliged
to turn back. He was not afraid that the
horses would bite or kick. It was quite enough
for him that they were so near that they could
see him. It was quite enough that they could
shake their bridles and scrape the earth with
their hoofs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>At last a moment came when all the horses
were looking down, and seemed to be eating
for a wager. Then he began to make his way
between them. He held his sheepskin cloak
tightly around him so that it should not flap
and betray him, and he went on tiptoe as lightly
as he could. When a horse raised its eyelid
and looked at him, he at once stopped and
curtsied. He wanted to be polite in this great
danger, but surely animals were amenable to
reason, and could understand that he could not
bow when he had a pack full of hardware upon
his back; he could only curtsy.</p>

<p>He sighed deeply, for in this world it was
a sad and troublesome thing to be so afraid of
all four-footed animals as he was. He was
really not afraid of any other animals than
goats, and he would not have been at all afraid
of horses and dogs and cats had he only been
quite sure that they were not a kind of transformed
goats. But he never was quite sure of
that, so as a matter of fact it was just as bad
for him as if he had been afraid of all kinds of
four-footed animals.</p>

<p>It was no use his thinking of how strong he
was, and that these small peasant horses never
did any harm to anyone: he who has become
possessed of such fears cannot reason with himself.
Fear is a heavy burden, and it is hard for
him who must always carry it.</p>

<p>It was strange that he managed to get past
all the horses. The last few steps he took in
two long jumps, and when he got into the
churchyard he closed the gate after him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
began to threaten the horses with his clenched
fist.</p>

<p>'You wretched, miserable, accursed goats!'</p>

<p>He did that to all animals. He could not
help calling them goats, and that was very stupid
of him, for it had procured him a name which
he did not like. Everyone who met him called
him the 'Goat.' But he would not own to this
name. He wanted to be called by his proper
name, but apparently no one knew his real name
in that district.</p>

<p>He stood a little while at the gate, rejoicing
at having escaped from the horses, but he soon
went further into the churchyard. At every
cross and every stone he stopped and curtsied,
but this was not from fear: this was simply
from joy at seeing these dear old friends. All
at once he began to look quite gentle and mild.
They were exactly the same crosses and stones
he had so often seen before. They looked just
as usual. How well he knew them again! He
must say 'Good-morning' to them.</p>

<p>How nice it was in the churchyard! There
were no animals about there, and there were
no people to make fun of him. It was best
there, when it was quite quiet as now; but
even if there were people, they did not disturb
him. He certainly knew many pretty meadows
and woods which he liked still better, but there
he was never left in peace. They could not by
any means compare with the churchyard. And
the churchyard was better than the forest, for
in the forest the loneliness was so great that
he was frightened by it. Here it was quiet, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
in the depths of the forest; but he was not
without company. Here people were sleeping
under every stone and every mound; just the
company he wanted in order not to feel lonely
and strange.</p>

<p>He went straight to the open grave. He
went there partly because there were some
shady trees, and partly because he wanted company.
He thought, perhaps, that the dead who
had so recently been laid in the grave might
be a better protection against his loneliness than
those who had passed away long ago.</p>

<p>He bent his knees, with his back to the great
mound of earth at the edge of the grave, and
succeeded in pushing the pack upwards, so that
it stood firmly on the mound, and he then
loosened the heavy straps that fastened it. It
was a great day&mdash;a holiday. He also took off
his coat. He sat down on the grass with a
feeling of great pleasure, so close to the grave
that his long legs, with the stockings tied under
the knee, and the heavy laced shoes dangled over
the edge of the grave.</p>

<p>For a while he sat still, with his eyes steadily
fixed upon the coffin. When one was possessed
by such fear as he was, one could not
be too careful. But the coffin did not move
in the least; it was impossible to suspect it of
containing any snare.</p>

<p>He was no sooner certain of this than he put
his hand into a side-pocket of the pack and took
out a violin and bow, and at the same time he
nodded to the dead in the grave. As he was
so quiet he should hear something pretty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>This was something very unusual for him.
There were not many who were allowed to hear
him play. No one was ever allowed to hear
him play at the farms, where they set the dogs
at him and called him the 'Goat'; but sometimes
he would play in a house where they
spoke softly, and went about quietly, and did
not ask him if he wanted to buy any goat-skins.
At such places he took out his violin
and treated them to some music; and this was
a great favour&mdash;the greatest he could bestow
upon anybody.</p>

<p>As he sat there and played at the edge of
the grave it did not sound amiss; he did not
play a wrong note, and he played so softly and
gently that it could hardly be heard at the next
grave. The strange thing about it was that it
was not the man who could play, but it was
his violin that could remember some small
melodies. They came forth from the violin as
soon as he let the bow glide over it. It might
not, perhaps, have meant so much to others,
but for him, who could not remember a single
tune, it was the most precious gift of all to possess
such a violin that could play by itself.</p>

<p>Whilst he played he sat with a beaming
smile on his face. It was the violin that
spoke and spoke; he only listened. Was it not
strange that one heard all these beautiful things
as soon as one let the bow glide over the strings?
The violin did that. It knew how it ought to
be, and the Dalar man only sat and listened.
Melodies grew out of that violin as grass grows
out of the earth. No one could understand how
it happened. Our Lord had ordered it so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dalar man intended to remain sitting
there the whole day, and let the dear tunes grow
out of the violin like small white and many-coloured
flowers. He would play a whole
meadowful of flowers, play a whole long valleyful,
a whole wide plain.</p>

<p>But she who lay in the coffin distinctly heard
the violin, and upon her it had a strange effect.
The tones had made her dream, and what she
had seen in her dreams caused her such emotion
that her heart began to beat, her blood to flow,
and she awoke.</p>

<p>But all she had lived through while she lay
there, apparently dead, the thoughts she had had,
and also her last dream&mdash;everything vanished
in the same moment she awoke to consciousness.
She did not even know that she was lying
in her coffin, but thought she was still lying ill
at home in her bed. She only thought it strange
that she was still alive. A little while ago, before
she fell asleep, she had been in the pangs of
death. Surely, all must have been over with
her long ago. She had taken leave of her
adopted parents, and of her brothers and sisters,
and of the servants. The Dean had been there
himself to administer the last Communion, for
her adopted father did not think he could bear
to give it to her himself. For several days she
had put away all earthly thoughts from her mind.
It was incomprehensible that she was not dead.</p>

<p>She wondered why it was so dark in the room
where she lay. There had been a light all the
other nights during her illness. And then they
had let the blankets fall off the bed. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
lying there getting as cold as ice. She raised
herself a little to pull the blankets over her.
In doing so she knocked her head against the
lid of the coffin, and fell back with a little scream
of pain. She had knocked herself rather severely,
and immediately became unconscious
again. She lay as motionless as before, and it
seemed as if life had again left her.</p>

<p>The Dalar man, who had heard both the
knock and the cry, immediately laid down his
violin and sat listening; but there was nothing
more to be heard&mdash;nothing whatever. He began
again to look at the coffin as attentively
as before. He sat nodding his head, as if he
would say 'Yes' to what he was himself thinking
about, namely, that nothing in this world
was to be depended upon. Here he had had
the best and most silent of comrades, but had
he not also been disappointed in him?</p>

<p>He sat and looked at the coffin, as if trying
to see right through it. At last, when it continued
quite still, he took his violin again and
began to play. But the violin would not play
any longer. However gently and tenderly he
drew his bow, there came forth no melody. This
was so sad that he was nearly crying. He had
intended to sit still and listen to his violin the
whole day, and now it would not play any more.</p>

<p>He could quite understand the reason. The
violin was uneasy and afraid of what had moved
in the coffin. It had forgotten all its melodies,
and thought only of what it could be that had
knocked at the coffin-lid. That is how it is
one forgets everything when one is afraid. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
saw that he would have to quiet the violin if he
wanted to hear more.</p>

<p>He had felt so happy, more so than for many
years. If there was really anything bad in the
coffin, would it not be better to let it out? Then
the violin would be glad, and beautiful flowers
would again grow out of it.</p>

<p>He quickly opened his big pack, and began
to rummage amongst his knives and saws and
hammers until he found a screw-driver. In
another moment he was down in the grave on
his knees and unscrewing the coffin-lid. He
took out one screw after the other, until at last
he could raise the lid against the side of the
grave; at the same moment the handkerchief
fell from off the face of the apparently dead girl.
As soon as the fresh air reached Ingrid, she
opened her eyes. Now she saw that it was
light. They must have removed her. Now
she was lying in a yellow chamber with a green
ceiling, and a large chandelier was hanging from
the ceiling. The chamber was small, but the
bed was still smaller. Why had she the sensation
of her arms and legs being tied? Was
it because she should lie still in the little narrow
bed? It was strange that they had placed a
hymn-book under her chin; they only did that
with corpses. Between her fingers she had a
little bouquet. Her adopted mother had cut
a few sprigs from her flowering myrtle, and
laid them in her hands. Ingrid was very much
surprised. What had come to her adopted
mother? She saw that they had given her a
pillow with broad lace, and a fine hem-stitched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
sheet. She was very glad of that; she liked to
have things nice. Still, she would rather have
had a warm blanket over her. It could surely
not be good for a sick person to lie without a
blanket. Ingrid was nearly putting her hands
to her eyes and beginning to cry, she was so
bitterly cold. At the same moment she felt
something hard and cold against her cheek.
She could not help smiling. It was the old,
red wooden horse, the old three-legged Camilla,
that lay beside her on the pillow. Her little
brother, who could never sleep at night without
having it with him in his bed, had put it in
her bed. It was very sweet of her little brother.
Ingrid felt still more inclined to cry when she
understood that her little brother had wanted
to comfort her with his wooden horse.</p>

<p>But she did not get so far as crying. The
truth all at once flashed upon her. Her little
brother had given her the wooden horse, and
her mother had given her her white myrtle flowers,
and the hymn-book had been placed under
her chin, because they had thought she was dead.</p>

<p>Ingrid took hold of the sides of the coffin
with both hands and raised herself. The little
narrow bed was a coffin, and the little narrow
chamber was a grave. It was all very difficult
to understand. She could not understand that
this concerned her, that it was she who had
been swathed like a corpse and placed in the
grave. She must be lying all the same in her
bed, and be seeing or dreaming all this. She
would soon find out that this was no reality,
but that everything was as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>All at once she found the explanation of the
whole thing&mdash;'I often have such strange dreams.
This is only a vision'&mdash;and she sighed, relieved
and happy. She laid herself down in her coffin
again; she was so sure that it was her own
bed, for that was not very wide either.</p>

<p>All this time the Dalar man stood in the
grave, quite close to the foot of the coffin. He
only stood a few feet from her, but she had not
seen him; that was probably because he had
tried to hide himself in the corner of the grave
as soon as the dead in the coffin had opened
her eyes and begun to move. She could, perhaps,
have seen him, although he held the coffin-lid
before him as a screen, had there not been
something like a white mist before her eyes so
that she could only see things quite near her
distinctly. Ingrid could not even see that there
were earthen walls around her. She had taken
the sun to be a large chandelier, and the shady
lime-trees for a roof. The poor Dalar man stood
and waited for the thing that moved in the coffin
to go away. It did not strike him that it would
not go unrequested. Had it not knocked because
it wanted to get out? He stood for a long time
with his head behind the coffin-lid and waited,
that it should go. He peeped over the lid when
he thought that now it must have gone. But
it had not moved; it remained lying on its bed
of shavings.</p>

<p>He could not put up with it any longer; he
must really make an end of it. It was a long
time since his violin had spoken so prettily as
to-day, he longed to sit again quietly with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Ingrid, who had nearly fallen asleep again, suddenly
heard herself addressed in the sing-song
Dalar dialect:</p>

<p>'Now, I think it is time you got up.'</p>

<p>As soon as he had said this he hid his head.
He shook so much over his boldness that he
nearly let the lid fall.</p>

<p>But the white mist which had been before
Ingrid's eyes disappeared completely when she
heard a human being speaking. She saw a man
standing in the corner, at the foot of the coffin,
holding a coffin-lid before him. She saw at
once that she could not lie down again and think
it was a vision. Surely he was a reality, which
she must try and make out. It certainly looked
as if the coffin were a coffin, and the grave a
grave, and that she herself a few minutes ago
was nothing but a swathed and buried corpse.
For the first time she was terror-stricken at what
had happened to her. To think that she could
really have been dead that moment! She could
have been a hideous corpse, food for worms.
She had been placed in the coffin for them to
throw earth upon her; she was worth no more
than a piece of turf; she had been thrown aside
altogether. The worms were welcome to eat
her; no one would mind about that.</p>

<p>Ingrid needed so badly to have a fellow-creature
near her in her great terror. She had
recognized the Goat directly he put up his head.
He was an old acquaintance from the parsonage;
she was not in the least afraid of him. She
wanted him to come close to her. She did not
mind in the least that he was an idiot. He was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
at any rate, a living being. She wanted him to
come so near to her that she could feel she belonged
to the living and not to the dead.</p>

<p>'Oh, for God's sake, come close to me!' she
said, with tears in her voice.</p>

<p>She raised herself in the coffin and stretched
out her arms to him.</p>

<p>But the Dalar man only thought of himself.
If she were so anxious to have him near her, he
resolved to make his own terms.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, 'if you will go away.'</p>

<p>Ingrid at once tried to comply with his request,
but she was so tightly swathed in the
sheet that she found it difficult to get up.</p>

<p>'You must come and help me,' she said.</p>

<p>She said this, partly because she was obliged
to do it, and partly because she was afraid that
she had not quite escaped death. She must be
near someone living.</p>

<p>He actually went near her, squeezing himself
between the coffin and the side of the grave.
He bent over her, lifted her out of the coffin,
and put her down on the grass at the side of
the open grave.</p>

<p>Ingrid could not help it. She threw her arms
round his neck, laid her head on his shoulder
and sobbed. Afterwards she could not understand
how she had been able to do this, and
that she was not afraid of him. It was partly
from joy that he was a human being&mdash;a living
human being&mdash;and partly from gratitude, because
he had saved her.</p>

<p>What would have become of her if it had not
been for him? It was he who had raised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
coffin-lid, who had brought her back to life.
She certainly did not know how it had all happened,
but it was surely he who had opened
the coffin. What would have happened to her
if he had not done this? She would have
awakened to find herself imprisoned in the
black coffin. She would have knocked and
shouted; but who would have heard her six
feet below the ground? Ingrid dared not think of
it; she was entirely absorbed with gratitude
because she had been saved. She must have
someone she could thank. She must lay her
head on someone's breast and cry from gratitude.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary thing, almost, that
happened that day was, that the Dalar man did
not repulse her. But it was not quite clear to
him that she was alive. He thought she was
dead, and he knew it was not advisable to offend
anyone dead. But as soon as he could manage,
he freed himself from her and went down into
the grave again. He placed the lid carefully on
the coffin, put in the screws and fastened it as
before. Then he thought the coffin would be
quite still, and the violin would regain its peace
and its melodies.</p>

<p>In the meantime Ingrid sat on the grass and
tried to collect her thoughts. She looked
towards the church and discovered the horses
and the carriages on the hillside. Then she
began to realize everything. It was Sunday;
they had placed her in the grave in the morning,
and now they were in church.</p>

<p>A great fear now seized Ingrid. The service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
would, perhaps, soon be over, and then all the
people would come out and see her. And she
had nothing on but a sheet! She was almost
naked. Fancy, if all these people came and saw
her in this state! They would never forget the
sight. And she would be ashamed of it all her
life.</p>

<p>Where should she get some clothes? For a
moment she thought of throwing the Dalar
man's fur coat round her, but she did not think
that that would make her any more like other
people.</p>

<p>She turned quickly to the crazy man, who
was still working at the coffin-lid.</p>

<p>'Oh,' she said, 'will you let me creep into
your pack?'</p>

<p>In a moment she stood by the great leather
pack, which contained goods enough to fill a
whole market-stall, and began to open it.</p>

<p>'You must come and help me.'</p>

<p>She did not ask in vain. When the Dalar
man saw her touching his wares he came up at
once.</p>

<p>'Are you touching my pack?' he asked threateningly.</p>

<p>Ingrid did not notice that he spoke angrily;
she considered him to be her best friend all
the time.</p>

<p>'Oh, dear good man,' she said, 'help me to
hide, so that people will not see me. Put your
wares somewhere or other, and let me creep
into the pack, and carry me home. Oh, do do
it! I live at the Parsonage, and it is only a
little way from here. You know where it is.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>The man stood and looked at her with stupid
eyes. She did not know whether he had understood
a word of what she said. She repeated
it, but he made no sign of obeying her. She
began again to take the things out of the pack.
Then he stamped on the ground and tore the
pack from her.</p>

<p>However should Ingrid be able to make him
do what she wanted?</p>

<p>On the grass beside her lay a violin and a
bow. She took them up mechanically&mdash;she did
not know herself why. She had probably been
so much in the company of people playing the
violin that she could not bear to see an instrument
lying on the ground.</p>

<p>As soon as she touched the violin he let go
the pack, and tore the violin from her. He was
evidently quite beside himself when anyone
touched his violin. He looked quite malicious.</p>

<p>What in the world could she do to get away
before people came out of church?</p>

<p>She began to promise him all sorts of things,
just as one promises children when one wants
them to be good.</p>

<p>'I will ask father to buy a whole dozen of
scythes from you. I will lock up all the dogs
when you come to the Parsonage. I will ask
mother to give you a good meal.'</p>

<p>But there was no sign of his giving way. She
bethought herself of the violin, and said in her
despair:</p>

<p>'If you will carry me to the Parsonage, I will
play for you.'</p>

<p>At last a smile flashed across his face. That
was evidently what he wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>'I will play for you the whole afternoon; I
will play for you as long as you like.'</p>

<p>'Will you teach the violin new melodies?'
he asked.</p>

<p>'Of course I will.'</p>

<p>But Ingrid now became both surprised and
unhappy, for he took hold of the pack and pulled
it towards him. He dragged it over the graves,
and the sweet-williams and southernwood that
grew on them were crushed under it as if it
were a roller. He dragged it to a heap of
branches and wizened leaves and old wreaths
lying near the wall round the churchyard. There
he took all the things out of the pack, and hid
them well under the heap. When it was empty
he returned to Ingrid.</p>

<p>'Now you can get in,' he said.</p>

<p>Ingrid stepped into the pack, and crouched
down on the wooden bottom. The man fastened
all the straps as carefully as when he went about
with his usual wares, bent down so that he nearly
went on his knees, put his arms through the
braces, buckled a couple of straps across his
chest, and stood up. When he had gone a few
steps he began to laugh. His pack was so light
that he could have danced with it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was only about a mile from the church to
the Parsonage. The Dalar man could walk it
in twenty minutes. Ingrid's only wish was that
he would walk so quickly that she could get
home before the people came back from church.
She could not bear the idea of so many people
seeing her. She would like to get home when
only her mother and the maid-servants were there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Ingrid had taken with her the little bouquet
of flowers from her adopted mother's myrtle.
She was so pleased with it that she kissed it
over and over again. It made her think more
kindly of her adopted mother than she had ever
done before. But in any case she would, of
course, think kindly of her now. One who has
come straight from the grave must think kindly
and gently of everything living and moving on
the face of the earth.</p>

<p>She could now understand so well that the
Pastor's wife was bound to love her own children
more than her adopted daughter. And
when they were so poor at the Parsonage that
they could not afford to keep a nursemaid, she
could see now that it was quite natural that
she should look after her little brothers and
sisters. And when her brothers and sisters
were not good to her, it was because they had
become accustomed to think of her as their
nurse. It was not so easy for them to remember
that she had come to the Parsonage to be
their sister.</p>

<p>And, after all, it all came from their being
poor. When father some day got another living,
and became Dean, or even Rector, everything
would surely come right. Then they would love
her again, as they did when she first came to
them. The good old times would be sure to
come back again. Ingrid kissed her flowers.
It had not been mother's intention, perhaps, to
be hard; it was only worry that had made her
so strange and unkind.</p>

<p>But now it would not matter how unkind they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
were to her. In the future nothing could hurt
her, for now she would always be glad, simply
because she was alive. And if things should
ever be really bad again, she would only think
of mother's myrtle and her little brother's horse.</p>

<p>It was happiness enough to know that she was
being carried along the road alive. This morning
no one had thought that she would ever again
go over these roads and hills. And the fragrant
clover and the little birds singing and the beautiful
shady trees, which had all been a source of
joy for the living, had not even existed for her.
But she had not much time for reflection, for in
twenty minutes the Dalar man had reached the
Parsonage.</p>

<p>No one was at home but the Pastor's wife and
the maid-servants, just as Ingrid had wished.
The Pastor's wife had been busy the whole
morning cooking for the funeral feast. She soon
expected the guests, and everything was nearly
ready. She had just been into the bedroom to
put on her black dress. She glanced down the
road to the church, but there were still no carriages
to be seen. So she went once again into
the kitchen to taste the food.</p>

<p>She was quite satisfied, for everything was as
it ought to be, and one cannot help being glad
for that, even if one is in mourning. There was
only one maid in the kitchen, and that was the
one the Pastor's wife had brought with her from
her old home, so she felt she could speak to her
in confidence.</p>

<p>'I must confess, Lisa,' she said, 'I think anyone
would be pleased with having such a funeral.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>'If she could only look down and see all the
fuss you make of her,' Lisa said, 'she would be
pleased.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' said the Pastor's wife, 'I don't think she
would ever be pleased with me.'</p>

<p>'She is dead now,' said the girl, 'and I am not
the one to say anything against one who is hardly
yet under the ground.'</p>

<p>'I have had to bear many a hard word from
my husband for her sake,' said the mistress.</p>

<p>The Pastor's wife felt she wanted to speak with
someone about the dead girl. Her conscience
had pricked her a little on her account, and this
was why she had arranged such a grand funeral
feast. She thought her conscience might leave
her alone now she had had so much trouble over
the funeral, but it did not do so by any means.
Her husband also reproached himself, and said
that the young girl had not been treated like one
of their own children, and that they had promised
she should be when they adopted her; and
he said it would have been better if they had
never taken her, when they could not help letting
her see that they loved their own children more.
And now the Pastor's wife felt she must talk to
someone about the young girl, to hear whether
people thought she had treated her badly.</p>

<p>She saw that Lisa began to stir the pan violently,
as if she had difficulty in controlling her
anger. She was a clever girl, who thoroughly
understood how to get into her mistress's good
books.</p>

<p>'I must say,' Lisa began, 'that when one has
a mother who always looks after one, and takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
care that one is neat and clean, one might at
least try to obey and please her. And when one
is allowed to live in a good Parsonage, and to
be educated respectably, one ought at least to
give some return for it, and not always go idling
about and dreaming. I should like to know what
would have happened if you had not taken the
poor thing in. I suppose she would have been
running about with those acrobats, and have died
in the streets, like any other poor wretch.'</p>

<p>A man from Dalarne came across the yard;
he had his pack on his back, although it was Sunday.
He came very quietly through the open
kitchen-door, and curtsied when he entered, but
no one took any notice of him. Both the mistress
and the maid saw him, but as they knew
him, they did not think it necessary to interrupt
their conversation.</p>

<p>The Pastor's wife was anxious to continue it;
she felt she was about to hear what she needed to
ease her conscience.</p>

<p>'It is perhaps as well she is gone,' she said.</p>

<p>'Yes, ma'am,' the servant said eagerly; 'and
I am sure the Pastor thinks just the same. In
any case he soon will. And the mistress will
see that now there will be more peace in the
house, and I am sure the master needs it.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' said the Pastor's wife, 'I was obliged
to be careful. There were always so many
clothes to be got for her, that it was quite dreadful.
He was so afraid that she should not get as
much as the others that she sometimes even had
more. And it cost so much, now that she was
grown up.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>'I suppose, ma'am, Greta will get her muslin
dress?'</p>

<p>'Yes; either Greta will have it, or I shall use
it myself.'</p>

<p>'She does not leave much behind her, poor
thing!'</p>

<p>'No one expects her to leave anything,' said
her adopted mother. 'I should be quite content
if I could remember ever having had a kind word
from her.'</p>

<p>This is only the kind of thing one says when
one has a bad conscience, and wants to excuse
one's self. Her adopted mother did not really
mean what she said.</p>

<p>The Dalar man behaved exactly as he always
did when he came to sell his wares. He stood
for a little while looking round the kitchen; then
he slowly pushed the pack on to a table, and unfastened
the braces and the straps; then he
looked round to see if there were any cats or
dogs about. He then straightened his back, and
began to unfasten the two leather flaps, which
were fastened with numerous buckles and knots.</p>

<p>'He need not trouble about opening his pack
to-day,' Lisa said; 'it is Sunday, and he knows
quite well we don't buy anything on Sundays.'</p>

<p>She, however, took no notice of the crazy fellow,
who continued to unfasten his straps. She
turned round to her mistress. This was a good
opportunity for insinuating herself.</p>

<p>'I don't even know whether she was good to
the children. I have often heard them cry in
the nursery.'</p>

<p>'I suppose it was the same with them as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
was with their mother,' said the Pastor's wife;
'but now, of course, they cry because she is
dead.'</p>

<p>'They don't understand what is best for them,'
said the servant; 'but the mistress can be certain
that before a month is gone there will be no one
to cry over her.'</p>

<p>At the same moment they both turned round
from the kitchen range, and looked towards the
table, where the Dalar man stood opening his
big pack. They had heard a strange noise, something
like a sigh or a sob. The man was just
opening the inside lid, and out of the pack rose
the newly-buried <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original has birl">girl</span>, exactly the same as when
they laid her in the coffin.</p>

<p>And yet she did not look quite the same. She
looked almost more dead now than when she was
laid in her coffin. Then she had nearly the same
colour as when she was alive; now her face was
ashy-gray, there was a bluish-black shadow
round her mouth, and her eyes lay deep in her
head. She said nothing, but her face expressed
the greatest despair, and she held out beseechingly,
and as if to avert their anger, the bouquet
of myrtle which she had received from her
adopted mother.</p>

<p>This sight was more than flesh and blood could
stand. Her mother fell fainting to the ground;
the maid stood still for a moment, gazing at the
mother and daughter, covered her eyes with her
hands, and rushed into her own room and locked
the door.</p>

<p>'It is not me she has come for; this does not
concern me.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>But Ingrid turned round to the Dalar man.</p>

<p>'Put me in your pack again, and take me away.
Do you hear? Take me away. Take me back to
where you found me.'</p>

<p>The Dalar man happened to look through the
window. A long row of carts and carriages was
coming up the avenue and into the yard. Ah,
indeed! then he was not going to stay. He did
not like that at all.</p>

<p>Ingrid crouched down at the bottom of the
pack. She said not another word, but only
sobbed. The flaps and the lids were fastened,
and she was again lifted on to his back and carried
away. Those who were coming to the funeral
feast laughed at the Goat, who hastened away,
curtsying and curtsying to every horse he met.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Anna Stina was an old woman who lived in
the depths of the forest. She gave a helping hand
at the Parsonage now and then, and always
managed opportunely to come down the hillside
when they were baking or washing. She was a
nice, clever old woman, and she and Ingrid were
good friends. As soon as the young girl was able
to collect her thoughts, she made up her mind to
take refuge with her.</p>

<p>'Listen,' she said to the Dalar man. 'When
you get onto the highroad, turn into the forest;
then go straight on until you come to a gate; there
you must turn to the left; then you must go
straight on until you come to the large gravel-pit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
From there you can see a house: take me there,
and I will play to you.'</p>

<p>The short and harsh manner in which she gave
her orders jarred upon her ears, but she was
obliged to speak in this way in order to be obeyed;
it was the only chance she had. What right had
she to order another person about&mdash;she who had
not even the right to be alive?</p>

<p>After all this she would never again be able to
feel as if she had any right to live. This was the
most dreadful part of all that had happened to
her: that she could have lived in the Parsonage
for six years, and not even been able to make herself
so much loved that they wished to keep her
alive. And those whom no one loves have no
right to live. She could not exactly say how she
knew it was so, but it was as clear as daylight.
She knew it from the feeling that the same moment
she heard that they did not care about her
an iron hand seemed to have crushed her heart as
if to make it stop. Yes, it was life itself that had
been closed for her. And the same moment she
had come back from death, and felt the delight of
being alive burn brightly and strongly within her,
just at that moment the one thing that gave her
the right of existing had been torn from her.</p>

<p>This was worse than sentence of death. It was
much more cruel than an ordinary sentence of
death. She knew what it was like. It was like
felling a tree&mdash;not in the usual manner, when the
trunk is cut through, but by cutting its roots and
leaving it standing in the ground to die by itself.
There the tree stands, and cannot understand why
it no longer gets nourishment and support. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
struggles and strives to live, but the leaves get
smaller and smaller, it sends forth no fresh shoots,
the bark falls off, and it must die, because it is severed
from the spring of life. Thus it is it must die.</p>

<p>At last the Dalar man put down his pack on the
stone step outside a little house in the midst of the
wild forest. The door was locked, but as soon as
Ingrid had got out of the pack she took the key
from under the doorstep, opened the door, and
walked in.</p>

<p>Ingrid knew the house thoroughly and all it
contained. It was not the first time she had come
there for comfort; it was not the first time she had
come and told old Anna Stina that she could not
bear living at home any longer&mdash;that her adopted
mother was so hard to her that she would not go
back to the Parsonage. But every time she came
the old woman had talked her over and quieted
her. She had made her some terrible coffee from
roasted peas and chicory, without a single coffee-bean
in it, but which had all the same given her
new courage, and in the end she had made her
laugh at everything, and encouraged her so much,
that she had simply danced down the hillside on
her way home.</p>

<p>Even if Anna Stina had been at home, and had
made some of her terrible coffee, it would probably
not have helped Ingrid this time. But the
old woman was down at the Parsonage to the
funeral feast, for the Pastor's wife had not forgotten
to invite any of those of whom Ingrid had
been fond. That, too, was probably the result of
an uneasy conscience.</p>

<p>But in Anna's room everything was as usual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
And when Ingrid saw the sofa with the wooden
seat, and the clean, scoured table, and the cat, and
the coffee-kettle, although she did not feel comforted
or cheered, she felt that here was a place
where she could give vent to her sorrow. It was
a relief that here she need not think of anything
but crying and moaning.</p>

<p>She went straight to the settle, threw herself on
the wooden seat, and lay there crying, she did not
know for how long.</p>

<p>The Dalar man sat outside on the stone step;
he did not want to go into the house on account of
the cat. He expected that Ingrid would come
out and play to him. He had taken the violin out
long ago. As it was such a long time before she
came, he began to play himself. He played softly
and gently, as was his wont. It was barely possible
for the young girl to hear him playing.</p>

<p>Ingrid had one fit of shivering after the other.
This was how she had been before she fell ill.
She would no doubt be ill again. It was also best
that the fever should come and put an end to her
in earnest.</p>

<p>When she heard the violin, she rose and looked
round with bewildered glance. Who was that
playing? Was that her student? Had he come
at last? It soon struck her, however, that it was
the Dalar man, and she lay down again with a
sigh. She could not follow what he was playing.
But as soon as she closed her eyes the violin assumed
the student's voice. She also heard what
he said; he spoke with her adopted mother and
defended her. He spoke just as nicely as he had
done to Mr. and Mrs. Blomgren. Ingrid needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
love so much, he said. That was what she
had missed. That was why she had not always
attended to her work, but allowed dreams to
fill her mind. But no one knew how she could
work and slave for those who loved her. For
their sake she could bear sorrow and sickness, and
contempt and poverty; for them she would be as
strong as a giant, and as patient as a slave.</p>

<p>Ingrid heard him distinctly and she became
quiet. Yes, it was true. If only her adopted
mother had loved her, she would have seen what
Ingrid was worth. But as she did not love her,
Ingrid was paralyzed in her efforts. Yes, so it
had been.</p>

<p>Now the fever had left her, she only lay and
listened to what the student said. She slept a
little now and then; time after time she thought
she was lying in her grave, and then it was always
the student who came and took her out of the coffin.
She lay and disputed with him.</p>

<p>'When I am dreaming it is you who come,' she
said.</p>

<p>'It is always I who come to you, Ingrid,' he
said. 'I thought you knew that. I take you out
of the grave; I carry you on my shoulders; I
play you to sleep. It is always I.'</p>

<p>What disturbed and awoke her was the thought
that she had to get up and play for the Dalar man.
Several times she rose up to do it, but could not.
As soon as she fell back upon the settle she began
to dream. She sat crouching in the pack and the
student carried her through the forest. It was
always he.</p>

<p>'But it was not you,' she said to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>'Of course it was I,' he said, smiling at her
contradicting him. 'You have been thinking
about me every day for all these years; so you
can understand I could not help saving you when
you were in such great danger.'</p>

<p>Of course she saw the force of his argument;
and then she began to realize that he was right,
and that it was he. But this was such infinite bliss
that she again awoke. Love seemed to fill her
whole being. It could not have been more real
had she seen and spoken with her beloved.</p>

<p>'Why does he never come in real life?' she
said, half aloud. 'Why does he only come in my
dreams?'</p>

<p>She did not dare to move, for then love would
fly away. It was as if a timid bird had settled on
her shoulder, and she was afraid of frightening
it away. If she moved, the bird would fly away,
and sorrow would overcome her.</p>

<p>When at last she really awoke, it was twilight.
She must have slept the whole afternoon and evening.
At that time of the year it was not dark until
after ten o'clock. The violin had ceased playing,
and the Dalar man had probably gone away.</p>

<p>Anna Stina had not yet come back. She would
probably be away the whole night. It did not
matter to Ingrid; all she wanted was to lie down
again and sleep. She was afraid of all the sorrow
and despair that would overwhelm her as soon as
she awoke. But then she got something new to
think about. Who could have closed the door?
who had spread Anna Stina's great shawl over
her? and who had placed a piece of dry bread
beside her on the seat? Had he, the Goat, done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
all this for her? For a moment she thought she
saw dream and reality standing side by side, trying
which could best console her. And the dream
stood joyous and smiling, showering over her all
the bliss of love to comfort her. But life, poor,
hard, and bitter though it was, also brought its
kindly little mite to show that it did not mean to
be so hard upon her as perhaps she thought.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Ingrid and Anna Stina were walking through
the dark forest. They had been walking for four
days, and had slept three nights in the S&auml;ter huts.
Ingrid was weak and weary; her face was transparently
pale; her eyes were sunken, and shone
feverishly. Old Anna Stina now and then secretly
cast an anxious look at her, and prayed to God
that He would sustain her so that she might not
die by the wayside. Now and then the old
woman could not help looking behind her with
uneasiness. She had an uncomfortable feeling
that the old man with his scythe came stealthily
after them through the forest to reclaim the
young girl who, both by the word of God and the
casting of earth upon her, had been consecrated
to him.</p>

<p>Old Anna Stina was little and broad, with a
large, square face, which was so intelligent that
it was almost good-looking. She was not superstitious&mdash;she
lived quite alone in the midst of the
forest without being afraid either of witches or
evil spirits&mdash;but as she walked there by the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of Ingrid she felt as distinctly as if someone had
told her that she was walking beside a being who
did not belong to this world. She had had that
sensation ever since she had found Ingrid lying in
her house that Monday morning.</p>

<p>Anna Stina had not returned home on the Sunday
evening, for down at the Parsonage the Pastor's
wife had been taken very ill, and Anna Stina,
who was accustomed to nurse sick people, had
stayed to sit up with her. The whole night she
had heard the Pastor's wife raving about Ingrid's
having appeared to her; but that the old woman
had not believed. And when she returned home
the next day and found Ingrid, the old woman
would at once have gone down to the Parsonage
again to tell them that it was not a ghost they had
seen; but when she had suggested this to Ingrid,
it had affected her so much that she dared not do
it. It was as if the little life which burnt in her
would be extinguished, just as the flame of a candle
is put out by too strong a draught. She could
have died as easily as a little bird in its cage.
Death was prowling around her. There was
nothing to be done but to nurse her very tenderly
and deal very gently with her if her life was to be
preserved.</p>

<p>The old woman hardly knew what to think of
Ingrid. Perhaps she was a ghost; there seemed
to be so little life in her. She quite gave up trying
to talk her to reason. There was nothing else for
it but giving in to her wishes that no one should
hear anything about her being alive. And then
the old woman tried to arrange everything as
wisely as possible. She had a sister who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
housekeeper on a large estate in Dalarne, and she
made up her mind to take Ingrid to her, and persuade
her sister, Stafva, to give the girl a situation
at the Manor House. Ingrid would have to be
content with being simply a servant. There was
nothing else for it.</p>

<p>They were now on their way to the Manor
House. Anna Stina knew the country so well
that they were not obliged to go by the highroad,
but could follow the lonely forest paths. But they
had also undergone much hardship. Their shoes
were worn and in pieces, their skirts soiled and
frayed at the bottom, and a branch had torn a
long rent in Ingrid's sleeve.</p>

<p>On the evening of the fourth day they came to a
hill from which they could look down into a deep
valley. In the valley was a lake, and near the
edge of the lake was a high, rocky island, upon
which stood a large white building. When Anna
Stina saw the house, she said it was called Munkhyttan,
and that it was there her sister lived.</p>

<p>They made themselves as tidy as they could on
the hillside. They arranged the handkerchiefs
which they wore on their heads, dried their shoes
with moss, and washed themselves in a forest
stream, and Anna Stina tried to make a fold in Ingrid's
sleeve so that the rent could not be seen.</p>

<p>The old woman sighed when she looked at
Ingrid, and quite lost courage. It was not only
that she looked so strange in the clothes she had
borrowed from Anna Stina, and which did not at
all fit her, but her sister Stafva would never take
her into her service, she looked so wretched and
pitiful. It was like engaging a breath of wind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
The girl could be of no more use than a sick
butterfly.</p>

<p>As soon as they were ready, they went down the
hill to the lake. It was only a short distance.
Then they came to the land belonging to the
Manor House.</p>

<p>Was that a country house?</p>

<p>There were large neglected fields, upon which
the forest encroached more and more. There
was a bridge leading on to the island, so shaky
that they hardly thought it would keep together
until they were safely over. There was an avenue
leading from the bridge to the main building,
covered with grass, like a meadow, and a tree
which had been blown down had been left lying
across the road.</p>

<p>The island was pretty enough, so pretty that a
castle might very well have been built there. But
nothing but weeds grew in the garden, and in the
large park the trees were choking each other, and
black snakes glided over the green, wet walks.</p>

<p>Anna Stina felt uneasy when she saw how neglected
everything was, and went along mumbling
to herself: 'What does all this mean? Is Stafva
dead? How can she stand everything looking
like this? Things were very different thirty years
ago, when I was last here. What in the world
can be the matter with Stafva?' She could not
imagine that there could be such neglect in any
place where Stafva lived.</p>

<p>Ingrid walked behind her, slowly and reluctantly.
The moment she put her foot on the
bridge she felt that there were not two walking
there, but three. Someone had come to meet her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
there, and had turned back to accompany her.
Ingrid heard no footsteps, but he who accompanied
them appeared indistinctly by her side.
She could see there was someone.</p>

<p>She became terribly afraid. She was just going
to beg Anna Stina to turn back and tell her that
everything seemed so strange here that she dare
not go any further. But before she had time to
say anything, the stranger came quite close to her,
and she recognised him. Before, she only saw
him indistinctly; now she saw him so clearly
that she could see it was the student.</p>

<p>It no longer seemed weird and ghost-like that
he walked there. It was only strangely delightful
that he came to receive her. It was as if it were
he who had brought her there, and would, by
coming to welcome her, show that it was.</p>

<p>He walked with her over the bridge, through
the avenue, quite up to the main building.</p>

<p>She could not help turning her head every
moment to the left. It was there she saw his face,
quite close to her cheek. It was really not a face
that she saw, only an unspeakably beautiful smile
that drew tenderly near her. But if she turned
her head quite round to see it properly, it was no
longer there. No, there was nothing one could
see distinctly. But as soon as she looked straight
before her, it was there again, quite close to
her.</p>

<p>Her invisible companion did not speak to her,
he only smiled. But that was enough for her. It
was more than enough to show her that there was
one in the world who kept near her with tender
love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>She felt his presence as something so real, that
she firmly believed he protected her and watched
over her. And before this happy consciousness
vanished all the despair which her adopted mother's
hard words had called forth.</p>

<p>Ingrid felt herself again given back to life. She
had the right to live, as there was one who loved
her.</p>

<p>And this was why she entered the kitchen at
Munkhyttan with a faint blush on her cheeks, and
with radiant eyes, fragile, weak, and transparent,
but sweet as a newly-opened rose.</p>

<p>She still went about as if in a dream, and did not
know much about where she was; but what surprised
her so much that it nearly awakened her
was to see a new Anna Stina standing by the fireplace.
She stood there, little and broad, with a
large, square face, exactly like the other. But
why was she so fine, with a white cap with strings
tied in a large bow under her chin, and with a
black bombazine dress? Ingrid's head was so
confused, that it was some time before it occurred
to her that this must be Miss Stafva.</p>

<p>She felt that Anna Stina looked uneasily at her,
and she tried to pull herself together and say
'Good-day.' But the only thing her mind could
grasp was the thought that he had come to her.</p>

<p>Inside the kitchen there was a small room, with
blue-checked covering on the furniture. They
were taken into that room, and Miss Stafva gave
them coffee and something to eat.</p>

<p>Anna Stina at once began to talk about
their errand. She spoke for a long time; said
that she knew her sister stood so high in her ladyship's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
favour that she left it to her to engage the
servants. Miss Stafva said nothing, but she gave
a look at Ingrid as much as to say that it would
hardly have been left with her if she had chosen
servants like her.</p>

<p>Anna Stina praised Ingrid, and said she was a
good girl. She had hitherto served in a parsonage,
but now that she was grown up she wanted
really to learn something, and that was why Anna
Stina had brought her to one who could teach her
more than any other person she knew.</p>

<p>Miss Stafva did not reply to this remark either.
But her glance plainly showed that she was surprised
that anyone who had had a situation in a
parsonage had no clothes of her own, but was
obliged to borrow old Anna Stina's.</p>

<p>Then old Anna Stina began to tell how she lived
quite alone in the forest, deserted by all her relatives.
And this young girl had come running up
the hill many an evening and many an early
morning to see her. She had therefore thought
and hoped that she could now help her to get a
good situation.</p>

<p>Miss Stafva said it was a pity that they had gone
such a long way to find a place. If she were a
clever girl, she could surely get a situation in
some good family in their own neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Anna Stina could now clearly see that Ingrid's
prospects were not good, and therefore she began
in a more solemn vein:</p>

<p>'Here you have lived, Stafva, and had a good,
comfortable home all your life, and I have had to
fight my way in great poverty. But I have never
asked you for anything before to-day. And now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
you will send me away like a beggar, to whom
one gives a meal and nothing more.'</p>

<p>Miss Stafva smiled a little; then she said:</p>

<p>'Sister Anna Stina, you are not telling me the
truth. I, too, come from Raglanda, and I should
like to know at what peasant's house in that
parish grow such eyes and such a face.'</p>

<p>And she pointed at Ingrid, and continued:</p>

<p>'I can quite understand, Anna Stina, that you
would like to help one who looks like that. But I
do not understand how you can think that your
sister Stafva has not more sense than to believe
the stories you choose to tell her.'</p>

<p>Anna Stina was so frightened that she could not
say a word, but Ingrid made up her mind to confide
in Miss Stafva, and began at once to tell her
whole story in her soft, beautiful voice.</p>

<p>And Ingrid had hardly told of how she had
been lying in the grave, and that a Dalar man had
come and saved her, before old Miss Stafva grew
red and quickly bent down to hide it. It was only
a second, but there must have been some cause for
it, for from that moment she looked so kind.</p>

<p>She soon began to ask full particulars about it;
more especially she wanted to know about the
crazy man, whether Ingrid had not been afraid of
him. Oh no, he did no harm. He was not mad,
Ingrid said; he could both buy and sell. He was
only frightened of some things.</p>

<p>Ingrid thought the hardest of all was to tell
what she had heard her adopted mother say. But
she told everything, although there were tears in
her voice.</p>

<p>Then Miss Stafva went up to her, drew back the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
handkerchief from her head, and looked into her
eyes. Then she patted her lightly on the cheek.</p>

<p>'Never mind that, little miss,' she said. 'There
is no need for me to know about that. Now sister
and Miss Ingrid must excuse me,' she said soon
after, 'but I must take up her ladyship's coffee. I
shall soon be down again, and you can tell me
more.'</p>

<p>When she returned, she said she had told her
ladyship about the young girl who had lain in the
grave, and now her mistress wanted to see her.</p>

<p>They were taken upstairs, and shown into her
ladyship's boudoir.</p>

<p>Anna Stina remained standing at the door of
the fine room. But Ingrid was not shy; she went
straight up to the old lady and put out her hand.
She had often been shy with others who looked
much less aristocratic; but here, in this house,
she did not feel embarrassed. She only felt so
wonderfully happy that she had come there.</p>

<p>'So it is you, my child, who have been buried,'
said her ladyship, nodding friendlily to her. 'Do
you mind telling me your story, my child? I sit
here quite alone, and never hear anything, you
know.'</p>

<p>Then Ingrid began again to tell her story. But
she had not got very far before she was interrupted.
Her ladyship did exactly the same as
Miss Stafva had done. She rose, pushed the
handkerchief back from Ingrid's forehead and
looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>'Yes,' her ladyship said to herself, 'that I can
understand. I can understand that he must obey
those eyes.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>For the first time in her life Ingrid was praised
for her courage. Her ladyship thought she had
been very brave to place herself in the hands of a
crazy fellow.</p>

<p>She <em>was</em> afraid, she said, but she was still more
afraid of people seeing her in that state. And he
did no harm; he was almost quite right, and then
he was so good.</p>

<p>Her ladyship wanted to know his name, but
Ingrid did not know it. She had never heard of
any other name but the Goat. Her ladyship asked
several times how he managed when he came to
do business. Had she not laughed at him, and did
she not think that he looked terrible&mdash;the Goat?
It sounded so strange when her ladyship said 'the
Goat.' There was so much bitterness in her voice
when she said it, and yet she said it over and over
again.</p>

<p>No; Ingrid did not think so, and she never
laughed at unfortunate people. The old lady
looked more gentle than her words sounded.</p>

<p>'It appears you know how to manage mad people,
my child,' she said. 'That is a great gift.
Most people are afraid of such poor creatures.'
She listened to all Ingrid had to say, and sat meditating.
'As you have not any home, my child,'
she said, 'will you not stay here with me? You
see, I am an old woman living here by myself, and
you can keep me company, and I shall take care
that you have everything you want. What do
you say to it, my child? There will come a time,
I suppose,' continued her ladyship, 'when we
shall have to inform your parents that you are still
living; but for the present everything shall remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
as it is, so that you can have time to rest
both body and mind. And you shall call me
"Aunt"; but what shall I call you?'</p>

<p>'Ingrid&mdash;Ingrid Berg.'</p>

<p>'Ingrid,' said her ladyship thoughtfully. 'I
would rather have called you something else. As
soon as you entered the room with those star-like
eyes, I thought you ought to be called Mignon.'</p>

<p>When it dawned upon the young girl that here
she would really find a home, she felt more sure
than ever that she had been brought here in some
supernatural manner, and she whispered her
thanks to her invisible protector before she
thanked her ladyship, Miss Stafva, and Anna
Stina.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ingrid slept in a four-poster, on luxurious
featherbeds three feet high, and had hem-stitched
sheets, and silken quilts embroidered with Swedish
crowns and French lilies. The bed was so
broad that she could lie as she liked either way,
and so high that she must mount two steps to get
into it. At the top sat a Cupid holding the
brightly-coloured hangings, and on the posts sat
other Cupids, which held them up in festoons.</p>

<p>In the same room where the bed stood was an
old curved chest of drawers inlaid with olive-wood,
and from it Ingrid might take as much
sweetly-scented linen as she liked. There was
also a wardrobe containing many gay and pretty
silk and muslin gowns that only hung there and
waited until it pleased her to put them on.</p>

<p>When she awoke in the morning there stood by
her bedside a tray with a silver coffee-set and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
old Indian china. And every morning she
set her small white teeth in fine white bread and
delicious almond-cakes; every day she was
dressed in a fine muslin gown with a lace fichu.
Her hair was dressed high at the back, but round
her forehead there was a row of little light curls.</p>

<p>On the wall between the windows hung a mirror,
with a narrow glass in a broad frame, where
she could see herself, and nod to her picture, and
ask:</p>

<p>'Is it you? Is it really you? How have you
come here?'</p>

<p>In the daytime, when Ingrid had left the chamber
with the four-poster, she sat in the drawing-room
and embroidered or painted on silk, and
when she was tired of that, she played a little on
the guitar and sang, or talked with the old lady,
who taught her French, and amused herself by
training her to be a fine lady.</p>

<p>But she had come to an enchanted castle&mdash;she
could not get away from that idea. She had
had that feeling the first moment, and it was
always coming back again. No one arrived at
the house, no one left it. In this big house only
two or three rooms were kept in order; in the
others no one ever went. No one walked in the
garden, no one looked after it. There was only
one man-servant, and an old man who cut the firewood.
And Miss Stafva had only two servants,
who helped her in the kitchen and in the dairy.</p>

<p>But there was always dainty food on the
table, and her ladyship and Ingrid were always
waited upon and dressed like fine ladies of rank.</p>

<p>If nothing thrived on the old estate, there was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
at any rate, fertile soil for dreams, and even if
they did not nurse and cultivate flowers there, Ingrid
was not the one to neglect her dream-roses.
They grew up around her whenever she was
alone. It seemed to her then as if red dream-roses
formed a canopy over her.</p>

<p>Round the island where the trees bent low over
the water, and sent long branches in between the
reeds, and where shrubs and lofty trees grew luxuriantly,
was a pathway where Ingrid often
walked. It looked so strange to see so many letters
carved on the trees, to see the old seats and
summer-houses; to see the old tumble-down pavilions,
which were so worm-eaten that she dared
not go into them; to think that real people had
walked here, that here they had lived, and longed,
and loved, and that this had not always been an
enchanted castle.</p>

<p>Down here she felt even more the witchery of
the place. Here the face with the smile came to
her. Here she could thank him, the student, because
he had brought her to a home where she
was so happy, where they loved her, and made
her forget how hardly others had treated her.
If it had not been he who had arranged all this
for her, she could not possibly have been allowed
to remain here; it was quite impossible.</p>

<p>She knew that it must be he. She had never
before had such wild fancies. She had always
been thinking of him, but she had never felt that
he was so near her that he took care of her. The
only thing she longed for was that he himself
should come, for of course he would come some
day. It was impossible that he should not come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
In these avenues he had left behind part of his
soul.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Summer went, and autumn; Christmas was
drawing near.</p>

<p>'Miss Ingrid,' said the old housekeeper one
day, in a rather mysterious manner, 'I think I
ought to tell you that the young master who owns
Munkhyttan is coming home for Christmas. In
any case, he generally comes,' she added, with a
sigh.</p>

<p>'And her ladyship, who has never even mentioned
that she has a son,' said Ingrid.</p>

<p>But she was not really surprised. She might
just as well have answered that she had known
it all along.</p>

<p>'No one has spoken to you about him, Miss
Ingrid,' said the housekeeper, 'for her ladyship
has forbidden us to speak about him.'</p>

<p>And then Miss Stafva would not say any
more.</p>

<p>Neither did Ingrid want to ask any more. Now
she was afraid of hearing something definite.
She had raised her expectations so high that she
was herself afraid they would fail. The truth
might be well worth hearing, but it might also
be bitter, and destroy all her beautiful dreams.
But from that day he was with her night and day.
She had hardly time to speak to others. She
must always be with him.</p>

<p>One day she saw that they had cleared the
snow away from the avenue. She grew almost
frightened. Was he coming now?</p>

<p>The next day her ladyship sat from early morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>ing
in the window looking down the avenue. Ingrid
had gone further into the room. She was
so restless that she could not remain at the window.</p>

<p>'Do you know whom I am expecting to-day,
Ingrid?'</p>

<p>The young girl nodded; she dared not depend
upon her voice to answer.</p>

<p>'Has Miss Stafva told you that my son is peculiar?'</p>

<p>Ingrid shook her head.</p>

<p>'He is very peculiar&mdash;he&mdash;I cannot speak
about it. I cannot&mdash;you must see for yourself.'</p>

<p>It sounded heartrending. Ingrid grew very
uneasy. What was there with this house that
made everything so strange? Was it something
terrible that she did not know about? Was her
ladyship not on good terms with her son? What
was it, what was it?</p>

<p>The one moment in an ecstasy of joy, the next
in a fever of uncertainty, she was obliged to call
forth the long row of visions in order again to
feel that it must be he who came. She could not
at all say why she so firmly believed that he must
be the son just of this house. He might, for the
matter of that, be quite another person. Oh,
how hard it was that she had never heard his
name!</p>

<p>It was a long day. They sat waiting in silence
until evening came.</p>

<p>The man came driving a cartload of Christmas
logs, and the horse remained in the yard
whilst the wood was unloaded.</p>

<p>'Ingrid,' said her ladyship in a commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and hasty tone, 'run down to Anders and tell him
that he must be quick and get the horse into the
stable. Quick&mdash;quick!'</p>

<p>Ingrid ran down the stairs and on to the veranda;
but when she came out she forgot to call
to the man. Just behind the cart she saw a tall
man in a sheepskin coat, and with a large pack
on his back. It was not necessary for her to see
him standing curtsying and curtsying to recognise
him. But, but&mdash;&mdash;She put her hand to her
head and drew a deep breath. How would all
these things ever become clear to her? Was it
for that fellow's sake her ladyship had sent her
down? And the man, why did he pull the horse
away in such great haste? And why did he take
off his cap and salute? What had that crazy man
to do with the people of this house?</p>

<p>All at once the truth flashed upon Ingrid so
crushingly and overwhelmingly that she could
have screamed. It was not her beloved who had
watched over her; it was this crazy man. She
had been allowed to remain here because she had
spoken kindly of him, because his mother wanted
to carry on the good work which he had commenced.</p>

<p>The Goat&mdash;that was the young master.</p>

<p>But to her no one came. No one had brought
her here; no one had expected her. It was all
dreams, fancies, illusions! Oh, how hard it was!
If she had only never expected him!</p>

<p>But at night, when Ingrid lay in the big bed
with the brightly-coloured hangings, she dreamt
over and over again that she saw the student
come home. 'It was not you who came,' she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
said. 'Yes, of course it was I,' he replied. And
in her dreams she believed him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day, the week after Christmas, Ingrid sat
at the window in the boudoir embroidering. Her
ladyship sat on the sofa knitting, as she always
did now. There was silence in the room.</p>

<p>Young Hede had been at home for a week.
During all that time Ingrid had never seen him.
In his home, too, he lived like a peasant, slept in
the men-servants' quarters, and had his meals in
the kitchen. He never went to see his mother.</p>

<p>Ingrid knew that both her ladyship and Miss
Stafva expected that she should do something
for Hede, that at the least she would try and persuade
him to remain at home. And it grieved her
that it was impossible for her to do what they
wished. She was in despair about herself and
about the utter weakness that had come over her
since her expectations had been so shattered.</p>

<p>To-day Miss Stafva had just come in to say
that Hede was getting his pack ready to start.
He was not even staying as long as he generally
did at Christmas, she said with a reproachful look
at Ingrid.</p>

<p>Ingrid understood all they had expected from
her, but she could do nothing. She sewed and
sewed without saying anything.</p>

<p>Miss Stafva went away, and there was again
silence in the room. Ingrid quite forgot that she
was not alone; a feeling of drowsiness suddenly
came over her, whilst all her sad thoughts wove
themselves into a strange fancy.</p>

<p>She thought she was walking up and down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
whole of the large house. She went through a
number of rooms and salons; she saw them before
her with gray covers over the furniture. The
paintings and the chandeliers were covered with
gauze, and on the floors was a layer of thick dust,
which whirled about when she went through the
rooms. But at last she came to a room where she
had never been before; it was quite a small chamber,
where both walls and ceiling were black.
But when she came to look more closely at them,
she saw that the chamber was neither painted
black, nor covered with black material, but it was
so dark on account of the walls and the ceiling being
completely covered with bats. The whole room
was nothing but a huge nest for bats. In one of
the windows a pane was broken, so one could
understand how the bats had got in in such incredible
numbers that they covered the whole
room. They hung there in their undisturbed
winter sleep; not one moved when she entered.
But she was seized by such terror at this sight
that she began to shiver and shake all over. It
was dreadful to see the quantity of bats she so distinctly
saw hanging there. They all had black
wings wrapped around them like cloaks; they all
hung from the walls by a single long claw in undisturbable
sleep. She saw it all so distinctly that
she wondered if Miss Stafva knew that the bats
had taken possession of a whole room. In her
thoughts she then went to Miss Stafva and asked
her whether she had been into that room and seen
all the bats.</p>

<p>'Of course I have seen them,' said Miss Stafva.
'It is their own room. I suppose you know, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Ingrid, that there is not a single old country
house in all Sweden where they have not to give
up a room to the bats?'</p>

<p>'I have never heard that before,' Ingrid said.</p>

<p>'When you have lived as long in the world as I
have, Miss Ingrid, you will find out that I am
speaking the truth,' said Miss Stafva.</p>

<p>'I cannot understand that people will put up
with such a thing,' Ingrid said.</p>

<p>'We are obliged to,' said Miss Stafva. 'Those
bats are Mistress Sorrow's birds, and she has
commanded us to receive them.'</p>

<p>Ingrid saw that Miss Stafva did not wish to
say anything more about that matter, and she began
to sew again; but she could not help speculating
over who that Mistress Sorrow could be
who had so much power here that she could compel
Miss Stafva to give up a whole room to the
bats.</p>

<p>Just as she was thinking about all this, she saw
a black sledge, drawn by black horses, pull up
outside the veranda. She saw Miss Stafva come
out and make a low curtsy. An old lady in a
long black velvet cloak, with many small capes
on the shoulders, alighted from the sledge. She
was bent, and had difficulty in walking. She
could hardly lift her feet sufficiently to walk up
the steps.</p>

<p>'Ingrid,' said her ladyship, looking up from
her knitting, 'I think I heard Mistress Sorrow
arrive. It must have been her jingle I heard.
Have you noticed that she never has sledge-bells
on her horses, but only quite a small jingle? But
one can hear it&mdash;one can hear it! Go down into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the hall, Ingrid, and bid Mistress Sorrow welcome.'</p>

<p>When Ingrid came down into the front hall,
Mistress Sorrow stood talking with Miss Stafva
on the veranda. They did not notice her.</p>

<p>Ingrid saw with surprise that the round-backed
old lady had something hidden under all her
capes which looked like crape; it was put well
up and carefully hidden. Ingrid had to look very
closely before she discovered that they were two
large bat's wings which she tried to hide. The
young girl grew still more curious and tried to
see her face, but she stood and looked into the
yard, so it was impossible. So much, however,
Ingrid did see when she put out her hand to the
housekeeper&mdash;that one of her fingers was much
longer than the others, and at the end of it was a
large, crooked claw.</p>

<p>'I suppose everything is as usual here?' she
said.</p>

<p>'Yes, honoured Mistress Sorrow,' said Miss
Stafva.</p>

<p>'You have not planted any flowers, nor pruned
any trees? You have not mended the bridge,
nor weeded the avenue?'</p>

<p>'No, honoured mistress.'</p>

<p>'This is quite as it should be,' said the honoured
mistress. 'I suppose you have not had the
audacity to search for the vein of ore, or to cut
down the forest which is encroaching on the
fields?'</p>

<p>'No, honoured mistress.'</p>

<p>'Or to clean the wells?'</p>

<p>'No, nor to clean the wells.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>'This is a nice place,' said Mistress Sorrow;
'I always like being here. In a few years things
will be in such a state that my birds can live all
over the house. You are really very good to my
birds, Miss Stafva.'</p>

<p>At this praise the housekeeper made a deep
curtsy.</p>

<p>'How are things otherwise at the house?' said
Mistress Sorrow. 'What sort of a Christmas
have you had?'</p>

<p>'We have kept Christmas as we always do,'
said Miss Stafva. 'Her ladyship sits knitting in
her room day after day, thinks of nothing but her
son, and does not even know that it is a festival.
Christmas Eve we allowed to pass like any other
day&mdash;no presents and no candles.'</p>

<p>'No Christmas tree, no Christmas fare?'</p>

<p>'Nor any going to church; not so much as a
candle in the windows on Christmas morning.'</p>

<p>'Why should her ladyship honour God's Son
when God will not heal her son?' said Mistress
Sorrow.</p>

<p>'No, why should she?'</p>

<p>'He is at home at present, I suppose? Perhaps
he is better now?'</p>

<p>'No, he is no better. He is as much afraid
of things as ever.'</p>

<p>'Does he still behave like a peasant? Does
he never go into the rooms?'</p>

<p>'We cannot get him to go into the rooms;
he is afraid of her ladyship, as the honoured mistress
knows.'</p>

<p>'He has his meals in the kitchen, and sleeps
in the men-servants' room?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes, he does.'</p>

<p>'And you have no idea how to cure him?'</p>

<p>'We know nothing, we understand nothing.'</p>

<p>Mistress Sorrow was silent for a moment;
when she spoke again there was a hard, sharp
ring in her voice:</p>

<p>'This is all right as far as it goes, Miss Stafva;
but I am not quite satisfied with you, all the
same.'</p>

<p>The same moment she turned round and
looked sharply at Ingrid.</p>

<p>Ingrid shuddered. Mistress Sorrow had a little,
wrinkled face, the under part of which was
so doubled up that one could hardly see the
lower jaw. She had teeth like a saw, and thick
hair on the upper lip. Her eyebrows were one
single tuft of hair, and her skin was quite
brown.</p>

<p>Ingrid thought Miss Stafva could not see what
she saw: Mistress Sorrow was not a human
being; she was only an animal.</p>

<p>Mistress Sorrow opened her mouth and
showed her glittering teeth when she looked at
Ingrid.</p>

<p>'When this girl came here,' she said to Miss
Stafva, 'you thought she had been sent by God.
You thought you could see from her eyes that
she had been sent by Our Lord to save him.
She knew how to manage mad people. Well,
how has it worked?'</p>

<p>'It has not worked at all. She has not done
anything.'</p>

<p>'No, I have seen to that,' said Mistress Sorrow.
'It was my doing that you did not tell her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
why she was allowed to stay here. Had she
known that, she would not have indulged in
such rosy dreams about seeing her beloved. If
she had not had such expectations, she would
not have had such a bitter disappointment. Had
disappointment not paralyzed her, she could perhaps
have done something for this mad fellow.
But now she has not even been to see him. She
hates him because he is not the one she expected
him to be. That is my doing, Miss Stafva, my
doing.'</p>

<p>'Yes; the honoured mistress knows her business,'
said Miss Stafva.</p>

<p>Mistress Sorrow took her lace handkerchief
and dried her red-rimmed eyes. It looked as if
it were meant for an expression of joy.</p>

<p>'You need not make yourself out to be any
better than you are, Miss Stafva,' she said. 'I
know you do not like my having taken that room
for my birds. You do not like the thought of
my having the whole house soon. I know that.
You and your mistress had intended to cheat
me. But it is all over now.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Miss Stafva, 'the honoured mistress
can be quite easy. It is all over. The
young master is leaving to-day. He has packed
up his pack, and then we always know he is
about to leave. Everything her ladyship and I
have been dreaming about the whole autumn is
over. Nothing has been done. We thought she
might at least have persuaded him to remain at
home, but in spite of all we have done for her,
she has not done anything for us.'</p>

<p>'No, she has only been a poor help, I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
that,' said Mistress Sorrow. 'But, all the same,
she must be sent away now. That was really
what I wanted to see her ladyship about.'</p>

<p>Mistress Sorrow began to drag herself up the
steps on her tottering legs. At every step she
raised her wings a little, as if they should help
her. She would, no doubt, much rather have
flown.</p>

<p>Ingrid went behind her. She felt strangely
attracted and fascinated. If Mistress Sorrow
had been the most beautiful woman in the world,
she could not have felt a greater inclination to
follow her.</p>

<p>When she went into the boudoir she saw Mistress
Sorrow sitting on the sofa by the side of
her ladyship, whispering confidentially with her,
as if they were old friends.</p>

<p>'You must be able to see that you cannot
keep her with you,' said Mistress Sorrow impressively.
'You, who cannot bear to see a
flower growing in your garden, can surely not
stand having a young girl about in the house.
It always brings a certain amount of brightness
and life, and that would not suit you.'</p>

<p>'No; that is just what I have been sitting and
thinking about.'</p>

<p>'Get her a situation as lady's companion
somewhere or other, but don't keep her here.'</p>

<p>She rose to say good-bye.</p>

<p>'That was all I wanted to see you about,' she
said. 'But how are you yourself?'</p>

<p>'Knives and scissors cut my heart all day
long,' said her ladyship. 'I only live in him as
long as he is at home. It is worse than usual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
much worse this time. I cannot bear it much
longer.'.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Ingrid started; it was her ladyship's bell that
rang. She had been dreaming so vividly that
she was quite surprised to see that her ladyship
was alone, and that the black sledge was not
waiting before the door.</p>

<p>Her ladyship had rung for Miss Stafva, but
she did not come. She asked Ingrid to go down
to her room and call her.</p>

<p>Ingrid went, but the little blue-checked room
was empty. The young girl was going into the
kitchen to ask for the housekeeper, but before
she had time to open the door she heard Hede
talking. She stopped outside; she could not
persuade herself to go in and see him.</p>

<p>She tried, however, to argue with herself. It
was not his fault that he was not the one she had
been expecting. She must try to do something
for him; she must persuade him to remain at
home. Before, she had not had such a feeling
against him. He was not so very bad.</p>

<p>She bent down and peeped through the keyhole.
It was the same here as at other places.
The servants tried to lead him on in order to
amuse themselves by his strange talk. They
asked him whom he was going to marry. Hede
smiled; he liked to be asked about that kind of
thing.</p>

<p>'She is called Grave-Lily&mdash;don't you know
that?' he said.</p>

<p>The servant said she did not know that she
had such a fine name.</p>

<p>'But where does she live?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>'Neither has she home nor has she farm,'
Hede said. 'She lives in my pack.'</p>

<p>The servant said that was a queer home, and
asked about her parents.</p>

<p>'Neither has she father nor has she mother,'
Hede said. 'She is as fine as a flower; she has
grown up in a garden.'</p>

<p>He said all this with a certain amount of clearness,
but when he wanted to describe how beautiful
his sweetheart was he could not get on at
all. He said a number of words, but they were
strangely mixed together. One could not follow
his thoughts, but evidently he himself derived
much pleasure from what he said. He sat
smiling and happy.</p>

<p>Ingrid hurried away. She could not bear it
any longer. She could not do anything for him.
She was afraid of him. She disliked him. But
she had not got further than the stairs before
her conscience pricked her. Here she had received
so much kindness, and she would not
make any return.</p>

<p>In order to master her dislike she tried in her
own mind to think of Hede as a gentleman. She
wondered how he had looked when he wore good
clothes, and had his hair brushed back. She
closed her eyes for a moment and thought. No,
it was impossible, she could not imagine him as
being any different from what he was. The
same moment she saw the outlines of a beloved
face by her side. It appeared at her left side
wonderfully distinct. This time the face did not
smile. The lips trembled as if in pain, and unspeakable
suffering was written in sharp lines
round the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Ingrid stopped half-way up the stairs and
looked at it. There it was, light and fleeting, as
impossible to grasp and hold fast as a sun-spot
reflected by the prism of a chandelier, but just
as visible, just as real. She thought of her recent
dream, but this was different&mdash;this was reality.</p>

<p>When she had looked a little at the face, the
lips began to move; they spoke, but she could
not hear a sound. Then she tried to see what
they said, tried to read the words from the lips,
as deaf people do, and she succeeded.</p>

<p>'Do not let me go,' the lips said; 'do not let
me go.'</p>

<p>And the anguish with which it was said! If a
fellow-creature had been lying at her feet begging
for life, it could not have affected her more.
She was so overcome that she shook. It was
more heart-rending than anything she had ever
heard in her whole life. Never had she thought
that anyone could beg in such fearful anguish.
Again and again the lips begged, 'Do not let
me go!' And for every time the anguish was
greater.</p>

<p>Ingrid did not understand it, but remained
standing, filled with unspeakable pity. It seemed
to her that more than life itself must be at stake
for one who begged like this, that his very soul
must be at stake.</p>

<p>The lips did not move any more; they stood
half open in dull despair. When they assumed
this expression she uttered a cry and stumbled.
She recognised the face of the crazy fellow as
she had just seen it.</p>

<p>'No, no, no!' she said. 'It cannot be so! It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
must not! it cannot! It is not possible that it
is he!'</p>

<p>The same moment the face vanished. She
must have sat for a whole hour on the cold staircase,
crying in helpless despair. But at last hope
sprang up in her, strong and fair. She again
took courage to raise her head. All that had
happened seemed to show that she should save
him. It was for that she had come here. She
should have the great, great happiness of saving
him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the little boudoir her ladyship was talking
to Miss Stafva. It sounded so pitiful to hear her
asking the housekeeper to persuade her son to
remain a few days longer. Miss Stafva tried to
appear hard and severe.</p>

<p>'Of course, I can ask him,' she said; 'but
your ladyship knows that no one can make him
stay longer than he wants.'</p>

<p>'We have money enough, you know. There
is not the slightest necessity for him to go. Can
you not tell him that?' said her ladyship.</p>

<p>At the same moment Ingrid came in. The
door opened noiselessly. She glided through
the room with light, airy steps; her eyes were radiant,
as if she beheld something beautiful afar off.</p>

<p>When her ladyship saw her she frowned a
little. She also felt an inclination to be cruel, to
give pain.</p>

<p>'Ingrid,' she said, 'come here; I must speak
with you about your future.'</p>

<p>The young girl had fetched her guitar and
was about to leave the room. She turned round
to her ladyship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>'My future?' she said, putting her hand to her
forehead. 'My future is already decided, you
know,' she continued, with the smile of a martyr;
and without saying any more she left the room.</p>

<p>Her ladyship and Stafva looked in surprise at
each other. They began to discuss where they
should send the young girl. But when Miss
Stafva came down to her room she found Ingrid
sitting there, singing some little songs and playing
on the guitar, and Hede sat opposite her,
listening, his face all sunshine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ever since Ingrid had recognised the student
in the poor crazy fellow, she had no other
thought but that of trying to cure him; but this
was a difficult task, and she had no idea whatever
as to how she should set about it. To begin
with, she only thought of how she could persuade
him to remain at Munkhyttan; and this
was easy enough. Only for the sake of hearing
her play the violin or the guitar a little every day
he would now sit patiently from morning till
evening in Miss Stafva's room waiting for her.</p>

<p>She thought it would be a great thing if she
could get him to go into the other rooms, but
that she could not. She tried keeping in her
room, and said she would not play any more for
him if he did not come to her. But after she
had remained there two days, he began to pack
up his pack to go away, and then she was obliged
to give in.</p>

<p>He showed great preference for her, and distinctly
showed that he liked her better than
others; but she did not make him less frightened.
She begged him to leave off his sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>skin
coat, and wear an ordinary coat. He consented
at once, but the next day he had it on
again. Then she hid it from him; but he then
appeared in the man-servant's skin coat. So
then they would rather let him keep his own.
He was still as frightened as ever, and took great
care no one came too near him. Even Ingrid
was not allowed to sit quite close to him.</p>

<p>One day she said to him that now he must
promise her something: he must give over curtsying
to the cat. She would not ask him to do
anything so difficult as give up curtsying to
horses and dogs, but surely he could not be
afraid of a little cat.</p>

<p>Yes, he said; the cat was a goat.</p>

<p>'It can't be a goat,' she said; 'it has no horns,
you know.'</p>

<p>He was pleased to hear that. It seemed as if
at last he had found something by which he could
distinguish a goat from other animals.</p>

<p>The next day he met Miss Stafva's cat.</p>

<p>'That goat has no horns,' he said; and laughed
quite proudly.</p>

<p>He went past it, and sat down on the sofa to
listen to Ingrid playing. But after he had sat a
little while he grew restless, and he rose, went
up to the cat, and curtsied.</p>

<p>Ingrid was in despair. She took him by his
arm and shook him. He ran straight out of the
room, and did not appear until the next day.</p>

<p>'Child, child,' said her ladyship, 'you do exactly
as I did; you try the same as I did. It will
end by your frightening him so that he dare not
see you any more. It is better to leave him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
peace. We are satisfied with things as they are
if he will only remain at home.'</p>

<p>There was nothing else for Ingrid to do but
wring her hands in sorrow that such a fine,
lovable fellow should be concealed in this crazy
man.</p>

<p>Ingrid thought again and again, had she
really only come here to play her grandfather's
tunes to him? Should they go on like that all
through life? Would it never be otherwise?</p>

<p>She also told him many stories, and in the
midst of a story his face would lighten up, and
he would say something wonderfully subtle and
beautiful. A sane person would never have
thought of anything like it. And no more was
needed to make her courage rise, and then she
began again with these endless experiments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was late one afternoon, and the moon was
just about to rise. White snow lay on the
ground, and bright gray ice covered the lake.
The trees were blackish-brown, and the sky was
a flaming red after the sunset.</p>

<p>Ingrid was on her way to the lake to skate.
She went along a narrow path where the snow
was quite trodden down. Gunnar Hede went
behind her. There was something cowed in his
bearing that made one think of a dog following
its master.</p>

<p>Ingrid looked tired; there was no brightness
in her eyes, and her complexion was gray.</p>

<p>As she walked along she wondered whether
the day, which was now so nearly over, was
content with itself&mdash;if it were from joy it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
lighted the great flaming red sunset far away in
the west.</p>

<p>She knew she could light no bonfire over this
day, nor over any other day. In the whole
month that had passed since she recognised Gunnar
Hede she had gained nothing.</p>

<p>And to-day a great fear had come upon her.
It seemed to her as if she might perhaps lose
her love over all this. She was nearly forgetting
the student, only for thinking of the poor fellow.
All that was bright and beautiful and youthful
vanished from her love. Nothing was left but
dull, heavy earnest.</p>

<p>She was quite in despair as she walked towards
the lake. She felt she did not know what ought
to be done&mdash;felt that she must give it all up.
Oh, God, to have him walking behind her apparently
strong and hale, and yet so helplessly,
incurably sick!</p>

<p>They had reached the lake, and she was putting
on her skates. She also wanted him to
skate, and helped him to put on his skates; but
he fell as soon as he got on to the ice. He
scrambled to the bank and sat down on a stone,
and she skated away from him.</p>

<p>Just opposite the stone upon which Gunnar
Hede was sitting was an islet overgrown with
birches and poplars, and behind it the radiant
evening sky, which was still flaming red. And
the fine, light, leafless tops of the trees stood
against the glorious sky with such beauty that it
was impossible not to notice it.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that one always recognises a
place by a single feature? One does not exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
know how even the most familiar spot looks from
all sides. And Munkhyttan one always knew
by the little islet. If one had not seen the place
for many years, one would know it again by this
islet, where the dark tree-tops were lifted towards
the sunset.</p>

<p>Hede sat quite still, and looked at the islet and
at the branches of the trees and at the gray ice
which surrounded it.</p>

<p>This was the view he knew best of all; there
was nothing on the whole estate he knew so well,
for it was always this islet that attracted the eye.
And soon he was sitting looking at the islet
without thinking about it, just as one does with
things one knows so well. He sat for a long
time gazing. Nothing disturbed him, not a
human being, not a gust of wind, no strange object.
He could not see Ingrid; she had skated
far away on the ice.</p>

<p>A rest and peace fell upon Gunnar Hede such
as one only feels in home surroundings. Security
and peace came to him from the little islet; it
quieted the everlasting unrest that <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original has tormened">tormented</span>
him.</p>

<p>Hede always imagined he was amongst
enemies, and always thought of defending himself.
For many years he had not felt that peace
which made it possible for him to forget himself.
But now it came upon him.</p>

<p>Whilst Gunnar Hede was sitting thus and not
thinking of anything, he happened mechanically
to make a movement as one may do when one
finds one's self in accustomed circumstances. As
he sat there with the shining ice before him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
with skates on his feet, he got up and skated on
to the lake, and he thought as little of what he
was doing as one thinks of how one is holding
fork or spoon when eating.</p>

<p>He glided over the ice; it was glorious skating.
He was a long way off the shore before he realized
what he was doing.</p>

<p>'Splendid ice!' he thought. 'I wonder why I
did not come down earlier in the day. It is a
good thing I was more here yesterday,' he said.
'I will really not waste a single day during the
rest of my vacation.'</p>

<p>No doubt it was because Gunnar Hede happened
to do something he was in the habit of
doing before he was ill that his old self awakened
within him.</p>

<p>Thoughts and associations connected with his
former life began to force themselves upon his
consciousness, and at the same time all the
thoughts connected with his illness sank into oblivion.</p>

<p>It had been his habit when skating to take a
wide turn on the lake in order to see beyond a
certain point. He did so now without thinking,
but when he had turned the point he knew he
had skated there to see if there was a light in
his mother's window.</p>

<p>'She thinks it is time I was coming home, but
she must wait a little; the ice is too good.'</p>

<p>But it was mostly vague sensations of pleasure
over the exercise and the beautiful evening that
were awakened within him. A moonlight evening
like this was just the time for skating; he
was so fond of this peaceful transition from day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to night. It was still light, but the stillness of
night was already there, the best both of day and
of night.</p>

<p>There was another skater on the ice; it was a
young girl. He was not sure if he knew her, but
he skated towards her to find out. No; it was
no one he knew, but he could not help making a
remark when he passed her about the splendid
ice.</p>

<p>The stranger was probably a young girl from
the town. She was evidently not accustomed to
be addressed in this unceremonious manner; she
looked quite frightened when he spoke to her.
He certainly was queerly dressed; he was
dressed quite like a peasant.</p>

<p>Well, he did not want to frighten her away.
He turned off and skated further up the lake; the
ice was big enough for them both.</p>

<p>But Ingrid had nearly screamed with astonishment.
He had come towards her skating elegantly,
with his arms crossed, the brim of his
hat turned up, and his hair thrown back, so that
it did not fall over his ears.</p>

<p>He had spoken with the voice of a gentleman,
almost without the slightest Dalar accent. She
did not stop to think about it. She skated quickly
towards the shore. She came breathless into the
kitchen. She did not know how to say it shortly
and quickly enough.</p>

<p>'Miss Stafva, the young master has come
home!'</p>

<p>The kitchen was empty; neither the housekeeper
nor the servants were there. Nor was
there anybody in the housekeeper's room. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>grid
rushed through the whole house, went into
rooms where no one ever went. The whole
time she cried out, 'Miss Stafva, Miss Stafva!
the young master has come home!'</p>

<p>She was quite beside herself, and went on calling
out, even when she stood on the landing upstairs,
surrounded by the servants, Miss Stafva,
and her ladyship herself. She said it over and
over again. She was too much excited to stop.
They all understood what she meant. They
stood there quite as much overcome as she was.</p>

<p>Ingrid turned restlessly from the one to the
other. She ought to give explanations and
orders, but about what? That she could so lose
her presence of mind! She looked wildly questioning
at her ladyship.</p>

<p>'What was it I wanted?'</p>

<p>The old lady gave some orders in a low,
trembling voice. She almost whispered.</p>

<p>'Light the candles and make a fire in the
young master's room. Lay out the young master's
clothes.'</p>

<p>It was neither the place nor the time for Miss
Stafva to be important. But there was all the
same a certain superior ring in her voice as she
answered:</p>

<p>'There is always a fire in the young master's
room. The young master's clothes are always in
readiness for him.'</p>

<p>'Ingrid had better go up to her room,' said her
ladyship.</p>

<p>The young girl did just the opposite. She
went into the drawing-room, placed herself at
the window, sobbed and shook, but did not her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>self
know that she was not still. She impatiently
dried the tears from her eyes, so that she could
see over the snowfield in front of the house. If
only she did not cry, there was nothing she could
miss seeing in the clear moonlight. At last he
came.</p>

<p>'There he is! there he is!' she cried to her
ladyship. 'He walks quickly! he runs! Do
come and see!'</p>

<p>Her ladyship sat quite still before the fire. She
did not move. She strained her ears to hear,
just as much as the other strained her eyes to
see. She asked Ingrid to be quiet, so that she
could hear how he walked. Ah, yes, she would
be quiet. Her ladyship should hear how he
walked. She grasped the window-sill, as if that
could help her.</p>

<p>'You <em>shall</em> be quiet,' she whispered, 'so that
her ladyship can hear how he walks.'</p>

<p>Her ladyship sat bending forward, listening
with all her soul. Did she already hear his steps
in the court-yard? She probably thought he
would go towards the kitchen. Did she hear
that it was the front steps that creaked? Did
she hear that it was the door to the front hall that
opened? Did she hear how quickly he came up
the stairs, two or three steps at a time? Had his
mother heard that? It was not the dragging step
of a peasant, as it had been when he left the
house.</p>

<p>It was almost more than they could bear, to
hear him coming towards the door of the drawing-room.
Had he come in then, they would no
doubt both have screamed. But he turned down
the corridor to his own rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Her ladyship fell back in her chair, and her
eyes closed. Ingrid thought her ladyship would
have liked to die at that moment. Without opening
her eyes, she put out her hand. Ingrid went
softly up and took it; the old lady drew her
towards her.</p>

<p>'Mignon, Mignon,' she said; 'that was the
right name after all. But,' she continued, 'we
must not cry. We must not speak about it. Take
a stool and come and sit down by the fire. We
must be calm, my little friend. Let us speak
about something else. We must be perfectly calm
when he comes in.'</p>

<p>Half an hour afterwards Hede came in; the
tea was on the table, and the chandelier was
lighted. He had dressed; every trace of the
peasant had disappeared. Ingrid and her ladyship
pressed each other's hands.</p>

<p>They had been sitting trying to imagine how
he would look when he came in. It was impossible
to say what he might say or do, said her
ladyship. One never had known what he might
do. But in any case they would both be quite
calm. A feeling of great happiness had come
over her, and that had quieted her. She was
resting, free from all sorrow, in the arms of
angels carrying her upwards, upwards.</p>

<p>But when Hede came in, there was no sign of
confusion about him.</p>

<p>'I have only come to tell you,' he said, 'that I
have got such a headache, that I shall have to go
to bed at once. I felt it already when I was on
the ice.'</p>

<p>Her ladyship made no reply. Everything was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
so simple; she had never thought it would be
like that. It took her a few moments to realize
that he did not know anything about his illness,
that he was living somewhere in the past.</p>

<p>'But perhaps I can first drink a cup of tea,'
he said, looking a little surprised at their silence.</p>

<p>Her ladyship went to the tea-tray. He looked
at her.</p>

<p>'Have you been crying, mother? You are so
quiet.'</p>

<p>'We have been sitting talking about a sad
story, I and my young friend here,' said her
ladyship, pointing to Ingrid.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon,' he said. 'I did not see
you had visitors.'</p>

<p>The young girl came forward towards the
light, beautiful as one would be who knew that
the gates of heaven the next moment would open
before her.</p>

<p>He bowed a little stiffly. He evidently did not
know who she was. Her ladyship introduced
them to each other. He looked curiously at Ingrid.</p>

<p>'I think I saw Miss Berg on the ice,' he said.</p>

<p>He knew nothing about her&mdash;had never
spoken to her before.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A short, happy time followed. Gunnar Hede
was certainly not quite himself; but those around
him were happy in the belief that he soon would
be. His memory was partly gone. He knew
nothing about certain periods of his life; he
could not play the violin; he had almost forgotten
all he knew; and his power of thinking was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
weak; and he preferred neither to read nor to
write. But still he was very much better. He
was not frightened; he was fond of his mother;
he had again assumed the manners and habits
of a gentleman. One can easily understand that
her ladyship and all her household were delighted.</p>

<p>Hede was in the best of spirits&mdash;bright and
joyous all day long. He never speculated over
anything, put to one side everything he could
not understand, never spoke about anything that
necessitated mental exertion, but talked merrily
and cheerfully. He was most happy when he
was engaged in bodily exercise. He took Ingrid
out with him sledging and skating. He did not
talk much to her, but she was happy to be with
him. He was kind to Ingrid, as he was to everyone
else, but not in the least in love with her.
He often wondered about his <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fianc&eacute;e</span></em>&mdash;wondered
why she never wrote. But after a short time
that trouble, too, left him. He always put away
from him anything that worried him.</p>

<p>Ingrid thought that he would never get really
well by doing like this. He must some time be
made to think&mdash;to face his own thoughts, which
he was afraid of doing now. But she dared not
compel him to do this, and there was no one else
who dared. If he began to care for her a little,
perhaps she might dare. She thought all they
now wanted, every one of them, was a little happiness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was just at that time that a little child died
at the Parsonage at Raglanda where Ingrid had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
been brought up; and the grave-digger was
about to dig the grave.</p>

<p>The man dug the grave quite close to the spot
where the previous summer he had dug the
grave for Ingrid. And when he had got a few
feet into the ground he happened to lay bare a
corner of her coffin. The grave-digger could not
help smiling a little to himself. Of course he had
heard that the dead girl lying in this coffin had
appeared. She was supposed to have unscrewed
her coffin-lid on the very day of her funeral, risen
from the grave, and appeared at the Parsonage.
The Pastor's wife was not so much liked but that
people in the parish rather enjoyed telling this
story about her. The grave-digger thought that
people should only know how securely the dead
were lying in the ground, and how fast the coffin-lids.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>He interrupted himself in the midst of this
thought. On the corner of the coffin which was
exposed the lid was not quite straight, and one
of the screws was not quite fast. He did not
say anything, he did not think anything, but
stopped digging and whistled the whole reveille
of the Vermland Regiment&mdash;for he was an old
soldier. Then he thought he had better examine
the thing properly. It would never do for a
grave-digger to have thoughts about the dead
which might come and trouble him during the
dark autumn nights. He hastily removed some
more earth. Then he began to hammer on the
coffin with his shovel. The coffin answered quite
distinctly that it was empty&mdash;empty.</p>

<p>Half an hour after the grave-digger was at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Parsonage. There was no end to the questionings
and surmises. So much they were all
agreed upon&mdash;that the young girl had been in
the Dalar man's pack. But what had become of
her afterwards?</p>

<p>Anna Stina stood at the oven in the Parsonage
and looked after the baking, for of course there
was baking to be done for the new funeral. She
stood for a long time listening to all this talk
without saying a word. All she took care of
was that the cakes were not burnt. She put
sheet-tins in and took sheet-tins out, and it was
dangerous to approach her as she stood there
with the long baker's shovel. But suddenly she
took off her kitchen-apron, wiped the worst of
the sweat and the soot from her face, and was
talking with the Pastor in his study almost before
she knew how it had come about.</p>

<p>After this it was not so very wonderful that one
day in March the Pastor's little red-painted
sledge, ornamented with green tulips, and drawn
by the Pastor's little red horse, pulled up at
Munkhyttan. Ingrid was of course obliged to
go back with the Pastor home to her mother. The
Pastor had come to fetch her. He did not say
much about their being glad that she was alive,
but one could see how happy he was. He had
never been able to forgive himself that they had
not been more kind to their adopted daughter.
And now he was radiant at the thought that he
was allowed to make a new beginning and make
everything good for her this time.</p>

<p>They did not speak a word about the reason
why she had run away. It was of no use bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>ing
that up again so long after. But Ingrid understood
that the Pastor's wife had had a hard
time, and had suffered many pangs of conscience,
and that they wanted to have her back again in
order to be good to her. She felt that she was
almost obliged to go back to the Parsonage to
show that she had no ill-feeling against her
adopted parents.</p>

<p>They all thought it was the most natural thing
that she should go to the Parsonage for a week
or two. And why should she not? She could
not make the excuse that they needed her at
Munkhyttan. She could surely be away for
some weeks without it doing Gunnar Hede any
harm. She felt it was hard, but it was best she
should go away, as they all thought it was the
right thing.</p>

<p>Perhaps she had hoped they would ask her not
to go away. She took her seat in the sledge
with the feeling that her ladyship or Miss Stafva
would surely come and lift her out of it, and carry
her into the house again. It was impossible to
realize that she was actually driving down the
avenue, that she was turning into the forest, and
that Munkhyttan was disappearing behind her.</p>

<p>But supposing it was from pure goodness that
they let her go? They thought, perhaps, that
youth, with its craving for pleasure, wanted to
get away from the loneliness of Munkhyttan.
They thought, perhaps, she was tired of being
the keeper of a crazy man. She raised her hand,
and was on the point of seizing the reins and
turning the horse. Now that she was several
miles from the house it struck her that that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
why they had let her go. She would have liked
so much to have gone back and asked them.</p>

<p>In her utter loneliness she felt as if she were
groping about in the wild forest. There was not
a single human being who answered her or advised
her. She received just as much answer
from fir and pine, and squirrel and owl, as she
did from any human being.</p>

<p>It was really a matter of utter indifference to
her how they treated her at the Parsonage. They
were very kind to her, as far as she knew, but
it really did not matter. If she had come to a
palace full of everything one could most desire,
that would likewise have been the same to her.
No bed is soft enough to give rest unto one
whose heart is full of longing.</p>

<p>In the beginning she had asked them every
day, as modestly as she could, if they would not
let her go home, now that she had had the great
happiness of seeing her mother and her brothers
and sisters. But the roads were really too bad.
She must stay with them until the frost had disappeared.
It was not a matter of life and death,
they supposed, to go back to that place.</p>

<p>Ingrid could not understand why it annoyed
people when she said she wanted to go back to
Munkhyttan. But this seemed to be the case
with her father and her mother and everybody
else in the parish. One had no right, it appeared,
to long for any other place in the world,
when one was at Raglanda.</p>

<p>She soon saw it was best not to speak about
her going away. There were so many difficulties
in the way whenever she spoke about it. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
was not enough that the roads were still in the
same bad condition; they surrounded her with
walls and ramparts and moats. She would knit
and weave, and plant out in the forcing-frames.
And surely she would not go away until after
the large birthday party at the Dean's? And she
could not think of leaving till after Karin Landberg's
wedding.</p>

<p>There was nothing for her to do but to lift her
hands in supplication to the spring, and beg it to
make haste with its work, beg for sunshine and
warmth, beg the gentle sun to do its very best
for the great border forest, send small piercing
rays between the fir-trees, and melt the snow beneath
them. Dear, dear sun! It did not matter
if the snow were not melted in the valley, if only
the snow would vanish from the mountains, if
only the forest paths became passable, if only
the S&auml;ter girls were able to go to their huts, if
only the bogs became dry, if only it became
possible to go by the forest road, which was half
the distance of the highroad.</p>

<p>Ingrid knew one who would not wait for carriage,
or ask for money to drive, if only the road
through the forest became passable. She knew
one who would leave the Parsonage some moonlight
night, and who would do it without asking
a single person's permission.</p>

<p>She thought she had waited for the spring before.
That everybody does. But now Ingrid
knew that she had never before longed for it.
Oh no, no! She had never before known what
it was to long. Before she had waited for green
leaves and anemones, and the song of the thrush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and the cuckoo. But that was childishness&mdash;nothing
more. They did not long for the spring
who only thought of what was beautiful. One
should take the first bit of earth that peeped
through the snow, and kiss it. One should pluck
the first coarse leaf of the nettle simply to burn
into one that now the spring had come.</p>

<p>Everybody was very good to her. But although
they did not say anything, they seemed
to think that she was always thinking of leaving
them.</p>

<p>'I can't understand why you want to go back
to that place and look after that crazy fellow,'
said Karin Landberg one day. It seemed as if
she could read Ingrid's thoughts.</p>

<p>'Oh, she has given up thinking of that now,'
said the Pastor's wife, before the young girl had
time to answer.</p>

<p>When Karin was gone the Pastor's wife said:</p>

<p>'People wonder that you want to leave us.'</p>

<p>Ingrid was silent.</p>

<p>'They say that when Hede began to improve
perhaps you fell in love with him.'</p>

<p>'Oh no! Not after he had begun to improve,'
Ingrid said, feeling almost inclined to laugh.</p>

<p>'In any case, he is not the sort of person one
could marry,' said her adopted mother. 'Father
and I have been speaking about it, and we think
it is best that you should remain with us.'</p>

<p>'It is very good of you that you want to keep
me,' Ingrid said. And she was touched that now
they wanted to be so kind to her.</p>

<p>They did not believe her, however obedient
she was. She could not understand what little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
bird it was that told them about her longing.
Now her adopted mother had told her that she
must not go back to Munkhyttan. But even
then she could not leave the matter alone.</p>

<p>'If they really wanted you,' she said, 'they
would write for you.'</p>

<p>Ingrid again felt inclined to laugh. That
would be the strangest thing of all, should there
be a letter from the enchanted castle. She
would like to know if her adopted mother
thought that the King of the Mountain wrote
for the maiden who had been swallowed by the
mountain to come back when she had gone to
see her mother?</p>

<p>But if her adopted mother had known how
many messages she had received she would
probably have been even more uneasy. There
came messages to her in her dreams by nights,
and there came messages to her in her visions by
day. He let Ingrid know that he was in need of
her. He was so ill&mdash;so ill!</p>

<p>She knew that he was nearly going out of his
mind again, and that she must go to him. If
anyone had told her this, she would simply have
answered that she knew it.</p>

<p>The large star-like eyes looked further and
further away. Those who saw that look would
never believe that she meant to stay quietly and
patiently at home.</p>

<p>It is not very difficult either to see whether a
person is content or full of longing. One only
needs to see a little gleam of happiness in the
eyes when he or she comes in from work and sits
down by the fire. But in Ingrid's eyes there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
no gleam of happiness, except when she saw the
mountain stream come down through the forest,
broad and strong. It was that that should prepare
the way for her.</p>

<p>It happened one day that Ingrid was sitting
alone with Karin Landberg, and she began to
tell her about her life at Munkhyttan. Karin
was quite shocked. How could Ingrid stand
such a life?</p>

<p>Karin Landberg was to be married very soon.
And she was now at that stage when she could
speak of nothing but her lover. She knew nothing
but what he had taught her, and she could
do nothing without first consulting him.</p>

<p>It occurred to her that Oluf had said something
about Gunnar Hede which would help to
frighten Ingrid if she had begun to like that
crazy fellow. And then she began to tell her how
mad he had really been. For Oluf had told her
that when he was at the fair last autumn some
gentlemen had said that they did not think the
Goat was mad at all. He only pretended to be
in order to attract customers. But Oluf had
maintained that he was mad, and in order to
prove it went to the market and bought a
wretched little goat. And then it was plain
enough to see that he was mad. Oluf had only
put the goat in front of him on the counter
where his knives and things lay, and he had run
away and left both his pack and his wares, and
they had all laughed so awfully when they saw
how frightened he was. And it was impossible
that Ingrid could care for anyone who had been
so crazy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>It was, no doubt, unwise of Karin Landberg
that she did not look at Ingrid whilst she told
this story. If she had seen how she frowned,
she would perhaps have taken warning.</p>

<p>'And you will marry anyone who could do
such a thing!' Ingrid said. 'I think it would be
better to marry the Goat himself.'</p>

<p>This Ingrid said in downright earnest, and it
seemed so strange to Karin that she, who was
always so gentle, should have said anything so
unkind, that it quite worried her. For several
days she was quite unhappy, because she feared
Oluf was not what she would like him to be. It
simply embittered Karin's life until she made up
her mind to tell Oluf everything; but he was so
nice and good, that he quite reassured her.</p>

<p>It is not an easy task to wait for the spring in
Vermland. One can have sun and warmth in the
evening, and the next morning find the ground
white with snow. Gooseberry-bushes and lawns
may be green, but the trees of the birch-forest
are bare, and seem as if they will never spring
out.</p>

<p>At Whitsuntide there was spring in the air,
but Ingrid's prayers had been of no avail. Not a
single S&auml;ter girl had taken up her abode in the
forest, not a fen was dry; it was impossible to go
through the forest.</p>

<p>On Whit-Sunday Ingrid and her adopted
mother went to church. As it was such a great
festival, they had driven to church. In olden
days Ingrid had very much enjoyed driving up
to the church in full gallop, whilst people along
the roadside politely took off their hats, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
those who were standing on the road rushed to
the side as if they were quite frightened. But at
the present moment she could not enjoy anything.
'Longing takes the fragrance from the
rose, and the light from the full moon,' says an
old proverb.</p>

<p>But Ingrid was glad for what she heard in
church. It did her good to hear how the disciples
were comforted in their longing. She was
glad that Jesus thought of comforting those who
longed so greatly for Him.</p>

<p>Whilst Ingrid and the rest of the congregation
were in church a tall Dalar man came walking
down the road. He wore a sheepskin coat, and
had a large pack on his back, like one who cannot
tell winter from summer, or Sunday from
any other day. He did not go into the church,
but stole timidly past the horses that were tied
to the railings, and went into the churchyard.</p>

<p>He sat down on a grave and thought of all the
dead who were still sleeping, and of one of the
dead who had awakened to life again. He was
still sitting there when the people left the church.
Karin Landberg's Oluf was one of the first to
leave the church, and when he happened to look
across the churchyard he discovered the Dalar
man. It is hard to say whether it was curiosity
or some other motive that prompted him, but
he went up to talk to him. He wanted to see if
it were possible that he who was supposed to
have been cured had become mad again.</p>

<p>And it was possible. He told him at once
that he sat there waiting for her who was
called Grave-Lily. She was to come and play to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
him. She played so beautifully that the sun and
the stars danced.</p>

<p>Then Karin Landberg's Oluf told him that
she for whom he was waiting was standing outside
the church. If he stood up, he could see
her. She would, no doubt, be glad to see him.</p>

<p>The Pastor's wife and Ingrid were just getting
into the carriage, when a tall Dalar man came
running up to them. He came at a great pace
in spite of all the horses he must curtsy to, and
he beckoned eagerly to the young girl.</p>

<p>As soon as Ingrid saw him she stood quite
still. She could not have told whether she was
most glad to see him again or most grieved that
he had again gone out of his mind; she only
forgot everything else in the world.</p>

<p>Her eyes began to sparkle. In that moment
she saw nothing of the poor wretched man. She
only felt that she was once again near the beautiful
soul of the man for whom she had longed
so terribly.</p>

<p>There were a great many people about, and
they could not help looking at her. They could
not take their eyes from her face. She did not
move; she stood waiting for him. But those
who saw how radiant she was with happiness
must have thought that she was waiting for
some great and noble man, instead of a poor,
half-witted fellow.</p>

<p>They said afterwards that it almost seemed as
if there were some affinity between his soul and
hers&mdash;some secret affinity which lay so deeply
hidden beneath their consciousness that no
human being could understand it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>But when Hede was only a step or two from
Ingrid her adopted mother took her resolutely
round the waist and lifted her into the carriage.
She would not have a scene between the two
just outside the church, with so many people
present. And as soon as they were in the carriage
the man sent his horses off at full gallop.</p>

<p>A wild, terrified cry was heard as they drove
away. The Pastor's wife thanked God that she
had got the young girl into the carriage.</p>

<p>It was still early in the afternoon when a
peasant came to the Parsonage to speak with the
Pastor. He came to speak about the crazy Dalar
man. He had now gone quite raving mad, and
they had been obliged to bind him. What did
the Pastor advise them to do? What should
they do with him?</p>

<p>The Pastor could give them no other advice
but to take him home. He told the peasant who
he was, and where he lived.</p>

<p>Later on in the evening he told Ingrid everything.
It was best to tell her the truth, and
trust to her own common-sense.</p>

<p>But when night came it became clear to her
that she had not time to wait for the spring. The
poor girl set out for Munkhyttan by the highroad.
She would no doubt be able to get there
by that road, although she knew that it was
twice as long as the way through the forest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was Whit-Monday, late in the afternoon.
Ingrid walked along the highroad. There was a
wide expanse of country, with low mountains
and small patches of birch forest between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
fields. The mountain-ash and the bird-cherry
were in bloom; the light, sticky leaves of the
aspen were just out. The ditches were full of
clear, rippling water which made the stones at
the bottom glisten and sparkle.</p>

<p>Ingrid walked sorrowfully along, thinking of
him whose mind had again given way, wondering
whether she could do anything for him,
whether it was of any use that she had left her
home in this manner.</p>

<p>She was tired and hungry; her shoes had begun
to go to pieces. Perhaps it would be better
for her to turn back. She could never get to
Munkhyttan.</p>

<p>The further she walked, the more sorrowful
she became. She could not help thinking that
it could be of no use her coming now that he
had gone quite out of his mind. There was no
doubt it was too late now; it was quite hopeless
to do anything for him.</p>

<p>But as soon as she thought of turning back
she saw Gunnar Hede's face close to her cheek,
as she had so often seen it before. It gave her
new courage; she felt as if he were calling for
her. She again felt hopeful and confident of
being able to help him.</p>

<p>Just as Ingrid raised her head, looking a little
less downcast, a queer little procession came
towards her.</p>

<p>There was a little horse, drawing a little cart;
a fat woman sat in the cart, and a tall, thin
man, with long, thin moustaches walked by the
side of it.</p>

<p>In the country, where no one understood any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>thing
about art, Mr. and Mrs. Blomgren always
went in for looking like ordinary people. The
little cart in which they travelled about was well
covered over, and no one could suspect that it
only contained fireworks and conjuring apparatus
and marionettes.</p>

<p>No one could suspect that the fat woman
who sat on the top of the load, looking like a
well-to-do shopkeeper's wife, was formerly Miss
Viola, who once sprang through the air, or that
the man who walked by her side, and looked
like a pensioned soldier, was the same Mr.
Blomgren who occasionally, to break the monotony
of the journey, took it into his head to
turn a somersault over the horse, and play the
ventriloquist with thrushes and siskins that sang
in the trees by the roadside, so that he made
them quite mad.</p>

<p>The horse was very small, and had formerly
drawn a roundabout, and therefore it would
never go unless it heard music. On that account
Mrs. Blomgren generally sat playing the
Jews'-harp, but as soon as they met anyone, she
put it in her pocket, so that no one should discover
they were artists, for whom country
people have no respect whatever. Owing to this
they did not travel very fast, but they were not
in any hurry either.</p>

<p>The blind man, who played the violin, had to
walk some little distance behind the others in order
not to betray the fact of his belonging to the
company. The blind man was led by a little dog;
he was not allowed to have a child to lead him,
for that would always have reminded Mr. and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Mrs. Blomgren of a little girl who was called Ingrid.
That would have been too sad.</p>

<p>And now they were all in the country on account
of the spring. For however much money
Mr. and Mrs. Blomgren were making in the
towns, they felt they <em>must</em> be in the country at
that time of the year, for Mr. and Mrs. Blomgren
were artists.</p>

<p>They did not recognise Ingrid, and she went
past them without taking any notice of them, for
she was in a hurry; she was afraid of their detaining
her. But directly afterwards she felt that
it was heartless and unkind of her, and turned
back.</p>

<p>If Ingrid could have felt glad about anything,
she would have been glad by seeing the old people's
joy at meeting her. You may be sure they
had plenty to talk about. The little horse turned
its head time after time to see what was wrong
with the roundabout.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, it was Ingrid who talked the
most. The two old people saw at once that she
had been crying, and they were so concerned that
she was obliged to tell them everything that had
happened to her.</p>

<p>But it was a relief to Ingrid to speak. The old
people had their own way of taking things; they
clapped their hands when she told them how she
had got out of the grave and how she had frightened
the Pastor's wife. They caressed her and
praised her because she had run away from the
Parsonage. For them nothing was dull or sad,
but everything was bright and hopeful. They
simply had no standard by which to measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
reality, and therefore its hardness could not affect
them. They compared everything they heard
with the pieces from marionette theatres and pantomimes.
Of course, one also put a little sorrow
and misery into the pantomime, but that was only
done to heighten the effect. And, of course,
everything would end well. In the pantomimes
it always ended well.</p>

<p>There was something infectious in all this
hopefulness. Ingrid knew they did not at all understand
how great her trouble was, but it was
cheering all the same to listen to them.</p>

<p>But they were also of real help to Ingrid. They
told her that they had had dinner a short time
since at the inn at Tors&auml;ker, and just as they were
getting up from the table some peasants came
driving up with a man who was mad. Mrs.
Blomgren could not bear to see mad people, and
wanted to go away at once, and Mr. Blomgren
had consented. But supposing it was Ingrid's
madman! And they had hardly said the words
before Ingrid said that it was very likely, and
wanted to set off at once.</p>

<p>Mr. Blomgren then asked his wife in his own
ceremonious manner if they were not in the country
solely on account of the spring, and if it were
not just the same where they went. And old Mrs.
Blomgren asked him equally ceremoniously in
her turn if he thought she would leave her beloved
Ingrid before she had reached the harbour
of her happiness.</p>

<p>Then the old roundabout horse was turned,
and conversation grew more difficult, because
they again had to play on the Jews'-harp. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
soon as Mrs. Blomgren wished to say anything,
she was obliged to hand the instrument to Mr.
Blomgren, and when Mr. Blomgren wanted to
speak, he gave it back again to his wife. And
the little horse stood still every time the instrument
passed from mouth to mouth.</p>

<p>The whole time they did their best to comfort
Ingrid. They related all the fairy tales they had
seen represented at the dolls' theatre. They comforted
her with the 'Enchanted Princess,' they
comforted her with 'Cinderella,' they comforted
her with all the fairy tales under the sun.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Blomgren watched Ingrid when
they saw that her eyes grew brighter. 'Artist's
eyes,' they said, nodding contentedly to each
other. 'What did we say? Artist's eyes!'</p>

<p>In some incomprehensible manner they had
got the idea that Ingrid had become one of them,
an artist. They thought she was playing a part
in a drama. It was a triumph for them in their
old age.</p>

<p>On they went as fast as they could. The old
couple were only afraid that the madman would
not be at the inn any longer. But he was there,
and the worst of it was, no one knew how to get
him away.</p>

<p>The two peasants from Raglanda who had
brought him had taken him to one of the rooms
and locked him in whilst they were waiting for
fresh horses. When they left him his arms had
been tied behind him, but he had somehow managed
to free his hands from the cord, and when
they came to fetch him he was free, and, beside
himself with rage, had seized a chair, with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
he threatened to strike anyone who approached
him. They could do nothing but beat a hasty retreat
and lock the door. The peasants now only
waited for the landlord and his men to return and
help them to bind him again.</p>

<p>All the hope which Ingrid's old friends had reawakened
within her was, however, not quenched.
She quite saw that Gunnar Hede was worse than
he had ever been before, but that was what she
had expected. She still hoped. It was not their
fairy tales, it was their great love that had given
her new hope.</p>

<p>She asked the men to let her go to the madman.
She said she knew him, and he would not
do her any harm; but the peasants said they were
not mad. The man in the room would kill anybody
who went in.</p>

<p>Ingrid sat down to think. She thought how
strange it was that she should meet Mr. and Mrs.
Blomgren just to-day. Surely that meant something.
She would never have met them if it had
not been for some purpose. And Ingrid thought
of how Hede had regained his senses the last
time. Could she not again make him do something
which would remind him of olden days, and
drive away his mad thoughts? She thought and
thought.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Blomgren sat on a seat outside
the inn, looking more unhappy than one would
have thought was possible. They were not far
from crying.</p>

<p>Ingrid, their 'child,' came up to them with a
smile&mdash;such a smile as only she could have&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
stroked their old, wrinkled cheeks, and said it
would please her so much if they would let her
see a performance like those she used to see every
day in the olden time. It would be such a comfort
to her.</p>

<p>At first they said no, for they were not at all in
proper artist humour, but when she had expended
a few smiles upon them they could not resist her.
They went to their cart and unpacked their costumes.</p>

<p>When they were ready they called for the blind
man, and Ingrid selected the place where the performance
was to be held. She would not let them
perform in the yard, but took them into the garden
belonging to the inn, for there was a garden
belonging to this inn. It was mostly full of beds
for vegetables which had not yet come up, but
here and there was an apple-tree in bloom. And
Ingrid said she would like them to perform under
one of the apple-trees in bloom.</p>

<p>Some lads and servant-girls came running
when they heard the violin, so there was a small
audience. But it was hard work for Mr. and Mrs.
Blomgren to perform. Ingrid had asked too
much of them; they were really much too sad.</p>

<p>And it was very unfortunate that Ingrid had
taken them out into the garden. She had evidently
not remembered that the rooms in the inn
faced this way. Mrs. Blomgren was very nearly
running away when she heard a window in one
of the rooms quickly opened. Supposing the
madman had heard the music, and supposing he
jumped out of the window and came to them?</p>

<p>But Mrs. Blomgren was somewhat reassured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
when she saw who had opened the window. It
was a young gentleman with a pleasant face. He
was in shirt-sleeves, but otherwise very decently
dressed. His eye was quiet, his lips smiled, and
he stroked his hair back from his forehead with
his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Blomgren was working, and was so taken
up with the performance that he did not notice
anything. Mrs. Blomgren, who had nothing else
to do but kiss her hands in all directions, had
time to observe everything.</p>

<p>It was astonishing how radiant Ingrid suddenly
looked. Her eyes shone as never before,
and her face was so white that light seemed to
come from it. And all this radiancy was directed
towards the man in the window.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate long. He stood up on the
window-sill and jumped down to them, and he
went up to the blind man and asked him to lend
him his violin. Ingrid at once took the violin
from the blind man and gave it to him.</p>

<p>'Play the waltz from "Freisch&uuml;tz,"' she said.</p>

<p>Then the man began to play, and Ingrid smiled,
but she looked so unearthly that Mrs. Blomgren
almost thought that she would dissolve into a
sunbeam, and fly away from them. But as soon
as Mrs. Blomgren heard the man play she knew
him again.</p>

<p>'Is that how it is?' she said to herself. 'Is it
he? That was why she wanted to see two old
people perform.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gunnar Hede, who had been walking up and
down his room in such a rage that he felt inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
to kill someone, had suddenly heard a blind man
playing outside his window, and that had taken
him back to an incident in his former life.</p>

<p>He could not at first understand where his
own violin was, but then he remembered that Alin
had taken it away with him, and now the only
thing left for him to do was to try and borrow the
blind man's violin to play himself quiet again; he
was so excited. And as soon as he had got the
violin in his hand he began to play. It never occurred
to him that he could not play. He had no
idea that for several years he had only been able
to play some poor little tunes.</p>

<p>He thought all the time he was in Upsala, outside
the house with the Virginia-creepers, and he
expected the acrobats would begin to dance as
they had done last time. He endeavoured to
play with more life to make them do so, but his
fingers were stiff and awkward; the bow would
not properly obey them. He exerted himself so
much that the perspiration stood on his forehead.</p>

<p>At last, however, he got hold of the right tune&mdash;the
same they had danced to the last time. He
played it so enticingly, so temptingly, that it
ought to have melted their hearts. But the old
acrobats did not begin to dance. It was a long
time since they had met the student at Upsala;
they did not remember how enthusiastic they
were then. They had no idea what he expected
them to do.</p>

<p>Gunnar Hede looked at Ingrid for an explanation
why they did not dance. When he looked at
her there was such an unearthly radiance in her
eyes that in his astonishment he gave up playing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
He stood a moment looking round the small
crowd. They all looked at him with such strange,
uneasy glances. It was impossible to play with people
staring at him so. He simply went away from
them. There were some apple-pears in bloom at
the other end of the garden, so he went there.</p>

<p>He saw now that nothing fitted in with the ideas
he had just had that Alin had locked him in, and
that he was at Upsala. The garden was too large,
and the house was not covered with red creepers.
No, it could not be Upsala. But he did not mind
very much where he was. It seemed to him as if
he had not played for centuries, and now he had
got hold of a violin. Now he would play. He
placed the violin against his cheek, and began.
But again he was stopped by the stiffness in his
fingers. He could only play the very simplest
things.</p>

<p>'I shall have to begin at the beginning,' he
said.</p>

<p>And he smiled and played a little minuet. It
was the first thing he had learnt. His father had
played it to him, and he had afterwards played it
from ear. He saw all at once the whole scene before
him, and he heard the words:</p>

<p>'The little Prince should learn to dance, but he
broke his little leg.'</p>

<p>Then he tried to play several other small
dances. They were some he had played as a
school boy. They had asked him to play at the
dancing-lessons at the young ladies' boarding-school.
He could see the girls dance and swing
about, and could hear the dancing-mistress beat
the time with her foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he grew bolder. He played first violin in
one of Mozart's quartettes. When he learnt that,
he was in the Sixth Form at the Latin school at
Falun. Some old gentlemen had practised this
quartette for a concert, but the first violin had
been taken ill, and he was asked to take his part,
young as he was. He remembered how proud he
had been.</p>

<p>Gunnar Hede only thought of getting his fingers
into practice when he played these childish
exercises. But he soon noticed that something
strange was happening to him. He had a distinct
sensation that in his brain there was some great
darkness that hid his past. As soon as he tried
to remember anything, it was as if he were trying
to find something in a dark room; but when he
played, some of the darkness vanished. Without
his having thought of it, the darkness had vanished
so much that he could now remember his
childhood and school life.</p>

<p>Then he made up his mind to let himself be led
by the violin; perhaps it could drive away all the
darkness. And so it did, for every piece he
played the darkness vanished a little. The violin
led him through the one year after the other,
awoke in him memories of studies, friends and
pleasures. The darkness stood like a wall before
him, but when he advanced against it, armed with
the violin, it vanished step by step. Now and
then he looked round to see whether it closed
again behind him. But behind him was bright
day.</p>

<p>The violin came to a series of duets for piano
and violin. He only played a bar or two of each.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
But a large portion of the darkness vanished; he
remembered his <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fianc&eacute;e</span></em> and his engagement. He
would like to have dwelt a little over this, but
there was still much darkness left to be played
away. He had no time.</p>

<p>He glided into a hymn. He had heard it once
when he was unhappy. He remembered he was
sitting in a village church when he heard it. But
why <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original has had be">had he</span> been unhappy? Because he went
about the country selling goods like a poor pedlar.
It was a hard life. It was sad to think
about it.</p>

<p>The bow went over the strings like a whirlwind,
and again cut through a large portion of the
darkness. Now he saw the Fifty-Mile Forest, the
snow-covered animals, the weird shapes, the drifts
made of them. He remembered the journey to
see his <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fianc&eacute;e</span></em>, remembered that she had broken
the engagement. All this became clear to him at
one time.</p>

<p>He really felt neither sorrow nor joy over anything
he remembered. The most important thing
was that he did remember. This of itself was an
unspeakable pleasure. But all at once the bow
stopped, as if of its own accord. It would not
lead him any further. And yet there was more&mdash;much
more&mdash;that he must remember. The darkness
still stood like a solid wall before him.</p>

<p>He compelled the bow to go on. And it played
two quite common tunes, the poorest he had ever
heard. How could his bow have learned such
tunes? The darkness did not vanish in the least
for these tunes. They really taught him nothing;
but from them came a terror which he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
remember having ever felt before&mdash;an inconceivable,
awful fear, the mad terror of a doomed soul.</p>

<p>He stopped playing; he could not bear it.
What was there in these tunes&mdash;what was there?
The darkness did not vanish for them, and the
awful thing was, that it seemed to him that when
he did not advance against the darkness with the
violin and drive it before him, it came gliding
towards him to overwhelm him.</p>

<p>He had been standing playing, with his eyes
half closed; now he opened them and looked into
the world of reality. He saw Ingrid, who had
been standing listening to him the whole time.
He asked her, not expecting an answer, but simply
to keep back the darkness for a moment:</p>

<p>'When did I last play this tune?'</p>

<p>But Ingrid stood trembling. She had made up
her mind, whatever happened, now he should
hear the truth. Afraid she was, but at the same
time full of courage, and quite decided as to what
she meant to do. He should not again escape
her, not be allowed to slip away from her. But
in spite of her courage she did not dare to tell him
straight out that these were the tunes he had
played whilst he was out of his mind; she evaded
the question.</p>

<p>'That was what you used to play at Munkhyttan
last winter,' she said.</p>

<p>Hede felt as if he were surrounded by nothing
but mysteries. Why did this young girl say '<em><span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">du</span></em>'
to him? She was not a peasant girl.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Her hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
was dressed like other young ladies', on the top of
the head and in small curls. Her dress was home-woven,
but she wore a lace collar. She had small
hands and a refined face. This face, with the
large, dreamy eyes, could not belong to a peasant
girl. Hede's memory could not tell him anything
about her. Why did she, then, say '<em><span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">du</span></em>' to
him? How did she know that he had played
these tunes at home?</p>

<p>'What is your name?' he said. 'Who are
you?'</p>

<p>'I am Ingrid, whom you saw at Upsala many
years ago, and whom you comforted because she
could not learn to dance on the tight-rope.'</p>

<p>This went back to the time he could partly remember.
Now he did remember her.</p>

<p>'How tall and pretty you have grown, Ingrid!'
he said. 'And how fine you have become!
What a beautiful brooch you have!'</p>

<p>He had been looking at her brooch for some
time. He thought he knew it; it was like a
brooch of enamel and pearls his mother used to
wear. The young girl answered at once.</p>

<p>'Your mother gave it to me. You must have
seen it before.'</p>

<p>Gunnar Hede put down the violin and went up
to Ingrid. He asked her almost violently:</p>

<p>'How is it possible&mdash;how can you wear her
brooch? How is it that I don't know anything
about your knowing my mother?'</p>

<p>Ingrid was frightened. She grew almost gray
with terror. She knew already what the next
question would be.</p>

<p>'I know nothing, Ingrid. I don't know why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
I am here. I don't know why you are here. Why
don't I know all this?'</p>

<p>'Oh, don't ask me!'</p>

<p>She went back a step or two, and stretched out
her hands as if to protect herself.</p>

<p>'Won't you tell me?'</p>

<p>'Don't ask! don't ask!'</p>

<p>He seized her roughly by the wrist to compel
her to tell the truth.</p>

<p>'Tell me! I am in my full senses! Why is
there so much I can't remember?'</p>

<p>She saw something wild and threatening in his
eyes. She knew now that she would be obliged
to tell him. But she felt as if it were impossible
to tell a man that he had been mad. It was much
more difficult than she had thought. It was impossible&mdash;impossible!</p>

<p>'Tell me!' he repeated.</p>

<p>But she could hear from his voice that he would
not hear it. He was almost ready to kill her if
she told him. Then she summoned up all her
love, and looked straight into Gunnar Hede's
eyes, and said:</p>

<p>'You have not been quite right.'</p>

<p>'Not for a long time?'</p>

<p>'I don't quite know&mdash;not for three or four
years.'</p>

<p>'Have I been out of my mind?'</p>

<p>'No, no! You have bought and sold and gone
to the fairs.'</p>

<p>'In what way have I been mad?'</p>

<p>'You were frightened.'</p>

<p>'Of whom was I frightened?'</p>

<p>'Of animals.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>'Of goats, perhaps?'</p>

<p>'Yes, mostly of goats.'</p>

<p>He had stood clutching her by the wrist the
whole time. He now flung her hand away from
him&mdash;simply flung it. He turned away from Ingrid
in a rage, as if she had maliciously told him
an infamous lie.</p>

<p>But this feeling gave way for something else
which excited him still more. He saw before his
eyes, as distinctly as if it had been a picture, a tall
Dalar man, weighed down by a huge pack. He
was going into a peasant's house, but a wretched
little dog came rushing at him. He stopped and
curtsied and curtsied, and did not dare to go in
until a man came out of the house, laughing, and
drove the dog away.</p>

<p>When he saw this he again felt that terrible
fear. In this anguish the vision disappeared, but
then he heard voices. They shouted and shrieked
around him. They laughed. Derision was showered
upon him. Worst and loudest were the
shrill voices of children. One word, one name
came over and over again: it was shouted,
shrieked, whispered, wheezed into his ear&mdash;'The
Goat! the Goat!' And that all meant him, Gunnar
Hede. All that he had lived in. He felt in
full consciousness the same unspeakable fear he
had suffered whilst out of his mind. But now it
was not fear for anything outside himself&mdash;now
he was afraid of himself.</p>

<p>'It was I! it was I!' he said, wringing his
hands. The next moment he was kneeling
against a low seat. He laid his head down and
cried, cried: 'It was I!' He moaned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
sobbed. 'It was I!' How could he have courage
to bear this thought&mdash;a madman, scorned
and laughed at by all? 'Ah! let me go mad
again!' he said, hitting the seat with his fist.
'This is more than a human being can bear.'</p>

<p>He held his breath a moment. The darkness
came towards him as the saviour he invoked. It
came gliding towards him like a mist. A smile
passed over his lips. He could feel the muscles
of his face relax, feel that he again had the look
of a madman. But that was better. The other
he could not bear. To be pointed at, jeered at,
scorned, mad! No, it was better to be so again
and not to know it. Why should he come back
to life? Everyone must loathe him. The first
light, fleeting clouds of the great darkness began
to enwrap him.</p>

<p>Ingrid stood there, seeing and hearing all his
anguish, not knowing but that all would soon be
lost again. She saw clearly that madness was
again about to seize him. She was so frightened,
so frightened, all her courage had gone. But before
he again lost his senses, and became so
scared that he allowed no one to come near him,
she would at least take leave of him and of all
her happiness.</p>

<p>Gunnar Hede felt that Ingrid came and knelt
down beside him, laid her arm round his neck,
put her cheek to his, and kissed him. She did not
think herself too good to come near him, the
madman, did not think herself too good to kiss
him.</p>

<p>There was a faint hissing in the darkness. The
mist lifted, and it was as if serpents had raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
their heads against him, and now wheezed with
anger that they could not reach to sting him.</p>

<p>'Do not be so unhappy,' Ingrid said. 'Do not
be so unhappy. No one thinks of the past, if you
will only get well.'</p>

<p>'I want to be mad again,' he said. 'I cannot
bear it. I cannot bear to think how I have been.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you can,' said Ingrid.</p>

<p>'No; that no one can forget,' he moaned. 'I
was so dreadful! No one can love me.'</p>

<p>'I love you,' she said.</p>

<p>He looked up doubtfully.</p>

<p>'You kissed me in order that I should not go
out of my mind again. You pity me.'</p>

<p>'I will kiss you again,' she said.</p>

<p>'You say that now because you think I am in
need of hearing it.'</p>

<p>'Are you in need of hearing that someone loves
you?'</p>

<p>'If I am&mdash;if I am? Ah, child,' he said, and tore
himself away from her, 'how can I possibly bear
it, when I know that everyone who sees me
thinks: "That fellow has been mad; he has gone
about curtsying for dogs and cats."'</p>

<p>Then he began again. He lay crying with his
face in his hands.</p>

<p>'It is better to go out of one's mind again. I
can hear them shouting after me, and I see myself,
and the anguish, the anguish, the anguish&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But then Ingrid's patience came to an end.</p>

<p>'Yes, that is right,' she cried; 'go out of your
mind again. I call that manly to go mad in order
to escape a little anguish.'</p>

<p>She sat biting her lips, struggling with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
tears, and as she could not get the words out
quickly enough, she seized him by the shoulder
and shook him. She was enraged and quite beside
herself with anger because he would again
escape her, because he did not struggle and
fight.</p>

<p>'What do you care about me? What do you
care about your mother? You go mad, and then
you will have peace.' She shook him again by
the arm. 'To be saved from anguish, you say,
but you don't care about one who has been waiting
for you all her life. If you had any thought
for anyone but yourself, you would fight against
this and get well; but you have no thought for
others. You can come so touchingly in visions
and dreams and beg for help, but in reality you
will not have any help. You imagine that your
sufferings are greater than anyone else's, but
there are others who have suffered more than
you.'</p>

<p>At last Gunnar Hede raised his eyes, and
looked her straight in the face. She was anything
but beautiful at this moment. Tears were
streaming down her cheeks, and her lips trembled,
whilst she tried to get out the words between her
sobs. But in his eyes her emotion only made her
more beautiful. A wonderful peace came over
him, and a great and humble thankfulness.
Something great and wonderful had come to him
in his deepest humiliation. It must be a great
love&mdash;a great love.</p>

<p>He had sat bemoaning his wretchedness, and
Love came and knocked at his door. He would
not merely be tolerated when he came back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
life; people would not only with difficulty refrain
from laughing at him.</p>

<p>There was one who loved him and longed for
him. She spoke hardly to him, but he heard love
trembling in every single word. He felt as if she
were offering him thrones and kingdoms. She
told him that whilst he had been out of his mind
he had saved her life. He had awakened her from
the dead, had helped her, protected her. But this
was not enough for her; she would possess him
altogether.</p>

<p>When she kissed him he had felt a life-giving
balm enter his sick soul, but he had hardly dared
to think that it was love that made her. But he
could not doubt her anger and her tears. He
was beloved&mdash;he, poor wretched creature! he
who had been held in derision by everybody! and
before the great and humble bliss which now
filled Gunnar Hede vanished the last darkness. It
was drawn aside like a heavy curtain, and he saw
plainly before him the region of terror through
which he had wandered. But there, too, he had
met Ingrid; there he had lifted her from the
grave; there he had played for her at the hut in
the forest; there she had striven to heal him.</p>

<p>But only the memory of her came back: the
feelings with which she had formerly inspired him
now awoke. Love filled his whole being; he felt
the same burning longing that he had felt in the
churchyard at Raglanda when she was taken from
him.</p>

<p>In that region of terror, in that great desert,
there had at any rate grown one flower that had
comforted him with fragrance and beauty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
now he felt that love would dwell with him forever.
The wild flower of the desert had been
transplanted into the garden of life, and had taken
root and grown and thriven, and when he felt this
he knew he was saved; he knew that the darkness
had found its master.</p>

<p>Ingrid was silent. She was tired, as one is tired
after hard work; but she was also content, for
she felt she had carried out her work in the best
possible manner. She knew she had conquered.</p>

<p>At last Gunnar Hede broke the silence.</p>

<p>'I promise you that I will not give in,' he said.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' Ingrid answered.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said.</p>

<p>Gunnar Hede thought he would never be able
to tell her how much he loved her. It could never
be told in words, only shown every day and every
hour of his life.</p>

would assuredly be much surprised. He would
ask himself whether churches and fortifications
could melt away like snow, or if the earth had
opened and swallowed them up. He stands on
a spot where formerly there was a mighty city,
and he cannot find a street or a landing-stage.
He sees neither ruins nor traces of devastating
fires; he only sees a country seat, surrounded by
green trees and red outbuildings. He sees nothing
but broad meadows and fields, where the
plough does its work year after year without being
hindered either by brick foundations or old
pavements.</p>

<p>He would probably first of all go down to the
river. He would not expect to see anything of
the great ships that went to the Baltic ports or to
distant Spain, but he would in all likelihood think
that he might find traces of the old ship-yards, of
the large boat-houses and landing-stages. He
presumes that he will find some of the old kilns
where they used to refine salt; he will see the
worn-out pavement on the main street that led to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the harbour. He will inquire about the German
pier and the Swedish pier; he would like to see
the Weeping Bridge where the women of Kungah&auml;lla
took leave of their husbands and sons when
they went to distant lands, but when he comes
down to the river's edge he sees nothing but a
forest of waving reeds. He sees a road full of
holes leading down to the ferry; he sees a couple
of common barges and a little flat-bottomed ferryboat
that is taking a peasant cart over to Hisingen,
but no big ships come gliding up the river.
He does not even see any dark hulls lying and
rotting at the bottom of the river.</p>

<p>As he does not find anything remarkable down
at the harbour, he will probably begin to look for
the celebrated Convent Hill. He expects to see
traces of the palisading and ramparts which in
olden days surrounded it. He is hoping to see
the ruins of the high walls and the long cloisters.
He says to himself that anyhow there must be
ruins of that magnificent church where the cross
was kept&mdash;that miracle-working cross which had
been brought from Jerusalem. He thinks of the
number of monuments covering the holy hills
which rise over other ancient cities, and his heart
begins to beat with glad expectation. But when
he comes to the old Convent Hill which rises
above the fields, he finds nothing but clusters of
murmuring trees; he finds neither walls, nor towers,
nor gables perforated with pointed arched
windows. Garden seats and benches he will find
under the shadow of the trees, but no cloisters
decorated with pillars, no hewn gravestones.</p>

<p>Well, if he has not found anything here, he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
in any case try to find the old King's Hall. He
thinks about the large halls from which Kungah&auml;lla
is supposed to have derived its name. It
might be that there was something left of the
timber&mdash;a yard thick&mdash;that formed the walls, or
of the deep cellars under the great hall where the
Norwegian kings celebrated their banquets. He
thinks of the smooth green courtyard of the
King's Hall, where the kings used to ride their
silver-shod chargers, and where the queens used
to milk the golden-horned cows. He thinks of
the lofty ladies' bower; of the brewing-room, with
its large boilers; of the huge kitchen, where half
an ox at a time was placed in the pot, and where a
whole hog was roasted on the spit. He thinks of
the serfs' house, of the falcon's cages, of the great
pantries&mdash;house by house all round the courtyard,
moss-grown with age, decorated with
dragons' heads. Of such a number of buildings
there must be some traces left, he thinks.</p>

<p>But should he then inquire for the old King's
Hall, he will be taken to a modern country-house,
with glass veranda and conservatories. The
King's seat has vanished, and with it all the drinking-horns,
inlaid with silver, and the shields, covered
with skin. One cannot even show him the
well-kept courtyard, with its short, close grass,
and with narrow paths of black earth. He sees
strawberry-beds and hedges of rose-trees; he
sees happy children and young girls dancing under
apple and pear trees. But he does not see
strong men wrestling, or knights playing at ball.</p>

<p>Perhaps he asks about the great oak on the
Market Place, beneath which the Kings sat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
judgment, and where the twelve stones of judgment
were set up. Or about the long street,
which was said to be seven miles long! Or about
the rich merchants' houses, separated by dark
lanes, each having its own landing-stage and
boathouse down by the river. Or about the
Marie Church in the Market Place, where the
seamen brought their offerings of small, full-rigged
ships, and the sorrowful, small silver
hearts.</p>

<p>But there is nothing left to show him of all
these things. Cows and sheep graze where the
long street used to be. Rye and barley grow on
the Market Place, and stables and barns stand
where people used to flock round the tempting
market-stalls.</p>

<p>How can he help feeling disappointed? Is
there not a single thing to be found, he says, not
a single relic left? And he thinks perhaps that
they have been deceiving him. The great Kungah&auml;lla
can never have stood here, he says. It
must have stood in some other place.</p>

<p>Then they take him down to the riverside, and
show him a roughly-hewn stone block, and they
scrape away the silver-gray lichen, so that he can
see there are some figures hewn in the stone. He
will not be able to understand what they represent;
they will be as incomprehensible to him as
the spots in the moon. But they will assure him
that they represent a ship and an elk, and that
they were cut in the stone in the olden days
to commemorate the foundation of the city.</p>

<p>And should he still not be able to understand,
they will tell him what is the meaning of the inscription
on the stone.</p>

<h3><a name="Forest" id="Forest"><span class="dec_italic">The Forest</span> <span class="smcap">Queen</span></a></h3>

<p>Marcus Antonius Poppius was a Roman
merchant of high standing. He traded with distant
lands; and from the harbour at Ostia he
sent well-equipped triremas to Spain, to Britain,
and even to the north coast of Germany. Fortune
favoured him, and he amassed immense
riches, which he hoped to leave as an inheritance
to his only son. Unfortunately, this only son
had not inherited his father's ability. This happens,
unfortunately, all the world over. A rich
man's only son. Need one say more? It is,
and always will be, the same story.</p>

<p>One would almost think that the gods give rich
men these incorrigible idlers, these dull, pale, languid
fools of sons, to show man what unutterable
folly it is to amass riches. When will the eyes of
mankind be opened? When will men listen to
the warning voice of the gods?</p>

<p>Young Silvius Antonius Poppius, at the age of
twenty, had already tried all the pleasures of life.
He was also fond of letting people see that he was
tired of them; but in spite of that, one did not notice
any diminution in the eagerness with which
he sought them. On the contrary, he was quite
in despair when a singularly persistent ill-luck began
to pursue him, and to interfere with all his
pleasures. His Numidian horses fell lame the
day before the great chariot race of the year; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
illicit love affairs were found out; his cleverest
cook died from malaria. This was more than
enough to crush a man whose strength had not
been hardened by exertion and toil. Young
Poppius felt so unhappy that he made up his mind
to take his own life. He seemed to think that this
was the only way in which he could cheat the God
of Misfortune who pursued him and made his life
a burden.</p>

<p>One can understand that an unhappy creature
commits suicide in order to escape the persecution
of man; but only a fool like Silvius Antonius
could think of adopting such means to flee from
the gods. One recalls involuntarily the story of
the man who, to escape from the lion, sprang right
into its open jaws.</p>

<p>Young Silvius was much too effeminate to
choose a bloody death. Neither had he any inclination
to die from a painful poison. After careful
consideration, he resolved to die the gentle
death of the waves.</p>

<p>But when he went down to the Tiber to drown
himself he could not make up his mind to give his
body to the dirty, sluggish water of the river.
For a long time he stood undecided, staring into
the stream. Then he was seized by the magic
charm which lies dreamily over a river. He felt
that great, holy longing which fills these never-resting
wanderers of nature; he would see the sea.</p>

<p>'I will die in the clear blue sea, through which
the sun's rays penetrate right to the bottom,' said
Silvius Antonius. 'My body shall rest upon a
couch of pink coral. The foamy waves which I
set in motion when I sink into the deep shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
snow-white and fresh; they shall not be like the
sooty froth which lies quivering at the river-side.'</p>

<p>He immediately hurried home, had his horses
harnessed and drove to Ostia. He knew that one
of his father's ships was lying in the harbour
ready to sail. Young Poppius drove his horses
at a furious pace, and he succeeded in getting on
board just as the anchor was being weighed. Of
course he did not think it necessary to take any
baggage with him. He did not even trouble to
ask the skipper for what place the craft was
bound. To the sea they were going, in any case&mdash;that
was enough for him.</p>

<p>Nor was it very long before the young suicide
reached the goal of his desire. The trirema
passed the mouth of the Tiber, and the Mediterranean
lay before Silvius Antonius, its sparkling
waves bathed in sun. Its beauty made Silvius
Antonius believe in the poet's assertion that the
swelling ocean is but a thin veil which covers the
most beautiful world. He felt bound to believe
that he who boldly makes his way through this
cover will immediately reach the sea-god's palace
of pearls. The young man congratulated himself
that he had chosen this manner of death. And
one could scarcely call it that; it was impossible
to believe that this beautiful water could kill. It
was only the shortest road to a land where pleasure
is not a delusion, leaving nothing but distaste
and loathing. He could only with difficulty suppress
his eagerness. But the whole deck was
full of sailors. Even Silvius could understand
that if he now sprang into the sea the consequence
would simply be that one of his father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
sailors would quickly spring overboard and fish
him out.</p>

<p>As soon as the sails were set and the oarsmen
were well in swing, the skipper came up to him
and saluted him with the greatest politeness.</p>

<p>'You intend, then, to go with me to Germany,
my Silvius?' he said. 'You do me great honour.'</p>

<p>Young Poppius suddenly remembered that
this man used never to return from a voyage without
bringing him some curious thing or other
from the barbarous countries he had visited.
Sometimes it was a couple of pieces of wood with
which the savages made fire; sometimes it was
the black horn of an ox, which they used as a
drinking-vessel; sometimes a necklace of bear's
teeth, which had been a great chief's mark of distinction.</p>

<p>The good man beamed with joy at having his
master's son on board his ship. He saw in it a
new proof of the wisdom of old Poppius, in sending
his son to distant lands, instead of letting him
waste more time amongst the effeminate young
Roman idlers.</p>

<p>Young Poppius did not wish to undeceive him.
He was afraid that if he disclosed his intention
the skipper would at once turn back with him.</p>

<p>'Verily, Galenus,' he said, 'I would gladly accompany
you on this voyage, but I fear I must
ask you to put me ashore at Baj&aelig;. I made up my
mind too late. I have neither clothes nor money.'</p>

<p>But Galenus assured him that that need was
soon remedied. Was he not upon his father's
well-appointed vessel? He should not want for
anything&mdash;neither warm fur tunic when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
weather was cold, or light Syrian clothing of the
kind that seamen wear when they cruise in fair
weather in the friendly seas between the islands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three months after their departure from Ostia,
Galenus's trirema rowed in amongst a cluster of
rocky islands. Neither the skipper nor any of his
crew were quite clear as to where they really
were, but they were glad to take shelter for a
time from the storms that raged on the open sea.</p>

<p>One could almost think that Silvius Antonius
was right in his belief that some deity persecuted
him. No one on the ship had ever before experienced
such a voyage. The luckless sailors
said to each other that they had not had fair
weather for two days since they left Ostia. The
one storm had followed upon the other. They
had undergone the most terrible sufferings. They
had suffered hunger and thirst, whilst they, day
and night, exhausted and almost fainting from
want of sleep, had had to manage sails and oars.
The fact of the seamen being unable to trade had
added to their despondency. How could they
approach the coast and display their wares on the
shore to effect an exchange in such weather? On
the contrary, every time they saw the coast appear
through the obstinate heavy mist that surrounded
them, they had been compelled to put
out to sea again for fear of the foam-decked rocks.
One night, when they struck on a rock, they had
been obliged to throw the half of their cargo into
the sea. And as for the other half, they dared not
think about it, as they feared it was completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
spoiled by the breakers which had rolled over the
ship.</p>

<p>Certain it was that Silvius Antonius had proved
himself not to be lucky at sea either. Silvius
Antonius was still living; he had not drowned
himself. It is difficult to say why he prolonged an
existence which could not be of any more pleasure
to him now than when he first made up his
mind to cut it short. Perhaps he had hoped that
the sea would have taken possession of him without
he himself doing anything to bring it about.
Perhaps his love for the sea had passed away during
its bursts of anger; perhaps he had resolved
to die in the opal-green perfumed water of his
bath.</p>

<p>But had Galenus and his men known why the
young man had come on board, they would assuredly
have bitterly complained that he had not
carried out his intention, for they were all convinced
that it was his presence which had called
forth their misfortunes. Many a dark night Galenus
had feared that the sailors would throw him
into the sea. More than one of them related that
in the terrible stormy nights he had seen dark
hands stretching out of the water, grasping after
the ship. And they did not think it was necessary
to cast lots to find out who it was that these hands
wanted to draw down into the deep. Both the
skipper and the crew did Silvius Antonius the
special honour to think that it was for his sake
these storms rent the air and scourged the sea.</p>

<p>If Silvius during this time had behaved like a
man, if he had taken his share of their work and
anxiety, then perhaps some of his companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
might have had pity upon him as a being who had
brought upon himself the wrath of the gods. But
the young man had not understood how to win
their sympathy. He had only thought of seeking
shelter for himself from the wind, and of sending
them to fetch furs and rugs from the stores for his
protection from the cold.</p>

<p>But for the moment all complaints over his
presence had ceased. As soon as the storm had
succeeded in driving the trirema into the quiet
waters between the islands, its rage was spent.
It behaved like a sheep-dog that becomes silent
and keeps quiet as soon as it sees the sheep on the
right way to the fold. The heavy clouds disappeared
from the sky; the sun shone. For the first
time during the voyage the sailors felt the joys
of summer spreading over Nature.</p>

<p>Upon these storm-beaten men the sunshine and
the warmth had almost an intoxicating effect.
Instead of longing for rest and sleep, they became
as merry as happy children in the morning.
They expected they would find a large continent
behind all these rocks and boulders. They hoped
to find people, and&mdash;who could tell?&mdash;on this
foreign coast, which had probably never before
been visited by a Roman ship, their wares would
no doubt find a ready sale. In that case they
might after all do some good business, and bring
back with them skins of bear and elk, and large
quantities of white wax and golden amber.</p>

<p>Whilst the trirema slowly made its way between
the rocks, which grew higher and higher
and richer with verdure and trees, the crew made
haste to decorate it so that it could attract the at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>tention
of the barbarians. The ship, which, even
without any decoration, was a beautiful specimen
of human handiwork, soon rivalled in splendour
the most gorgeous bird. Recently tossed about
by storms and ravaged by tempests, it now bore
on its topmast a golden sceptre and sails striped
with purple. In the bows a resplendent figure of
Neptune was raised, and in the stern a tent of
many-coloured silken carpets. And do not think
the sailors neglected to hang the sides of the ship
with rugs, the fringes of which trailed in the
water, or to wind the long oars of the ship with
golden ribbons. Neither did the crew of the ship
wear the clothes they had worn during the
voyage, and which the sea and the storm had
done their best to destroy. They arrayed themselves
in white garments, wound purple scarves
round their waists, and placed glittering bands in
their hair.</p>

<p>Even Silvius Antonius roused himself from his
apathy. It was as if he was glad of having at last
found something to do which he thoroughly understood.
He was shaved, had his hair trimmed,
and his whole person rubbed over with fragrant
scents. Then he put on a flowing robe, hung a
mantle over his shoulders, and chose from the
large casket of jewels which Galenus opened for
him rings and bracelets, necklaces, and a golden
belt. When he was ready he flung aside the purple
curtains of the silken tent, and laid himself on
a couch in the opening of the tent in order to be
seen by the people on the shore.</p>

<p>During these preparations the sea became
narrower and narrower, and the sailors dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>covered
that they were entering the mouth of
a river. The water was fresh, and there was
land on both sides. The trirema glided slowly
onwards up the sparkling river. The weather
was brilliant, and the whole of nature was
gloriously peaceful. And how the magnificent
merchantman enlivened the great solitude!</p>

<p>On both sides of the river primeval forests,
high and thick, met their view. Pine-trees grew
right to the water's edge. The river in its eternal
course had washed away the earth from the
roots, and the hearts of the seamen were moved
with solemn awe at the sight, not only of these
venerable trees, but even more by that of the
naked roots, which resembled the mighty limbs
of a giant. 'Here,' they thought, 'man will
never succeed in planting corn; here the ground
will never be cleared for the building of a city,
or even a farmstead. For miles round the earth
is woven through with this network of roots,
hard as steel. This alone is sufficient to make
the dominion of the forest everlasting and unchangeable.'</p>

<p>Along the river the trees grew so close, and
their branches were so entangled, that they
formed firm, impenetrable walls. These walls of
prickly firs were so strong and high that no fortified
city need wish for stronger defences. But
here and there there was, all the same, an opening
in this wall of firs. It was the paths the wild
beasts had made on their way to the river to
drink. Through these openings the strangers
could obtain a glimpse of the interior of the forest.
They had never seen anything like it. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
sunless twilight there grew trees with trunks
of greater circumference than the gate-towers on
the walls of Rome. There was a multitude of
trees, fighting with each other for light and air.
Trees strove and struggled, trees were crippled
and weighed down by other trees. Trees took
root in the branches of other trees. Trees strove
and fought as if they had been human beings.</p>

<p>But if man or beast moved in this world of
trees they must have other modes of making
their way than those which the Romans knew,
for from the ground right up to the top of the
forest was a network of stiff bare branches.
From these branches fluttered long tangles of
gray lichen, transforming the trees into weird
beings with hair and beard. And beneath them
the ground was covered with rotten and rotting
trunks, and one's feet would have sunk into the
decayed wood as into melting snow.</p>

<p>The forest sent forth a fragrance which had
a drowsy effect upon the men on board the
ship. It was the strong odour of resin and wild
honey that blended with the sickly smell from
the decayed wood, and from innumerable gigantic
red and yellow mushrooms.</p>

<p>There was no doubt something awe-inspiring
in all this, but it was also elevating to see nature
in all its power before man had yet interfered
with its dominion. It was not long before one
of the sailors began to sing a hymn to the God
of the Forest, and involuntarily the whole crew
joined in. They had quite given up all thought
of meeting human beings in this forest-world.
Their hearts were filled with pious thoughts;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
they thought of the forest god and his nymphs.
They said to themselves that when Pan was
driven from the woods of Hellas he must have
taken refuge here in the far north. With pious
songs they entered his kingdom.</p>

<p>Every time there was a pause in the song
they heard a gentle music from the forest. The
tops of the fir-trees, vibrating in the noonday
heat, sang and played. The sailors often discontinued
their song in order to listen, if Pan
was not playing upon his flute.</p>

<p>The oarsmen rowed slower and slower. The
sailors gazed searchingly into the golden-green
and black-violet water flowing under the fir-trees.
They peered between the tall reeds which
quivered and rustled in the wash of the ship.
They were in such a state of expectation that
they started at the sight of the white water-lilies
that shone in the dark water between the
reeds.</p>

<p>And again they sang the song, 'Pan, thou
ruler of the forest!' They had given up all
thoughts of trading. They felt that they stood
at the entrance to the dwelling of the gods.
All earthly cares had left them. Then, all of
a sudden, at the outlet of one of the tracks, there
stood an elk, a royal deer with broad forehead
and a forest of antlers on its horns.</p>

<p>There was a breathless silence on the trirema.
They stemmed the oars to slacken speed. Silvius
Antonius arose from his purple couch.</p>

<p>All eyes were fixed upon the elk. They
thought they could discern that it carried something
on its back, but the darkness of the forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
and the drooping branches made it impossible
to see distinctly.</p>

<p>The huge animal stood for a long time and
scented the air, with its muzzle turned towards
the trirema. At last it seemed to understand
that there was no danger. It made a step towards
the water. Behind the broad horns one
could now discern more distinctly something
light and white. They wondered if the elk carried
on its back a harvest of wild roses.</p>

<p>The crew gently plied their oars. The trirema
drew nearer to the animal, which gradually
moved towards the edge of the reeds.</p>

<p>The elk strode slowly into the water, put down
its feet carefully, so as not to be caught by the
roots at the bottom. Behind the horns one
could now distinctly see the face of a maiden,
surrounded by fair hair. The elk carried on its
back one of those nymphs whom they had been
expectantly awaiting, and whom they felt sure
would be found in this primeval world.</p>

<p>A holy enthusiasm filled the men on the
trirema. One of them, who hailed from Sicily,
remembered a song which he had heard in his
youth, when he played on the flowery plains
around Syracuse. He began to sing softly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Nymph, amongst flowers born, Arethusa by name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou who in sheltered wood wanders, white like the moon.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And when the weather-beaten men understood
the words, they tried to subdue the storm-like
roar in their voices in order to sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Nymph, amongst flowers born, Arethusa by name.'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></div></div>

<p>They steered the ship nearer and nearer the
reeds. They did not heed that it had already
once or twice touched the bottom.</p>

<p>But the young forest maiden sat and played
hide-and-seek between the horns. One moment
she hid herself, the next she peeped out. She
did not stop the elk; she drove it further into
the river.</p>

<p>When the elk had gone some little distance,
she stroked it to make it stop. Then she bent
down and gathered two or three water-lilies.
The men on the ship looked a little foolishly at
each other. The nymph had, then, come solely
for the purpose of plucking the white water-lilies
that rocked on the waters of the river. She had
not come for the sake of the Roman seamen.</p>

<p>Then Silvius Antonius drew a ring from off
his finger, sent up a shout that made the nymph
look up, and threw her the ring. She stretched
out her hand and caught it. Her eyes sparkled.
She stretched out her hands for more. Silvius
Antonius again threw a ring.</p>

<p>Then she flung the water-lilies back into the
river and drove the elk further into the water.
Now and again she stopped, but then a ring
came flying from Silvius Antonius, and enticed
her further.</p>

<p>All at once she overcame her hesitation. The
colour rose in her cheeks. She came nearer to
the ship without it being necessary to tempt her.
The water was already up to the shoulders of
the elk. She came right under the side of the
vessel.</p>

<p>The sailors hung over the gunwales to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the beautiful nymph, should she wish to go on
board the trirema.</p>

<p>But she saw only Silvius Antonius, as he stood
there, decked with pearls and rings, and fair as
the sunrise. And when the young Roman saw
that the eyes of the nymph were fastened upon
him, he leant over even further than the others.
They cried to him that he should take care, lest
he should lose his balance and fall into the sea.
But this warning came too late. It is not known
whether the nymph, with a quick movement,
drew Silvius Antonius to her, or how it really
happened, but before anyone thought of grasping
him, he was overboard.</p>

<p>All the same, there was no danger of Silvius
Antonius drowning. The nymph stretched forth
her lovely arms and caught him in them. He
hardly touched the surface of the water. At the
same moment her steed turned, rushed through
the water, and disappeared in the forest. And
loudly rang the laugh of the wild rider as she
carried off Silvius Antonius.</p>

<p>Galenus and his men stood for a moment
horror-stricken. Then some of the men involuntarily
threw off their clothes to swim to the
shore; but Galenus stopped them.</p>

<p>'Without doubt this is the will of the gods,'
he said. 'Now we see the reason why they have
brought Silvius Antonius Poppius through a
thousand storms to this unknown land. Let us
be glad that we have been an instrument in their
hands; and let us not seek to hinder their
will.'</p>

<p>The seamen obediently took their oars and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
rowed down the river, softly singing to their
even stroke the song of Arethusa's flight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When one has finished this story, surely the
stranger must be able to understand the inscription
on the old stone. He must be able to see
both the elk with its many-antlered horns, and
the trirema with its long oars. One does not
expect that he shall be able to see Silvius Antonius
Poppius and the beautiful queen of the
primeval forest, for in order to see them he
must have the eyes of the relaters of fairy-tales
of bygone days. He will understand that the
inscription hales from the young Roman himself,
and that this also applies to the whole of the
old story. Silvius Antonius has handed it down
to his descendants word for word. He knew
that it would gladden their hearts to know that
they sprang from the world-famed Romans.</p>

<p>But the stranger, of course, need not believe
that any of Pan's nymphs have wandered here
by the river's side. He understands quite well
that a tribe of wild men have wandered about
in the primeval forest, and that the rider of the
elk was the daughter of the King who ruled over
these people; and that the maiden who carried
off Silvius Antonius would only rob him of his
jewels, and that she did not at all think of Silvius
Antonius himself, scarcely knew, perhaps, that
he was a human being like herself. And the
stranger can also understand that the name of
Silvius Antonius would have been forgotten long
ago in this country had he remained the fool he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
was. He will hear how misfortune and want
roused the young Roman, so that from being
the despised slave of the wild men he became
their King. It was he who attacked the forest
with fire and steel. He erected the first firmly-timbered
house. He built vessels and planted
corn. He laid the foundation of the power and
glory of great Kungah&auml;lla.</p>

<p>And when the stranger hears this, he looks
around the country with a more contented
glance than before. For even if the site of the
city has been turned into fields and meadows,
and even if the river no longer boasts of busy
craft, still, this is the ground that has enabled
him to breathe the air of the land of dreams, and
shown him visions of bygone days.</p>

<h3><a name="Sigrid" id="Sigrid"><span class="smcap">Sigrid Storr&auml;de</span></a></h3>

<p>Once upon a time there was an exceedingly
beautiful spring. It was the very spring that the
Swedish Queen Sigrid Storr&auml;de summoned the
Norwegian King Olaf Trygveson to meet her at
Kungah&auml;lla in order to settle about their marriage.</p>

<p>It was strange that King Olaf would marry
Queen Sigrid; for although she was fair and
well-gifted, she was a wicked heathen, whilst
King Olaf was a Christian, who thought of
nothing but building churches and compelling
the people to be baptized. But maybe the King
thought that God the Almighty would convert
her.</p>

<p>But it was even more strange that when Storr&auml;de
had announced to King Olaf's messenger
that she would set out for Kungah&auml;lla as soon
as the sea was no longer ice-bound, spring should
come almost immediately. Cold and snow disappeared
at the time when winter is usually at
its height. And when Storr&auml;de made known
that she would begin to equip her ships, the ice
vanished from the fjords, the meadows became
green, and although it was yet a long time to
Lady-day, the cattle could already be put out
to grass.</p>

<p>When the Queen rowed between the rocks of
East Gothland into the Baltic, she heard the
cuckoo's song, although it was so early in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
year that one could scarcely expect to hear the
lark.</p>

<p>And great joy prevailed everywhere when Storr&auml;de
proceeded on her way. All the trolls who
had been obliged to flee from Norway during
King Olaf's reign because they could not bear
the sound of the church bells came on the rocks
when they saw Storr&auml;de sailing past. They
pulled up young birch-trees by the roots and
waved them to the Queen, and then they went
back to their rocky dwellings, where their wives
were sitting, full of longing and anxiety, and
said:</p>

<p>'Woman, thou shalt not be cast down any
longer. Storr&auml;de is now sailing to King Olaf.
Now we shall soon return to Norway.'</p>

<p>When the Queen sailed past Kullen, the Kulla
troll came out of his cave, and he made the black
mountain open, so that she saw the gold and
silver veins which twisted through it, and it made
the Queen happy to see his riches.</p>

<p>When Storr&auml;de went past the Holland rivers,
the Nixie came down from his waterfall, swam
right out to the mouth of the river, and played
upon his harp, so that the ship danced upon the
waves.</p>

<p>When she sailed past the Nidinge rocks, the
mermen lay there and blew upon their seashell
horns, and made the water splash in frothy
pillars. And when the wind was against them,
the most loathsome trolls came out of the deep
to help Storr&auml;de's ship over the waves. Some
lay at the stern and pushed, others took ropes of
seaweed in their mouth and harnessed themselves
before the ship like horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>The wild heathen, whom King Olaf would not
allow to remain in the country on account of
their great wickedness, came rowing towards the
Queen's ship, with sails furled, and with their
pole-axes raised as if for attack. But when they
recognised the Queen, they allowed her to pass
unhurt, and shouted after her:</p>

<p>'We empty a beaker to thy wedding, Storr&auml;de.'</p>

<p>All the heathen who lived along the coast laid
firewood upon their stone altars, and sacrificed
both sheep and goats to the old gods, in order
that they should aid Storr&auml;de in her expedition
to the Norwegian King.</p>

<p>When the Queen sailed up the northern river,
a mermaid swam alongside the ship, stretched
her white arm out of the water, and gave her a
large clear pearl.</p>

<p>'Wear this, Storr&auml;de,' she said; 'then King
Olaf will be so bewitched by thy beauty that he
will never be able to forget thee.'</p>

<p>When the Queen had sailed a short distance
up the river, she heard such a roar and such a
rushing noise that she expected to find a waterfall.
The further she proceeded, the louder grew
the noise. But when she rowed past the Golden
Isle, and passed into a broad bay, she saw at
the riverside the great Kungah&auml;lla.</p>

<p>The town was so large, that as far as she could
see up the river there was house after house, all
imposing and well timbered, with many outhouses.
Narrow lanes between the gray wooden
walls led down to the river; there were large
courtyards before the dwelling-houses, well-laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
pathways went from each house down to its
boathouse and landing-stage.</p>

<p>Storr&auml;de commanded her men to row quite
slowly. She herself stood on the poop of the
ship and looked towards the shore.</p>

<p>'Never before have I seen the like of this,' she
said.</p>

<p>She now understood that the roar she had
heard was nothing but the noise of the work
which went on at Kungah&auml;lla in the spring, when
the ships were being made ready for their long
cruises. She heard the smiths hammering with
huge sledge-hammers, the baker's shovel clattered
in the ovens; beams were hoisted on to
heavy lighters with much crashing noise; young
men planed oars and stripped the bark from the
trees which were to be used for masts.</p>

<p>She saw green courtyards, where handmaidens
were twining ropes for the seafaring men, and
where old men sat mending the gray wadmal
sails. She saw the boat-builders tarring the new
boats. Enormous nails were driven into strong
oaken planks. The hulls of the ships were
hauled out of the boathouses to be tightened;
old ships were done up with freshly-painted
dragon-heads; goods were stowed away; people
took a hurried leave of each other; heavily-filled
ships' chests were carried on board. Ships that
were ready to sail left the shore. Storr&auml;de saw
that the vessels rowing up the river were heavily
laden with herrings and salt, but those making
for the open sea were laden high up the masts
with costly oak timber, hides, and skins.</p>

<p>When the Queen saw all this she laughed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
joy. She thought that she would willingly marry
King Olaf in order to rule over such a city.
Storr&auml;de rowed up to the King's Landing-Stage.
There King Olaf stood ready to receive her, and
when she advanced to meet him he thought that
she was the fairest woman he had ever seen.</p>

<p>They then proceeded to the King's Hall, and
there was great harmony and friendship between
them. When they went to table Storr&auml;de
laughed and talked the whole time the Bishop
was saying grace, and the King laughed and
talked also, because he saw that it pleased Storr&auml;de.
When the meal was finished, and they all
folded their hands to listen to the Bishop's
prayer, Storr&auml;de began to tell the King about
her riches. She continued doing this as long as
the prayer lasted, and the King listened to Storr&auml;de,
and not to the Bishop.</p>

<p>The King placed Storr&auml;de in the seat of
honour, whilst he sat at her feet; and Storr&auml;de
told him how she had caused two minor kings
to be burnt to death for having had the presumption
to woo her. The King was glad at
hearing this, and thought that all minor kings
who had the audacity to woo a woman like Storr&auml;de
should share the same fate.</p>

<p>When the bells rang for Evensong, the King
rose to go to the Marie Church to pray, as was
his wont. But then Storr&auml;de called for her bard,
and he sang the lay of Brynhild Budles-dotter,
who caused Sigurd Fofnersbane to be slain; and
King Olaf did not go to church, but instead sat
and looked into Storr&auml;de's radiant eyes, under the
thick, black, arched eyebrows; and he under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>stood
that Storr&auml;de was Brynhild, and that she
would kill him if ever he forsook her. He also
thought that she was no doubt a woman who
would be willing to burn on the pile with him.
And whilst the priests were saying Mass and
praying in the Marie Church at Kungah&auml;lla,
King Olaf sat thinking that he would ride to
Valhalla with Sigrid Storr&auml;de before him on the
horse.</p>

<p>That night the ferryman who conveyed people
over the G&ouml;ta River was busier than he had ever
been before. Time after time he was called to
the other side, but when he crossed over there
was never anybody to be seen. But all the same
he heard steps around him, and the boat was
so full that it was nearly sinking. He rowed the
whole night backwards and forwards, and did
not know what it could all mean. But in the
morning the whole shore was full of small footprints,
and in the footprints the ferryman found
small withered leaves, which on closer examination
proved to be pure gold, and he understood
they were the Brownies and Dwarfs who had
fled from Norway when it became a Christian
country, and who had now come back again.
And the giant who lived in the Fortin mountain
right to the east of Kungah&auml;lla threw one big
stone after the other at the Marie Church the
whole night through; and had not the giant
been so strong that all the stones went too far
and fell down at Hisingen, on the other side of
the river, a great disaster would assuredly have
happened.</p>

<p>Every morning King Olaf was in the habit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of going to Mass, but the day Storr&auml;de was at
Kungah&auml;lla he thought he had not the time.
As soon as he arose, he at once wanted to go
down to the harbour, where her ship lay, in order
to ask her if she would drink the wedding-cup
with him before eventide.</p>

<p>The Bishop had caused the bells to be rung
the whole morning, and when the King left the
King's Hall, and went across the Market Place,
the church doors were thrown open, and beautiful
singing was heard from within. But the King
went on as if he had not heard anything. The
Bishop ordered the bells to be stopped, the
singing ceased, and the candles were extinguished.</p>

<p>It all happened so suddenly that the King
involuntarily stopped and looked towards the
church, and it seemed to him that the church
was more insignificant than he had ever before
thought. It was smaller than the houses in the
town; the peat roof hung heavily over its low
walls without windows; the door was low, with
a small projecting roof covered with fir-bark.</p>

<p>Whilst the King stood thinking, a slender
young woman came out of the dark church door.
She wore a red robe and a blue mantle, and
she bore in her arms a child with fair locks. Her
dress was poor, and yet it seemed to the King
that he had never before seen a more noble-looking
woman. She was tall, dignified, and fair of
face.</p>

<p>The King saw with emotion that the young
woman pressed the child close to her, and carried
it with such care, that one could see it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the most precious thing she possessed in the
world.</p>

<p>As the woman stood in the doorway she turned
her gentle face round and looked back, looked
into the poor, dark little church with great longing
in look and mien. When she again turned
round towards the Market Place there were tears
in her eyes. But just as she was about to step
over the threshold into the Market Place her
courage failed her. She leant against the doorposts
and looked at the child with a troubled
glance, as if to say:</p>

<p>'Where in all the wide world shall we find a
roof over our heads?'</p>

<p>The King stood immovable, and looked at the
homeless woman. What touched him the most
was to see the child, who lay in her arms free from
sorrow, stretch out his hand with a flower towards
her, as if to win a smile from her. And
then he saw she tried to drive away the sorrow
from her face and smile at her son.</p>

<p>'Who can that woman be?' thought the King.
'It seems to me that I have seen her before.
She is undoubtedly a high-born woman who is
in trouble.'</p>

<p>However great a hurry the King was in to
go to Storr&auml;de, he could not take his eyes away
from the woman. It seemed to him that he had
seen these tender eyes and this gentle face before,
but where, he could not call to mind. The
woman still stood in the church door, as if she
could not tear herself away. Then the King
went up to her and asked:</p>

<p>'Why art thou so sorrowful?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>'I am turned out of my home,' answered the
woman, pointing to the little dark church.</p>

<p>The King thought she meant that she had
taken refuge in the church because she had no
other place to go to. He again asked:</p>

<p>'Who hath turned thee out?'</p>

<p>She looked at him with an unutterably sorrowful
glance.</p>

<p>'Dost thou not know?' she asked.</p>

<p>But then the King turned away from her. He
had no time to stand guessing riddles, he
thought. It appeared as if the woman meant
that it was he who had turned her out. He did
not understand what she could mean.</p>

<p>The King went on quickly. He went down to
the King's Landing-Stage, where Storr&auml;de's
ship was lying. At the harbour the Queen's
servants met the King. Their clothes were
braided with gold, and they wore silver helmets
on their heads.</p>

<p>Storr&auml;de stood on her ship looking towards
Kungah&auml;lla, rejoicing in its power and wealth.
She looked at the city as if she already regarded
herself as its Queen. But when the King saw
Storr&auml;de, he thought at once of the gentle
woman who, poor and sorrowful, had been
turned out of the church.</p>

<p>'What is this?' he thought. 'It seems to me
as if she were fairer than Storr&auml;de.'</p>

<p>When Storr&auml;de greeted him with smiles, he
thought of the tears that sparkled in the eyes of
the other woman. The face of the strange
woman was so clear to King Olaf that he could
not help comparing it, feature for feature, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Storr&auml;de's. And when he did that all Storr&auml;de's
beauty vanished. He saw that Storr&auml;de's eyes
were cruel and her mouth sensual. In each of
her features he saw a sin. He could still see
she was beautiful, but he no longer took pleasure
in her countenance. He began to loathe her
as if she were a beautiful poisonous snake.</p>

<p>When the Queen saw the King come a victorious
smile passed over her lips.</p>

<p>'I did not expect thee so early, King Olaf,'
she said. 'I thought thou wast at Mass.'</p>

<p>The King felt an irresistible inclination to contradict
Storr&auml;de, and do everything she did not
want.</p>

<p>'Mass has not yet begun,' he said. 'I have
come to ask thee to go with me to the house of
my God.'</p>

<p>When the King said this he saw an angry look
in Storr&auml;de's eyes, but she continued to smile.</p>

<p>'Rather come to me on my ship,' she said,
'and I will show thee the presents I have
brought for thee.'</p>

<p>She took up a sword inlaid with gold, as if to
tempt him; but the King thought all the
time that he could see the other woman at her
side, and it appeared to him that Storr&auml;de stood
amongst her treasures like a foul dragon.</p>

<p>'Answer me first,' said the King, 'if thou wilt
go with me to church.'</p>

<p>'What have I to do in thy church?' she asked
mockingly.</p>

<p>Then she saw that the King's brow darkened,
and she perceived that he was not of the same
mind as the day before. She immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
changed her manner, and became gentle and
submissive.</p>

<p>'Go thou to church as much as thou likest,
even if I do not go. There shall be no discord
between us on that account.'</p>

<p>The Queen came down from the ship and went
up to the King. She held in her hand a sword
and a mantle trimmed with fur which she would
give him. But in the same moment the King
happened to look towards the harbour. At some
distance he saw the other woman; her head
was bowed, and she walked with weary steps,
but she still bore the child in her arms.</p>

<p>'What art thou looking so eagerly after, King
Olaf?' Storr&auml;de asked.</p>

<p>Then the other woman turned round and
looked at the King, and as she looked at him
it appeared to him as if a ring of golden light
surrounded her head and that of the child, more
beautiful than the crown of any King or Queen.
Then she immediately turned round and walked
again towards the town, and he saw her no more.</p>

<p>'What art thou looking so eagerly after?'
again asked Storr&auml;de.</p>

<p>But when King Olaf now turned to the Queen
she appeared to him old and ugly, and full of
the world's sin and wickedness, and he was terrified
at the thought that he might have fallen
into her snares.</p>

<p>He had taken off his glove to give her his
hand; but he now took the glove and threw it
in her face instead.</p>

<p>'I will not own thee, foul woman and heathen
dog that thou art!' he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Storr&auml;de drew backwards. But she soon
regained the command over herself, and answered:</p>

<p>'That blow may prove thy destruction, King
Olaf Trygveson.'</p>

<p>And she was white as H&eacute;l when she turned
away from him and went on board her ship.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next night King Olaf had a strange dream.
What he saw in his dream was not the earth, but
the bottom of the sea. It was a grayish-green
field, over which there were many fathoms of
water. He saw fish swimming after their prey;
he saw ships gliding past on the surface of the
water, like dark clouds; and he saw the disc of
the sun, dull as a pale moon.</p>

<p>Then he saw the woman he had seen at the
church-door wandering along the bottom of the
sea. She had the same stooping gait and the
same worn garments as when he first saw her,
and her face was still sorrowful. But as she
wandered along the bottom of the sea the water
divided before her. He saw that it rose into
pillars, as if in deep reverence, forming itself into
arches, so that she walked in the most glorious
temple.</p>

<p>Suddenly the King saw that the water which
surrounded the woman began to change colour.
The pillars and the arches first became pale pink;
but they soon assumed a darker colour. The
whole sea around was also red, as if it had been
changed into blood.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the sea, where the woman
walked, the King saw broken swords and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
arrows, and bows and spears in pieces. At first
there were not many, but the longer she
walked in the red water the more closely they
were heaped together.</p>

<p>The King saw with emotion that the woman
went to one side in order not to tread upon a
dead man who lay stretched upon the bed of
green seaweed. The man, who had a deep cut
in his head, wore a coat of mail, and had a sword
in his hand. It seemed to the King that the
woman closed her eyes so as not to see the dead
man. She moved towards a fixed goal without
hesitation or doubt. But he who dreamt could
not turn his eyes away.</p>

<p>He saw the bottom of the sea covered with
wreckage. He saw heavy anchors, thick ropes
twined about like snakes, ships with their sides
riven asunder; golden dragon-heads from the
bows of ships stared at him with red, threatening
eyes.</p>

<p>'I should like to know who has fought a battle
here and left all this as a prey to destruction,'
thought the dreamer.</p>

<p>Everywhere he saw dead men. They were
hanging on the ships' sides, or had sunk into
the green seaweed. But he did not give himself
time to look at them, for his eyes were obliged
to follow the woman, who continued to walk onwards.</p>

<p>At last the King saw her stop at the side of
a dead man. He was clothed in a red mantle,
had a bright helmet on his head, a shield on his
arm, and a naked sword in his hand.</p>

<p>The woman bent over him and whispered to
him, as if awaking someone sleeping:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>'King Olaf! King Olaf!'</p>

<p>Then he who was dreaming saw that the man
at the bottom of the sea was himself. He could
distinctly see that he was the dead man.</p>

<p>As the dead did not move, the woman knelt
by his side and whispered into his ear:</p>

<p>'Now Storr&auml;de hath sent her fleet against thee
and avenged herself. Dost thou repent what
thou hast done, King Olaf?'</p>

<p>And again she asked:</p>

<p>'Now thou sufferest the bitterness of death
because thou hast chosen me instead of Storr&auml;de.
Dost thou repent? dost thou repent?'</p>

<p>Then at last the dead opened his eyes, and the
woman helped him to rise. He leant upon her
shoulder, and she walked slowly away with him.</p>

<p>Again King Olaf saw her wander and wander,
through night and day, over sea and land. At
last it seemed to him that they had gone further
than the clouds and higher than the stars. Now
they entered a garden, where the earth shone
as light and the flowers were clear as dewdrops.</p>

<p>The King saw that when the woman entered
the garden she raised her head, and her step grew
lighter. When they had gone a little further into
the garden her garments began to shine. He
saw that they became, as of themselves, bordered
with golden braid, and coloured with the
hues of the rainbow. He saw also that a halo
surrounded her head that cast a light over her
countenance.</p>

<p>But the slain man who leant upon her shoulder
raised his head, and asked:</p>

<p>'Who art thou?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>'Dost thou not know, King Olaf?' she answered;
and an infinite majesty and glory
encompassed her.</p>

<p>But in the dream King Olaf was filled with
a great joy because he had chosen to serve the
gentle Queen of Heaven. It was a joy so great
that he had never before felt the like of it, and it
was so strong that it awoke him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When King Olaf awoke his face was bathed
in tears, and he lay with his hands folded in
prayer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="Astrid" id="Astrid"><span class="smcap">Astrid</span></a></h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>In the midst of the low buildings forming the
old Castle of the Kings at Upsala towered the
Ladies' Bower. It was built on poles, like
a dovecote. The staircase leading up to it was
as steep as a ladder, and one entered it by a very
low door. The walls inside were covered with
runes, signifying love and longing; the sills of
the small loopholes were worn by the maidens
leaning on their elbows and looking down into
the courtyard.</p>

<p>Old Hjalte, the bard, had been a guest at the
King's Castle for some time, and he went up
every day to the Ladies' Bower to see Princess
Ingegerd, and talk with her about Olaf Haraldsson,
the King of Norway, and every time Hjalte
came Ingegerd's bondwoman Astrid sat and listened
to his words with as much pleasure as the
Princess. And whilst Hjalte talked, both the
maidens listened so eagerly that they let their
hands fall in their laps and their work rest.</p>

<p>Anyone seeing them would not think much
spinning or weaving could be done in the
Ladies' Bower. No one would have thought
that they gathered all Hjalte's words as if they
were silken threads, and that each of his listeners
made from them her own picture of King Olaf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
No one could know that in their thoughts they
wove the Bard's words each into her own radiant
picture.</p>

<p>But so it was. And the Princess's picture was
so beautiful that every time she saw it before
her she felt as if she must fall on her knees and
worship it. For she saw the King sitting on
his throne, crowned and great; she saw a red,
gold-embroidered mantle hanging from his
shoulders to his feet. She saw no sword in his
hand, but holy writings; and she also saw that
his throne was supported by a chained troll.
His face shone for her, white like wax, surrounded
by long, soft locks, and his eyes beamed
with piety and peace. Oh, she became nearly
afraid when she saw the almost superhuman
strength that shone from that pale face. She
understood that King Olaf was not only a King,
she saw that he was a saint, and the equal of the
angels.</p>

<p>But quite different was the picture which
Astrid had made of the King. The fair-haired
bondwoman, who had experienced both hunger
and cold and suffered much hardship, but who
all the same was the one who filled the Ladies'
Bower with merriment and laughter, had in her
mind an entirely different picture of the King.
She could not help that every time she heard
him spoken about she saw before her the wood-cutter's
son who at eventide came out of the
wood with the axe over his shoulder.</p>

<p>'I can see thee&mdash;I can see thee so well,'
Astrid said to the picture, as if it were a living
being. 'Tall thou art not, but broad of shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and light and agile, and because thou hast
walked about in the dark forest the whole long
summer day thou takest the last few steps in
one spring, and laughest when thou reachest
the road. Then thy white teeth shine, and thy
hair flies about, and that I love to see. I can
see thee; thou hast a fair, ruddy face and freckles
on thy nose, and thou hast blue eyes, which become
dark and stern in the deep forest; but
when thou comest so far that thou seest the
valley and thy home, they become light and
gentle. As soon as thou seest thine own hut
down in the valley, thou raisest thy cap for a
greeting, and then I see thy forehead. Is not
that forehead befitting a King? Should not that
broad forehead be able to wear both crown and
helmet?'</p>

<p>But however different these two pictures were,
one thing is certain: just as much as the Princess
loved the holy picture she had conjured
forth, so did the poor bondwoman love the bold
swain whom she saw coming from the depths of
the forest to meet her.</p>

<p>And had Hjalte the Bard been able to see
these pictures he would have assuredly praised
them both. He would assuredly have said that
they both were like the King. For that is King
Olaf's good fortune, he would have been sure to
say, that he is a fresh and merry swain at the
same time that he is God's holy warrior. For
old Hjalte loved King Olaf, and although he
had wandered from court to court he had never
been able to find his equal.</p>

<p>'Where can I find anyone to make me forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Olaf Haraldsson?' he was wont to say. 'Where
shall I find a greater hero?'</p>

<p>Hjalte the Bard was a rough old man and
severe of countenance. Old as he was, his hair
was still black, he was dark of complexion, and
his eyes were keen, and his song had always
tallied with his appearance. His tongue never
uttered other words than those of strife; he had
never made other lays than songs of war.</p>

<p>Old Hjalte's heart had hitherto been like the
stony waste outside the wood-cutter's hut; it had
been like a rocky plain, where only poor ferns
and dry mugworts could grow. But now
Hjalte's roving life had brought him to the
Court at Upsala, and he had seen the Princess
Ingegerd. He had seen that she was the noblest
of all the women he had met in his life&mdash;in truth,
the Princess was just as much fairer than all
other women as King Olaf was greater than all
other men.</p>

<p>Then the thought suddenly arose within
Hjalte that he would try to awaken love between
the Swedish Princess and the Norwegian
King. He asked himself why she, who was the
best amongst women, should not be able to love
King Olaf, the most glorious amongst men?
And after that thought had taken root in Hjalte's
heart he gave up making his stern war-songs.
He gave up trying to win praise and honour
from the rough warriors at the Court of Upsala,
and sat for many hours with the women in the
Ladies' Bower, and one would never have
thought that it was Hjalte who spoke. One
would never have believed that he possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
such soft and fair and gentle words which he
now used in speaking about King Olaf.</p>

<p>No one would have known Hjalte again; he
was entirely transformed ever since the thought
of the marriage had arisen within him. When
the beautiful thought took root in Hjalte's soul,
it was as if a blushing rose, with soft and fragrant
petals, had sprung up in the midst of a
wilderness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day Hjalte sat with the Princess in the
Ladies' Bower. All the maidens were absent
except Astrid. Hjalte thought that now he had
spoken long enough about Olaf Haraldsson.
He had said all the fair words he could about
him, but had it been of any avail? What did
the Princess think of the King? Then he began
to lay snares for the Princess to find out what
she thought of King Olaf.</p>

<p>'I can see from a look or a blush,' he thought.</p>

<p>But the Princess was a high-born lady; she
knew how to conceal her thoughts. She neither
blushed nor smiled, neither did her eyes betray
her. She would not let Hjalte divine what she
thought.</p>

<p>When the Bard looked into her noble face he
was ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>'She is too good for anyone to take her by
stealth,' he said; 'one must meet her in open
warfare.' So Hjalte said straight out: 'Daughter
of a King, if Olaf Haraldsson asked thee in
marriage of thy father, what wouldst thou answer?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the young Princess's face lit up, as does
the face of a man when he reaches the mountain-top
and discovers the ocean. Without hesitation
she replied at once:</p>

<p>'If he be such a King and such a Christian as
thou sayest, Hjalte, then I consider it would be
a great happiness.'</p>

<p>But scarcely had she said this before the light
faded from her eyes. It was as if a cloud rose
between her and the beautiful far-off vision.</p>

<p>'Oh, Hjalte,' she said, 'thou forgettest one
thing. King Olaf is our enemy. It is war and
not wooing we may expect from him.'</p>

<p>'Do not let that trouble thee,' said Hjalte.
'If thou only wilt, all is well. I know King
Olaf's mind in this matter.'</p>

<p>The Bard was so glad that he laughed when
he said this; but the Princess grew more and
more sorrowful.</p>

<p>'No,' she said, 'neither upon me nor King
Olaf does it depend, but upon my father, Oluf
Sk&ouml;tkonung, and you know that he hates Olaf
Haraldsson, and cannot bear that anyone should
even mention his name. Never will he let me
leave my father's house with an enemy; never
will he give his daughter to Olaf Haraldsson.'</p>

<p>When the Princess had said this, she laid aside
all her pride and began to lament her fate.</p>

<p>'Of what good is it that I have now learnt to
know Olaf Haraldsson,' she said, 'that I dream
of him every night, and long for him every day?
Would it not have been better if thou hadst
never come hither and told me about him?'</p>

<p>When the Princess had spoken these words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
her eyes filled with tears; but when Hjalte saw
her tears, he lifted his hand fervent and eager.</p>

<p>'God wills it,' he cried. 'Ye belong to one
another. Strife must exchange its red mantle
for the white robe of peace, that your happiness
may give joy unto the earth.'</p>

<p>When Hjalte had said this, the Princess bowed
her head before God's holy name, and when she
raised it, it was with a newly awakened hope.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When old Hjalte stepped through the low door
of the Ladies' Bower, and went down the narrow
open corridor, Astrid followed him.</p>

<p>'Hjalte,' she cried, 'why dost thou not ask
me what I would answer if Olaf Haraldsson
asked for my hand?'</p>

<p>It was the first time Astrid had spoken to
Hjalte; but Hjalte only cast a hurried glance
at the fair bondwoman, whose golden hair curled
on her temples and neck, who had the broadest
bracelets and the heaviest ear-rings, whose dress
was fastened with silken cords, and whose bodice
was so embroidered with pearls that it was as
stiff as armour, and went on without answering.</p>

<p>'Why dost thou only ask Princess Ingegerd?'
continued Astrid. 'Why dost thou not also ask
me? Dost thou not know that I, too, am the
Svea-King's daughter? Dost thou not know,'
she continued, when Hjalte did not answer, 'that
although my mother was a bondwoman, she was
the bride of the King's youth? Dost thou not
know that whilst she lived no one dared to remind
her of her birth? Oh, Hjalte, dost thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
not know that it was only after she was dead,
when the King had taken to himself a Queen,
that everyone remembered that she was a bondwoman?
It was first after I had a stepmother
that the King began to think I was not of free
birth. But am I not a King's daughter, Hjalte,
even if my father counts me for so little, that he
has allowed me to fall into bondage? Am I not
a King's daughter, even if my stepmother allowed
me to go in rags, whilst my sister went
in cloth of gold? Am I not a King's daughter,
even if my stepmother has allowed me to tend the
geese and taste the whip of the slave? And if I
am a King's daughter, why dost thou not ask
me whether I will wed Olaf Haraldsson? See, I
have golden hair that shines round my head like
the sun. See, I have sparkling eyes; I have
roses in my cheeks. Why should not King Olaf
woo me?'</p>

<p>She followed Hjalte across the courtyard all
the way to the King's Hall; but Hjalte took no
more heed of her words than a warrior clad in
armour heeds a boy throwing stones. He took
no more notice of her words than if she had
been a chattering magpie in the top of a tree.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No one must think that Hjalte contented himself
with having won Ingegerd for his King.
The next day the old Icelander summoned up his
courage and spoke to Oluf Sk&ouml;tkonung about
Olaf Haraldsson. But he hardly had time to
say a word; the King interrupted him as soon as
he mentioned the name of his foe. Hjalte saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
that the Princess was right. He thought he had
never before seen such bitter hatred.</p>

<p>'But that marriage will take place all the
same,' said Hjalte. 'It is the will of God&mdash;the
will of God.'</p>

<p>And it really seemed as if Hjalte were right.
Two or three days later a messenger came from
King Olaf of Norway to make peace with the
Swedes. Hjalte sought the messenger, and told
him that peace between the two countries could
be most firmly established by a marriage taking
place between Princess Ingegerd and Olaf Haraldsson.</p>

<p>The King's messenger hardly thought that old
Hjalte was the man to incline a young maiden's
heart to a stranger; but he thought, all the same,
that the plan was a good one; and he promised
Hjalte that he would lay the proposal of the
marriage before King Oluf Sk&ouml;tkonung at the
great Winter Ting.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards Hjalte left Upsala.
He went from farm to farm on the great plain;
he went far into the forests; he went even to the
borders of the sea. He never met either man or
woman without speaking to them about Olaf
Haraldsson and Princess Ingegerd. 'Hast thou
ever heard of a greater man or of a fairer
woman?' he said. 'It is assuredly the will of
God that they shall wander through life together.'</p>

<p>Hjalte came upon old Vikings, who wintered
at the seashore, and who had formerly carried
off women from every coast. He talked to them
about the beautiful Princess until they sprang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
up and promised him, with their hand on the
hilt of their sword, that they would do what they
could to help her to happiness.</p>

<p>Hjalte went to stubborn old peasants who
had never listened to the prayers of their own
daughters, but had given them in marriage as
shrewdness, family honour, and advantage required,
and he spoke to them so wisely about the
peace between the two countries and the marriage
that they swore they would rather deprive
the King of his kingdom than that this marriage
should not come to pass.</p>

<p>But to the young women Hjalte spoke so
many good words about Olaf Haraldsson that
they vowed they would never look with kindly
eyes at the swain who did not stand by the Norwegian
King's messenger at the Ting and help
to break down the King's opposition.</p>

<p>Thus Hjalte went about talking to people until
the Winter Ting should assemble, and all the
people, along snow-covered roads, proceeded to
the great Ting Hills at Upsala.</p>

<p>When the Ting was opened, the eagerness of
the people was so great that it seemed as if the
stars would fall down from the sky were this
marriage not decided upon. And although the
King twice roughly said 'No' both to the peace
and to the wooing, it was of no avail. It was
of no avail that he would not hear the name of
King Olaf mentioned. The people only shouted:
'We will not have war with Norway. We will
that these two, who by all are accounted the
greatest, shall wander through life together.'</p>

<p>What could old Oluf Sk&ouml;tkonung do when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
people rose against him with threats, strong
words, and clashing of shields? What was he to
do when he saw nothing but swords lifted and
angry men before him? Was he not compelled
to promise his daughter away if he would keep his
life and his crown? Must he not swear to send
the Princess to Kungah&auml;lla next summer to meet
King Olaf there?</p>

<p>In this way the whole people helped to further
Ingegerd's love. But no one helped Astrid to the
attainment of her happiness; no one asked her
about her love. And yet it lived&mdash;it lived like the
child of the poor fisherman's widow, in want and
need; but all the same it grew, happily and hopefully.
It grew and thrived, for in Astrid's soul
there were, as at the sea, fresh air and light and
breezy waves.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>In the rich city of Kungah&auml;lla, far away at the
border, was the old castle of the kings. It was
surrounded by green ramparts. Huge stones
stood as sentinels outside the gates, and in the
courtyard grew an oak large enough to shelter
under its branches all the King's henchmen.</p>

<p>The whole space inside the ramparts was covered
with long, low wooden houses. They were
so old that grass grew on the ridges of the roofs.
The beams in the walls were made from the thickest
trees of the forest, silver-white with age.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the summer Olaf Haraldsson
came to Kungah&auml;lla, and he gathered together
in the castle everything necessary for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
celebration of his marriage. For several weeks
peasants came crowding up the long street, bringing
gifts: butter in tubs, cheese in sacks, hops
and salt, roots and flour.</p>

<p>After the gifts had been brought to the castle,
there was a continual procession of wedding
guests through the street. There were great men
and women on side-saddles, with a numerous
retinue of servants and serfs. Then came hosts
of players and singers, and the reciters of the
Sagas. Merchants came all the way from Venderland
and Gardarike, to tempt the King with
bridal gifts.</p>

<p>When these processions for two whole weeks
had filled the town with noise and bustle they
only awaited the last procession, the bride's.</p>

<p>But the bridal procession was long in coming.
Every day they expected that she would come
ashore at the King's Landing-Stage, and from
there, headed by drum and fife, and followed by
merry swains and serious priests, proceed up the
street to the King's Castle. But the bride's procession
came not.</p>

<p>When the bride was so long in coming, everybody
looked at King Olaf to see if he were uneasy.
But the King always showed an undisturbed face.</p>

<p>'If it be the will of God,' the King said, 'that I
shall possess this fair woman, she will assuredly
come.'</p>

<p>And the King waited, whilst the grass fell for
the scythe, and the cornflowers blossomed in the
rye. The King still waited when the flax was
pulled up, and the hops ripened on the poles. He
was still waiting, when the bramble blackened on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the mountain-side, and the <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Possibly hip">nip</span> reddened on the
naked branch of the <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Possibly rosebush">hawthorn</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hjalte had spent the whole summer at Kungah&auml;lla
waiting for the marriage. No one awaited
the arrival of the Princess more eagerly than he
did. He assuredly awaited her with greater longing
and anxiety than even King Olaf himself.</p>

<p>Hjalte no longer felt at his ease with the warriors
in the King's Hall. But lower down the
river there was a landing-stage where the women
of Kungah&auml;lla were wont to assemble to see the
last of their husbands and sons, when they sailed
for distant lands. Here they were also in the
habit of gathering during the summer, to watch
for the vessels coming up the river, and to weep
over those who had departed. To that bridge
Hjalte wended his way every day. He liked best
to be amongst those who longed and sorrowed.</p>

<p>Never had any of the women who sat waiting
at Weeping Bridge gazed down the river with
more anxious look than did Hjalte the Bard. No
one looked more eagerly at every approaching
sail. Sometimes Hjalte stole away to the Marie
Church. He never prayed for anything for himself.
He only came to remind the Saints about
this marriage, which must come to pass, which
God Himself had willed.</p>

<p>Most of all Hjalte liked to speak with King Olaf
Haraldsson alone. It was his greatest happiness
to sit and tell him of every word that had fallen
from the lips of the King's daughter. He described
her every feature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>'King Olaf,' he said to him, 'pray to God
that she may come to thee. Every day I see
thee warring against ancient heathendom which
hides like an owl in the darkness of the forest,
and in the mountain-clefts. But the falcon, King
Olaf, will never be able to overcome the owl.
Only a dove can do that, only a dove.'</p>

<p>The Bard asked the King whether it was not
his desire to vanquish all his enemies. Was it
not his intention to be alone master in the land?
But in that he would never succeed. He would
never succeed until he had won the crown which
Hjalte had chosen for him, a crown so resplendent
with brightness and glory that everyone must
bow before him who owned it.</p>

<p>And last of all he asked the King if he were
desirous of gaining the mastery over himself.
But he would never succeed in overcoming the
wilfulness of his own heart if he did not win a
shield which Hjalte had seen in the Ladies'
Bower at the King's Castle at Upsala. It was
a shield from which shone the purity of heaven.
It was a shield which protected from all sin and
the lusts of the flesh.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But harvest came and they were still waiting
for the Princess. One after the other the great
men who had come to Kungah&auml;lla for the marriage
festivities were obliged to depart. The last
to take his leave was old Hjalte the Bard. It
was with a heavy heart he set sail, but he was
obliged to return to his home in distant Iceland
before Christmas came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Hjalte had not gone further than the rocky
islands outside the mouth of the northern river
before he met a galley. He immediately ordered
his men to stop rowing. At the first glance he
recognised the dragon-headed ship belonging to
Princess Ingegerd. Without hesitation Hjalte
told his men to row him to the galley. He gave
up his place at the rudder to another, and placed
himself with joyous face at the prow of the boat.</p>

<p>'It will make me happy to behold the fair
maiden once more,' the Bard said. 'It gladdens
my heart that her gentle face will be the last I
shall see before sailing for Iceland.'</p>

<p>All the wrinkles had disappeared from Hjalte's
face when he went on board the dragon-ship.
He greeted the brave lads who plied the oars
as friendlily as if they were his comrades, and
he handed a golden ring to the maiden, who,
with much deference, conducted him to the
women's tent in the stern of the ship. Hjalte's
hand trembled when he lifted the hangings that
covered the entrance to the tent. He thought
this was the most beautiful moment of his life.</p>

<p>'Never have I fought for a greater cause,' he
said. 'Never have I longed so eagerly for anything
as this marriage.'</p>

<p>But when Hjalte entered the tent, he drew
back a step in great consternation. His face expressed
the utmost confusion. He saw a tall,
beautiful woman. She advanced to meet him with
outstretched hand. But the woman was not Ingegerd.</p>

<p>Hjalte's eyes looked searchingly round the
narrow tent to find the Princess. He certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
saw that the woman who stood before him was
a King's daughter. Only the daughter of a King
could look at him with such a proud glance, and
greet him with such dignity. And she wore the
band of royalty on her forehead, and was attired
like a Queen. But why was she not Ingegerd?
Hjalte angrily asked the strange woman:</p>

<p>'Who art thou?'</p>

<p>'Dost thou not know me, Hjalte? I am the
King's daughter, to whom thou hast spoken
about Olaf Haraldsson.'</p>

<p>'I have spoken with a King's daughter about
Olaf Haraldsson, but her name was Ingegerd.'</p>

<p>'Ingegerd is also my name.'</p>

<p>'Thy name can be what thou likest, but thou
art not the Princess. What is the meaning of
all this? Will the Svea-King deceive King
Olaf?'</p>

<p>'He will not by any means deceive him. He
sends him his daughter as he has promised.'</p>

<p>Hjalte was not far from drawing his sword
to slay the strange woman. He had his hand
already on the hilt, but he bethought himself it
was not befitting a warrior to take the life of a
woman. But he would not waste more words
over this impostor. He turned round to go.</p>

<p>The stranger with gentle voice called him
back.</p>

<p>'Where art thou going, Hjalte? Dost thou
intend to go to Kungah&auml;lla to report this to Olaf
Haraldsson?'</p>

<p>'That is my intention,' answered Hjalte, without
looking at her.</p>

<p>'Why, then, dost thou leave me, Hjalte? Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
dost thou not remain with me? I, too, am going
to Kungah&auml;lla.'</p>

<p>Hjalte now turned round and looked at her.</p>

<p>'Hast thou, then, no pity for an old man?'
he said. 'I tell thee that my whole mind is set
upon this marriage. Let me hear the full
measure of my misfortune. Is Princess Ingegerd
not coming?'</p>

<p>Then the Princess gave over fooling Hjalte.</p>

<p>'Come into my tent and sit down,' she said,
'and I will tell thee all that thou wouldest know.
I see it is of no use to hide the truth from
thee.'</p>

<p>Then she began to tell him everything:</p>

<p>'The summer was already drawing to a close.
The blackcock's lively young ones had already
strong feathers in their cloven tails and firmness
in their rounded wings; they had already begun
to flutter about amongst the close branches of
the pine-forest with quick, noisy strokes.</p>

<p>'It happened one morning that the Svea-King
came riding across the plain; he was returning
from a successful chase. There hung from the
pommel of his saddle a shining blue-black blackcock,
a tough old fellow, with red eyebrows,
as well as four of his half-grown young ones,
which on account of their youth were still garbed
in many-coloured hues. And the King was very
proud; he thought it was not every man's luck
to make such a bag with falcon and hawk in
one morning.</p>

<p>'But that morning Princess Ingegerd and her
maidens stood at the gates of the castle waiting
for the King. And amongst the maidens was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
one, Astrid by name; she was the daughter of
the Svea-King just as much as Ingegerd,
although her mother was not a free woman, and
she was therefore treated as a bondmaiden. And
this young maiden stood and showed her sister
how the swallows gathered in the fields and chose
the leaders for their long journey. She reminded
her that the summer was soon over&mdash;the summer
that should have witnessed the marriage of Ingegerd&mdash;and
urged her to ask the King why she
might not set out on her journey to King Olaf;
for Astrid wished to accompany her sister on
the journey. She thought that if she could but
once see Olaf Haraldsson, she would have pleasure
from it all her life.</p>

<p>'But when the Svea-King saw the Princess, he
rode up to her.</p>

<p>'"Look, Ingegerd," he said, "here are five
blackcocks hanging from my saddle. In one
morning I have killed five blackcocks. Who
dost thou think can boast of better luck? Have
you ever heard of a King making a better capture?"</p>

<p>'But then the Princess was angered that he
who barred the way for her happiness should
come so proudly and praise his own good luck.
And to make an end of the uncertainty that had
tormented her for so many weeks, she replied:</p>

<p>'"Thou, father, hast with great honour killed
five blackcocks, but I know of a King who in
one morning captured five other Kings, and that
was Olaf Haraldsson, the hero whom thou hast
selected to be my husband."</p>

<p>'Then the Svea-King sprang off his horse in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
great fury, and advanced towards the Princess
with clenched hands.</p>

<p>'"What troll hath bewitched thee?" he asked.
"What herb hath poisoned thee? How hath thy
mind been turned to this man?"</p>

<p>'Ingegerd did not answer; she drew back,
frightened. Then the King became quieter.</p>

<p>'"Fair daughter," he said to her, "dost thou
not know how dear thou art to me? How should
I, then, give thee to one whom I cannot endure?
I should like my best wishes to go with thee on
thy journey. I should like to sit as guest in
thy hall. I tell thee thou must turn thy mind
to the Kings of other lands, for Norway's King
shall never own thee."</p>

<p>'At these words the Princess became so confused
that she could find no other words than
these with which to answer the King:</p>

<p>'"I did not ask thee; it was the will of the
people."</p>

<p>'The King then asked her if she thought that
the Svea-King was a slave, who could not dispose
of his own offspring, or if there were a
master over him who had the right to give away
his daughters.</p>

<p>'"Will the Svea-King be content to hear
himself called a breaker of oaths?" asked the
Princess.</p>

<p>'Then the Svea-King laughed aloud.</p>

<p>'"Do not let that trouble thee. No one shall
call me that. Why dost thou question about
this, thou who art a woman? There are still
men in my Council; they will find a way out
of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>'Then the King turned towards his henchmen
who had been with him to the chase.</p>

<p>'"My will is bound by this promise," he said
to them. "How shall I be released from it?"</p>

<p>'But none of the King's men answered a word;
no one knew how to counsel him.</p>

<p>'Then Oluf Sk&ouml;tkonung became very wrath;
he became like a madman.</p>

<p>'"So much for your wisdom," he shouted
again and again to his men. "I will be free.
Why do people laud your wisdom?"</p>

<p>'Whilst the King raged and shouted, and no
one knew how to answer him, the maiden Astrid
stepped forward from amongst the other women
and made a proposal.</p>

<p>'Hjalte must really believe her when she told
him that it was only because she found it so
amusing that she could not help saying it, and
not in the least because she thought it could
really be done.</p>

<p>'"Why dost thou not send me?" she had said.
"I am also thy daughter. Why dost thou not
send me to the Norwegian King?"</p>

<p>'But when Ingegerd heard Astrid say these
words, she grew pale.</p>

<p>'"Be silent, and go thy way!" she said
angrily. "Go thy way, thou tattler, thou deceitful,
wicked thing, to propose such a shameful
thing to my father!"</p>

<p>'But the King would not allow Astrid to go.
On the contrary! on the contrary! He stretched
out his arms and drew her to his breast. He
both laughed and cried, and was as wild with joy
as a child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>'"Oh," he shouted, "what an idea! What
a heathenish trick! Let us call Astrid Ingegerd,
and entrap the King of Norway into marrying
her. And afterwards when the rumour gets
abroad that she is born of a bondwoman, many
will rejoice in their hearts, and Olaf Haraldsson
will be held in scorn and derision."</p>

<p>'But then Ingegerd went up to the King, and
prayed:</p>

<p>"Oh, father, father! do not do this thing.
King Olaf is dear at heart to me. Surely thou
wilt not grieve me by thus deceiving him."</p>

<p>'And she added that she would patiently do
the bidding of her royal father, and give up all
thought of marriage with Olaf Haraldsson, if
he would only promise not to do him this injury.</p>

<p>'But the Svea-King would not listen to her
prayers. He turned to Astrid and caressed her,
just as if she were as beautiful as revenge itself.</p>

<p>'"Thou shalt go! thou shalt go soon&mdash;to-morrow!"
he said. "All thy dowry, thy clothes,
my dear daughter, and thy retinue, can all be
collected in great haste. The Norwegian King
will not think of such things; he is too taken up
with joy at the thought of possessing the high-born
daughter of the Svea-King."</p>

<p>'Then Ingegerd understood that she could
hope for no mercy. And she went up to her
sister, put her arm round her neck, and conducted
her to the hall. Here she placed her in
her own seat of honour, whilst she herself sat
down on a low stool at her feet. And she said
to Astrid that from henceforth she must sit there,
in order to accustom herself to the place she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
should take as Queen. For Ingegerd did not
wish that King Olaf should have any occasion to
be ashamed of his Queen.</p>

<p>'Then the Princess sent her maidens to the
wardrobes and the pantries to fetch the dowry
she had chosen for herself. And she gave everything
to her sister, so that Astrid should not come
to Norway's King as a poor bondwoman. She
had also settled which of the serfs and maidens
should accompany Astrid, and at last she made
her a present of her own splendid galley.</p>

<p>'"Thou shalt certainly have my galley," she
said. "Thou knowest there are many good men
at the oars. For it is my will that thou shalt come
well dowered to Norway's King, so that he may
feel honoured with his Queen."</p>

<p>'And afterwards the Princess had sat a long
time with her sister, and spoken with her about
King Olaf. But she had spoken of him as one
speaks of the Saints of God, and not of kings,
and Astrid had not understood many of her
words. But this much she did understand&mdash;that
the King's daughter wished to give Astrid all
the good thoughts that dwelt in her own heart,
in order that King Olaf might not be so disappointed
as her father wished. And then Astrid,
who was not so bad as people thought
her, forgot how often she had suffered for her
sister's sake, and she wished that she had been
able to say, "I will not go!" She had also
spoken to her sister about this wish, and they had
cried together, and for the first time felt like
sisters.</p>

<p>'But it was not Astrid's nature to allow herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
to be weighed down by sorrow and scruples. By
the time she was out at sea she had forgotten
all her sorrow and fear. She travelled as a
Princess, and was waited upon as a Princess.
For the first time since her mother's death she
was happy.'</p>

<p>When the King's beautiful daughter had told
Hjalte all this she was silent for a moment, and
looked at him. Hjalte had sat immovable whilst
she was speaking, but the King's daughter grew
pale when she saw the pain his face betrayed.</p>

<p>'Tell me what thou thinkest, Hjalte,' she exclaimed.
'Now, we are soon at Kungah&auml;lla.
How shall I fare there? Will the King slay me?
Will he brand me with red-hot irons, and send
me back again? Tell me the truth, Hjalte.'</p>

<p>But Hjalte did not answer. He sat and talked
to himself without knowing it. Astrid heard
him murmur that at Kungah&auml;lla no one knew
Ingegerd, and that he himself had but little inclination
to turn back.</p>

<p>But now Hjalte's moody face fell upon Astrid,
and he began to question her. She had wished,
had she not, that she could have said 'No' to
this journey. When she came to Kungah&auml;lla,
the choice lay before her. What did she, then,
mean to do! Would she tell King Olaf who she
was?</p>

<p>This question caused Astrid not a little
embarrassment. She was silent for a long while,
but then she began to beg Hjalte to go with her
to Kungah&auml;lla and tell the King the truth. She
told Hjalte that her maidens and the men on
board her ship had been bound to silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>'And what I shall do myself I do not know,'
she said. 'How can I know that? I have heard
all thou hast told Ingegerd about Olaf Haraldsson.'</p>

<p>When Astrid said this she saw that Hjalte was
again lost in thought. She heard him mutter to
himself that he did not think she would confess
how things were.</p>

<p>'But I must all the same tell her what awaits
her,' he said.</p>

<p>Then Hjalte rose, and spoke to her with the
utmost gravity.</p>

<p>'Let me tell thee yet another story, Astrid,
about King Olaf, which I have not told thee before:</p>

<p>'It was at the time when King Olaf was a poor
sea-king, when he only possessed a few good
ships and some faithful warriors, but none of his
forefathers' land. It was at the time when he
fought with honour on distant seas, chastised
vikings and protected merchants, and aided
Christian princes with his sword.</p>

<p>'The King had a dream that one night an angel
of God descended to his ship, set all the sails, and
steered for the north. And it seemed to the King
that they had not sailed for a longer time than it
takes the dawn to extinguish a star before they
came to a steep and rocky shore, cut up by
narrow fjords and bordered with milk-white
breakers. But when they reached the shore the
angel stretched out his hand, and spoke in his
silvery voice. It rang through the wind, which
whistled in the sails, and through the waves surging
round the keel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>'"Thou, King Olaf," were the angel's words,
"shalt possess this land for all time."</p>

<p>'And when the angel had said this the dream
was over.'</p>

<p>Hjalte now tried to explain to Astrid that like
as the dawn tempers the transition from dark
night to sunny day, so God had not willed that
King Olaf should at once understand that the
dream foretold him of superhuman honour. The
King had not understood that it was the will of
God that he from a heavenly throne should reign
forever and ever over Norway's land, that kings
should reign and kings should pass away, but
holy King Olaf should continue to rule his kingdom
for ever.</p>

<p>The King's humility did not let him see the
heavenly message in its fulness of light, and he
understood the words of the angel thus&mdash;that he
and his seed should forever rule over the land
the angel had shown him. And inasmuch as he
thought he recognised in this land the kingdom
of his forefathers, he steered his course for Norway,
and, fortune helping him, he soon became
King of that land.</p>

<p>'And thus it is still, Astrid. Although everything
indicates that in King Olaf dwells a
heavenly strength, he himself is still in doubt,
and thinks that he is only called to be an earthly
King. He does not yet stretch forth his hand
for the crown of the saints. But now the time
cannot be far distant when he must fully realize
his mission. It cannot be far distant.'</p>

<p>And old Hjalte went on speaking, whilst the
light of the seer shone in his soul and on his
brow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>'Is there any other woman but Ingegerd who
would not be rejected by Olaf Haraldsson and
driven from his side when he fully understands
the words of the angel, that he shall be Norway's
King for all time? Is there anyone who can,
then, follow him in his holy walk except Ingegerd?'</p>

<p>And again Hjalte turned to Astrid and asked
with great severity:</p>

<p>'Answer me now and tell me whether thou
wilt speak the truth to King Olaf?'</p>

<p>Astrid was now sore afraid. She answered
humbly:</p>

<p>'Why wilt thou not go with me to Kungah&auml;lla?
Then I shall be compelled to tell
everything. Canst thou not see, Hjalte, that I
do not know myself what I shall do? If it were
my intention to deceive the King, could I not
promise thee all thou wishest? All that I needed
was to persuade thee to go on thy way. But I
am weak; I only asked thee to go with me.'</p>

<p>But hardly had she said this before she saw
Hjalte's face glow with fierce wrath.</p>

<p>'Why should I help thee to escape the fate
that awaits thee?' he asked.</p>

<p>And then he said that he did not think he had
any cause to show her mercy. He hated her for
having sinned against her sister. The man that
she would steal, thief as she was, belonged to
Ingegerd. Even a hardened warrior like Hjalte
must groan with pain when he thought of how
Ingegerd had suffered. But Astrid had felt
nothing. In the midst of all that young maiden's
sorrow she had come with wicked and cruel cun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>ning,
and had only sought her own happiness.
Woe unto Astrid! woe unto her!</p>

<p>Hjalte had lowered his voice; it became heavy
and dull; it sounded to Astrid as if he were murmuring
an incantation.</p>

<p>'It is thou,' he said to her, 'who hast destroyed
my most beautiful song.' For the most beautiful
song Hjalte had made was the one in which
he had joined the most pious of all women with
the greatest of all men. 'But thou hast spoiled
my song,' he said, 'and made a mockery of it;
and I will punish thee, thou child of H&eacute;l. I will
punish thee; as the Lord punisheth the tempter
who brought sin into His world, I will punish
thee. But do not ask me,' he continued, 'to protect
thee against thine own self. I remember the
Princess, and how she must suffer through the
trick thou playest on King Olaf. For her sake
thou shalt be punished, just as much as for mine.
I will not go with thee to betray thee. That is
my revenge, Astrid. I will not betray thee. Go
thou to Kungah&auml;lla, Astrid; and if thou dost not
speak of thine own accord, thou wilt become the
King's bride. But then, thou serpent, punishment
shall overtake thee! I know King Olaf,
and I know thee. Thy life shall be such a burden
that thou wilt wish for death every day that
passes.'</p>

<p>When Hjalte had said this he turned away
from her and went his way.</p>

<p>Astrid sat a long time silent, thinking of what
she had heard. But then a smile came over her
face. He forgot, did old Hjalte, that she had
suffered many trials, that she had learnt to laugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
at pain. But happiness, happiness, that she had
never tried.</p>

<p>And Astrid rose and went to the opening of
the tent. She saw the angry Bard's ship. She
thought that far, far away she could see Iceland,
shrouded in mist, welcoming her much-travelled
son with cold and darkness.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>A sunny day late in the harvest, not a cloud
in the sky; a day when one thinks the fair sun
will give to the earth all the light she possesses!
The fair sun is like a mother whose son is about
to set out for a far-off land, and who, in the hour
of the leave-taking, cannot take her eyes from
the beloved.</p>

<p>In the long valley where Kungah&auml;lla lies there
is a row of small hills covered with beech-wood.
And now at harvest-time the trees have garbed
themselves in such splendid raiment that one's
heart is gladdened. One would almost think
that the trees were going a-wooing. It looks
as if they had clothed themselves in gold and
scarlet to win a rich bride by their splendour.</p>

<p>The large island of Hisingen, on the other
side of the river, had also adorned itself. But
Hisingen is covered with golden-white birch-trees.
At Hisingen the trees are clad in light
colours, as if they are little maidens in bridal attire.</p>

<p>But up the river, which comes rushing down
towards the ocean as proudly and wildly as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the harvest rain had filled it with frothy wine,
there passes the one ship after the other, rowing
homewards. And when the ships approach
Kungah&auml;lla they hoist new white sails, instead
of the old ones of gray wadmal; and one cannot
help thinking of old fairy-tales of kings' sons
who go out seeking adventures clothed in rags,
but who throw them off when they again enter
the King's lofty hall.</p>

<p>But all the people of Kungah&auml;lla have assembled
at the landing-stages. Old and young
are busy unloading goods from the ships. They
fill the storehouses with salt and train-oil, with
costly weapons, and many-coloured rugs. They
haul large and small vessels on to land, they
question the returned seamen about their voyage.
But suddenly all work ceases, and every
eye is turned towards the river.</p>

<p>Right between the big merchant vessels a
large galley is making its way, and people ask
each other in astonishment who it can be that
carries sails striped with purple and a golden
device on the prow; they wonder what kind of
ship it can be that comes flying over the waves
like a bird. They praise the oarsmen, who
handle the oars so evenly that they flash along
the sides of the ship like an eagle's wings.</p>

<p>'It must be the Swedish Princess who is coming,'
they say. 'It must be the beautiful Princess
Ingegerd, for whom Olaf Haraldsson has been
waiting the whole summer and harvest.'</p>

<p>And the women hasten down to the riverside
to see the Princess when she rows past them on
her way to the King's Landing-Stage. Men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
boys run to the ships, or climb the roofs of the
boathouses.</p>

<p>When the women see the Princess standing
in gorgeous apparel, they begin to shout to her,
and to greet her with words of welcome; and
every man who sees her radiant face tears his
cap from his head and swings it high in the air.
But on the King's Landing-Stage stands King
Olaf himself, and when he sees the Princess his
face beams with gladness, and his eyes light up
with tender love.</p>

<p>And as it is now so late in the year that all
the flowers are faded, the young maidens pluck
the golden-red autumnal leaves from the trees
and strew them on the bridge and in the street;
and they hasten to deck their houses with the
bright berries of the mountain-ash and the dark-red
leaves of the poplar.</p>

<p>The Princess, who stands high on the ship,
sees the people waving and greeting her in welcome.
She sees the golden-red leaves over which
she shall walk, and foremost on the landing-stage
she sees the King awaiting her with smiles. And
the Princess forgets everything she would have
said and confessed. She forgets that she is not
Ingegerd, she forgets everything except the one
thing, that she is to be the wife of Olaf Haraldsson.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One Sunday Olaf Haraldsson was seated at
table, and his beautiful Queen sat by his side.
He was talking eagerly with her, resting his
elbow on the table, and turning towards her, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
that he could see her face. But when Astrid
spoke the King lowered his eyes in order not to
think of anything but her lovely voice, and when
she had been speaking for a long time he began
to cut the table with his knife without thinking
of what he was doing. All King Olaf's men
knew that he would not have done this if he had
remembered that it was Sunday; but they had
far too great a respect for King Olaf to venture
to remind him that he was committing a sin.</p>

<p>The longer Astrid talked, the more uneasy became
his henchmen. The Queen saw that they
exchanged troubled glances with each other, but
she did not understand what was the matter.</p>

<p>All had finished eating, and the food had been
removed, but King Olaf still sat and talked with
Astrid and cut the top of the table. A whole
little heap of chips lay in front of him. Then at
last his friend Bj&ouml;rn, the son of Ogur from
Sel&ouml;, spoke.</p>

<p>'What day is it to-morrow, Eilif?' he asked,
turning to one of the torch-bearers.</p>

<p>'To-morrow is Monday,' answered Eilif in a
loud and clear voice.</p>

<p>Then the King lifted his head and looked up
at Eilif.</p>

<p>'Dost thou say that to-morrow is Monday?'
he asked thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Without saying another word, the King gathered
up all the chips he had cut off the table into
his hand, went to the fireplace, seized a burning
coal, and laid it on the chips, which soon caught
fire. The King stood quite still and let them
burn to ashes in his hand. Then all the hench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>men
rejoiced, but the young Queen grew pale as
death.</p>

<p>'What sentence will he pronounce over me
when he one day finds out my sin,' she thought,
'he who punishes himself so hardly for so slight
an offence?'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Agge from Gardarike lay sick on board his
galley in Kungah&auml;lla harbour. He was lying in
the narrow hold awaiting death. He had been
suffering for a long time from pains in his foot,
and now there was an open sore, and in the
course of the last few hours it had begun to turn
black.</p>

<p>'Thou needest not die, Agge,' said Lodulf
from Kungh&auml;lla, who had come on board to see
his sick friend. 'Dost thou not know that King
Olaf is here in the town, and that God, on account
of his piety and holiness, has given him
power to heal the sick? Send a message to him
and ask him to come and lay his hand upon thee,
and thou wilt recover.'</p>

<p>'No, I cannot ask help from him,' answered
Agge. 'Olaf Haraldsson hates me because I
have slain his foster-brother, Reor the White.
If he knew that my ship lay in the harbour, he
would send his men to kill me.'</p>

<p>But when Lodulf had left Agge and gone into
the town, he met the young Queen, who had
been in the forest gathering nuts.</p>

<p>'Queen,' Lodulf cried to her, 'say this to
King Olaf: "Agge from Gardarike, who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
slain thy foster-brother, lies at the point of death
on his ship in the harbour."'</p>

<p>The young Queen hastened home and went
immediately up to King Olaf, who stood in the
courtyard smoothing the mane of his horse.</p>

<p>'Rejoice, King Olaf!' she said. 'Agge from
Gardarike, who slew thy foster-brother, lies sick
on his ship in the harbour and is near death.'</p>

<p>Olaf Haraldsson at once led his horse into the
stable; then he went out without sword or
helmet. He went quickly down one of the narrow
lanes between the houses until he reached
the harbour. There he found the ship which
belonged to Agge. The King was at the side
of the sick man before Agge's men thought of
stopping him.</p>

<p>'Agge,' said King Olaf, 'many a time I have
pursued thee on the sea, and thou hast always
escaped me. Now thou hast been struck down
with sickness here in my city. This is a sign to
me that God hath given thy life into my hands.'</p>

<p>Agge made no answer. He was utterly feeble,
and death was very near. Olaf Haraldsson laid
his hands upon his breast and prayed to God.</p>

<p>'Give me the life of this mine enemy,' he said.</p>

<p>But the Queen, who had seen the King hasten
down to the harbour without helmet and sword,
went into the hall, fetched his weapons and called
for some of his men. Then she hurried after
him down to the ship. But when she stood outside
the narrow hold, she heard King Olaf praying
for the sick man.</p>

<p>Astrid looked in and saw the King and Agge
without betraying her presence. She saw that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
whilst the King's hands rested upon the forehead
and breast of the dying man, the deathly pallor
vanished from his face; he began to breathe
lightly and quietly; he ceased moaning, and at
last he fell into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>Astrid went softly back to the King's Castle.
She dragged the King's sword after her along
the road. Her face was paler than the dying
man's had been. Her breathing was heavy, like
that of a dying person.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the morning of All Saints' Day, and
King Olaf was ready to go to Mass. He came
out of the King's Hall and went across the courtyard
towards the gateway. Several of the King's
henchmen stood in the courtyard to accompany
him to Mass. When the King came towards
them, they drew up in two rows, and the King
passed between them.</p>

<p>Astrid stood in the narrow corridor outside
the Women's Room and looked down at the
King. He wore a broad golden band round his
head, and was attired in a long mantle of red
velvet. He went very quietly, and there was a
holy peace over his face. Astrid was terrified
to see how much he resembled the Saints and
Kings that were carved in wood over the altar
in the Marie Church.</p>

<p>At the gateway stood a man in a broad-brimmed
hat, and wearing a big mantle. When
the King approached him he threw off his
mantle, lifted a drawn sword, which he had hidden
under it, and rushed at the King. But when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
he was quite close to him, the mild and gentle
glance of the King fell upon him, and he suddenly
stopped. He let his sword fall to the
ground, and fell on his knees.</p>

<p>King Olaf stood still, and looked at the man
with the same clear glance; the man tried to
turn his eyes away from him, but he could not.
At last he burst into tears and sobs.</p>

<p>'Oh, King Olaf! King Olaf!' he moaned.
'Thine enemies sent me hither to slay thee; but
when I saw thy saintly face my sword fell from
my hand. Thine eyes, King Olaf, have felled
me to the ground.'</p>

<p>Astrid sank upon her knees where she stood.</p>

<p>'Oh God, have mercy upon me, a sinner!' she
said. 'Woe unto me, because by lying and deceit
I have become the wife of this man.'</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>On the evening of All Saints' Day the moon
shone bright and clear. The King had gone the
round of the castle, had looked into stables
and barns to see that all was well; he had even
been to the house where the serfs dwelt to ascertain
if they were well looked after. When he
went back to the King's Hall, he saw a woman
with a black kerchief over her head stealing
towards the gateway. He thought he knew her,
and therefore followed her. She went out of
the gateway, over the Market Place, and stole
down the narrow lanes to the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>Olaf Haraldsson went after her as quietly as
he could. He saw her go on to one of the
landing-stages, stand still, and look down into
the water. She stretched out her arms towards
heaven, and, with a deep sigh, she went so near
the edge that the King saw she meant to spring
into the river.</p>

<p>The King approached her with the noiseless
steps which a life full of danger had taught him.
Twice the woman lifted her foot to make the
spring, but she hesitated. Before she could make
a new attempt, King Olaf had his arm round
her waist and drew her back.</p>

<p>'Thou unhappy one!' he said. 'Thou wouldest
do that which God hath prohibited.'</p>

<p>When the woman heard his voice she held her
hands before her face as if to hide it. But King
Olaf knew who she was. The rustle of her dress,
the shape of her head, the golden rings on her
arms had already told him that it was the Queen.
The first moment Astrid had struggled to free
herself, but she soon grew quiet, and tried to
make the King believe that she had not intended
to kill herself.</p>

<p>'King Olaf, why dost thou secretly come behind
a poor woman who hath gone down to the
river to see how she is mirrored in the water?
What must I think of thee?'</p>

<p>Astrid's voice sounded composed and playful.
The King stood silent.</p>

<p>'Thou hast frightened me so that I nearly fell
into the river,' Astrid said. 'Didst thou think,
perhaps, that I would drown myself?'</p>

<p>The King answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>'I know not what to believe; God will enlighten
me.'</p>

<p>Astrid laughed and kissed him.</p>

<p>'What woman would take her life who is as
happy as I am? Doth one take one's life in
Paradise?'</p>

<p>'I do not understand it,' said King Olaf, in
his gentle manner. 'God will enlighten me. He
will tell me if it be through any fault of mine that
thou wouldest commit so great a sin.'</p>

<p>Astrid went up to him and stroked his cheek.
The reverence she felt for King Olaf had hitherto
deterred her from showing him the full tenderness
of her love. Now she threw her arms passionately
around him and kissed him countless
times. Then she began to speak to him in gentle,
bird-like tones.</p>

<p>'Wouldest thou know how truly my heart
clings to thee?' she said.</p>

<p>She made the King sit down on an overturned
boat. She knelt down at his feet.</p>

<p>'King Olaf,' she said, 'I will no longer be
Queen. She who loves as greatly as I love thee
cannot be a Queen. I wish thou wouldest go far
into the forest, and let me be thy bondwoman.
Then I should have leave to serve thee every
day. Then I would prepare thy food, make thy
bed, and watch over thy house whilst thou slept.
None other should have leave to serve thee, except
I. When thou returnest from the chase
in the evening, I would go to meet thee, and
kneel before thee on the road and say: "King
Olaf, my life is thine." And thou wouldest laugh,
and lower thy spear against my breast, and say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
"Yes, thy life is mine. Thou hast neither father
nor mother; thou art mine, and thy life is mine."'</p>

<p>As Astrid said this, she drew, as if in play,
King Olaf's sword out of its sheath. She laid
the hilt in the King's hand, but the point she
directed towards her own heart.</p>

<p>'Say these words to me, King Olaf,' she said,
'as if we were alone in the forest, and I were thy
bondwoman. Say: "Thy life is mine."'</p>

<p>'Thy life is God's,' said the King.</p>

<p>Astrid laughed lightly.</p>

<p>'My life is thine,' she repeated, in the tenderest
voice, and the same moment King Olaf felt
that she pressed the point of the sword against
her breast.</p>

<p>But the King held the sword with a firm hand,
even when in play. He drew it to him before
Astrid had time to do herself any harm. And he
sprang up. For the first time in his life he
trembled from fear. The Queen would die at his
hand, and she had not been far from attaining
her wish. At the same moment he had an inspiration,
and he understood what was the cause
of her despair.</p>

<p>'She has committed a sin,' he thought. 'She
has a sin upon her conscience.'</p>

<p>He bent down over Astrid.</p>

<p>'Tell me in what manner thou hast sinned,'
he said.</p>

<p>Astrid had thrown herself down on the rough
planks of the bridge, crying in utter despair.</p>

<p>'No one free from guilt would weep like this,'
thought the King. 'But how can the honourable
daughter of the King have brought such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
heavy burden upon her?' he asked himself.
'How can the noble Ingegerd have a crime upon
her conscience?'</p>

<p>'Ingegerd, tell me how thou hast sinned,' he
asked again.</p>

<p>But Astrid was sobbing so violently that she
could not answer, but instead she drew off her
golden arm and finger rings, and handed them
to the King with averted face. The King
thought how unlike this was to the gentle King's
daughter of whom Hjalte had spoken.</p>

<p>'Is this Hjalte's Ingegerd that lies sobbing at
my feet?' he thought.</p>

<p>He bent down and seized Astrid by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>'Who are thou? who art thou?' he said, shaking
her arm. 'I see that thou canst not be Ingegerd.
Who art thou?'</p>

<p>Astrid was still sobbing so violently that she
could not speak. But in order to give the King
the answer he asked for, she let down her long
hair, twisted a lock of it round her arms, and held
them towards the King, and sat thus bowed and
with drooping head. The King thought:</p>

<p>'She wishes me to understand that she belongs
to those who wear chains. She confesses that
she is a bondwoman.'</p>

<p>A thought again struck the King; he now
understood everything.</p>

<p>'Has not the Svea-King a daughter who is
the child of a bondwoman?' he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>He received no answer to this question either,
but he heard Astrid shudder as if from cold.
King Olaf asked still one more question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>'Thou whom I have made my wife,' he said,
'hast thou so low a mind that thou wouldest
allow thyself to be used as a means of spoiling
a man's honour? Is thy mind so mean that thou
rejoicest when his enemies laugh at his discomfiture?'</p>

<p>Astrid could hear from the King's voice how
bitterly he suffered under the insult that had
been offered him. She forgot her own sufferings,
and wept no more.</p>

<p>'Take my life,' she said.</p>

<p>A great temptation came upon King Olaf.</p>

<p>'Slay this wicked bondwoman,' the old Adam
said within him. 'Show the Svea-King what it
costs to make a fool of the King of Norway.'</p>

<p>At that moment Olaf Haraldsson felt no love
for Astrid. He hated her for having been the
means of his humiliation. He knew everybody
would think it right when he returned evil for
evil, and if he did not avenge this insult, he
would be held in derision by the Bards, and his
enemies would no longer fear him. He had but
one wish: to slay Astrid, to take her life. His
anger was so violent that it craved for blood.
If a fool had dared to put his fool's cap upon
his head, would he not have torn it off, torn it
to pieces, thrown it on the ground, trampled
upon it? If he now laid Astrid a bloody corpse
upon her ship, and sent her back to her father,
people would say of King Olaf that he was a
worthy descendant of Harald Haarfager.</p>

<p>But King Olaf still held his sword in his
hand, and under his fingers he felt the hilt, upon
which he had once had inscribed: 'Blessed are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
the peacemakers,' 'Blessed are the meek,'
'Blessed are the merciful.' And every time he,
in this hour of anguish, grasped his sword firmly
in order to slay Astrid, he felt these words under
his hand. He thought he could feel every letter.
He remembered the day when he had first heard
these words.</p>

<p>'This I will write in letters of gold on the hilt
of my sword,' he had said, 'so that the words
may burn in my hand every time I would swing
my sword in fury, or for an unjust cause.'</p>

<p>He felt that the hilt of the sword now burnt in
his hand. King Olaf said aloud to himself:</p>

<p>'Formerly thou wert the slave of many lusts;
now thou hast but one master, and that is God.'</p>

<p>With these words he put back the sword into
its sheath, and began to walk to and fro on the
bridge. Astrid remained lying in the same position.
King Olaf saw that she crouched in fear
of death every time he went past her.</p>

<p>'I will not slay thee,' he said; but his voice
sounded hard from hatred.</p>

<p>King Olaf continued for awhile to walk backwards
and forwards on the bridge; then he went
up to Astrid, and asked her in the same hard
voice what her real name was, and that she was
able to answer him. He looked at this woman
whom he had so highly treasured, and who now
lay at his feet like a wounded deer&mdash;he looked
down upon her as a dead man's soul looks with
pity at the poor body which was once its dwelling.</p>

<p>'Oh, thou my soul,' said King Olaf, 'it was
there thou dwelt in love, and now thou art as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
homeless as a beggar.' He drew nearer to
Astrid, and spoke as if she were no longer living
or could hear what he said. 'It was told me
that there was a King's daughter whose heart
was so pure and holy that she endued with peace
all who came near her. They told me of her
gentleness, that he who saw her felt as safe as a
helpless child does with its mother, and when
the beautiful woman who now lies here came
to me, I thought that she was Ingegerd, and she
became exceeding dear to me. She was so
beautiful and glad, and she made my own heavy
thoughts light. And did she sometimes act
otherwise than I expected the proud Ingegerd
to do, she was too dear to me to doubt her; she
stole into my heart with her joyousness and
beauty.'</p>

<p>He was silent for a time, and thought how
dear Astrid had been to him and how happiness
had with her come to his house.</p>

<p>'I could forgive her,' he said aloud. 'I could
again make her my Queen, I could in love take
her in my arms; but I <em>dare</em> not, for my soul
would still be homeless. Ah, thou fair woman,'
he said, 'why dost lying dwell within thee? With
thee there is no security, no rest.'</p>

<p>The King went on bemoaning himself, but
now Astrid stood up.</p>

<p>'King Olaf, do not speak thus to me,' she
said; 'I will rather die. Understand, I am in
earnest.'</p>

<p>Then she tried to say a few words to excuse
herself. She told him that she had gone to
Kungah&auml;lla not with the intention of deceiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
him, but in order to be a Princess for a few
weeks, to be waited upon like a Queen, to sail
on the sea. But she had intended to confess who
she was as soon as she came to Kungah&auml;lla.
There she expected to find Hjalte and the other
great men who knew Ingegerd. She had never
thought of deceiving him when she came, but
an evil spirit had sent all those away who knew
Ingegerd, and then the temptation had come
to her.</p>

<p>'When I saw thee, King Olaf,' she said, 'I
forgot everything to become thine, and I thought
I would gladly suffer death at thine hand had I
but for one day been thy wife.'</p>

<p>King Olaf answered her:</p>

<p>'I see that what was deadly earnest to me was
but a pastime to thee. Never hast thou thought
upon what it was to come and say to a man: "I
am she whom thou most fervently desirest; I am
that high-born maiden whom it is the greatest
honour to win." And then thou art not that
woman; thou art but a lying bondwoman.'</p>

<p>'I have loved thee from the first moment I
heard thy name,' Astrid said softly.</p>

<p>The King clenched his hand in anger against
her.</p>

<p>'Know, Astrid, that I have longed for Ingegerd
as no man has ever longed for woman. I
would have clung to her as the soul of the dead
clings to the angel bearing him upwards. I
thought she was so pure that she could have
helped me to lead a sinless life.'</p>

<p>And he broke out into wild longings, and said
that he longed for the power of the holy ones of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
God, but that he was too weak and sinful to attain
to perfection.</p>

<p>'But the King's daughter could have helped
me,' he said; 'she the saintly and gentle one
would have helped me. Oh, my God,' he said,
'whichever way I turn I see sinners, wherever
I go I meet those who would entice me to sin.
Why didst Thou not send me the King's daughter,
who had not a single evil thought in her heart?
Her gentle eye would have found the right path
for my foot. Whenever I strayed from it her
gentle hand would have led me back.'</p>

<p>A feeling of utter helplessness and the weariness
of despair fell upon Olaf Haraldsson.</p>

<p>'It was this upon which I had set my hopes,'
he said&mdash;'to have a good woman at my side, not
to wander alone amongst wickedness and sin forever.
Now I feel that I must succumb; I am
unable to fight any longer. Have I not asked
God,' he exclaimed, 'what place I shall have
before His face? To what hast Thou chosen me,
Thou Lord of souls? Is it appointed unto me
to become the equal of apostles and martyrs?
But now, Astrid, I need ask no longer; God hath
not been willing to give me that woman who
should have assisted me in my wandering. Now
I know that I shall never win the crown of the
Saints.'</p>

<p>The King was silent in inconsolable despair;
then Astrid drew nearer to him.</p>

<p>'King Olaf,' she said, 'what thou now sayest
both Hjalte and Ingegerd have told me long ago,
but I would not believe that thou wert more than
a good and brave knight and noble King. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
only now that I have lived under thy roof that
my soul has begun to fear thee. I have felt that
it was worse than death to appear before thee
with a lie upon my lips. Never have I been so
terrified,' Astrid continued, 'as when I understood
that thou wast a Saint. When I saw thee
burn the chips in thine hand, when I saw sickness
flee at thy bidding, and the sword fall out of
thine enemy's hand when he met thee, I was
terrified unto death when I saw that thou wast a
Saint, and I resolved to die before thou knewest
that I had deceived thee.'</p>

<p>King Olaf did not answer. Astrid looked up
at him; she saw that his eyes were turned
towards heaven. She did not know if he had
heard her.</p>

<p>'Ah,' she said, 'this moment have I feared
every day and every hour since I came hither.
I would have died rather than live through it.'</p>

<p>Olaf Haraldsson was still silent.</p>

<p>'King Olaf,' she said, 'I would gladly give my
life for thee; I would gladly throw myself into
the gray river so that thou shouldst not live with
a lying woman at thy side. The more I saw of
thy holiness the better I understood that I must
go from thee. A Saint of God cannot have a
lying bondwoman at his side.'</p>

<p>The King was still silent, but now Astrid raised
her eyes to his face; then she cried out, terror-stricken:</p>

<p>'King Olaf, thy face shines.'</p>

<p>Whilst Astrid spoke, God had shown King
Olaf a vision. He saw all the stars of heaven
leave their appointed places, and fly like swarm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>ing
bees about the universe. But suddenly they
all gathered above his head and formed a radiant
crown.</p>

<p>'Astrid,' said he, with trembling voice, 'God
hath spoken to me. It is true what thou sayest.
I shall become a Saint of God.'</p>

<p>His voice trembled from emotion, and his face
shone in the night. But when Astrid saw the
light that surrounded his head, she arose. For
her the last hope had faded.</p>

<p>'Now I will go,' she said. 'Now thou knowest
whom thou art. Thou canst never more bear
me at thy side. But think gently of me. Without
joy or happiness have I lived all my life. In
rags have I gone; blows have I endured. Forgive
me when I am gone. My love has done thee
no harm.'</p>

<p>When Astrid in silent despair crossed over the
bridge, Olaf Haraldsson awoke from his ecstasy.
He hastened after her.</p>

<p>'Why wilt thou go?' he said. 'Why wilt
thou go?'</p>

<p>'<em>Must</em> I not go from thee when thou art a
Saint?' she whispered scarcely audibly.</p>

<p>'Thou shalt not go. Now thou canst remain,'
said King Olaf. 'Before, I was a lowly man and
must fear all sin; a poor earthly King was I,
too poor to bestow on thee my grace; but now
all the glory of Heaven has been given to me. Art
thou weak? I am the Lord's knight. Dost thou
fall? I can lift thee up. God hath chosen me,
Astrid. Thou canst not harm me, but I can help
thee. Ah! what am I saying? In this hour God
hath so wholly and fully shed the riches of His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
love in my heart that I cannot even see thou hast
done wrong.'</p>

<p>Gently and tenderly he lifted up the trembling
form, and whilst lovingly supporting her, who
was still sobbing and who could hardly stand
upright, he and Astrid went back to the King's
Castle.</p>

<p class="story_head"><span class="dec_italic">Old</span> <span class="smcap">Agnete</span></p>

<p>An old woman went up the mountain-path
with short, tripping steps. She was little
and thin. Her face was pale and wizened,
but neither hard nor furrowed. She wore a long
cloak and a quilled cap. She had a Prayer-Book
in her hand and a sprig of lavender in her handkerchief.</p>

<p>She lived in a hut far up the high mountain
where no trees could grow. It was lying quite
close to the edge of a broad glacier, which sent
its river of ice from the snow-clad mountain peak
into the depths of the valley. There she lived
quite alone. All those who had belonged to her
were dead.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, and she had been to church.
But whatever might be the cause, her going there
had not made her happy, but sorrowful. The
clergyman had spoken about death and the
doomed, and that had affected her. She had suddenly
begun to think of how she had heard in
her childhood that many of the doomed were
tormented in the region of eternal cold on the
mountain right above her dwelling. She could
remember many tales about these wanderers of
the glaciers&mdash;these indefatigable shadows which
were hunted from place to place by the icy
mountain winds.</p>

<p>All at once she felt a great terror of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
mountain, and thought that her hut was dreadfully
high up. Supposing those who moved
about invisibly there wandered down the glaciers!
And she who was quite alone! The word
'alone' gave to her thoughts a still sadder turn.
She again felt the full burden of that sorrow
which never left her. She thought how hard it
was to be so far away from human beings.</p>

<p>'Old Agnete,' she said aloud to herself, as she
had got into the habit of doing in the lonely
waste, 'you sit in your hut and spin, and spin.
You work and toil all the hours of the day so
as not to perish from hunger. But is there anyone
to whom you give any pleasure by being
alive? Is there anyone, old Agnete? If any of
your own were living&mdash;&mdash;Yes, then, perhaps,
if you lived nearer the village, you might be of
some use to somebody. Poor as you are, you
could neither take dog nor cat home to you,
but you could probably now and then give a
beggar shelter. You ought not to live so far
away from the highroad, old Agnete. If you
could only once in a while give a thirsty wayfarer
a drink, then you would know that it was of
some use your being alive.'</p>

<p>She sighed, and said to herself that not even
the peasant women who gave her flax to spin
would mourn her death. She had certainly
striven to do her work honestly and well, but no
doubt there were many who could have done it
better. She began to cry bitterly, when the
thought struck her that his reverence, who had
seen her sitting in the same place in church for so
many, many years, would perhaps think it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
matter of perfect indifference whether she was
dead or not.</p>

<p>'It is as if I were dead,' she said. 'No one
asks after me. I would just as well lie down
and die. I am already frozen to death from cold
and loneliness. I am frozen to the core of the
heart, I am indeed. Ah me! ah me!' she said,
now she had been set a-thinking; 'if there were
only someone who really needed me, there might
still be a little warmth left in old Agnete. But
I cannot knit stockings for the mountain goats,
or make the beds for the marmots, can I? I
tell Thee,' she said, stretching our her hands
towards heaven, 'something Thou must give me
to do, or I shall lay me down and die.'</p>

<p>At the same moment a tall, stern monk came
towards her. He walked by her side because he
saw that she was sorrowful, and she told him
about her troubles. She said that her heart was
nearly frozen to death, and that she would become
like one of the wanderers on the glacier
if God did not give her something to live for.</p>

<p>'God will assuredly do that,' said the monk.</p>

<p>'Do you not see that God is powerless here?'
old Agnete said. 'Here there is nothing but
an empty, barren waste.'</p>

<p>They went higher and higher towards the snow
mountains. The moss spread itself softly over
the stones; the Alpine herbs, with their velvety
leaves, grew along the pathway; the mountain,
with its rifts and precipices, its glaciers and snow-drifts,
towered above them, weighing them down.
Then the monk discovered old Agnete's hut,
right below the glacier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh,' he said, 'is it there you live? Then you
are not alone there; you have company enough.
Only look!'</p>

<p>The monk put his thumb and first finger together,
held them before old Agnete's left eye,
and bade her look through them towards the
mountain. But old Agnete shuddered and closed
her eyes.</p>

<p>'If there is anything to see up there, then I
will not look on any account,' she said. 'The
Lord preserve us! it is bad enough without that.'</p>

<p>'Good-bye, then,' said the monk; 'it is not
certain that you will be permitted to see such a
thing a second time.'</p>

<p>Old Agnete grew curious; she opened her
eyes and looked towards the glacier. At first
she saw nothing remarkable, but soon she began
to discern things moving about. What she had
taken to be mist and vapour, or bluish-white
shadows on the ice, were multitudes of doomed
souls, tormented in the eternal cold.</p>

<p>Poor old Agnete trembled like an aspen leaf.
Everything was just as she had heard it described
in days gone by. The dead wandered about there
in endless anguish and pain. Most of them were
shrouded in something long and white, but all
had their faces and their hands bared.</p>

<p>They could not be counted, there was such a
multitude. The longer she looked, the more
there appeared. Some walked proud and erect,
others seemed to dance over the glacier; but she
saw that they all cut their feet on the sharp and
jagged edges of the ice.</p>

<p>It was just as she had been told. She saw how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
they constantly huddled close together, as if to
warm themselves, but immediately drew back
again, terrified by the deathly cold which emanated
from their bodies.</p>

<p>It was as if the cold of the mountain came
from them, as if it were they who prevented the
snow from melting and made the mist so piercingly
cold.</p>

<p>They were not all moving; some stood in icy
stoniness, and it looked as if they had been standing
thus for years, for ice and snow had gathered
around them so that only the upper portion of
their bodies could be seen.</p>

<p>The longer the little old woman gazed the
quieter she grew. Fear left her, and she was only
filled with sorrow for all these tormented beings.
There was no abatement in their pain, no rest for
their torn feet, hurrying over ice sharp as edged
steel. And how cold they were! how they shivered!
how their teeth chattered from cold!
Those who were petrified and those who could
move, all suffered alike from the snarling, biting,
unbearable cold.</p>

<p>There were many young men and women; but
there was no youth in their faces, blue with cold.
It looked as if they were playing, but all joy was
dead. They shivered, and were huddled up like
old people.</p>

<p>But those who made the deepest impression on
her were those frozen fast in the hard glacier,
and those who were hanging from the mountain-side
like great icicles.</p>

<p>Then the monk removed his hand, and old
Agnete saw only the barren, empty glaciers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Here and there were ice-mounds, but they did
not surround any petrified ghosts. The blue
light on the glacier did not proceed from frozen
bodies; the wind chased the snowflakes before
it, but not any ghosts.</p>

<p>Still old Agnete was certain that she had really
seen all this, and she asked the monk:</p>

<p>'Is it permitted to do anything for these poor
doomed ones?'</p>

<p>He answered:</p>

<p>'When has God forbidden Love to do good
or Mercy to solace?'</p>

<p>Then the monk went his way, and old Agnete
went to her hut and thought it all over. The
whole evening she pondered how she could help
the doomed who were wandering on the glaciers.
For the first time in many years she had been
too busy to think of her loneliness.</p>

<p>Next morning she again went down to the
village. She smiled, and was well content. Old
age was no longer so heavy a burden. 'The
dead,' she said to herself, 'do not care so much
about red cheeks and light steps. They only
want one to think of them with a little warmth.
But young people do not trouble to do that. Oh
no, oh no. How should the dead protect themselves
from the terrible coldness of death did not
old people open their hearts to them?</p>

<p>When she came to the village shop she bought
a large package of candles, and from a peasant
she ordered a great load of firewood; but in
order to pay for it she had to take in twice as
much spinning as usual.</p>

<p>Towards evening, when she got home again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
she said many prayers, and tried to keep up her
courage by singing hymns. But her courage
sank more and more. All the same, she did what
she had made up her mind to do.</p>

<p>She moved her bed into the inner room of her
hut. In the front room she made a big fire and
lighted it. In the window she placed two candles,
and left the outer door wide open. Then
she went to bed.</p>

<p>She lay in the darkness and listened.</p>

<p>Yes, there certainly was a step. It was as if
someone had come gliding down the glacier. It
came heavily, moaning. It crept round the hut
as if it dared not come in. Close to the wall it
stood and shivered.</p>

<p>Old Agnete could not bear it any longer. She
sprang out of bed, went into the outer room and
closed the door. It was too much; flesh and
blood could not stand it.</p>

<p>Outside the hut she heard deep sighs and dragging
steps, as of sore, wounded feet. They
dragged themselves away further and further up
the icy glacier. Now and again she also heard
sobs; but soon everything was quiet.</p>

<p>Then old Agnete was beside herself with anxiety.
'You are a coward, you silly old thing,'
she said. 'Both the fire and the lights, which
cost so much, are burning out. Shall it all have
been done in vain because you are such a miserable
coward?' And when she had said this
she got out of bed again, crying from fear, with
chattering teeth, and shivering all over; but into
the other room she went, and the door she
opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>Again she lay and waited. Now she was no
longer frightened that they should come. She
was only afraid lest she had scared them away,
and that they dared not come back.</p>

<p>And as she lay there in the darkness she began
to call just as she used to do in her young days
when she was tending the sheep.</p>

<p>'My little white lambs, my lambs in the
mountains, come, come! Come down from rift
and precipice, my little white lambs!'</p>

<p>Then it seemed as if a cold wind from the
mountain came rushing into the room. She
heard neither step nor sob, only gusts of wind
that came rushing along the walls of the hut into
the room. And it sounded as if someone were
continually saying:</p>

<p>'Hush, hush! Don't frighten her! don't
frighten her! don't frighten her!'</p>

<p>She had a feeling as if the outside room was
so overcrowded that they were being crushed
against the walls, and that the walls were giving
way. Sometimes it seemed as if they would lift
the roof in order to gain more room. But the
whole time there were whispers:</p>

<p>'Hush, hush! Don't frighten her! don't
frighten her!'</p>

<p>Then old Agnete felt happy and peaceful. She
folded her hands and fell asleep. In the morning
it seemed as if the whole had been a dream.
Everything looked as usual in the outer room;
the fire had burnt out, and so had the candles.
There was not a vestige of tallow left in the
candlesticks.</p>

<p>As long as old Agnete lived she continued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
do this. She spun and worked so that she could
keep her fire burning every night. And she was
happy because someone needed her.</p>

<p>Then one Sunday she was not in her usual seat
in the church. Two peasants went up to her hut
to see if there was anything the matter. She was
already dead, and they carried her body down
to the village to bury it.</p>

<p>When, the following Sunday, her funeral took
place, just before Mass, there were but few who
followed, neither did one see grief on any face.
But suddenly, just as the coffin was being lowered
into the grave, a tall, stern monk came into
the churchyard, and he stood still and pointed
to the snow-clad mountains. Then they saw the
whole mountain-ridge shining in a red light as
if lighted with joy, and round it wound a procession
of small yellow flames, looking like
burning candles. And these flames numbered
as many as the candles which old Agnete had
burned for the doomed. Then people said:
'Praise the Lord! She whom no one mourns
here below has all the same found friends in the
solitude <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Punctuation added">above.</span>'</p>

<p class="story_head"><span class="dec_italic">The Fisherman's</span> <span class="smcap">Ring</span></p>

<p>During the reign of the Doge Gradenigos
there lived in Venice an old fisherman,
Cecco by name. He had been an
unusually strong man, and was still very strong
for his age, but lately he had given up work and
left it to his two sons to provide for him. He was
very proud of his sons, and he loved them&mdash;ah,
signor, how he loved them!</p>

<p>Fate had so ordered it that their bringing up
had been almost entirely left to him. Their
mother had died early, and so Cecco had to take
care of them. He had looked after their clothes
and cooked their food; he had sat in the boat
with needle and cotton and mended and darned.
He had not cared in the least that people had
laughed at him on that account. He had also,
quite alone, taught them all it was necessary for
them to know. He had made a couple of able
fishermen of them, and taught them to honour
God and San Marco.</p>

<p>'Always remember,' he said to them, 'that
Venice will never be able to stand in her own
strength. Look at her! Has she not been built
on the waves? Look at the low islands close to
land, where the sea plays amongst the seaweed.
You would not venture to tread upon them, and
yet it is upon such foundation that the whole
city rests. And do you not know that the north
wind has strength enough to throw both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
churches and palaces into the sea? Do you not
know that we have such powerful enemies, that
all the princes in Christendom cannot vanquish
them? Therefore you must always pray to San
Marco, for in his strong hands rests the chains
which hold Venice suspended over the depths of
the sea.'</p>

<p>And in the evening, when the moon shed its
light over Venice, greenish-blue from the sea-mist;
when they quietly glided up the Canale
Grande and the gondolas they met were full of
singers; when the palaces shone in their white
splendour, and thousands of lights mirrored
themselves in the dark waters&mdash;then he always
reminded them that they must thank San Marco
for life and happiness.</p>

<p>But oh, signor! he did not forget him in the
daytime either. When they returned from fishing
and glided over the water of the lagoons,
light-blue and golden; when the city lay before
them, swimming on the waves; when the great
ships passed in and out of the harbour, and the
palace of the Doges shone like a huge jewel-casket,
holding all the world's treasure&mdash;then he
never forgot to tell them that all these things
were the gift of San Marco, and that they would
all vanish if a single Venetian were ungrateful
enough to give up believing in and adoring him.</p>

<p>Then, one day, the sons went out fishing on
the open sea, outside Lido. They were in company
with several others, had a splendid vessel,
and intended being away several days. The
weather was fine, and they hoped for a goodly
haul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>They left the Rialto, the large island where the
city proper lies, one early morning, and as they
passed through the lagoons they saw all the
islands which, like fortifications, protect Venice
against the sea, appear through the mist of the
morning. There were La Gindecca and San
Giorgio on the right, and San Michele, Muracco
and San Lazzaro on the left. Then island followed
upon island in a large circle, right on to
the long Lido lying straight before them, and
forming, as it were, the clasp of this string of
pearls. And beyond Lido was the wide, infinite
sea.</p>

<p>When they were well at sea, some of them got
into a small boat and rowed out to set their nets.
It was still fine weather, although the waves were
higher here than inside the islands. None of
them, however, dreamt of any danger. They had
a good boat and were experienced men. But
soon those left on the vessel saw that the sea and
the sky suddenly grew darker in the north. They
understood that a storm was coming on, and they
at once shouted to their comrades, but they were
already too far away to hear them.</p>

<p>The wind first reached the small boat. When
the fishermen suddenly saw the waves rise around
them, as herds of cattle on a large plain arise
in the morning, one of the men in the boat stood
up and beckoned to his comrades, but the same
moment he fell backwards into the sea. Immediately
afterwards a wave came which raised the
boat on her bows, and one could see how the
men, as it were, were shaken from off their seats
and flung into the sea. It only lasted a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
and everything had disappeared. Then the boat
again appeared, keel upwards. The men in the
vessel tried to reach the spot, but could not tack
against the wind.</p>

<p>It was a terrific storm which came rushing
over the sea, and soon the fishermen in the vessel
had their work set to save themselves. They succeeded
in getting home safely, however, and
brought with them the news of the disaster. It
was Cecco's two sons and three others who had
perished.</p>

<p>Ah me! how strangely things come about!
The same morning Cecco had gone down to
the Rialto to the fish-market. He went about
amongst the stands and strutted about like a fine
gentleman because he had no need to work.
He even invited a couple of old Lido fishermen
to an asteri and stood them a beaker of wine.
He grew very important as he sat there and
bragged and boasted about his sons. His spirits
rose high, and he took out the zecchine&mdash;the
one the Doge had given him when he had saved a
child from drowning in Canale Grande. He was
very proud of this large gold coin, carried it always
about him, and showed it to people whenever
there was an opportunity.</p>

<p>Suddenly a man entered the asteri and began
to tell about the disaster, without noticing that
Cecco was sitting there. But he had not been
speaking long before Cecco threw himself over
him and seized him by the throat.</p>

<p>'You do not dare to tell me that they are
dead!' he shrieked&mdash;'not my sons!'</p>

<p>The man succeeded in getting away from him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
but Cecco for a long time went on as if he were
out of his mind. People heard him shout and
groan; they crowded into the asteri&mdash;as many
as it could hold&mdash;and stood round him in a circle
as if he were a juggler.</p>

<p>Cecco sat on the floor and moaned. He hit
the hard stone floor with his fist, and said over
and over again:</p>

<p>'It is San Marco, San Marco, San Marco!'</p>

<p>'Cecco, you have taken leave of your senses
from grief,' they said to him.</p>

<p>'I knew it would happen on the open sea,'
Cecco said; 'outside Lido and Malamocco,
there, I knew it would happen. There San
Marco would take them. He bore them a
grudge. I have feared it, boy. Yes,' he said,
without hearing what they said to quiet him,
'they once laughed at him, once when we were
lying outside Lido. He has not forgotten it; he
will not stand being laughed at.'</p>

<p>He looked with confused glances at the bystanders,
as if to seek help.</p>

<p>'Look here, Beppo from Malamocca,' he said,
stretching out his hand towards a big fisherman,
'don't you believe it was San Marco?'</p>

<p>'Don't imagine any such thing, Cecco.'</p>

<p>'Now you shall hear, Beppo, how it happened.
You see, we were lying out at sea, and to while
away the time I told them how San Marco had
come to Venice. The evangelist San Marco
was first buried in a beautiful cathedral at Alexandria
in Egypt. But the town got into the
possession of unbelievers, and one day the
Khalifa ordered that they should build him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
magnificent palace at Alexandria, and take some
columns from the Christian churches for its
decoration. But just at that time there were
two Venetian merchants at Alexandria who had
ten heavily-laden vessels lying in the harbour.
When these men entered the church where San
Marco was buried and heard the command of the
Khalifa, they said to the sorrowful priests:
"The precious body which you have in your
church may be desecrated by the Saracens. Give
it to us; we will honour it, for San Marco was
the first to preach on the Lagoon, and the Doge
will reward you." And the priests gave their
consent, and in order that the Christians of Alexandria
should not object, the body of another
holy man was placed in the Evangelist's coffin.
But to prevent the Saracens from getting any
news of the removal of the body, it was placed
at the bottom of a large chest, and above it were
packed hams and smoked bacon, which the
Saracens could not endure. So when the Custom-house
officers opened the lid of the chest,
they at once hurried away. The two merchants,
however, brought San Marco safely to Venice;
you know, Beppo, that this is what they say.'</p>

<p>'I do, Cecco.'</p>

<p>'Yes; but just listen now,' and Cecco half
arose, and in his fear spoke in a low voice.
'Something terrible now happened. When I told
the boys that the holy man had been hidden
underneath the bacon, they burst out laughing.
I tried to hush them, but they only laughed the
louder. Giacomo was lying on his stomach in
the bows, and Pietro sat with his legs dangling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
outside the boat, and they both laughed so that
it could be heard far out over the sea.'</p>

<p>'But, Cecco, surely two children may be allowed
to laugh.'</p>

<p>'But don't you understand that is where they
have perished to-day&mdash;on the very spot? Or can
you understand why they should have lost their
lives on that spot?'</p>

<p>Now they all began to talk to him and comfort
him. It was his grief which made him lose
his senses. This was not like San Marco. He
would not revenge himself upon two children.
Was it not natural that when a boat was caught
in a storm this would happen on the open sea
and not in the harbour?</p>

<p>Surely his sons had not lived in enmity with
San Marco. They had heard them shout, '<em><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Eviva
San Marco!</span></em>' as eagerly as all the others, and had
he not protected them to this very day. He had
never, during the years that had passed, shown
any sign of being angry with them.</p>

<p>'But, Cecco,' they said, 'you will bring misfortune
upon us with your talk about San Marco.
You, who are an old man and a wise man, should
know better than to raise his anger against the
Venetians. What are we without him?'</p>

<p>Cecco sat and looked at them bewildered.</p>

<p>'Then you don't believe it?'</p>

<p>'No one in his senses would believe such a
thing.'</p>

<p>It looked as if they had succeeded in quieting
him.</p>

<p>'I will also try not to believe it,' he said. He
rose and walked towards the door. 'It would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
too cruel, would it not?' he said. 'They were
too handsome and too brave for anyone to hate
them; I will not believe it.'</p>

<p>He went home, and in the narrow street outside
his door he met an old woman, one of his
neighbours.</p>

<p>'They are reading a Mass in the cathedral for
the souls of the dead,' she said to Cecco, and
hurried away. She was afraid of him; he looked
so strange.</p>

<p>Cecco took his boat and made his way through
the small canals down to Riva degli Schiavoni.
There was a wide view from there; he looked
towards Lido and the sea. Yes, it was a hard
wind, but not a storm by any means; there
were hardly any waves. And his sons had perished
in weather like this! It was inconceivable.</p>

<p>He fastened his boat, and went across the
Piazetta and the Market Place into San Marco.
There were many people in the church, and they
were all kneeling and praying in great fear; for
it is much more terrible for the Venetians, you
know, than any other people when there is a
disaster at sea. They do not get their living
from vineyards or fields, but they are all, everyone
of them, dependent on the sea. Whenever
the sea rose against any one of them they were
all afraid, and hurried to San Marco to pray to
him for protection.</p>

<p>As soon as Cecco entered the cathedral he
stopped. He thought of how he had brought
his little sons there, and taught them to pray to
San Marco. 'It is he who carries us over the
sea, who opens the gates of Byzance for us and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
gives us the supremacy over the islands of the
East,' he said to them. Out of gratitude for all
this the Venetians had built San Marco the most
beautiful temple in the world, and no vessel ever
returned from a foreign port without bringing a
gift for San Marco.</p>

<p>Then they had admired the red marble walls
of the cathedral and the golden mosaic ceiling.
It was as if no misfortune could befall a city that
had such a sanctuary for her patron Saint.</p>

<p>Cecco quickly knelt down and began to pray,
the one <em>Paternoster</em> after the other. It came
back, he felt. He would send it away by prayers.
He would not believe anything bad about
San Marco.</p>

<p>But it had been no storm at all. And so much
was certain, that even if the Saint had not sent
the storm, he had, in any case, not done anything
to help Cecco's sons, but had allowed them
to perish as if by accident. When this thought
came upon him he began to pray; but the
thought would not leave him.</p>

<p>And to think that San Marco had a treasury
in this cathedral full of all the glories of fairyland!
To think that he had himself prayed to him all
his life, and had never rowed past the Piazetta
without going into the cathedral to invoke him!</p>

<p>Surely it was not by a mere accident that his
sons had to-day perished on the sea! Oh, it
was miserable for the Venetians to have no one
better to depend upon! Just fancy a Saint who
revenged himself upon two children&mdash;a patron
Saint who could not protect against a gust of
wind!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood up, and he shrugged his shoulders,
and disparagingly waved his hand when he
looked towards the tomb of the Saint in the
chancel.</p>

<p>A verger was going about with a large chased
silver-gilt dish, collecting gifts for San Marco.
He went from the one person to the other, and
also came to Cecco.</p>

<p>Cecco drew back as if it were the Evil One himself
who handed him the plate. Did San Marco
ask for gifts from him? Did he think he deserved
gifts from him?</p>

<p>All at once he seized the large golden zecchine
he had in his belt, and flung it into the plate with
such violence that the ring of it could be heard
all over the church. It disturbed those who were
praying, and made them turn round. And all
who saw Cecco's face were terrified; he looked as
if he were possessed of evil spirits.</p>

<p>Cecco immediately left the church, and at first
felt it as a great relief that he had been revenged
upon the Saint. He had treated him as one treats
a usurer who demands more than he is entitled to.
'Take this too,' one says, and throws his last gold
piece in the fellow's face so that the blood runs
down over his eyes. But the usurer does not
strike again&mdash;simply stoops and picks up the zecchine.
So, too, had San Marco done. He had accepted
Cecco's zecchine, having first robbed him
of his sons. Cecco had made him accept a gift
which had been tendered with such bitter hatred.
Would an honourable man have put up with such
treatment? But San Marco was a coward&mdash;both
cowardly and revengeful. But he was not likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
to revenge himself upon Cecco. He was, no
doubt, pleased and thankful he had got the
zecchine. He simply accepted it and pretended
that it had been given as piously as could be.</p>

<p>When Cecco stood at the entrance, two vergers
quickly passed him.</p>

<p>'It rises&mdash;it rises terribly!' the one said.</p>

<p>'What rises?' asked Cecco.</p>

<p>'The water in the crypt. It has risen a foot in
the last two or three minutes.'</p>

<p>When Cecco went down the steps, he saw a
small pool of water on the Market Place close to
the bottom step. It was sea-water, which had
splashed up from the Piazetta. He was surprised
that the sea had risen so high, and he hurried
down to the Riva, where his boat lay. Everything
was as he had left it, only the water had
risen considerably. It came rolling in broad
waves through the five sea-gates; but the wind
was not very strong. At the Riva there were already
pools of sea-water, and the canals rose so
that the doors in the houses facing the water had
to be closed. The sky was all gray like the sea.</p>

<p>It never struck Cecco that it might grow into
a serious storm. He would not believe any such
thing. San Marco had allowed his sons to perish
without cause. He felt sure this was no real
storm. He would just like to see if it would be a
storm, and he sat down beside his boat and
waited.</p>

<p>Then suddenly rifts appeared in the dull-gray
clouds which covered the sky. The clouds were
torn asunder and flung aside, and large storm-clouds
came rushing, black like warships, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
from them scourging rain and hail fell upon the
city. And something like quite a new sea came
surging in from Lido. Ah, signor! they were
not the swan-necked waves you have seen out
there, the waves that bend their transparent necks
and hasten towards the shore, and which, when
they are pitilessly repulsed, float away again with
their white foam-hair dispersed over the surface
of the sea. These were dark waves, chasing each
other in furious rage, and over their tops the bitter
froth of the sea was whipped into mist.</p>

<p>The wind was now so strong that the seagulls
could no longer continue their quiet flight, but,
shrieking, were thrust from their course. Cecco
soon saw them with much trouble making their
way towards the sea, so as not to be caught by
the storm and flung against the walls. Hundreds
of pigeons on San Marco's square flew up, beating
their wings, so that it sounded like a new
storm, and hid themselves away in all the nooks
and corners of the church roof.</p>

<p>But it was not the birds alone that were frightened
by the storm. A couple of gondolas had already
got loose, and were thrown against the
shore, and were nearly shattered. And now all
the gondoliers came rushing to pull their boats
into the boathouses, or place them in shelter in
the small canals.</p>

<p>The sailors on the ships lying in the harbour
worked with the anchor-chains to make the vessels
fast, in order to prevent them drifting on to
the shore. They took down the clothes hanging
up to dry, pulled their long caps well over
their foreheads, and began to collect all the loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
articles lying about in order to bring them below
deck. Outside Canale Grande a whole fishing-fleet
came hurrying home. All the people from
Lido and Malamocco who had sold their goods
at the Rialto were rushing homewards, before the
storm grew too violent.</p>

<p>Cecco laughed when he saw the fishermen
bending over their oars and straining themselves
as if they were fleeing from death itself. Could
they not see that it was only a gust of wind?
They could very well have remained and given
the Venetian women time to buy all their cattle,
fish, and crabs.</p>

<p>He was certainly not going to pull his boat into
shelter, although the storm was now violent
enough for any ordinary man to have taken notice
of it. The floating bridges were lifted up high
and cast on to the shore, whilst the washerwomen
hurried home shrieking. The broad-brimmed
hats of the signors were blown off into the canals,
from whence the street-boys fished them out with
great glee. Sails were torn from the masts, and
fluttered in the air with a cracking sound; children
were knocked down by the strong wind; and
the clothes hanging on the lines in the narrow
streets were torn to rags and carried far away.</p>

<p>Cecco laughed at the storm&mdash;a storm which
drove the birds away, and played all sorts of
pranks in the street, like a boy. But, all the same,
he pulled his boat under one of the arches of the
bridge. One could really not allow what that
wind might take it into its head to do.</p>

<p>In the evening Cecco thought that it would
have been fun to have been out at sea. It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
have been splendid sailing with such a fresh
wind. But on shore it was unpleasant. Chimneys
were blown down; the roofs of the boathouses
were lifted right off; it rained tiles from the
houses into the canals; the wind shook the doors
and the window-shutters, rushed in under the
open loggias of the palaces and tore off the decorations.</p>

<p>Cecco held out bravely, but he did not go home
to bed. He could not take the boat home with
him, so it was better to remain and look after it.
But when anyone went by and said that it was
terrible weather he would not admit it. He had
experienced very different weather in his young
days.</p>

<p>'Storm!' he said to himself&mdash;'call this a
storm? And they think, perhaps, that it began
the same moment I threw the zecchine to San
Marco. As if he can command a real storm!'</p>

<p>When night came the wind and the sea grew
still more violent, so that Venice trembled in her
foundations. Doge Gradenigo and the Gentlemen
of the High Council went in the darkness of
the night to San Marco to pray for the city.
Torch-bearers went before them, and the flames
were spread out by the wind, so that they lay flat,
like pennants. The wind tore the Doge's heavy
brocade gown, so that two men were obliged to
hold it.</p>

<p>Cecco thought this was the most remarkable
thing he had ever seen&mdash;Doge Gradenigo going
himself to the cathedral on account of this bit of
a wind! What would those people have done if
there had been a real storm?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>The waves beat incessantly against the bulwarks.
In the darkness of the night it was as if
white-headed wresters sprang up from the deep,
and with teeth and claws clung fast to the piles to
tear them loose from the shore. Cecco fancied
he could hear their angry snorts when they were
hurled back again. But he shuddered when he
heard them come again and again, and tear in the
bulwarks.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that the storm was far more
terrible in the night. He heard shouts in the air,
and that was not the wind. Sometimes black
clouds came drifting like a whole row of heavy
galleys, and it seemed as if they advanced to make
an assault on the city. Then he heard distinctly
someone speaking in one of the riven clouds over
his head.</p>

<p>'Things look bad for Venice now,' it said from
the one cloud. 'Soon our brothers the evil spirits
will come and overthrow the city.'</p>

<p>'I am afraid San Marco will not allow it to
happen,' came as a response from the other cloud.</p>

<p>'San Marco has been knocked down by a
Venetian, so he lies powerless, and cannot help
anyone,' said the first.</p>

<p>The storm carried the words down to old Cecco,
and from that moment he was on his knees, praying
San Marco for grace and forgiveness. For
the evil spirits had spoken the truth. It did indeed
look bad for Venice. The fair Queen of the
Isles was near destruction. A Venetian had
mocked San Marco, and therefore Venice was in
danger of being carried away by the sea. There
would be no more moonlight sails or her sea and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
in her canals, and no more barcaroles would be
heard from her black gondolas. The sea would
wash over the golden-haired signoras, over the
proud palaces, over San Marco, resplendent with
gold.</p>

<p>If there was no one to protect these islands,
they were doomed to destruction. Before San
Marco came to Venice it had often happened that
large portions of them had been washed away by
the waves.</p>

<p>At early dawn San Marco's Church bells began
to ring. People crept to the church, their clothes
being nearly torn off them.</p>

<p>The storm went on increasing. The priests had
resolved to go out and adjure the storm and the
sea. The main doors of the cathedral were
opened, and the long procession streamed out of
the church. Foremost the cross was carried, then
came the choir-boys with wax candles, and last in
the procession were carried the banner of San
Marco and the Sacred Host.</p>

<p>But the storm did not allow itself to be cowed;
on the contrary, it was as if it wished for nothing
better to play with. It upset the choir-boys, blew
out the wax candles, and flung the baldachin,
which was carried over the Host, on to the top of
the Doge's palace. It was with the utmost trouble
that they saved San Marco's banner, with the
winged lion, from being carried away.</p>

<p>Cecco saw all this, and stole down to his boat
moaning loudly. The whole day he lay near the
shore, often wet by the waves and in danger of
being washed into the sea. The whole day he
was praying incessantly to God and San Marco.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
He felt that the fate of the whole city depended
upon his prayers.</p>

<p>There were not many people about that day,
but some few went moaning along the Riva. All
spoke about the immeasurable damage the storm
had wrought. One could see the houses tumbling
down on the Murano. It was as if the whole
island were under water. And also on the Rialto
one or two houses had fallen.</p>

<p>The storm continued the whole day with unabated
violence. In the evening a large multitude
of people assembled at the Market Place and
the Piazetta, although these were nearly covered
with water. People dared not remain in their
houses, which shook in their very foundations.
And the cries of those who feared disaster mingled
with the lamentations of those whom it had
already overtaken. Whole dwellings were under
water; children were drowned in their cradles.
The old and the sick had been swept with the
overturned houses into the waves.</p>

<p>Cecco was still lying and praying to San Marco.
Oh, how could the crime of a poor fisherman be
taken in such earnest? Surely it was not his fault
that the saint was so powerless! He would let
the demons take him and his boat; he deserved
no better fate. But not the whole city!&mdash;oh,
God in heaven, not the whole city!</p>

<p>'My sons!' Cecco said to San Marco. 'What
do I care about my sons when Venice is at stake!
I would willingly give a son for each tile in danger
of being blown into the canal if I could keep them
in their place at that price. Oh, San Marco, each
little stone of Venice is worth as much as a
promising son.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>At times he saw terrible things. There was a
large galley which had torn itself from its moorings
and now came drifting towards the shore.
It went straight against the bulwark, and struck
it with the ram's head in her bows, just as if it had
been an enemy's ship. It gave blow after blow,
and the attack was so violent that the vessel immediately
sprang a leak. The water rushed in,
the leak grew larger, and the proud ship went to
pieces. But the whole time one could see the
captain and two or three of the crew, who would
not leave the vessel, cling to the deck and meet
death without attempting to escape it.</p>

<p>The second night came, and Cecco's prayers
continued to knock at the gate of heaven.</p>

<p>'Let me alone suffer!' he cried. 'San Marco, it
is more than a man can bear, thus to drag others
with him to destruction. Only send thy lion and
kill me; I shall not attempt to escape. Everything
that thou wilt have me give up for the city,
that will I willingly sacrifice.'</p>

<p>Just as he had uttered these words he looked
towards the Piazetta, and he thought he could
no longer see San Marco's lion on the granite
pillar. Had San Marco permitted his lion to be
overthrown? old Cecco cried. He was nearly
giving up Venice.</p>

<p>Whilst he was lying there he saw visions and
heard voices all the time. The demons talked and
moved to and fro. He heard them wheeze like
wild beasts every time they made their assaults on
the bulwarks. He did not mind them much; it
was worse about Venice.</p>

<p>Then he heard in the air above him the beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
of strong wings; this was surely San Marco's
lion flying overhead. It moved backwards and
forwards in the air; he saw and yet he did not
see it. Then it seemed to him as if it descended
on Riva degli Schiavoni, where he was lying, and
prowled about there. He was on the point of
jumping into the sea from fear, but he remained
sitting where he was. It was no doubt he whom
the lion sought. If that could only save Venice,
then he was quite willing to let San Marco avenge
himself upon him.</p>

<p>Then the lion came crawling along the ground
like a cat. He saw it making ready to spring. He
noticed that it beat its wings and screwed its large
carbuncle eyes together till they were only small
fiery slits.</p>

<p>Then old Cecco certainly did think of creeping
down to his boat and hiding himself under the
arch of the bridge, but he pulled himself together
and remained where he was. The same moment
a tall, imposing figure stood by his side.</p>

<p>'Good-evening, Cecco,' said the man; 'take
your boat and row me across to San Giorgio Maggiore.'</p>

<p>'Yes, signor,' immediately replied the old fisherman.</p>

<p>It was as if he had awakened from a dream.
The lion had disappeared, and the man must be
somebody who knew him, although Cecco could
not quite remember where he had seen him
before. He was glad to have company. The
terrible heaviness and anguish that had been over
him since he had revolted against the Saint suddenly
vanished. As to rowing across to San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Giorgio, he did not for a moment think that it
could be done.</p>

<p>'I don't believe we can even get the boat out,'
he said to himself.</p>

<p>But there was something about the man at his
side that made him feel he must do all he possibly
could to serve him; and he did succeed in getting
out the boat. He helped the stranger into the
boat and took the oars.</p>

<p>Cecco could not help laughing to himself.</p>

<p>'What are you thinking about? Don't go out
further in any case,' he said. 'Have you ever seen
the like of these waves? Do tell him that it is
not within the power of man.'</p>

<p>But he felt as if he could not tell the stranger
that it was impossible. He was sitting there as
quietly as if he were sailing to the Lido on a
summer's eve. And Cecco began to row to San
Giorgio Maggiore.</p>

<p>It was a terrible row. Time after time the
waves washed over them.</p>

<p>'Oh, stop him!' Cecco said under his breath;
'do stop the man who goes to sea in such
weather! Otherwise he is a sensible old fisherman.
Do stop him!'</p>

<p>Now the boat was up a steep mountain, and
then it went down into a valley. The foam
splashed down on Cecco from the waves that
rushed past him like runaway horses, but in spite
of everything he approached San Giorgio.</p>

<p>'For whom are you doing all this, risking boat
and life?' he said. 'You don't even know
whether he can pay you. He does not look like
a fine gentleman. He is no better dressed than
you are.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>But he only said this to keep up his courage,
and not to be ashamed of his tractability. He
was simply compelled to do everything the man
in the boat wanted.</p>

<p>'But in any case not right to San Giorgio, you
foolhardy old man,' he said. 'The wind is even
worse there than at the Rialto.'</p>

<p>But he went there, nevertheless, and made the
boat fast whilst the stranger went on shore. He
thought the wisest thing he could do would be
to slip away and leave his boat, but he did not
do it. He would rather die than deceive the
stranger. He saw the latter go into the Church
of San Giorgio. Soon afterwards he returned,
accompanied by a knight in full armour.</p>

<p>'Row us now to San Nicolo in Lido,' said the
stranger.</p>

<p>'Ay, ay,' Cecco thought; 'why not to Lido?'
They had already, in constant anguish and
death, rowed to San Giorgio; why should they
not set out for Lido?</p>

<p>And Cecco was shocked at himself that he
obeyed the stranger even unto death, for he now
actually steered for the Lido.</p>

<p>Being now three in the boat, it was still
heavier work. He had no idea how he should
be able to do it. 'You might have lived many
years yet,' he said sorrowfully to himself. But
the strange thing was that he was not sorrowful,
all the same. He was so glad that he could have
laughed aloud. And then he was proud that he
could make headway. 'He knows how to use
his oars, does old Cecco,' he said.</p>

<p>They laid-to at Lido, and the two strangers
went on shore. They walked towards San Nicolo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
in Lido, and soon returned accompanied by an
old Bishop, with robe and stole, crosier in hand,
and mitre on head.</p>

<p>'Now row out to the open sea,' said the first
stranger.</p>

<p>Old Cecco shuddered. Should he row out to
the sea, where his sons perished? Now he had
not a single cheerful word to say to himself. He
did not think so much of the storm, but of the
terror it was to have to go out to the graves
of his sons. If he rowed out there, he felt that he
gave the stranger more than his life.</p>

<p>The three men sat silently in the boat as if
they were on watch. Cecco saw them bend forward
and gaze into the night. They had reached
the gate of the sea at Lido, and the great storm-ridden
sea lay before them.</p>

<p>Cecco sobbed within himself. He thought of
two dead bodies rolling about in these waves.
He gazed into the water for two familiar faces.
But onward the boat went. Cecco did not
give in.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the three men rose up in the
boat; and Cecco fell upon his knees, although
he still went on holding the oars. A big ship
steered straight against them.</p>

<p>Cecco could not quite tell whether it was a
ship or only drifting mist. The sails were large,
spread out, as it were, towards the four corners
of heaven; and the hull was gigantic, but it
looked as if it were built of the lightest sea-mist.
He thought he saw men on board and heard
shouting; but the crew were like deep darkness,
and the shouting was like the roar of the storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>However it was, it was far too terrible to see
the ship steer straight upon them, and Cecco
closed his eyes.</p>

<p>But the three men in the boat must have
averted the collision, for the boat was not upset.
When Cecco looked up the ship had fled out
to sea, and loud wailings pierced the night.</p>

<p>He rose, trembling to row further. He felt so
tired that he could hardly hold the oars. But
now there was no longer any danger. The storm
had gone down, and the waves speedily laid themselves
to rest.</p>

<p>'Now row us back to Venice,' said the stranger
to the fisherman.</p>

<p>Cecco rowed the boat to Lido, where the
Bishop went on shore, and to San Giorgio, where
the knight left them. The first powerful stranger
went with him all the way to the Rialto.</p>

<p>When they had landed at Riva degli Schiavoni
he said to the fisherman:</p>

<p>'When it is daylight thou shalt go to the Doge
and tell him what thou hast seen this night. Tell
him that San Marco and San Giorgio and San
Nicolo have to-night fought the evil spirits that
would destroy Venice, and have put them to
flight.'</p>

<p>'Yes, signor,' the fisherman answered, 'I will
tell everything. But how shall I speak so that
the Doge will believe me?'</p>

<p>Then San Marco handed him a ring with a
precious stone possessed of a wonderful lustre.</p>

<p>'Show this to the Doge,' he said, 'then he will
understand that it brings a message from me.
He knows my ring, which is kept in San Marco's
treasury in the cathedral.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>The fisherman took the ring, and kissed it
reverently.</p>

<p>'Further, thou shalt tell the Doge,' said the
holy man, 'that this is a sign that I shall never
forsake Venice. Even when the last Doge has
left Palazzo Ducali I will live and preserve Venice.
Even if Venice lose her islands in the East
and the supremacy of the sea, and no Doge ever
again sets out on the Bucintoro, even then I will
preserve the city beautiful and resplendent. It
shall always be rich and beloved, always be
lauded and its praises sung, always a place of joy
for men to live in. Say this, Cecco, and the Doge
will not forsake thee in thine old age.'</p>

<p>Then he disappeared; and soon the sun rose
above the gate of the sea at Torcello. With its
first beautiful rays it shed a rosy light over the
white city and over the sea that shone in many
colours. A red glow lay over San Giorgio and
San Marco, and over the whole shore, studded
with palaces. And in the lovely morning radiant
Venetian ladies came out on to the loggias and
greeted with smiles the rising day.</p>

<p>Venice was once again the beautiful goddess,
rising from the sea in her shell of rose-coloured
pearl. Beautiful as never before, she combed her
golden hair, and threw the purple robe around
her, to begin one of her happiest days. For a
transport of bliss filled her when the old fisherman
brought San Marco's ring to the Doge, and she
heard how the Saint, now, and until the end of
time, would hold his protecting hand over her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p class="story_head"><span class="dec_italic" lang="it" xml:lang="it">Santa</span> <span class="smcap">Caterina</span> <span class="dec_italic">of</span> <span class="smcap">Siena</span></p>

<p>At <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Santa</span> Caterina's house in Siena, on a
day towards the end of April, in the week
when her f&ecirc;te is being celebrated, people
come to the old house in the Street of the Dyers,
to the house with the pretty loggia and with the
many small chambers, which have now been converted
into chapels and sanctuaries, bringing
bouquets of white lilies; and the rooms are fragrant
with incense and violets.</p>

<p>Walking through these rooms, one cannot
help thinking that it is just as if she were dead
yesterday, as if all those who go in and out of
her home to-day had seen and known her.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, no one could really
think that she had died recently, for then there
would be more grief and tears, and not only a
quiet sense of loss. It is more as if a beloved
daughter had been recently married, and had
left the parental home.</p>

<p>Look only at the nearest houses. The old
walls are still decorated as if for a f&ecirc;te. And in
her own home garlands of flowers are still hanging
beneath the portico and loggia, green leaves
are strewn on the staircase and the doorstep, and
large bouquets of flowers fill the rooms with their
scent.</p>

<p>She cannot possibly have been dead five hundred
years. It looks much more as if she had
celebrated her marriage, and had gone away to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
a country from which she would not return for
many years, perhaps never. Are not the houses
decorated with nothing but red table-cloths, red
trappings, and red silken banners, and are there
not stuck red-paper roses in the dark garlands
of oak-leaves? and the hangings over the doors
and the windows, are they not red with golden
fringes? Can one imagine anything more
cheerful?</p>

<p>And notice how the old women go about in
the house and examine her small belongings. It
is as if they had seen her wear that very veil and
that very shirt of hair. They inspect the room in
which she lived, and point to the bedstead and
the packets of letters, and they tell how at first
she could not at all learn to write, but that it
came to her all at once without her having learnt
it. And only look at her writing&mdash;how good and
distinct! And then they point to the little bottle
she used to carry at her belt, so as always to have
a little medicine at hand in case she met a sick
person, and they utter a blessing over the old
lantern she held in her hand when she went and
visited the sick in the long weary nights. It is
just as if they would say: 'Dear me&mdash;dear me!
that our little Caterina Benincasa should be
gone, that she will never come any more and look
after us old people!' And they kiss her picture,
and take a flower from the bouquets to keep as
a remembrance.</p>

<p>It looks as if those who were left in the home
had long ago prepared themselves for the separation,
and tried to do everything possible to keep
alive the memory of the one who had gone away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
See, there they have painted her on the wall;
there is the whole of her little history represented
in every detail. There she is when she cut off her
beautiful long hair so that no man could ever fall
in love with her, for she would never marry. Oh
dear&mdash;oh dear! how much ridicule and scoffing
she had suffered on that account! It is dreadful
to think how her mother tormented her and
treated her like a servant, and made her sleep on
the stone floor in the hall, and would not give
her any food, all because of her being so obstinate
about that hair. But what was she to do when
they continually tried to get her married&mdash;she
who would have no other bridegroom than
Christ? And there she is when she was kneeling
in prayer, and her father coming into the room
without her knowing it saw a beautiful white
dove hovering over her head whilst she was praying.
And there she is on that Christmas Eve
when she had gone secretly to the Madonna's
altar in order the more fully to rejoice over the
birth of the Son of God, and the beautiful Madonna
leaned out of her picture and handed the
Child to her that she might be allowed to hold
it for a moment in her arms. Oh, what a joy it
had been for her!</p>

<p>Oh dear, no; it is not at all necessary to say that
our little Caterina Benincasa is dead. One need
only say that she has gone away with the Bridegroom.</p>

<p>In her home one will never forget her pious
ways and doings. All the poor of Siena come and
knock at her door because they know that it is the
marriage-day of the little virgin, and large piles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
of bread lie in readiness for them as if she were
still there. They have their pockets and baskets
filled; had she herself been there, she could not
have sent them away more heavily laden. She
who had gone away had left so great a want that
one almost wonders the Bridegroom had the
heart to take her away with him.</p>

<p>In the small chapels which have been arranged
in every corner of the house they read Mass the
whole day, and they invoke the bride and sing
hymns in her praise.</p>

<p>'Holy Caterina,' they say, 'on this the day of
thy death, which is thine heavenly wedding-day,
pray for us!'</p>

<p>'Holy Caterina, thou who hadst no other love
but Christ, thou who in life wert His affianced
bride, and who in death wast received by Him in
Paradise, pray for us!'</p>

<p>'Holy Caterina, thou radiant heavenly bride,
thou most blessed of virgins, thou whom the
mother of God exalted to her Son's side, thou
who on this day wast carried by angels to the
kingdom of glory, pray for us!'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is strange how one comes to love her, how
the home and the pictures and the love of the old
and the poor seem to make her living, and one
begins to wonder how she really was, whether she
was only a saint, only a heavenly bride, and if it
is true that she was unable to love any other than
Christ. And then comes to one's mind an old
story which warmed one's heart long ago, at first
quite vague and without shape, but whilst one is
sitting there under the loggia in the festively deco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>rated
home and watching the poor wander away
with their full baskets, and hearing the subdued
murmur from the chapels, the story becomes
more and more distinct, and suddenly it is vivid
and clear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nicola Tungo was a young nobleman of Perugia,
who often came to Siena on account of the
races. He soon found out how badly Siena was
governed, and often said, both at the festive gatherings
of the great and when he sat drinking in
the inns, that Siena ought to rise against the Signoria
and procure other rulers.</p>

<p>The Signoria had not been in power for more
than half a year; they did not feel particularly
firm in their office, and did not like the Perugian
stirring up the people. In order promptly to put
a stop to it, they had him imprisoned, and after a
short trial he was sentenced to death. He was
placed in a cell in the Palazzo Publico whilst
preparations were being made for his execution,
which was to take place the next morning in the
Market Place.</p>

<p>At first he was strangely affected. To-morrow
he would no more wear his green velvet doublet
and his beautiful sword; he would no more walk
down the street in his cap with the ostrich-feather
and attract the glances of the young maidens, and
he had a feeling of painful disappointment that he
would never ride the new horse which he bought
yesterday, and which he had only tried once.</p>

<p>Suddenly he called the gaoler, and asked him
to go to the gentlemen of the Signoria and tell
them that he could not possibly allow himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
be killed; he had no time. He had far too much
to do. Life could not do without him. His father
was old, and he was the only son; it was through
his descendants that the family should be continued.
It was he who should give away his sisters
in marriage, he who should build the new
palace, he who should plant the new vineyard.</p>

<p>He was a strong young man; he did not know
what sickness was, had nothing but life in his
veins. His hair was dark and his cheeks red. He
could not realize that he should die.</p>

<p>When he thought of their wanting to take him
away from pleasure and dancing, and the carnival,
and from the races next Sunday, and from the
serenade he was going to sing to the beautiful
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original has Guilietta">Giulietta</span> Lombardi, he became furiously angry,
and his wrath was roused against the councillors
as though they were thieves and robbers. The
scoundrels&mdash;the scoundrels that would take his
life from him!</p>

<p>But as time went on his longings grew deeper;
he longed for air and water and heaven and earth.
He felt he would not mind being a beggar by the
wayside; he would gladly suffer sickness and
hunger and cold if only he were allowed to live.</p>

<p>He wished that everything might die with him,
that nothing would be left when he was gone;
that would have been a great consolation.</p>

<p>But that people should go to the Market Place
and buy and sell, and that the women would fetch
water from the well, and that the children would
run in the streets the next day and all days, and
that he would not be there to see, that he could
not bear. He envied not only those who could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
live in luxury and pleasure, and were happy; he
envied quite as much the most miserable cripple.
What he wanted was life, solely life.</p>

<p>Then the priests and the monks came to see
him. It made him almost happy, for now he had
someone upon whom he could wreak his anger.
He first allowed them to talk a little. It amused
him to hear what they had to say to a man so
deeply wronged as he was, but when they said
that he ought to rejoice that he was permitted to
leave this life and gain the bliss of heaven in
the fulness of his youth, then he started up and
poured forth his wrath upon them. He scoffed
at God and the joys of heaven&mdash;he did not want
them. He would have life, and the world, and
its pomps and vanities. He regretted every day
in which he had not revelled in earthly enjoyment;
he regretted every temptation he had resisted.
God need not trouble Himself in the least
about him; he felt no longing for His heaven.</p>

<p>The priests continued to speak; he seized one
of them by the throat, and would have killed him
had not the gaoler thrown himself between them.
They now bound and gagged him, and then
preached to him; but as soon as he was allowed
to speak he raged as before. They talked to him
for many hours, but they saw that it was of no
avail.</p>

<p>When they could think of nothing else to do,
one of them suggested they should send for the
young Caterina Benincasa, who had shown great
power in subduing defiant spirits. When the
Perugian heard the name he suddenly ceased his
abuse. In truth, it pleased him. It was some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>thing
quite different, having to do with a young,
beautiful maiden.</p>

<p>'By all means send for the maiden,' he said.</p>

<p>He knew that she was the young daughter of a
dyer, and that she went about alone and preached
in the lanes and streets of the town. Some
thought she was mad, others said that she had
visions. For him she might, anyhow, be better
company than these dirty monks, who made him
completely beside himself.</p>

<p>The monks then went their way, and he was
alone. Shortly afterwards the door was again
opened, but if she for whom they had sent had
really entered the cell, she must have walked with
very light footsteps, for he heard nothing. He
lay on the floor just as he had thrown himself
down in his great anger; now he was too tired to
raise himself, or make a movement, or even to
look up. His arms were tied together with ropes,
which cut deep into his flesh.</p>

<p>He now felt that someone began to loosen his
bands; a warm hand touched his arm, and he
looked up. Beside him lay a little figure in the
white dress of the Dominicans, with head and
neck so shrouded in a white veil that there was
not more of her face to be seen than of that of a
knight in helmet and closed visor.</p>

<p>She did not look so meek by any means; she
was evidently a little annoyed. He heard her
murmur something about the gaolers who had
tightened the bands. It did not appear as if she
had come for any other purpose than these knots.
She was only taken up with loosening them so
that they did not hurt. At last she had to bite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
in them, and then she succeeded. She untied the
cord with a light hand, and then took the little
bottle which was suspended from her belt and
poured a few drops upon the chafed skin.</p>

<p>He lay the whole time and looked at her, but
she did not meet his glance; it appeared as if she
could think of nothing else but what she had between
her hands. It was as if nothing were further
from her thoughts than that she was there
to prepare him for death. He felt so exhausted
after his passion, and at the same time so quieted
by her presence, that he only said:</p>

<p>'I think I will sleep.'</p>

<p>'It is a great shame that they have not given
you any straw,' she said.</p>

<p>For a moment she looked about undecided.
Then she sat down upon the floor, and placed his
head in her lap.</p>

<p>'Are you better now?' she said.</p>

<p>Never in his whole life had he felt such a rest.
Yet sleep he could not, but he lay and looked up
in her face, which was like wax, and transparent.
Such eyes he had never seen before. They were
always looking far, far away, gazing into another
world, whilst she sat quite motionless, so as not
to disturb his sleep.</p>

<p>'You are not sleeping, Nicola Tungo,' she said,
and looked uneasy.</p>

<p>'I cannot sleep,' he replied, 'because I am wondering
who you can be.'</p>

<p>'I am a daughter of Luca Benincasa the dyer,
and his wife Lapa,' she said.</p>

<p>'I know that,' he said, 'and I also know that
you go about and preach in the streets. And I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
know that you have attired yourself in the dress
of a nun, and have taken the vows of chastity.
But yet I don't know who you are.'</p>

<p>She turned her head away a little. Then she
said, whispering like one who confesses her first
love:</p>

<p>'I am the Bride of Christ.'</p>

<p>He did not laugh. On the contrary, he felt
quite a pang in his heart, as from jealousy.</p>

<p>'Oh, Christ!' he said, as if she had thrown herself
away.</p>

<p>She heard that his tone was contemptuous, but
she thought he meant that she had spoken too
presumptuously.</p>

<p>'I do not understand it myself,' she said, 'but
so it is.'</p>

<p>'Is it an imagination or a dream?' he said.</p>

<p>She turned her face towards him. The blood
rose red behind the transparent skin. He saw
suddenly that she was fair as a flower, and she became
dear to him. He moved his lips as if to
speak, but at first no sound came.</p>

<p>'How can you expect me to believe that?' he
said defiantly.</p>

<p>'Is it not enough for you that I am here in the
prison with you?' she asked, raising her voice.
'Is it any pleasure for a young girl like me to go
to you and other evil-doers in their gloomy dungeons?
Is it usual for a woman to stand and
preach at the street corners as I do, and to be held
in derision? Do I not require sleep as other people?
And yet I must rise every night and go to
the sick in the hospitals. Am I not timid as other
women? And yet I must go to the high-born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
gentlemen at their castles and reason with them,
I must go to the plague-smitten, I must see all
vice and sin. When have you seen another
maiden do all this? But I am obliged to do it.'</p>

<p>'Poor thing!' he said, and stroked her hand
gently&mdash;'poor thing!'</p>

<p>'For I am not braver, or wiser, or stronger
than others,' she said. 'It is just as hard for me
as for other maidens. You can see that. I have
come here to speak with you about your soul, but
I do not at all know what I shall say to you.'</p>

<p>It was strange how reluctantly he would allow
himself to be convinced.</p>

<p>'You may be mistaken all the same,' he said.
'How do you know that you can call yourself the
Bride of Christ?'</p>

<p>Her voice trembled, and it was as if she should
tear out her heart when she replied:</p>

<p>'It began when I was quite young; I was not
more than six years old. It was one evening
when I was walking with my brother in the
meadow below the church of the Dominicans, and
just as I looked up at the church I saw Christ sitting
on a throne, surrounded by all His power and
glory. He was attired in shining white garments
like the Holy Father in Rome. His head was
surrounded by all the splendour of Paradise, and
around Him stood Pietro Paolo and the Evangelist
Giovanni. And whilst I gazed upon Him my
heart was filled with such a love and holy joy that
I could hardly bear it. He lifted His hand and
blessed me, and I sank down on the meadow, and
was so overcome with bliss, that my brother had
to take me in his arms and shake me. And ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
since that time, Nicola Tungo, I have loved Jesus
as a bridegroom.'</p>

<p>He again objected.</p>

<p>'You were a child then. You had fallen asleep
in the meadow and were dreaming.'</p>

<p>'Dreaming?' she repeated. 'Have I been
dreaming all the time I have seen Him? Was it
a dream when He came to me in the church in the
likeness of a beggar and asked for alms? Then I
was wide awake, at any rate. And do you think
that for the sake of a dream only I could have
borne all the worries I have had to bear as a
young girl because I would not marry?'</p>

<p>Nicola went on contradicting her because he
could not bear the thought that her heart was
filled with love to another.</p>

<p>'But even if you do love Christ, maiden, how
do you know that He loves you?'</p>

<p>She smiled her very happiest smile and clapped
her hands like a child.</p>

<p>'Now you shall hear,' she said. 'Now I will
tell you the most important of all. It was the last
night before Lent. It was after my parents and
I had been reconciled, and I had obtained their
permission to take the vow of chastity and wear
the dress of a nun, although I continued to live in
their house; and it was night, as I told you, the
last night of the carnival, when everybody turns
night into day. There were f&ecirc;tes in every street.
On the walls of the big palaces hung balconies
like cages, completely covered with silken hangings
and banners, and filled with noble ladies. I
saw all their beauty by the light of the red torches
in their bronze-holders, the one row over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
other quite up to the roof; and in the gaily decorated
streets there was a train of carriages, with
golden towers, and all the gods and goddesses,
and all the virtues and beauties went by in a long
procession. And everywhere there was such a
play of masks and so much merriment that I am
sure that you, sir, have never taken part in anything
more gay. And I took refuge in my chamber,
but still I heard laughter from the street, and
never before have I heard people laugh like that;
it was so clear and bell-like that everyone was
obliged to join in it. And they sang songs
which, I suppose, were wicked, but they sounded
so innocent, and caused such pleasure, that one's
heart trembled. Then, in the middle of my prayers,
I suddenly began to wonder why I was not
out amongst them, and the thought fascinated
and tempted me, as if I were dragged along by a
runaway horse; but never before have I prayed
so intensely to Christ to show me what was His
will with me. Suddenly all the noise ceased, a
great and wonderful silence surrounded me, and
I saw a great meadow, where the Mother of God
sat amongst the flowers, and on her lap lay the
Child Jesus, playing with lilies. But I hurried
thither in great joy, and knelt before the Child,
and was at the same moment filled with peace and
quietness, and then the Holy Child placed a ring
on my finger, and said to me, "Know, Caterina,
that to-day I celebrate My betrothal with thee,
and bind thee to Me by the strongest faith."'</p>

<p>'Oh, Caterina!'</p>

<p>The young Perugian had turned himself on the
floor, so that he could bury his face in her lap. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
was as if he could not bear to see how radiant she
was whilst she was speaking, and now her eyes
became bright as stars. A shadow of pain passed
over him. For whilst she spoke a great sorrow
had sprung up in his heart. This little maiden,
this little white maiden, he could never win. Her
love belonged to another; it could never be his.
It was of no use even to tell her that he loved her;
but he suffered; his whole being groaned in
love's agony. How could he bear to live without
her? It almost became a consolation to remember
that he was sentenced to death. It was not
necessary for him to live and do without her.</p>

<p>Then the little woman beside him sighed
deeply, and came back from the joys of heaven in
order to think of poor human beings.</p>

<p>'I forgot to speak to you about your soul,' she
said.</p>

<p>Then, he thought: 'This burden, at any rate,
I can lighten for her.'</p>

<p>'Sister Caterina,' he said, 'I do not know how
it is, but heavenly consolation has come to me.
In God's name I will prepare for death. Now
you may send for the priests and monks; now I
will confess to them. But one thing you must
promise me before you go: you must come to
me to-morrow, when I shall die, and hold my
head between your hands as you are doing now.'</p>

<p>When he said this she burst into tears, from a
great feeling of relief, and an unspeakable joy
filled her.</p>

<p>'How happy you must be, Nicola Tungo!' she
said. 'You will be in Paradise before I am;' and
she stroked his face gently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>He said again:</p>

<p>'You will come to me to-morrow in the Market
Place? Perhaps I shall otherwise be afraid; perhaps
I cannot otherwise die with steadfastness.
But when you are there I shall feel nothing but
joy, and all fear will leave me.'</p>

<p>'You do not seem to me any more as a poor
mortal,' she said, 'but as a dweller of Paradise.
You appear to me radiant with life, surrounded
by incense. Bliss comes to me from you, who
shall so soon meet my beloved Bridegroom. Be
assured I shall come.'</p>

<p>She then led him to confession and the Communion.
He felt the whole time as if he were
asleep. All the fear of death and the longing for
life had passed away from him. He longed for
the morning, when he should see her again; he
thought only of her, and of the love with which
she had inspired him. Death seemed to him now
but a slight thing compared with the pain of the
thought that she would never love him.</p>

<p>The young maiden did not sleep much during
the night, and early in the morning she went to
the place of execution, to be there when he came.
She invoked Jesu, Mother, Marie, and the Holy
Caterina of Egypt, virgin and martyr, incessantly
with prayers to save his soul. Incessantly she repeated:
'I will that he shall be saved&mdash;I will, I
will.' But she was afraid that her prayers were
unavailing, for she did not feel any longer that
ecstasy which had filled her the evening before;
she only felt an infinite pity for him who should
die. She was quite overcome with grief and sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>Little by little the Market Place filled with
people. The soldiers marched up, the executioner
arrived, and much noise and talking went
on around her; but she saw and heard nothing.
She felt as if she were quite alone.</p>

<p>When Nicola Tungo arrived, it was just the
same with him. He had no thought for all the
others, but saw only her. When he saw at the
first glance that she was entirely overcome with
sorrow, his face beamed, and he felt almost
happy. He called loudly to her:</p>

<p>'You have not slept much this night, maiden?'</p>

<p>'No,' she said; 'I have watched in prayer for
you; but now I am in despair, for my prayers
have no power.'</p>

<p>He knelt down before the block, and she knelt
so that she could hold his head in her hands.</p>

<p>'Now I am going to your Bridegroom,
Caterina.'</p>

<p>She sobbed more and more.</p>

<p>'I can comfort you so badly,' she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a strange smile.</p>

<p>'Your tears are my best comfort.'</p>

<p>The executioner stood with his sword drawn,
but she bade him with a movement stand on one
side, for she would speak a few words with the
doomed man.</p>

<p>'Before you came,' she said, 'I laid my head
down on the block to try if I could bear it; and
then I felt that I was still afraid of death, that I do
not love Jesus enough to be willing to die in this
hour; and I do not wish you to die either, and my
prayers have no power.'</p>

<p>When he heard this he thought: 'Had I lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
I should have won her'; and he was glad he
should die before he had succeeded in drawing the
radiant heavenly bride down to earth. But when
he had laid his head in her hands, a great consolation
came to them both.</p>

<p>'Nicola Tungo,' she said, 'I see heaven open.
The angels descend to receive your soul.'</p>

<p>A wondering smile passed over his face. Could
what he had done for her sake make him worthy
of heaven? He lifted his eyes to see what she
saw; the same moment the sword fell.</p>

<p>But Caterina saw the angels descend lower and
lower, saw them lift his soul, saw them carry it to
heaven.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All at once it seemed so natural that Caterina
Benincasa has lived all these five hundred years.
How could one forget that gentle little maiden,
that great loving heart? Again and again they
must sing in her praise, as they are now singing
in the small chapels:</p>

<p>The Bishop had summoned Father Verneau
to appear before him. It was on
account of a somewhat unpleasant matter.
Father Verneau had been sent to preach in the
manufacturing districts around Charleroi, but he
had arrived there in the midst of a strike, when
the workmen were rather excited and unmanageable.
He informed the Bishop that he had
immediately on his arrival in the Black Country
received a letter from one of the leaders of the
men to the effect that they were quite willing to
hear him preach, but if he ventured to mention
the name of God either directly or indirectly,
there would be a disturbance in the church.</p>

<p>'And when I went up into the pulpit and saw
the congregation to whom I should preach,' said
the Father, 'I felt no doubt but that the threat
would be carried out.'</p>

<p>Father Verneau was a little dried-up monk.
The Bishop looked down upon him as being of
a lower order. Such an unshaven, not too clean
monk, with the most insignificant face, was, of
course, a coward. He was, probably, also afraid
of the Bishop.</p>

<p>'I have been informed,' said the Bishop, 'that
you carried out the workmen's wishes. But I
need not point out&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Monseigneur,' interrupted Father Verneau in
all humility, 'I thought the Church, if possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
would avoid everything that might lead to a disturbance.'</p>

<p>'But a Church that dare not mention the name
of God&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Has Monseigneur heard my sermon?'</p>

<p>The Bishop walked up and down the floor to
calm himself.</p>

<p>'You know it by heart, of course?' he said.</p>

<p>'Of course, Monseigneur.'</p>

<p>'Let me hear it, then, as it was delivered,
Father Verneau, word for word, exactly as you
preached it.'</p>

<p>The Bishop sat down in his arm-chair. Father
Verneau remained standing.</p>

<p>'"Citizens and citizenesses," he began in the
tone of a lecturer.</p>

<p>The Bishop started.</p>

<p>'Yes, that is how they will be addressed, Monseigneur.'</p>

<p>'Never mind, Father Verneau, only proceed.'</p>

<p>The Bishop shuddered slightly; these two
words had suddenly shown him the whole situation.
He saw before him this gathering of the
children of the Black Country, to whom Father
Verneau had preached. He saw many wild faces,
many rags, much coarse merriment. He saw
these people for whom nothing had been done.</p>

<p>'"Citizens and citizenesses," began Father Verneau
afresh, "there is in this country an Empress
called Maria Theresa. She is an excellent ruler,
the best and wisest Belgium has ever had. Other
rulers, my fellow-citizens, other rulers have successors
when they die, and lose all power over
their people. Not so the great Empress Maria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Theresa. She may have lost the throne of Austria
and Hungary; Brabant and Limburg may
now be under other rulers, but not her good province
of West Flanders. In West Flanders, where
I have lived the last few years, no other ruler is
known to this very day than Maria Theresa. We
know King Leopold lives in Brussels, but that
has nothing to do with us. It is Maria Theresa
who still reigns here by the sea, more especially
in the fishing villages. The nearer one gets to
the sea, the mightier becomes her power. Neither
the great Revolution, nor the Empire, nor the
Dutch have had the power to overthrow her.
How could they? They have done nothing for
the children of the sea that can compare with
what she has done. But what has she not done
for the people on the dunes! What an invaluable
treasure, my fellow-citizens, has she not bestowed
upon them!</p>

<p>'"About one hundred and fifty years ago, in
the early part of her reign, she made a journey
through Belgium. She visited Brussels and
Bruges, she went to Liege and Louvain, and
when she had at last seen enough of large cities
and profusely ornamented town-halls, she went
to the coast to see the sea and the dunes.</p>

<p>'"It was not a very cheering sight for her. She
saw the ocean, so vast and mighty that no man
can fight against it. She saw the coast, helpless
and unprotected. There lay the dunes, but the
sea had washed over them before, and might do
so again. There were also dams, but they had
fallen down and were neglected.</p>

<p>'"She saw harbours filled with sand; she saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
marshes overgrown with rushes and weeds; she
saw, below the dunes, fishing-huts ravaged by the
wind&mdash;huts looking as if they had been thrown
there, a prey for the sea; she saw poor old
churches that had been moved away from the
sea, lying between quicksands and lyme-grass, in
desolate wastes.</p>

<p>'"The great Empress sat a whole day by the
sea. She was told all about the floods and the
towns that had been washed away; she was shown
the spot where a whole district had sunk under
the sea; she was rowed out to the place where
an old church stood at the bottom of the sea; and
she was told about all the people who had been
drowned, and of all the cattle that had been lost,
the last time the sea had overflowed the dunes.</p>

<p>'"The whole day through the Empress sat
thinking: 'How shall I help these poor people
on the dunes? I cannot forbid the sea to rise and
fall; I cannot forbid it to undermine the shore;
nor can I stay the storm, or prevent it from upsetting
the fishermen's boats; and still less can I
lead the fish into their nets, or transform the lyme-grass
into nutritious wheat. There is no monarch
in the world so mighty that he can help these
poor people in their need.'</p>

<p>'"The next day it was Sunday, and the Empress
heard Mass at Blankenberghe. All the people
from Dunkirk to Sluis had come to see her.
But before Mass the Empress went about and
spoke with the people.</p>

<p>'"The first person she addressed was the harbour-master
from Nieuport. 'What news is there
from your town?' asked the Empress. 'Noth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>ing
new,' answered the harbour-master, 'except
that Cornelis Aertsen's boat was upset in the
storm yesterday; and we found him this morning
riding on the keel.' 'It was a good thing his
life was saved,' said the Empress. 'Well, I don't
know,' said the harbour-master, 'for he was out
of his mind when he came on shore.' 'Was it
from fear?' asked the Empress. 'Yes,' said the
harbour-master; 'it is because we in Nieuport
have nothing to depend upon in the hour of need.
Cornelis knew that his wife and his small children
would starve to death if he perished; and
it was this thought, I suppose, that drove him out
of his mind.' 'Then that is what you need here
on the dunes&mdash;something to depend upon?'
'Yes, that is it,' said the harbour-master. 'The
sea is uncertain, the harvest is uncertain, the fishing
and the earnings are uncertain. Something
to depend upon, that is what we need.'</p>

<p>'"The Empress then went on, and the next
she spoke to was the priest from Heyst. 'What
news from Heyst?' said she to him. 'Nothing
new,' he answered, 'except that Jacob van Ravesteyn
has given up making ditches in the marshes,
and dredging the harbour, and attending to the
lighthouses, and all other useful work he had to
do.' 'How is that?' said the Empress. 'He has
inherited a sum of money,' said the priest; 'but
it was less than he had expected.' 'But now he
has something certain,' said the Empress. 'Yes,'
said the priest; 'but now he has got the money
he dare not venture to do anything great for fear
it will not be sufficient.' 'It is something infinitely
great, then, that is needed to help you at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Heyst?' said the Empress. 'It is,' said the priest;
'there is infinitely much to do. And nothing can
be done until we know that we have something
infinitely great to fall back upon.'</p>

<p>'"The Empress then went on until she came
to the master-pilot from Middelkerke, whom she
began to question about the news from his town.
'I do not know of anything new,' said the master-pilot,
'but that Ian van der Meer has quarrelled
with Luca Neerwinden.' 'Indeed!' said the Empress.
'Yes, they have found the cod-bank they
have both been looking for all their lives. They
had heard about it from old people, and they had
hunted for it all over the sea, and they have been
the best of friends the whole time, but now they
have found it they have fallen out.' 'Then it
would have been better if they had never found
it?' said the Empress. 'Yes,' answered the master-pilot,
'it would indeed have been better.'
'So, then, that which is to help you in Middelkerke,'
said the Empress, 'must be hidden so well
that no one can find it?' 'Just so,' said the
master-pilot; 'well hidden it must be, for if anyone
should find it, there would be nothing but
quarrelling and strife over it, or else it would be
all spent, and then it would be of no further use.'</p>

<p>'"The Empress sighed, and felt she could do
nothing.</p>

<p>'"She then went to Mass, and the whole time
she knelt and prayed that power might be given
her to help the people. And&mdash;you must excuse
me, citizens&mdash;when the Mass was finished, it had
become clear to her that it was better to do a little
than to do nothing. When all the people had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
come out of the church, she stood on the steps in
order to address them.</p>

<p>'"No man or woman of West Flanders will
ever forget how she looked. She was beautiful,
like an Empress, and she was attired like an Empress.
She wore her crown and her ermine mantle,
and held the sceptre in her hand. Her hair
was dressed high and powdered, and a string of
large pearls was entwined amongst the curls. She
wore a robe of red silk, which was entirely covered
with Flemish lace, and red, high-heeled
shoes, with large diamond buckles. That is how
she appears, she who to this day still reigns over
our West Flanders.</p>

<p>'"She spoke to the people of the coast, and
told them her will. She told them of how she
had thought of every way in which to help them.
She said that they knew she could not compel
the sea to quietness or chain the storm, that she
could not lead the fish-shoals to the coast, or
transform the lyme-grass into wheat; but what
a poor mortal could do for them, that should be
done.</p>

<p>'"They all knelt before her whilst she spoke.
Never before had they felt such a gentle and
motherly heart beat for them. The Empress
spoke to them in such a manner about their hard
and toilsome life that tears came into their eyes
over her pity.</p>

<p>'"But now the Empress said she had decided
to leave with them her Imperial money-chest,
with all the treasures which it contained. That
should be her gift to all those who lived on the
dunes. That was the only assistance she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
render them, and she asked them to forgive her
that it was so poor; and the Empress herself
had tears in her eyes when she said this.</p>

<p>'"She now asked them if they would promise
and swear not to use any of the treasure until
the need amongst them was so great that it could
not become any greater. Next, if they would
swear to leave it as an inheritance for their descendants,
if they did not require it themselves.
And, lastly, she asked every man singly to swear
that he would not try to take possession of the
treasure for his own use without having first
asked the consent of all his fellow-fishermen.</p>

<p>'"If they were willing to swear? That they all
were. And they blessed the Empress and cried
from gratitude. And she cried and told them that
she knew that what they needed was a support
that would never fail them, a treasure that could
never be exhausted, and a happiness that was unattainable,
but that she could not give them. She
had never been so powerless as here on the dunes.</p>

<p>'"My fellow-citizens, without her knowing it,
solely by force of the royal wisdom with which
this great Queen was endowed, the power was
given her to attain far more than she had intended,
and it is therefore one can say that to this
day she reigns over West Flanders.</p>

<p>'"What a happiness, is it not, to hear of all
the blessings which have been spread over West
Flanders by the Empress's gift! The people
there have now something to depend upon which
they needed so badly, and which we all need.
However bad things may be, there is never any
despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>'"They have told me at the dunes what the
Empress's money-chest is like. They say it is
like the holy shrine of Saint Ursula at Bruges,
only more beautiful. It is a copy of the cathedral
at Vienna, and it is of pure gold; but on the sides
the whole history of the Empress is depicted in
the whitest alabaster. On the small side-towers
are the four diamonds which the Empress took
from the crown of the Sultan of Turkey, and in
the gable are her initials inlaid with rubies. But
when I ask them whether they have seen the
money-chest, they reply that shipwrecked sailors
when in peril always see it swimming before them
on the waves as a sign that they shall not be in
despair for their wives and children, should they
be compelled to leave them. But they are the
only ones who have seen the treasure, otherwise
no one has been near enough to count it. And
you know, citizens, that the Empress never told
anyone how great it was. But if any of you doubt
how much use it has been and is, then I will ask
you to go to the dunes and see for yourself.
There has been digging and building ever since
that time, and the sea now lies cowed by bulwarks
and dams, and no longer does harm. And there
are green meadows inside the dunes, and there
are flourishing towns and watering-places near
the shore. But for every lighthouse that has been
built, for every harbour that has been deepened,
for every ship of which the keel has been laid, for
every dam that has been raised, they have always
thought: 'If our own money should not be sufficient,
we shall receive help from our Gracious
Empress Maria Theresa.' But this has been but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
a spur to them: their own money has always sufficed.</p>

<p>'"You know, also, that the Empress did not
say where the treasure was. Was not this well
considered, citizens? There is one who has it in
his keeping, but only, when all are agreed upon
dividing it, will he who keeps the treasure come
forward and reveal where it is. Therefore one
is certain that neither now nor in the future will
it be unfairly divided. It is the same for all.
Everyone knows that the Empress thinks as much
of him as of his neighbour. There can be no strife
or envy amongst the people of the dunes as there
is amongst other men, for they all share alike in
the treasure."'</p>

<p>The Bishop interrupted Father Verneau.</p>

<p>'That is enough,' he said. 'How did you continue?'</p>

<p>'I said,' continued the monk, 'that it was very
bad the good Empress had not also come to
Charleroi. I pitied them because they did not own
her money-chest. Considering the great things
they had to accomplish, considering the sea which
they had to tame, the quicksands which they had
to bind, considering all this, I said to them surely
there was nothing they needed so much.'</p>

<p>'And then?' asked the Bishop.</p>

<p>'One or two cabbages, your Eminence, a little
hissing; but then I was already out of the pulpit.
That was all.'</p>

<p>'They had understood that you had spoken to
them about the providence of God?'</p>

<p>The monk bowed.</p>

<p>'They had understood that you would show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
them that the power which they deride because
they do not see it must be kept hidden? that it will
be abused immediately it assumes a visible form?
I congratulate you, Father Verneau.'</p>

<p>The monk retired towards the door, bowing.
The Bishop followed him, beaming benevolently.</p>

<p>'But the money-chest&mdash;do they still believe in
it at the dunes?'</p>

<p>'As much as ever, Monseigneur.'</p>

<p>'And the treasure&mdash;has there ever been a treasure?'</p>

<p>'Monseigneur, I have sworn.'</p>

<p>'But for me,' said the Bishop.</p>

<p>'It is the priest at Blankenberghe, who has it in
his keeping. He allowed me to see it. It is an
old wooden chest with iron mountings.'</p>

<p>'And?'</p>

<p>'And at the bottom lie twenty bright Maria
Theresa gold pieces.'</p>

<p>The Bishop smiled, but became grave at once.</p>

<p>'Is it right to compare such a wooden chest
with God's providence?'</p>

<p>'All comparisons are incomplete, Monseigneur;
all human thoughts are vain.'</p>

<p>Father Verneau bowed once again, and quietly
withdrew from the audience-room.</p>

<p class="story_head"><span class="dec_italic">The</span> <span class="smcap">Peace</span> <span class="dec_italic">of</span> <span class="smcap">God</span></p>

<p>Once upon a time there was an old farmhouse.
It was Christmas-eve, the sky was
heavy with snow, and the north wind was
biting. It was just that time in the afternoon
when everybody was busy finishing their work
before they went to the bath-house to have their
Christmas bath. There they had made such a
fire that the flames went right up the chimney, and
sparks and soot were whirled about by the wind,
and fell down on the snow-decked roofs of the
outhouses. And as the flames appeared above
the chimney of the bath-house, and rose like a
fiery pillar above the farm, everyone suddenly felt
that Christmas was at hand. The girl that was
scrubbing the entrance floor began to hum, although
the water was freezing in the bucket
beside her. The men in the wood-shed who were
cutting Christmas logs began to cut two at a time,
and swung their axes as merrily as if log-cutting
were a mere pastime.</p>

<p>An old woman came out of the pantry with a
large pile of cakes in her arms. She went slowly
across the yard into the large red-painted dwelling-house,
and carried them carefully into the
best room, and put them down on the long seat.
Then she spread the tablecloth on the table, and
arranged the cakes in heaps, a large and a small
cake in each heap. She was a singularly ugly old
woman, with reddish hair, heavy drooping eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>lids,
and with a peculiar strained look about the
mouth and chin, as if the muscles were too short.
But being Christmas-eve, there was such a joy
and peace over her that one did not notice how
ugly she was.</p>

<p>But there was one person on the farm who was
not happy, and that was the girl who was tying up
the whisks made of birch twigs that were to be
used for the baths. She sat near the fireplace, and
had a whole armful of fine birch twigs lying beside
her on the floor, but the withes with which she
was to bind the twigs would not keep knotted.
The best room had a narrow, low window, with
small panes, and through them the light from the
bath-house shone into the room, playing on the
floor and gilding the birch twigs. But the higher
the fire burned the more unhappy was the girl.
She knew that the whisks would fall to pieces as
soon as one touched them, and that she would
never hear the last of it until the next Christmas
fire was lighted.</p>

<p>Just as she sat there bemoaning herself, the person
of whom she was most afraid came into the
room. It was her master, Ingmar Ingmarson.
He was sure to have been to the bath-house to see
if the stove was hot enough, and now he wanted
to see how the whisks were getting on. He was
old, was Ingmar Ingmarson, and he was fond of
everything old, and just because people were beginning
to leave off bathing in the bath-houses
and being whipped with birch twigs, he made a
great point of having it done on his farm, and
having it done properly.</p>

<p>Ingmar Ingmarson wore an old coat of sheep's-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>skin,
skin trousers, and shoes smeared over with
pitch. He was dirty and unshaven, slow in all his
movements, and came in so softly that one might
very well have mistaken him for a beggar. His
features resembled his wife's features and his ugliness
resembled his wife's ugliness, for they were
relations, and from the time the girl first began to
notice anything she had learned to feel a wholesome
reverence for anybody who looked like that;
for it was a great thing to belong to the old family
of the Ingmars, which had always been the first
in the village. But the highest to which a man
could attain was to be Ingmar Ingmarson himself,
and be the richest, the wisest, and the mightiest in
the whole parish.</p>

<p>Ingmar Ingmarson went up to the girl, took
one of the whisks, and swung it in the air. It immediately
fell to pieces; one of the twigs landed
on the Christmas table, another on the big four-poster.</p>

<p>'I say, my girl,' said old Ingmar, laughing, 'do
you think one uses that kind of whisk when one
takes a bath at the Ingmar's, or are you very
tender, my girl?'</p>

<p>When the girl saw that her master did not take
it more seriously than that, she took heart, and
answered that she could certainly make whisks
that would not go to pieces if she could get proper
withes to bind them with.</p>

<p>'Then I suppose I must try to get some for
you, my girl,' said old Ingmar, for he was in a real
Christmas humour.</p>

<p>He went out of the room, stepped over the girl
who was scouring the floor, and remained stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>ing
on the doorstep, to see if there were anyone
about whom he could send to the birch-wood for
some withes. The farm hands were still busy cutting
Yule logs; his son came out of the barn with
the Christmas sheaf; his two sons-in-law were
putting the carts into the shed so that the yard
could be tidy for the Christmas festival. None of
them had time to leave their work.</p>

<p>The old man then quietly made up his mind to
go himself. He went across the yard as if he were
going into the cowshed, looked cautiously round
to make sure no one noticed him, and stole along
outside the barn where there was a fairly good
road to the wood. The old man thought it was
better not to let anyone know where he was going,
for either his son or his sons-in-law might
then have begged him to remain at home, and
old people like to have their own way.</p>

<p>He went down the road, across the fields,
through the small pine-forest into the birch-wood.
Here he left the road, and waded in the snow to
find some young birches.</p>

<p>About the same time the wind at last accomplished
what it had been busy with the whole day:
it tore the snow from the clouds, and now came
rushing through the wood with a long train of
snow after it.</p>

<p>Ingmar Ingmarson had just stooped down and
cut off a birch twig, when the wind came tearing
along laden with snow. Just as the old man was
getting up the wind blew a whole heap of snow in
his face. His eyes were full of snow, and the wind
whirled so violently around him that he was
obliged to turn round once or twice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole misfortune, no doubt, arose from
Ingmar Ingmarson being so old. In his young
days a snowstorm would certainly not have made
him dizzy. But now everything danced round
him as if he had joined in a Christmas polka, and
when he wanted to go home he went in the wrong
direction. He went straight into the large pine-forest
behind the birch-wood instead of going
towards the fields.</p>

<p>It soon grew dark, and the storm continued to
howl and whirl around him amongst the young
trees on the outskirts of the forest. The old man
saw quite well that he was walking amongst fir-trees,
but he did not understand that this was
wrong, for there were also fir-trees on the other
side of the birch-wood nearest the farm. But by-and-by
he got so far into the forest that everything
was quiet and still&mdash;one could not feel the
storm, and the trees were high with thick stems&mdash;then
he found out that he had mistaken the road,
and would turn back.</p>

<p>He became excited and upset at the thought
that he <em>could</em> lose his way, and as he stood there in
the midst of the pathless wood he was not sufficiently
clear-headed to know in which direction to
turn. He first went to the one side and then to the
other. At last it occurred to him to retrace his
way in his own footprints, but darkness came on,
and he could no longer follow them. The trees
around him grew higher and higher. Whichever
way he went, it was evident to him that he got
further and further into the forest.</p>

<p>It was like witchcraft and sorcery, he thought,
that he should be running about the woods like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
this all the evening and be too late for the bathing.
He turned his cap and rebound his garter, but his
head was no clearer. It had become quite dark,
and he began to think that he would have to remain
the whole night in the woods.</p>

<p>He leant against a tree, stood still for a little,
and tried to collect his thoughts. He knew this
forest so well, and had walked in it so much, that
he ought to know every single tree. As a boy he
had gone there and tended sheep. He had gone
there and laid snares for the birds. In his young
days he had helped to fell trees there. He had
seen old trees cut down and new ones grow up.
At last he thought he had an idea where he was,
and fancied if he went that and that way he must
come upon the right road; but all the same, he
only went deeper and deeper into the forest.</p>

<p>Once he felt smooth, firm ground under his
feet, and knew from that, that he had at last come
to some road. He tried now to follow this, for a
road, he thought, was bound to lead to some place
or other; but then the road ended at an open
space in the forest, and there the snowstorm had
it all its own way; there was neither road nor
path, only drifts and loose snow. Then the old
man's courage failed him; he felt like some poor
creature destined to die a lonely death in the
wilderness.</p>

<p>He began to grow tired of dragging himself
through the snow, and time after time he sat down
on a stone to rest; but as soon as he sat down
he felt he was on the point of falling asleep, and
he knew he would be frozen to death if he did fall
asleep, therefore he tried to walk and walk; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
was the only thing that could save him. But all
at once he could not resist the inclination to sit
down. He thought if he could only rest, it did
not matter if it did cost him his life.</p>

<p>It was so delightful to sit down that the thought
of death did not in the least frighten him. He felt
a kind of happiness at the thought that when he
was dead the account of his whole life would be
read aloud in the church. He thought of how
beautifully the old Dean had spoken about his
father, and how something equally beautiful
would be sure to be said about him. The Dean
would say that he had owned the oldest farm in
the district, and he would speak about the honour
it was to belong to such a distinguished family,
and then something would be said about responsibility.
Of course there was responsibility in the
matter; that he had always known. One must
endure to the very last when one was an Ingmar.</p>

<p>The thought rushed through him that it was
not befitting for him to be found frozen to death
in the wild forest. He would not have that handed
down to posterity; and he stood up again and
began to walk. He had been sitting so long that
masses of snow fell from his fur coat when he
moved. But soon he sat down again and began
to dream.</p>

<p>The thought of death now came quite gently to
him. He thought about the whole of the funeral
and all the honour they would show his dead
body. He could see the table laid for the great
funeral feast in the large room on the first floor,
the Dean and his wife in the seats of honour, the
Justice of the Peace, with the white frill spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
over his narrow chest; the Major's wife in full
dress, with a low silk bodice, and her neck covered
with pearls and gold; he saw all the best
rooms draped in white&mdash;white sheets before the
windows, white over the furniture; branches of
fir strewn the whole way from the entrance-hall to
the church; house-cleaning and butchering,
brewing and baking for a fortnight before the
funeral; the corpse on a bier in the inmost room;
smoke from the newly-lighted fires in the rooms;
the whole house crowded with guests; singing
over the body whilst the lid of the coffin was being
screwed on; silver plates on the coffin; twenty
loads of wood burned in a fortnight; the whole
village busy cooking food to take to the funeral;
all the tall hats newly ironed; all the corn-brandy
from the autumn drunk up during the funeral
feast; all the roads crowded with people as at fair-time.</p>

<p>Again the old man started up. He had heard
them sitting and talking about him during the
feast.</p>

<p>'But how did he manage to go and get frozen
to death?' asked the Justice of the Peace. 'What
could he have been doing in the large forest?'</p>

<p>And the Captain would say that it was probably
from Christmas ale and corn-brandy. And that
roused him again. The Ingmars had never been
drunkards. It should never be said of him that
he was muddled in his last moments. And he began
again to walk and walk; but he was so tired
that he could scarcely stand on his legs. It was
quite clear to him now that he had got far into
the forest, for there were no paths anywhere, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
many large rocks, of which he knew there were
none lower down. His foot caught between two
stones, so that he had difficulty in getting it out,
and he stood and moaned. He was quite done
for.</p>

<p>Suddenly he fell over a heap of fagots. He fell
softly on to the snow and branches, so he was not
hurt, but he did not take the trouble to get up
again. He had no other desire in the world than
to sleep. He pushed the fagots to one side and
crept under them as if they were a rug; but when
he pushed himself under the branches he felt that
underneath there was something warm and soft.
This must be a bear, he thought.</p>

<p>He felt the animal move, and heard it sniff; but
he lay still. The bear might eat him if it liked, he
thought. He had not strength enough to move a
single step to get out of its way.</p>

<p>But it seemed as if the bear did not want to
harm anyone who sought its protection on such a
night as this. It moved a little further into its lair,
as if to make room for its visitor, and directly
afterwards it slept again with even, snorting
breath.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the meantime there was but scanty Christmas
joy in the old farm of the Ingmars. The
whole of Christmas-eve they were looking for
Ingmar Ingmarson. First they went all over the
dwelling-house and all the outhouses. They
searched high and low, from loft to cellar. Then
they went to the neighbouring farms and inquired
for Ingmar Ingmarson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>As they did not find him, his sons and his sons-in-law
went into the fields and roads. They used
the torches which should have lighted the way for
people going to early service on Christmas morning
in the search for him. The terrible snowstorm
had hidden all traces, and the howling of the wind
drowned the sound of their voices when they
called and shouted. They were out and about
until long after midnight, but then they saw that
it was useless to continue the search, and that they
must wait until daylight to find the old man.</p>

<p>At the first pale streak of dawn everybody was
up at Ingmar's farm, and the men stood about the
yard ready to set out for the wood. But before
they started the old housewife came and called
them into the best room. She told them to sit
down on the long benches; she herself sat down
by the Christmas table with the Bible in front of
her and began to read. She tried her best to find
something suitable for the occasion, and chose
the story of the man who was travelling from
Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves.</p>

<p>She read slowly and monotonously about the
unfortunate man who was succoured by the good
Samaritan. Her sons and sons-in-law, her
daughters and daughters-in-law, sat around her
on the benches. They all resembled her and each
other, big and clumsy, with plain, old-fashioned
faces, for they all belonged to the old race of the
Ingmars. They had all reddish hair, freckled
skin, and light-blue eyes with white eyelashes.
They might be different enough from each other
in some ways, but they had all a stern look about
the mouth, dull eyes, and heavy movements, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
everything were a trouble to them. But one could
see that they all, every one of them, belonged to
the first people in the neighbourhood, and that
they knew themselves to be better than other
people.</p>

<p>All the sons and daughters of the house of Ingmar
sighed deeply during the reading of the Bible.
They wondered if some good Samaritan had
found the master of the house and taken care of
him, for all the Ingmars felt as if they had lost part
of their own soul when a misfortune happened to
anyone belonging to the family.</p>

<p>The old woman read and read, and came to the
question: 'Who was neighbour unto him that fell
amongst thieves?' But before she had read the
answer the door opened and old Ingmar came
into the room.</p>

<p>'Mother, here is father,' said one of the daughters;
and the answer, that the man's neighbour
was he who had shown mercy unto him, was
never read.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Later in the day the housewife sat again in the
same place, and read her Bible. She was alone;
the women had gone to church, and the men were
bear-hunting in the forest. As soon as Ingmar
Ingmarson had eaten and drunk, he took his sons
with him and went out to the forest; for it is every
man's duty to kill a bear wherever and whenever
he comes across one. It does not do to spare a
bear, for sooner or later it will get a taste for flesh,
and then it will spare neither man nor beast.</p>

<p>But after they were gone a great feeling of fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
came over the old housewife, and she began to
read her Bible. She read the lesson for the day,
which was also the text for the Pastor's sermon;
but she did not get further than this: 'Peace on
earth, goodwill towards men.' She remained sitting
and staring at these words with her dull eyes,
now and again sighing deeply. She did not read
any further, but she repeated time after time in
her slow, drawling voice, 'Peace on earth, goodwill
towards men.'</p>

<p>The eldest son came into the room just as she
was going to repeat the words afresh.</p>

<p>'Mother!' he said softly.</p>

<p>She heard him, but did not take her eyes from
the book whilst she asked:</p>

<p>'Are you not with the others in the forest?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said he, still more softly, 'I have been
there.'</p>

<p>'Come to the table,' she said, 'so that I can see
you.'</p>

<p>He came nearer, but when she looked at him
she saw that he was trembling. He had to press
his hands hard against the edge of the table in
order to keep them still.</p>

<p>'Have you got the bear?' she asked again.</p>

<p>He could not answer; he only shook his head.</p>

<p>The old woman got up and did what she had
not done since her son was a child. She went up
to him, laid her hand on his arm, and drew him
to the bench. She sat down beside him and took
his hand in hers.</p>

<p>'Tell me now what has happened, my boy.'</p>

<p>The young man recognised the caress which
had comforted him in bygone days when he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
been in trouble and unhappy, and he was so overcome
that he began to weep.</p>

<p>'I suppose it is something about father?' she
said.</p>

<p>'It is worse than that,' the son sobbed.
'Worse than that?'</p>

<p>The young man cried more and more violently;
he did not know how to control his voice. At last
he lifted his rough hand, with the broad fingers,
and pointed to what she had just read: 'Peace
on earth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.'</p>

<p>'Is it anything about that?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he answered.</p>

<p>'Is it anything about the peace of Christmas?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'You wished to do an evil deed this morning?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'And God has punished us?'</p>

<p>'God has punished us.'</p>

<p>So at last she was told how it had happened.
They had with some trouble found the lair of the
bear, and when they had got near enough to see
the heap of fagots, they stopped in order to load
their guns. But before they were ready the bear
rushed out of its lair straight against them. It
went neither to the right nor to the left, but
straight for old Ingmar Ingmarson, and struck
him a blow on the top of the head that felled him
to the ground as if he had been struck by lightning.
It did not attack any of the others, but
rushed past them into the forest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the afternoon Ingmar Ingmarson's wife and
son drove to the Dean's house to announce his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
death. The son was spokesman, and the old
housewife sat and listened with a face as immovable
as a stone figure.</p>

<p>The Dean sat in his easy-chair near his writing-table.
He had entered the death in the register.
He had done it rather slowly; he wanted time to
consider what he should say to the widow and the
son, for this was, indeed, an unusual case. The
son had frankly told him how it had all happened,
but the Dean was anxious to know how they
themselves looked at it. They were peculiar people,
the Ingmars.</p>

<p>When the Dean had closed the book, the son
said:</p>

<p>'We wanted to tell you, sir, that we do not wish
any account of father's life to be read in church.'</p>

<p>The Dean pushed his spectacles over his forehead
and looked searchingly at the old woman.
She sat just as immovable as before. She only
crumpled the handkerchief a little which she
held in her hand.</p>

<p>'We wish to have him buried on a week day,'
continued the son.</p>

<p>'Indeed!' said the Dean.</p>

<p>He could hardly believe his own ears. Old
Ingmar Ingmarson to be buried without anyone
taking any notice of it! The congregation not to
stand on railings and mounds in order to see the
display when he was being carried to the grave!</p>

<p>'There will not be any funeral feast. We have
let the neighbours know that they need not think
of preparing anything for the funeral.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, indeed!' said the Dean again.</p>

<p>He could think of nothing else to say. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
knew quite well what it meant for such people to
forego the funeral feast. He had seen both widows
and fatherless comforted by giving a splendid
funeral feast.</p>

<p>'There will be no funeral procession, only I and
my brothers.'</p>

<p>The Dean looked almost appealingly at the old
woman. Could she really be a party to all this?
He asked himself if it could be her wishes to which
the son had given expression. She was sitting
there and allowing herself to be robbed of what
must be dearer to her than gold and silver.</p>

<p>'We will not have the bells rung, or any silver
plates on the coffin. Mother and I wish it to be
done in this way, but we tell you all this, sir, in
order to hear, sir, if you think we are wronging
father.'</p>

<p>Now the old woman spoke:</p>

<p>'We should like to hear if your Reverence
thinks we are doing father a wrong.'</p>

<p>The Dean remained silent, and the old woman
continued, more eagerly:</p>

<p>'I must tell your Reverence that if my husband
had sinned against the King or the authorities, or
if I had been obliged to cut him down from the
gallows, he should all the same have had an honourable
funeral, as his father before him, for the
Ingmars are not afraid of anyone, and they need
not go out of their way for anybody. But at
Christmas God has made peace between man and
beast, and the poor beast kept God's commandment,
whilst we broke it, and therefore we now
suffer God's punishment; and it is not becoming
for us to show any ostentatious display.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dean rose and went up to the old woman.</p>

<p>'What you say is right,' he said, 'and you shall
follow the dictates of your own conscience.' And
involuntarily he added, perhaps most to himself:
'The Ingmars are a grand family.'</p>

<p>The old woman straightened herself a little at
these words. At that moment the Dean saw in
her the symbol of her whole race. He understood
what it was that had made these heavy, silent people,
century after century, the leaders of the whole
parish.</p>

<p>'It behooves the Ingmars to set the people a
good example,' she said. 'It behooves us to show
that we humble ourselves before God.'</p>

<p class="story_head"><span class="dec_italic">A</span> <span class="smcap">Story</span> <span class="dec_italic">from</span> <span class="smcap">Halstan&auml;s</span></p>

<p>In olden times there stood by the roadside an
old country-house called Halstan&auml;s. It comprised
a long row of red-painted houses,
which were of low structure, and right behind
them lay the forest. Close to the dwelling-house
was a large wild cherry-tree, which showered its
black fruit over the red-tiled roof. A bell under a
small belfry hung over the gable of the stables.</p>

<p>Just outside the kitchen-door was a dovecote,
with a neat little trelliswork outside the holes.
From the attic a cage for squirrels was hanging;
it consisted of two small green houses and a
large wheel, and in front of a big hedge of lilacs
stood a long row of beehives covered with bark.</p>

<p>There was a pond belonging to the farm, full of
fat carp and slim water-snakes; there was also a
kennel at the entrance; there were white gates at
the end of the avenue, and at the garden walks,
and in every place where they could possibly have
a gate. There were big lofts with dark lumber-rooms,
where old-fashioned uniforms and ladies'
head-gear a hundred years old were stored away;
there were large chests full of silk gowns and
bridal finery; there were old pianos and violins,
guitars and bassoons. In bureaus and cabinets
were manuscript songs and old yellow letters; on
the walls of the entrance-hall hung guns, pistols
and hunting-bags; on the floor were rugs, in
which patches of old silken gowns were woven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
together with pieces of threadbare cotton curtains.
There was a large porch, where the deadly nightshade
summer after summer grew up a thin
trelliswork; there were large, yellow front-doors,
which were fastened with bolts and catches; the
hall was strewn with sprigs of juniper, and the
windows had small panes and heavy wooden
shutters.</p>

<p>One summer old Colonel Beerencreutz came on
a visit to this house. It is supposed to have been
the very year after he left Ekeby. At that time he
had taken rooms at a farm at Svartsj&ouml;, and it was
only on rare occasions that he went visiting. He
still had his horse and gig, but he scarcely ever
used them. He said that he had grown old in
earnest now, and that home was the best place for
old people.</p>

<p>Beerencreutz was also loath to leave the work
he had in hand. He was weaving rugs for his two
rooms&mdash;large, many-coloured rugs in a rich and
strangely-thought-out pattern. It took him an
endless time, because he had his own way of weaving,
for he used no loom, but stretched his wool
from the one wall to the other right across the one
room. He did this in order to see the whole rug
at one time; but to cross the woof and afterwards
bring the threads together to a firm web was no
easy matter. And then there was the pattern,
which he himself thought out, and the colours
which should match. This took the Colonel more
time than anyone would have imagined; for whilst
Beerencreutz was busy getting the pattern right,
and whilst he was working with warp and woof, he
often sat and thought of God. Our Lord, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
thought, was likewise sitting at a loom, still
larger, and with an even more peculiar pattern to
weave. And he knew that there must be both
light and dark shades in that weaving. But Beerencreutz
would at times sit and think so long
about this, until he fancied he saw before him his
own life and the life of the people whom he had
known, and with whom he had lived, forming a
small portion of God's great weaving; and he
seemed to see that piece so distinctly that he could
discern both outlines and colouring. And if one
asked Beerencreutz what the pattern in his work
really meant, he would be obliged to confess that
it was the life of himself and his friends which he
wove into the rug as a faint imitation of what he
thought he had seen represented on God's loom.</p>

<p>The Colonel, however, was accustomed to pay
a little visit to some old friends every year just
after midsummer. He had always liked best to
travel through the country when the fields were
still scented with clover, and blue and yellow flowers
grew along the roadside in two long straight
rows.</p>

<p>This year the Colonel had hardly got to the
great highroad before he met his old friend Ensign
von &Ouml;rneclou. And the Ensign, who was
travelling about all the year round, and who knew
all the country houses in V&auml;rmland, gave him
some good advice.</p>

<p>'Go to Halstan&auml;s and call upon Ensign Vestblad,'
he said to the Colonel. 'I can only tell you,
old man, I don't know a house in the whole country
where one fares better.'</p>

<p>'What Vestblad are you speaking about?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
asked the Colonel. 'I suppose you don't mean
the old Ensign whom the Major's wife showed
the door?'</p>

<p>'The very man,' said the Ensign. 'But Vestblad
is not the same man he was. He has married
a fine lady&mdash;a real stunning woman, Colonel&mdash;who
has made a man of him. It was a wonderful
piece of good luck for Vestblad that such a splendid
girl should take a fancy to him. She was not
exactly young any longer; but no more was he.
You should go to Halstan&auml;s, Colonel, and see
what wonders love can work.'</p>

<p>And the Colonel went to Halstan&auml;s to see if
&Ouml;rneclou spoke the truth. He had, as a matter
of fact, now and then wondered what had become
of Vestblad; in his young days he had kicked so
recklessly over the traces that even the Major's
wife at Ekeby could not put up with him. She
had not been able to keep him at Ekeby more than
a couple of years before she was obliged to turn
him out. Vestblad had become such a heavy
drinker that a Cavalier could hardly associate with
him. And now &Ouml;rneclou declared that he owned
a country house, and had made an excellent
match.</p>

<p>The Colonel consequently went to Halstan&auml;s,
and saw at the first glance that it was a real old
country-seat. He had only to look at the avenue
of birches with all the names cut on the fine old
trees. Such birches he had only seen at good old
country-houses. The Colonel drove slowly up to
the house, and every moment his pleasure increased.
He saw lime hedges of the proper kind,
so close that one could walk on the top of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
and there were a couple of terraces with stone
steps so old that they were half buried in the
ground. When the Colonel drove past the pond,
he saw indistinctly the dark carp in the yellowish
water. The pigeons flew up from the road flapping
their wings; the squirrel stopped its wheel;
the watch-dog lay with its head on its paws, wagging
its tail, and at the same time faintly growling.
Close to the porch the Colonel saw an ant-hill,
where the ants, unmolested, went to and fro&mdash;to
and fro. He looked at the flower-beds inside
the grass border. There they grew, all the old
flowers: narcissus and pyrola, sempervivum and
marigold; and on the bank grew small white
daisies, which had been there so long that they
now sowed themselves like weeds. Beerencreutz
again said to himself that this was indeed a real
old country-house, where both plants and animals
and human beings throve as well as could be.</p>

<p>When at last he drove up to the front-door he
had as good a reception as he could wish for, and
as soon as he had brushed the dust off him he was
taken to the dining-room, and he was offered
plenty of good old-fashioned food&mdash;the same old
cakes for dessert that his mother used to give him
when he came home from school; and any so
good he had never tasted elsewhere.</p>

<p>Beerencreutz looked with surprise at Ensign
Vestblad. He went about quiet and content, with
a long pipe in his mouth and a skull-cap on his
head. He wore an old morning-coat, which he
had difficulty in getting out of when it was time
to dress for dinner. That was the only sign of the
Bohemian left, as far as Beerencreutz could see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
He went about and looked after his men, calculated
their wages, saw how things were getting on
in the fields and meadows, gathered a rose for his
wife when he went through the garden, and he indulged
no longer in either swearing or spitting.
But what astonished the Colonel most of all was
the discovery that old Ensign Vestblad kept his
books. He took the Colonel into his office and
showed him large books with red backs. And
those he kept himself. He had lined them with
red ink and black ink, written the headings with
large letters, and put down everything, even to a
stamp.</p>

<p>But Ensign Vestblad's wife, who was a born
lady, called Beerencreutz cousin, and they soon
found out the relationship between them; and
they talked all their relatives over. At last Beerencreutz
became so intimate with Mrs. Vestblad
that he consulted her about the rug he was weaving.</p>

<p>It was a matter of course that the Colonel
should stay the night. He was taken to the best
spare room to the right of the hall and close to his
host's bedroom, and his bed was a large four-poster,
with heaps of eiderdowns.</p>

<p>The Colonel fell asleep as soon as he got into
bed, but awoke later on in the night. He immediately
got out of bed and went and opened the
window-shutters. He had a view over the garden,
and in the light summer night he could see all the
gnarled old apple-trees, with their worm-eaten
leaves, and with numerous props under the decayed
branches. He saw the large wild apple-tree,
which in the autumn would give barrels of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
uneatable fruit; he saw the strawberries, which
had just begun to ripen under their profusion of
green leaves.</p>

<p>The Colonel stood and looked at it as if he
could not afford to waste his time in sleeping.
Outside his window at the peasant farm where he
lived all he could see was a stony hill and a couple
of juniper-bushes; and it was natural that a man
like Beerencreutz should feel more at home
amongst well-trimmed hedges and roses in
bloom.</p>

<p>When in the quiet stillness of the night one
looks out upon a garden, one often has a feeling
that it is not real and natural. It can be so still
that one can almost fancy one's self in the theatre;
one imagines that the trees are painted and the
roses made of paper. And it was something like
this the Colonel felt as he stood there. 'It cannot
be possible,' he thought, 'that all this is real.
It can only be a dream.' But then a few rose-leaves
fell softly to the ground from the big rose-tree
just outside his window, and then he realized
that everything was genuine. Everything was
real and genuine; both day and night the same
peace and contentment everywhere.</p>

<p>When he went and laid down again he left the
window-shutters open. He lay in the high bed
and looked time after time at the rose-tree; it is
impossible to describe his pleasure in looking at
it. He thought what a strange thing it was that
such a man as Vestblad should have this flower of
Paradise outside his window.</p>

<p>The more the Colonel thought of Vestblad the
more surprised he became that such a foal should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
end his days in such a stable. He was not good
for much at the time he was turned away from
Ekeby. Who would have thought he would have
become a staid and well-to-do man?</p>

<p>The Colonel lay and laughed to himself, and
wondered whether Vestblad still remembered
how he used to amuse himself in the olden days
when he was living at Ekeby. On dark and
stormy nights he used to rub himself over with
phosphorus, mount a black horse, and ride over
the hills to the ironworks, where the smiths and
the workmen lived; and if anyone happened to
look out of his window and saw a horseman shining
with a bluish-white light tearing past, he
hastened to bar and bolt everywhere, saying it
was best to say one's prayers twice that night,
for the devil was abroad.</p>

<p>Oh yes, to frighten simple folks by such tricks
was a favourite amusement in olden days; but
Vestblad had carried his jokes further than anyone
else the Colonel knew of.</p>

<p>An old woman on the parish had died at Viksta,
which belonged to Ekeby. Vestblad happened to
hear about this. He also heard that the corpse
had been taken from the house and placed in a
barn. At night Vestblad put on his fiery array,
mounted his black horse, and rode to the farmstead;
and people there who were about had seen
a fiery horseman ride up to the barn, where the
corpse lay, ride three times round it and disappear
through the door. They had also seen the horseman
come out again, ride three times round the
house and then disappear. But in the morning,
when they went into the barn to see the corpse, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
was gone, and they thought the devil had been
there and carried her off. This supposition had
been enough for them. But a couple of weeks
later they found the body, which had been thrown
on to a hay-loft in the barn, and then there was a
great outcry. They found out who the fiery
horseman was, and the peasants were on the
watch to give Vestblad a good hiding. But the
Major's wife would not have him at her table or
in her house any longer; she packed his knapsack
and asked him to betake himself elsewhere. And
Vestblad went out into the world and made his
fortune.</p>

<p>A strange feeling of uneasiness came over the
Colonel as he lay in bed. He felt as if something
were going to happen. He had hardly realized
before what an ugly story it was. He had no
doubt even laughed at it at the time. They had
not been in the habit of taking much notice of
what happened to a poor old pauper in those
days; but, great God! how furious one would
have been if anybody had done that to one's own
mother!</p>

<p>A suffocating feeling came over the Colonel;
he breathed heavily. The thought of what Vestblad
had done appeared so vile and hateful to him,
it weighed him down like a nightmare. He was
half afraid of seeing the dead woman, of seeing
her appear from behind the bed. He felt as if she
must be quite near. And from the four corners of
the room the Colonel heard terrible words: 'God
will not forgive it! God has never forgotten it!'</p>

<p>The Colonel closed his eyes, but then he suddenly
saw before him God's great loom, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
the web was woven with the fates of men; and he
thought he saw Ensign Vestblad's square, and it
was dark on three sides; and he, who understood
something about weaving and patterns, knew that
the fourth side would also have to be covered with
the dark shade. It could not be done in any other
way, otherwise there would be a mistake in the
weaving.</p>

<p>A cold sweat broke out on his forehead; it
seemed to him that he looked upon what was the
hardest and the most immovable in all the world.
He saw how the fate which a man has worked out
in his past life will pursue him to the end. And to
think there were actually people who thought they
could escape it!</p>

<p>Escape it! escape! All was noted and written
down; the one colour and the one figure necessitated
the other, and everything came about as it
was bound to come about.</p>

<p>Suddenly Colonel Beerencreutz sat up in bed;
he would look at the flowers and the roses, and
think that perhaps our Lord could forget after
all. But at the moment Beerencreutz sat up in
bed the bedroom door opened, and one of the
farm-labourers&mdash;a stranger to him&mdash;put his head
in and nodded to the Colonel.</p>

<p>It was now so light that the Colonel saw the
man quite distinctly. It was the most hideous
face he had ever seen. He had small gray eyes
like a pig, a flat nose, and a thin, bristly beard.
One could not say that the man looked like an
animal, for animals have nearly always good
faces, but still, he had something of the animal
about him. His lower jaw projected, his neck was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
thick, and his forehead was quite hidden by his
rough, unkempt hair.</p>

<p>He nodded three times to the Colonel, and
every time his mouth opened with a broad grin;
and he put out his hand, red with blood, and
showed it triumphantly. Up to this moment the
Colonel had sat up in bed as if paralyzed, but now
he jumped up and was at the door in two steps.
But when he reached the door, the fellow was
gone and the door closed.</p>

<p>The Colonel was just on the point of raising the
alarm, when it struck him that the door must be
fastened on the inside, on his side, as he had himself
locked it the night before; and on examining
it, he found that it had not been unlocked.</p>

<p>The Colonel felt almost ashamed to think that
in his old age he had begun to see ghosts. He
went straight back to bed again.</p>

<p>When the morning came, and he had breakfasted,
the Colonel felt still more ashamed. He
had excited himself to such an extent that he had
trembled all over and perspired from fear. He
said not a word about it. But later on in the
day he and Vestblad went over the estate. As
they passed a labourer who was cutting sods on a
bank Beerencreutz recognised him again. It was
the man he had seen in the night. He recognised
feature for feature.</p>

<p>'I would not keep that man a day longer in my
service, my friend,' said Beerencreutz, when they
had walked a short distance. And he told Vestblad
what he had seen in the night. 'I tell you
this simply to warn you, in order that you may
dismiss the man.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>But Vestblad would not; he was just the man
he would not dismiss. And when Beerencreutz
pressed him more and more, he at last confessed
that he would not do anything to the man, because
he was the son of an old pauper woman who had
died at Viksta close to Ekeby.</p>

<p>'You no doubt remember the story?' he added.</p>

<p>'If that's the case, I would rather go to the end
of the world than live another day with that man
about the place,' said Beerencreutz. An hour
after he left, and was almost angry that his warning
was not heeded. 'Some misfortune will happen
before I come here again,' said the Colonel to
Vestblad, as he took leave.</p>

<p>Next year, at the same time, the Colonel was
preparing for another visit to Halstan&auml;s. But before
he got so far, he heard some sad news about
his friends. As the clock struck one, a year after
the very night he had slept there, Ensign Vestblad
and his wife had been murdered in their bedroom
by one of their labourers&mdash;a man with a neck like
a bull, a flat nose, and eyes like a pig.</p>

<p class="story_head"><span class="dec_italic">The</span> <span class="smcap">Inscription</span> <span class="dec_italic">on the</span> <span class="smcap">Grave</span></p>

<p>Nowadays no one ever takes any notice
of the little cross standing in the corner
of Svartsj&ouml; Churchyard. People on their
way to and from church go past it without giving
it a glance. This is not so very wonderful, because
it is so low and small that clover and
bluebells grow right up to the arms of the cross,
and timothy-grass to the very top of it. Neither
does anyone think of reading the inscription
which stands on the cross. The white letters are
almost entirely washed out by the rain, and it
never occurs to anyone to try and decipher what
is still left, and try to make it out. But so it has
not always been. The little cross in its time has
been the cause of much surprise and curiosity.
There was a time when not a person put his foot
inside Svartsj&ouml; Churchyard without going up to
look at it. And when one of the old people from
those days now happens to see it, a whole story
comes back to him of people and events that have
been long forgotten. He sees before him the
whole of Svartsj&ouml; parish in the lethargic sleep of
winter, covered by even white snow, quite a yard
deep, so that it is impossible to discern road or
pathway, or to know where one is going. It is
almost as necessary to have a compass here as
at sea. There is no difference between sea and
shore. The roughest ground is as even as the
field which in the autumn yielded such a harvest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
of oats. The charcoal-burner living near the
great bogs might imagine himself possessed of as
much cultivated land as the richest peasant.</p>

<p>The roads have left their secure course between
the gray fences, and are running at random
across the meadows and along the river. Even
on one's own farm one may lose one's way, and
suddenly discover that on one's way to the well
one has walked over the spirea-hedge and round
the little rose-bed.</p>

<p>But nowhere is it so impossible to find one's
way as in the churchyard. In the first place, the
stone wall which separates it from the pastor's
field is entirely buried under the snow, so with
that it is all one; and secondly, the churchyard
itself is only a simple large, white plain, where
not even the smallest unevenness in the snow-cover
betrays the many small mounds and tufts
of the garden of the dead.</p>

<p>On most of the graves are iron crosses, from
which hang small, thin hearts of tin, which the
summer wind sets in motion. These little hearts
are now all hidden under the snow, and cannot
tinkle their sad songs of sorrow and longing.</p>

<p>People who work in the towns have brought
back with them to their dead wreaths with flowers
of beads and leaves of painted tin; and these
wreaths are so highly treasured that they are kept
in small glass cases on the graves. But now all
this is hidden and buried under the snow, and the
grave that possesses such an ornament is in no
way more remarkable than any of the other
graves.</p>

<p>One or two lilac bushes raise their heads above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
the snow-cover, but their little stiff branches look
so alike, that it is impossible to tell one from the
other, and they are of no use whatever to anyone
trying to find his way in the churchyard. Old
women who are in the habit of going on Sundays
to visit their graves can only get a little way down
the main walk on account of the snow. There
they stand, trying to make out where their own
grave lies&mdash;is it near that bush, or that?&mdash;and
they begin to long for the snow to melt. It is
as if the one for whom they are sorrowing has
gone so far away from them, now that they cannot
see the spot where he lies.</p>

<p>There are also a few large gravestones and
crosses that are higher than the snow, but they
are not many; and as these are also covered with
snow, they cannot be distinguished either.</p>

<p>There is only one pathway kept clear in the
churchyard. It is the one leading from the entrance
to the small mortuary. When anyone is
to be buried the coffin is carried into the mortuary,
and there the pastor reads the service and
casts the earth upon the coffin. It is impossible
to place the coffin in the ground as long as such
a winter lasts. It must remain standing in the
mortuary until God sees fit to thaw the earth,
and the ground can be digged and made ready.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Just when the winter was at its hardest, and the
churchyard quite inaccessible, a child died at
Sander's, the ironmaster at Lerum ironworks.</p>

<p>The ironworks at Lerum were large, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Sander, the ironmaster, was a great man in that
part of the country. He had recently had a family
grave made in the churchyard&mdash;a splendid grave,
the position of which one could not easily forget,
although the snow had laid its <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original has thinck">thick</span> carpet over
it. It was surrounded by heavy, hewn stones,
with a massive chain between them, and in the
middle of the grave stood a huge granite block,
with their name inscribed upon it. There was
only the one word 'Sander,' engraved in large
letters, but it could be seen over the whole churchyard.
But now that the child was dead, and was
to be buried, the ironmaster said to his wife:</p>

<p>'I will not allow this child to lie in my grave.'</p>

<p>One can picture them both at that moment. It
was in their dining-room at Lerum. The ironmaster
was sitting at the breakfast-table alone,
as was his wont. His wife, Ebba Sander, was sitting
in a rocking-chair at the window, from where
she had a wide view of the lake, with its small
islands covered with birches.</p>

<p>She had been weeping, but when her husband
said this, her eyes became immediately dry. Her
little figure seemed to shrink from fear, and she
began to tremble.</p>

<p>'What do you say? What are you saying?'
she asked, and her voice sounded as if she were
shivering from cold.</p>

<p>'I object to it,' he said. 'My father and my
mother lie there, and the name "Sander" stands
on the stone. I will not allow that child to lie
there.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' she said, still trembling, 'is that what
you have been thinking about? I always did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
think that some day you would have your revenge.'</p>

<p>He threw down his serviette, rose from the
table, and stood before her, broad and big. It
was not his intention to assert his will with many
words, but she could see, as he stood there, that
nothing could make him change his mind. Stern,
immovable, obstinate he was from top to toe.</p>

<p>'I will not revenge myself,' he said, 'only I
will not have it.'</p>

<p>'You speak as if it were only a question of
removing him from one bed to the other,' she
said. 'He is dead. It does not matter to him
where he lies, I suppose; but for me it is ruin,
you know.'</p>

<p>'I have also thought of that,' he said, 'but I
cannot.'</p>

<p>When two people have been married, and have
lived together for some years, they do not require
many words to understand one another. She
knew it would be quite useless to try and move
him.</p>

<p>'Why did you forgive me, then?' she said,
wringing her hands. 'Why did you let me stay
with you as your wife and promise to forgive
me?'</p>

<p>He knew that he would not do her any harm.
It was not his fault that he had now reached the
limit of his forbearance.</p>

<p>'Say to people what you like,' he said; 'I
shall not say anything. You can say, if you like,
that there is water in the vault, or that there is
only room for father and mother and you and
me.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>'And you imagine that they will believe that!'</p>

<p>'Well, you must manage that as best you can.'</p>

<p>He was not angry; she knew that he was not.
It was only as he said: on that point he could not
give way.</p>

<p>She went further into the room, put her hands
at the back of her head, and sat gazing out of the
window without saying anything. The terrible
thing is that so much happens to one in life over
which one has no control, and, above all, that
something may spring up within one's self over
which one is entirely powerless. Some years ago,
when she was already a staid married woman,
love came to her; and what a love&mdash;so violent that
it was quite impossible for her to resist.</p>

<p>Was not the feeling which now mastered her
husband&mdash;was not that, after all, a desire to be
revenged?</p>

<p>He had never been angry with her. He forgave
her at once when she came and confessed
her sin.</p>

<p>'You have been out of your senses,' he said,
and allowed her to remain with him at Lerum as
if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>But although it is easy enough to say one forgives,
it may be hard to do so, especially for one
whose mind is slow and heavy, who ponders over
but never forgets or gives vent to his feelings.
Whatever he may say, and however much he may
have made up his mind, something is always left
within his heart which gnaws and longs to be satisfied
with someone else's suffering. She had
always had a strange feeling that it would have
been better for her if he had been so enraged that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
he had struck her. Then, perhaps, things could
have come right between them. All these years
he had been morose and irritable, and she had become
frightened. She was like a horse between
the traces. She knew that behind her was one
who held a whip over her, even if he did not use
it; and now he had used it. He had not been
able to refrain any longer. And now it was all
over with her.</p>

<p>Those who were about her said they had never
seen such sorrow as hers. She seemed to be petrified.
The whole time before the funeral it was
as if there were no real life in her. One could not
tell if she heard what was said to her, if she had
any idea who was speaking to her. She did not
eat; it was as if she felt no hunger. She went
out in the bitterest cold; she did not feel it. But
it was not grief that petrified her&mdash;it was fear.</p>

<p>It never struck her for a moment to stay at
home on the day of the funeral. She must go to
the churchyard, she must walk in the funeral procession&mdash;must
go there, feeling that all who were
present expected that the body would be laid in
the family vault of the Sanders. She thought
she would sink into the ground at all the surprise
and scorn which would rise up against her when
the grave-digger, who headed the procession, led
the way to an out-of-the-way grave. An outburst
of astonishment would be heard from everybody,
although it was a funeral procession:
'Why is the child not going to be buried in the
Sanders' family vault?' Thoughts would go back
to the vague rumours which were once circulated
about her. 'There must have been something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
in them, after all,' people will whisper to each
other. And before the mourners left the churchyard
she would be condemned and lost. The only
thing for her to do was to be present herself. She
would go there with a quiet face, as if everything
was as it ought to be. Then, perhaps, they might
believe what she said to explain the matter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Her husband went with her to the church; he
had looked after everything, invited people, ordered
the coffin, and arranged who should be the
bearers. He was kind and good now that he had
got his own way.</p>

<p>It was on a Sunday. The service was over, and
the mourners had assembled outside the porch,
where the coffin was standing. The bearers had
placed the white bands over their shoulders; all
people of any position had joined in the procession,
as did also many of the congregation. She
had a feeling as if they had all gathered together
in order to accompany a criminal to the scaffold.</p>

<p>How they would all look at her when they came
back from the funeral! She was there to prepare
them for what was to happen, but she had not
been able to utter a single word. She felt quite
unable to speak quietly and sensibly. There was
only one thing she wanted: to scream and moan
so violently and loudly that it could be heard all
over the churchyard; and she had to bite her lips
so as not to cry out.</p>

<p>The bells commenced to ring in the tower, and
the procession began to move. Now all these
people would find it out without the slightest
preparation. Oh, why had she not spoken in
time? She had to restrain herself to the utmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
from shouting out and telling them that they must
not go to the grave with the dead child. Those
who are dead are dead and gone. Why should
her whole life be spoiled for the sake of this dead
child? They could put him in the earth, where
they liked, only not in the churchyard. She had
a confused idea that she would frighten them
away from the churchyard; it was risky to go
there; it was plague-smitten; there were marks
of a wolf in the snow; she would frighten them
as one frightens children.</p>

<p>She did not know where they had digged the
child's grave. She would know soon enough, she
thought; and when the procession entered the
churchyard, she glanced around the snow-covered
ground to see where there was a new
grave; but she saw neither path nor grave&mdash;nothing
but the white snow. And the procession
advanced towards the small mortuary. As many
as possibly could pressed into the building and
saw the earth cast on to the coffin. There was no
question whatever about this or that grave. No
one found out that the little one which was now
laid to rest was never to be taken to the family
vault.</p>

<p>Had she but thought of that, had she not forgotten
everything else in her fear and terror, then
she need not have been afraid, not for a single
moment.</p>

<p>'In the spring,' she thought, 'when the coffin
has to be placed in the ground, there will probably
be no one there except the grave-digger; everybody
will think that the child is lying in the
Sanders' vault.' And she felt that she was saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>She sank down sobbing violently. People
looked at her with sympathy. 'How terribly she
felt it!' they said. But she herself knew that she
cried like one who has escaped from a mortal
danger.</p>

<p>A day or two after the funeral she was sitting
in the twilight in her accustomed place in the
dining-room, and as it grew darker she caught
herself waiting and longing. She sat and listened
for the child; that was the time when he always
used to come in and play with her. Why did
he not come that day? Then she started. 'Oh,
he is dead, he is dead!'</p>

<p>The next day she sat again in the twilight, and
longed for him, and day by day this longing grew.
It grew as the light does in the springtime, until
at last it filled all the hours both of day and night.</p>

<p>It almost goes without saying that a child like
hers was more loved after death than whilst it
was living. While it was living its mother had
thought of nothing but regaining the trust and
the love of her husband. And for him the child
could never be a source of happiness. It was necessary
to keep it away from him as much as
possible; and the child had often felt he was in
the way.</p>

<p>She, who had failed in and neglected her duty,
would show her husband that she was worth
something after all. She was always about in the
kitchen and in the weaving-room. Where could
there be any room, then, for the little boy?</p>

<p>But now, afterwards, she remembered how his
eyes could beg and beseech. In the evening he
liked so much to have her sitting at his bedside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>.
He said he was afraid to lie in the dark; but now
it struck her that that had probably only been
an excuse to get her to stay with him. She remembered
how he lay and tried not to fall asleep.
Now she knew that he kept himself awake in
order that he might lie a little longer and feel his
hand in hers. He had been a shrewd little fellow,
young as he was. He had exerted all his little
brain to find out how he could get a little share
of her love. It is incomprehensible that children
can love so deeply. She never understood it
whilst he was alive.</p>

<p>It was really first now that she had begun to
love the child. It was first now that she was
really impressed by his beauty. She would sit
and dream of his big, strange eyes. He had never
been robust and ruddy like most children, but
delicate and slender. But how sweet he had been!
He seemed to her now as something wonderfully
beautiful&mdash;more and more beautiful for every day
that went. Children were indeed the best of all
in this world. To think that there were little
beings stretching out their hands to everybody,
and thinking good of all; that never ask if a face
be plain or pretty, but are equally willing to kiss
either, loving equally old and young, rich and
poor. And yet they were real little people.</p>

<p>For every day that went she was drawn nearer
and nearer to the child. She wished that the
child had been still alive; but, on the other hand,
she was not sure that in that case she would have
been drawn so near to it. At times she was quite
in despair at the thought that she had not done
more for the child whilst he was alive. That was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
probably why he had been taken from her, she
thought.</p>

<p>But it was not often that she sorrowed like this.
Earlier in life she had always been afraid lest some
great sorrow should overtake her, but now it
seemed to her that sorrow was not what she had
then thought it to be. Sorrow was only to live
over and over again through something which
was no more. Sorrow in her case was to become
familiar with her child's whole being, and to seek
to understand him. And that sorrow had made
her life so rich.</p>

<p>What she was most afraid of now was that time
would take him from her and wipe out the memory
of him. She had no picture of him; perhaps
his features little by little would fade for her. She
sat every day and tried to think how he looked.
'Do I see him exactly as he was?' she said.</p>

<p>Week by week, as the winter wore away, she
began to long for the time when he would be
taken from the mortuary and buried in the
ground, so that she could go to his grave and
speak with him. He should lie towards the west,
that was the most beautiful, and she would deck
the grave with roses. There should also be a
hedge round the grave, and a seat where she could
sit often and often. People would perhaps wonder
at it; but they were not to know that her
child did not lie in the family grave; and they
were sure to think it strange that she placed flowers
on an unknown grave and sat there for hours.
What could she say to explain it?</p>

<p>Sometimes she thought that she could, perhaps,
do it in this way: First she would go to the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
grave and place a large bouquet of flowers on
it, and remain sitting there for some time, and
afterwards she would steal away to the little
grave; and he would be sure to be content with
the little flower she would secretly give him. But
even if he were satisfied with the one little flower,
could she be? Could she really come quite near
to him in this way? Would he not notice that
she was ashamed of him? Would he not understand
what a disgrace his birth had been to her?
No, she would have to protect him from that. He
must only think that the joy of having possessed
him weighed against all the rest.</p>

<p>At last the winter was giving way. One could
see the spring was coming. The snow-cover began
to melt, and the earth to peep out. It would
still be a week or two before the ground was
thawed, but it would not be long now before the
dead could be taken away from the mortuary.
And she longed&mdash;she longed so exceedingly
for it.</p>

<p>Could she still picture to herself how he
looked? She tried every day; but it was easier
when it was winter. Now, when the spring was
coming, it seemed as if he faded away from her.
She was filled with despair. If she were only soon
able to sit by his grave and be near to him
again, then she would be able to see him again,
to love him. Would he never be laid in his little
grave? She must be able to see him again, see
him through her whole life; she had no one else
to love.</p>

<p>At last all her fears and scruples vanished before
this great longing. She loved, she loved;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
she could not live without the dead! She knew
now that she could not consider anybody or anything
but him&mdash;him alone. And when the spring
came in earnest, when mounds and graves once
again appeared all over the churchyard, when the
little hearts of the iron crosses again began to
tinkle in the wind, and the beaded wreaths to
sparkle in their glass cases, and when the earth
at last was ready to receive the little coffin, she
had ready a black cross to place on his grave.
On the cross from arm to arm was written in plain
white letters,</p>

<p class="quote">
'HERE RESTS MY CHILD,'<br />
</p>

<p>and underneath, on the stem of the cross, stood
her name.</p>

<p>She did not mind that the whole world would
know how she had sinned. Other things were
of no consequence to her; all she thought about
was that she would now be able to pray at the
grave of her child.</p>

<p class="story_head"><span class="dec_italic">The</span> <span class="smcap">Brothers</span></p>

<p>It is very possible that I am mistaken, but it
seems to me that an astonishing number of
people die this year. I have a feeling that
I cannot go down the street without meeting a
hearse. One cannot help thinking about all those
who are carried to the churchyard. I always feel
as if it were so sad for the dead who have to be
buried in towns. I can hear how they moan in
their coffins. Some complain that they have not
had plumes on the hearse; some count up the
wreaths, and are not satisfied; and then there are
some who have only been followed by two or
three carriages, and who are hurt by it.</p>

<p>The dead ought never to know and experience
such things; but people in towns do not at all
understand how they ought to honour those who
have entered into eternal rest.</p>

<p>When I really think over it I do not know any
place where they understand it better than at
home in Svartsj&ouml;. If you die in the parish of
Svartsj&ouml; you know you will have a coffin like that
of everyone else&mdash;an honest black coffin which is
like the coffins in which the country judge and
the local magistrate were buried a year or two
ago. For the same joiner makes all the coffins,
and he has only one pattern; the one is made
neither better nor worse than the other. And you
know also, for you have seen it so many times,
that you will be carried to the church on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
waggon which has been painted black for the
occasion. You need not trouble yourself at all
about any plumes. And you know that the whole
village will follow you to the church, and that
they will drive as slowly and as solemnly for you
as for a landed proprietor.</p>

<p>But you will have no occasion to feel annoyed
because you have not enough wreaths, for they
do not place a single flower on the coffin; it shall
stand out black and shining, and nothing must
cover it; and it is not necessary for you to think
whether you will have a sufficiently large number
of people to follow you, for those who live in your
town will be sure to follow you, every one. Nor
will you be obliged to lie and listen if there is
lamenting and weeping around your coffin. They
never weep over the dead when they stand on the
church hill outside Svartsj&ouml; Church. No, they
weep as little over a strong young fellow who falls
a prey to death just as he is beginning to provide
for his old people as they will for you. You will
be placed on a couple of black trestles outside the
door of the parish room, and a whole crowd of
people will gradually gather round you, and all
the women will have handkerchiefs in their hands.
But no one will cry; all the handkerchiefs will
be kept tightly rolled up; not one will be applied
to the eyes. You need not speculate as to whether
people will shed as many tears over you as they
would over others. They would cry if it were the
proper thing, but it is not the proper thing.</p>

<p>You can understand that if there were much
sorrowing over one grave, it would not look well
for those over whom no one sorrowed. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
know what they were about at Svartsj&ouml;. They do
as it has been the custom to do there for many
hundred years. But whilst you stand there, on
the church hill, you are a great and important
personage, although you receive neither flowers
nor tears. No one comes to church without asking
who you are, and then they go quietly up to
you and stand and gaze at you; and it never
occurs to anyone to wound the dead by pitying
him. No one says anything but that it is well for
him that it is all over.</p>

<p>It is not at all as it is in a town, where you can
be buried any day. At Svartsj&ouml; you must be
buried on a Sunday, so that you can have the
whole parish around you. There you will have
standing near your coffin both the girl with whom
you danced at the last midsummer night's festival
and the man with whom you exchanged horses
at the last fair. You will have the schoolmaster
who took so much trouble with you when you
were a little lad, and who had forgotten you,
although you remembered him so well; and you
will have the old Member of Parliament who
never before thought it worth his while to bow
to you. This is not as in a town, where people
hardly turn round when you are carried past.
When they bring the long bands and place them
under the coffin, there is not one who does not
watch the proceedings.</p>

<p>You cannot imagine what a churchwarden we
have at Svartsj&ouml;. He is an old soldier, and he
looks like a Field-Marshal. He has short white
hair and twisted moustaches, and a pointed imperial;
he is slim and tall and straight, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
light and firm step. On Sundays he wears a well-brushed
frock-coat of fine cloth. He really looks
a very fine old gentleman, and it is he who walks
at the head of the procession. Then comes the
verger. Not that the verger is to be compared
with the churchwarden. It is more than probable
that his Sunday hat is too large and old-fashioned;
as likely as not he is awkward&mdash;but
when is a verger not awkward?</p>

<p>Then you come next in your coffin, with the
six bearers, and then follow the clergyman and
the clerk and the Town Council and the whole
parish. All the congregation will follow you to
the churchyard, you may be sure of that. But
I will tell you something: All those who follow
you look so small and poor. They are not fine
town's-people, you know&mdash;only plain, simple
Svartsj&ouml; folk. There is only one who is great
and important, and that is you in your coffin&mdash;you
who are dead.</p>

<p>The others the next day will have to resume
their heavy and toilsome work. They will have
to live in poor old cottages and wear old, patched
clothes; the others will always be plagued and
worried, and dragged down and humbled by
poverty.</p>

<p>Those who follow you to your grave become
far more sad by looking at the living than by
thinking of you who are dead. You need not
look any more at the velvet collar of your coat
to see if it is not getting worn at the edges; you
need not make a special fold of your silk handkerchief
to hide that it is beginning to fray; you
will never more be compelled to ask the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
shopkeeper to let you have goods on credit; you
will not find out that your strength is failing; you
will not have to wait for the day when you must
go on the parish.</p>

<p>While they are following you to the grave
everyone will be thinking that it is best to be
dead&mdash;better to soar heavenwards, carried on the
white clouds of the morning&mdash;than to be always
experiencing life's manifold troubles. When they
come to the wall of the churchyard, where the
grave has been made, the bands are exchanged
for strong ropes, and people get on to the loose
earth and lower you down. And when this has
been done the clerk advances to the grave and
begins to sing: 'I walk towards death.'</p>

<p>He sings the hymn quite alone; neither the
clergyman nor any of the congregation help him.
But the clerk must sing; however keen the north
wind and however glaring the sun which shines
straight in his face, sing he does.</p>

<p>The clerk, however, is getting old now, and
he has not much voice left; he is quite aware that
it does not sound as well now as formerly when
he sang people into their graves; but he does it
all the same&mdash;it is part of his duty. For the day,
you understand, when his voice quite fails him, so
that he cannot sing any more, he must resign
his office, and this means downright poverty for
him. Therefore the whole gathering stands in
apprehension while the old clerk sings, wondering
whether his voice will last through the whole
verse. But no one joins him, not a single person,
for that would not do; it is not the custom. People
never sing at a grave at Svartsj&ouml;. People do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
not sing in the church either, except the first
hymn on Christmas Day morning.</p>

<p>Still, if one listened very attentively, one could
hear that the clerk does not sing alone. There
really is another voice, but it sounds so exactly
the same that the two voices blend as if they were
only one. The other who sings is a little old man
in a long, coarse gray coat. He is still older than
the clerk, but he gives out all the voice he has to
help him. And the voice, as I have told you, is
exactly the same kind as the clerk's; they are so
alike one cannot help wondering at it.</p>

<p>But when one looks closer, the little gray old
man is also exactly like the clerk; he has the same
nose and chin and mouth, only somewhat older,
and, as it were, more hardly dealt with in life.
And then one understands that the little gray man
is the clerk's brother; and then one knows why
he helps him. For, you see, things have never
gone well with him in this world, and he has
always had bad luck; and once he was made a
bankrupt, and brought the clerk into his misfortunes.
He knows that it is his fault that his
brother has always had to struggle. And the
clerk, you know, has tried to help him on to his
legs again, but with no avail, for he has not been
one of those one can help. He has always been
unfortunate; and then, he has had no strength
of purpose.</p>

<p>But the clerk has been the shining light in the
family; and for the other it has been a case of
receiving and receiving, and he has never been
able to make any return at all. Great God! even
to talk of making any return&mdash;he who is so poor!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
You should only see the little hut in the forest
where he lives. He knows that he has always
been dull and sad, only a burden&mdash;only a burden
for his brother and for others. But now of late
he has become a great man; now he is able to
give some return. And that he does. Now he
helps his brother, the clerk, who has been the sunshine
and life and joy for him all his days. Now
he helps him to sing, so that he may keep his
office.</p>

<p>He does not go to church, for he thinks that
everyone looks at him because he has no black
Sunday clothes; but every Sunday he goes up
to the church to see whether there is a coffin on
the black trestles outside the parish room; and
if there is one he goes to the grave, in spite of his
old gray coat, and helps his brother with his pitiful
old voice.</p>

<p>The little old man knows very well how badly
he sings; he places himself behind the others,
and does not push forward to the grave. But
sing he does; it would not matter so much if the
clerk's voice should fail on one or other note, his
brother is there and helps him.</p>

<p>At the churchyard no one laughs at the singing;
but when people go home and have thrown
off their devoutness, then they speak about the
service, and then they laugh at the clerk's singing&mdash;laugh
both at his and his brother's. The clerk
does not mind it, it is the same to him; but his
brother thinks about it and suffers from it; he
dreads the Sunday the whole week, but still he
comes punctually to the churchyard and does his
duty. But you in your coffin, you do not think so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
badly of the singing. You think that it is good
music. Is it not true that one would like to be
buried in Svartsj&ouml;, if only for the sake of that
singing?</p>

<p>It says in the hymn that life is but a walk
towards death, and when the two old men sing
this&mdash;the two who have suffered for each other
during their whole life&mdash;then one understands
better than ever before how wearisome it is to
live, and one is so entirely satisfied with being
dead.</p>

<p>And then the singing stops, and the clergyman
throws earth on the coffin and says a prayer over
you. Then the two old voices sing: 'I walk
towards heaven.' And they do not sing this verse
any better than the former; their voices grow
more feeble and querulous the longer they sing.
But for you a great and wide expanse opens, and
you soar upwards with tremulous joy, and everything
earthly fades and disappears.</p>

<p>But still the last which you hear of things
earthly tells of faithfulness and love. And in the
midst of your trembling flight the poor song will
awake memories of all the faithfulness and love
you have met with here below, and this will bear
you upwards. This will fill you with radiance and
make you beautiful as an angel.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
