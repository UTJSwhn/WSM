<h2 class="p4 b2">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH M. Maeterlinck as a dramatist the
world is pretty well acquainted. This
little volume presents him in the new character
of a philosopher and an æsthetician. And it is
in some sort an ‘apology’ for his theatre, the
one being to the other as theory to practice.
Reversing the course prescribed by Mr. Squeers
for his pupils, M. Maeterlinck, having cleaned
w-i-n-d-e-r, winder, now goes and spells it.
He began by visualising and synthetising his
ideas of life; here you shall find him trying to
analyse these ideas and consumed with anxiety
to tell us the truth that is in him. It is not a
truth for all markets; he is at no pains to conceal
that. He appeals, as every mystic must, to
the elect; M. Anatole France would say, to
the <i>âmes bien nées</i>. If we are not sealed of the
tribe of Plotinus, he warns us to go elsewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
‘If, plunging thine eyes into thyself&mdash;it is this
same Plotinus that he is quoting&mdash;‘thou dost
not feel the charm of beauty, it is in vain that,
thy disposition being such, thou shouldst seek
the charm of beauty; for thou wouldst seek it
only with that which is ugly and impure. Therefore
it is that the discourse we hold here is not
addressed to all men.’ If we are to follow him
in his expedition to a philosophic Ultima Thule,
we must have the mind for that adventure.
‘We are here,’ as he tells us elsewhere of the
‘stiff’ but, it seems, ‘admirable’ Ruysbroeck,
‘all of a sudden on the borderland of human
thought and far across the Arctic circle of the
spirit. There is no ordinary cold, no ordinary
dark there, and yet you shall find there naught
but flames and light. But to those who arrive
without having trained their minds to these new
perceptions, the light and the flames are as dark
and as cold as though they were painted.’ This
means that the intelligence, the reason, will not
suffice of themselves; we must have faith.
There are passages in the book which may
provoke a sniff from Mr. Worldly Wiseman;
but we must beware of the Voltairean spirit, or
this will be a closed book to us. ‘We live by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
admiration, hope, and love,’ said Wordsworth.
And we understand by them, M. Maeterlinck
would add. I fear we are not all of us found
worthy of the mystical frame of mind. But it
is a psychological fact, like another; and if we
can only examine it from the outside, we can at
least bring patience and placidity to the task.
The point is: has M. Maeterlinck anything
to say? It will be found, I think, that he
has.</p>

<p>All men, the world has long been assured, are
born Aristotelians or Platonists. There cannot
be a doubt about M. Maeterlinck’s philosophic
birthright. He may say, as Paul Verlaine sang:</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">Moi, j’allais rêvant du divin Platon,<br />
Sous l’œil clignotant des bleus becs de gaz.</p>

<p class="pn1">More strictly, he is a Neo-Platonist. His remark
about the Admirable Ruysbroeck’s idea is equally
true of his own. ‘I fancy that all those who have
not lived in the intimacy of Plato and of the
Neo-Platonists of Alexandria, will not go far
with this reading.’ He quotes Plotinus, ‘the
great Plotinus, who, of all the intellects known to
me, draws the nearest to the divine.’ He cites
Porphyry and the Gnostics and Swedenborg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
These are not exactly popular authors of the
moment. But M. Maeterlinck, it is plain, has
devoured them; his is not what Pope called
‘index-learning.’ Plotinus (205-270 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) stood
between two worlds, the old and the new; and
he made the best of both. He enlarged the
boundaries of art by discerning in the idea of
beauty an inward and spiritual grace not to be
found in the ‘Platonic idea.’ That, too, is
what M. Maeterlinck is striving for: a larger
idea of beauty, and a better apprehension of its
inward and spiritual grace.</p>

<p>His cardinal doctrine will, I conjecture, prove
to be something like this. What should be of
most account for us all is not external fact, but
the supra-sensuous world. ‘What we know is
not interesting’; the really interesting things
are those which we can only divine&mdash;the veiled
life of the soul, the crepuscular region of subconsciousness,
our ‘borderland’ feelings, all that
lies in the strange ‘neutral zone’ between the
frontiers of consciousness and unconsciousness.
The mystery of life is what makes life worth
living. ‘’Twas a little being of mystery, like
every one else,’ says the old King Arkel of the
dead Mélisande. We are such stuff as dreams are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
made of, might be the ‘refrain’ of all M. Maeterlinck’s
plays, and of most of these essays. He is
penetrated by the feeling of the mystery in all
human creatures, whose every act is regulated by
far-off influences and obscurely rooted in things
unexplained. Mystery is within us and around
us. Of reality we can only get now and then
the merest glimpse. Our senses are too gross.
Between the invisible world and our own there is
doubtless an intimate concordance; but it escapes
us. We grope among shadows towards the unknown.
Even the new conquests of what we
vainly suppose to be ‘exact’ thought only deepen
the mystery of life. There is, for example, the
Schopenhauerian theory of love. We had fancied
we could at least choose our loves in freedom:
but ‘we are told that a thousand centuries divide
us from ourselves when we choose the woman we
love, and that the first kiss of the betrothed is
but the seal which thousands of hands, craving
for birth, have impressed upon the lips of the
mother they desire.’ And so with the ‘heredity’
of the men of science. ‘We know that the dead
do not die. We know that it is not in our
churches they are to be found, but in the houses,
the habits of us all.’ What was there in the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
notion of Destiny so mysterious as this double
thraldom of ours&mdash;thraldom to the dead and to
the unborn? Conclusion: mysticism is your
only wear. In the mystics alone is certitude.
‘If it be true, as has been said, that every man
is a Shakespeare in his dreams, we have to ask
ourselves whether every man, in his waking
life, is not an inarticulate mystic, a thousandfold
more transcendental than those circumscribed by
speech.’ In silence is our only chance of knowing
one another. And ‘mystic truths have over
ordinary truths a strange privilege; they can
neither age nor die.’ From all this you see
M. Maeterlinck’s train of thought. He would
fix our minds upon the obscure, pre-conscious,
what M. Faguet calls the <i>incunabulary</i> life of the
soul. He finds no epithets too fine for this: the
higher life, the transcendental life, the divine life,
the absolute life.</p>

<p>Whatever we may think of these ideas in
themselves, there is no doubt that the man who
expresses them sounds a new and individual note.
They show a reaction against the whole effort of
modern literature, which has been nothing if not
positive, quasi-scientific, ever on the prowl for
‘documents.’ And if for no other reason than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
that, this book, I submit, would have peculiar
significance and value.</p>

<p>But there is at least one other reason. M.
Maeterlinck puts forward a plea, and a plea not
lightly to be dismissed, for a new æsthetic of the
drama. The mystery which he finds everywhere
around us and within us he would bring
into the theatre. If there is one position which
the whole world supposed itself to have definitively
taken up, it is the position that the theatre
lives by action and to offer us an exhibition of
the will. Therein, for instance, M. Ferdinand
Brunetière finds the <i>differentia</i> of drama; it is
the struggle of a will, conscious of itself, against
obstacles. Traversing this position M. Maeterlinck
boldly asks whether a ‘static’ theatre is
impossible, a theatre of mood not of movement,
a theatre where nothing material happens and
where everything immaterial is felt. Even as it
is, the real beauty and purport of a tragedy is
not seldom to be found in that part of its
dialogue which is superficially ‘useless.’ ‘Certain
it is that in the ordinary drama the indispensable
dialogue by no means corresponds to
reality.... One may even affirm that the poem
draws the nearer to beauty and loftier truth in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
the measure that it eliminates words that merely
explain the action and replaces them by others
that reveal not the so-called “soul-state,” but I
know not what intangible and unceasing striving
of the soul towards its beauty and its truth.’
The frivolous will be reminded here, perhaps, of
the old stage direction for the miser: ‘Leans
against a wall and grows generous.’ Others who
remember their Xenophon will bethink them of
a certain discussion which Socrates had with
Parrhasius on the question, ‘Can the unseen be
imitated?’ (<i>Soc. Memorabilia</i>, iii. 10). It may
be that M. Maeterlinck’s ‘static’ theatre is an
unrealisable dream; but it is a seductive one, by
contrast with the reality. Do not all of us who
are condemned to spend much of our time in
the playhouse occasionally share M. Maeterlinck’s
feeling of repugnance? ‘When I go to the
theatre, I feel as though I were spending a few
hours in the midst of my ancestors, who looked
upon life as something that was primitive, arid,
and brutal; but this conception of theirs scarcely
even lingers in my memory, and surely it is not
one that I can any longer share.... I had
hoped to be shown some act of life traced back
to its source and to its mystery by connecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
links that my daily occupations afford me neither
power nor occasion to study. I had gone thither
hoping that the beauty, the grandeur, and the
earnestness of my humble day-by-day existence
would for one instant be revealed to me ...
whereas, almost invariably, all that I beheld was
but a man who would tell me at wearisome
length why he was jealous, why he poisoned, or
why he killed.’ And so he would have the
drama make an effort to show us ‘how truly
wonderful is the mere fact of living’; he would
have it tackle ‘presentiments, the strange impression
produced by a chance meeting or a
look, a decision that the unknown side of human
reason had governed, an intervention or a force
inexplicable and yet understood, the secret laws
of sympathy and antipathy, elective and instinctive
affinities, the overwhelming influence of
things unsaid.’</p>

<p>How is it all to come about? When we ask
this question we find ourselves in the position of
the lady who had been discussing the subject of
a future state with Dr. Johnson. ‘She seemed
desirous of knowing more,’ says Boswell, ‘but
he left the question in obscurity.’ It is there
that M. Maeterlinck, like a true mystic, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
content to leave most of his questions. ‘The
time has not yet come,’ he says with an engaging
candour, ‘when we can speak lucidly of these
things.’ One thinks of Sir Thomas Browne’s
quaint fancy. ‘A dialogue between two infants
in the womb concerning the state of this world
might handsomely illustrate our ignorance of the
next, whereof methinks we yet discourse in
Plato’s den, and are but embryon philosophers.’
Maybe M. Maeterlinck is but an embryon
philosopher, one who discourses in Plato’s den.
But I think we must all recognise the native
distinction of his mind, the fastidious delicacy of
his taste, his abiding and insatiable love of
beauty. What he says, exquisitely enough but
perhaps too liberally, of every man&mdash;‘to every
man there come noble thoughts that pass across
his heart like great white birds’&mdash;is certainly
true of himself. Wherefore one may venture to
invite people to his book as Heraclitus welcomed
guests to his kitchen: ‘Enter boldly, for here
also there are gods.’</p>

<h2 class="p4 b2">SILENCE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">‘SILENCE and Secrecy!’ cries Carlyle.
‘Altars might still be raised to them
(were this an altar-building time) for
universal worship. Silence is the element
in which great things fashion themselves
together, that at length they may emerge,
full-formed and majestic, into the daylight
of Life, which they are henceforth to rule.
Not William the Silent only, but all the
considerable men I have known, and the
most undiplomatic and unstrategic of these,
forbore to babble of what they were creating
and projecting. Nay, in thy own mean
perplexities, do thou thyself but <i>hold thy
tongue for one day</i>; on the morrow how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
much clearer are thy purposes and duties;
what wreck and rubbish have these mute
workmen within thee swept away, when
intrusive noises were shut out! Speech is
too often not, as the Frenchman defined it,
the art of concealing Thought, but of quite
stifling and suspending Thought, so that
there is none to conceal. Speech, too, is
great, but not the greatest. As the Swiss
inscription says: <i>Sprechen ist Silbern,
Schweigen ist goldern</i> (Speech is silver,
Silence is golden); or, as I might rather
express it, Speech is of Time, Silence is of
Eternity.</p>

<p>‘Bees will not work except in darkness;
Thought will not work except in Silence;
neither will Virtue work except in
secrecy.’</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> is idle to think that, by means of
words, any real communication can ever pass
from one man to another. The lips or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
tongue may represent the soul, even as a
cipher or a number may represent a picture
of Memling; but from the moment that
we have <i>something to say to each other</i>, we
are <i>compelled</i> to hold our peace: and if at
such times we do not listen to the urgent
commands of silence, invisible though they
be, we shall have suffered an eternal loss
that all the treasures of human wisdom
cannot make good; for we shall have let
slip the opportunity of listening to another
soul, and of giving existence, be it only for
an instant, to our own; and many lives
there are in which such opportunities do
not present themselves twice....</p>

<p>It is only when life is sluggish within us
that we speak: only at moments when
reality lies far away, and we <i>do not wish</i>
to be conscious of our brethren. And no
sooner do we speak than something warns
us that the divine gates are closing. Thus
it comes about that we hug silence to us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and are very misers of it; and even the
most reckless will not squander it on the
first comer. There is an instinct of the
superhuman truths within us which warns
us that it is dangerous to be silent with
one whom we do not wish to know,
or do not love: for words may pass
between men, but let silence have had its
instant of activity, and it will never efface
itself; and indeed the true life, the only
life that leaves a trace behind, is made up
of silence alone. Bethink it well, in that
silence to which you must again have
recourse, so that it may explain itself, by
itself; and if it be granted to you to
descend for one moment into your soul,
into the depths where the angels dwell, it
is not the words spoken by the creature
you loved so dearly that you will recall,
or the gestures that he made, but it
is, above all, the silences that you have
lived together that will come back to you:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
for it is the <i>quality</i> of those silences that
alone revealed the quality of your love and
your souls.</p>

<p>So far I have considered <i>active</i> silence
only, for there is a <i>passive</i> silence, which
is the shadow of sleep, of death or non-existence.
It is the silence of lethargy, and
is even less to be dreaded than speech, so
long as it slumbers; but beware lest a
sudden incident awake it, for then would
its brother, the great active silence, at once
rear himself upon his throne. Be on your
guard. Two souls would draw near each
other: the barriers would fall asunder, the
gates fly open, and the life of every day be
replaced by a life of deepest earnest, wherein
all are defenceless; a life in which
laughter dares not show itself, in which
there is no obeying, in which nothing can
evermore be forgotten....</p>

<p>And it is because we all of us know
of this sombre power and its perilous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
manifestations, that we stand in so deep a
dread of silence. We can bear, when need
must be, the silence of ourselves, that of
isolation: but the silence of many&mdash;silence
multiplied&mdash;and above all the silence of
a crowd&mdash;these are supernatural burdens,
whose inexplicable weight brings dread to
the mightiest soul. We spend a goodly
portion of our lives in seeking places where
silence is not. No sooner have two or
three men met than their one thought is to
drive away the invisible enemy; and of how
many ordinary friendships may it not be
said that their only foundation is the common
hatred of silence! And if, all efforts notwithstanding,
it contrives to steal among
a number of men, disquiet will fall upon
them, and their restless eyes will wander in
the mysterious direction of things unseen:
and each man will hurriedly go his way,
flying before the intruder: and henceforth
they will avoid each other, dreading lest a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
similar disaster should again befall them,
and suspicious as to whether there be not
one among them who would treacherously
throw open the gate to the enemy....</p>

<p>In the lives of most of us, it will not
happen more than twice or thrice that
silence is really understood and freely
admitted. It is only on the most solemn
occasions that the inscrutable guest is
welcomed; but, when such come about,
there are few who do not make the
welcome worthy, for even in the lives of
the most wretched there are moments
when they know how to act, even as though
they knew already that which is known to
the gods. Remember the day on which,
without fear in your heart, you met your
first silence. The dread hour had sounded;
silence went before your soul. You saw it
rising from the unspeakable abysses of life,
from the depths of the inner sea of horror
or beauty, and you did not fly.... It was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
a home-coming, on the threshold of a departure,
in the midst of a great joy, at the
pillow of a death-bed, on the approach of
a dire misfortune. Bethink you of those
moments when all the secret jewels shone
forth on you, and the slumbering truths
sprung to life, and tell me whether silence,
then, was not good and necessary, whether
the caresses of the enemy you had so persistently
shunned were not truly divine?
The kisses of the silence of misfortune&mdash;and
it is above all at times of misfortune that
silence caresses us&mdash;can never be forgotten;
and therefore it is that those to whom they
have come more often than to others are
worthier than those others. They alone
know, perhaps, how voiceless and unfathomable
are the waters on which the
fragile shell of daily life reposes: they
have approached nearer to God, and the
steps they have taken towards the light are
steps that can never be lost, for the soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
may not rise, perhaps, but it can never
sink.... ‘Silence, the great Empire
of Silence,’ says Carlyle again&mdash;he who
understood so well the empire of the life
which holds us&mdash;‘higher than the stars,
deeper than the Kingdom of Death!...
Silence, and the great silent men!...
Scattered here and there, each in his
department; silently thinking, silently
working; whom no morning newspaper
makes mention of! They are the salt of
the earth. A country that has none or
few of these is in a bad way. Like a
forest which had no <i>roots</i>; which had all
turned to leaves and boughs; which must
soon wither and be no forest.’</p>

<p>But the real silence, which is greater still
and more difficult of approach than the
material silence of which Carlyle speaks&mdash;the
real silence is not one of those gods
that can desert mankind. It surrounds us
on every side; it is the source of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
undercurrents of our life; and let one of
us but knock, with trembling fingers, at
the door of the abyss, it is always by the
same attentive silence that this door will
be opened.</p>

<p>It is a thing that knows no limit, and
before it all men are equal; and the silence
of king or slave, in presence of death, or
grief, or love, reveals the same features,
hides beneath its impenetrable mantle the
self-same treasure. For this is the essential
silence of our soul, our most inviolable
sanctuary, and its secret can never be
lost; and, were the first born of men to
meet the last inhabitant of the earth, a
kindred impulse would sway them, and
they would be voiceless in their caresses, in
their terror and their tears; a kindred
impulse would sway them, and all that
could be said without falsehood would call
for no spoken word: and, the centuries
notwithstanding, there would come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
them, at the same moment, as though one
cradle had held them both, comprehension
of that which the tongue shall not learn to
tell before the world ceases....</p>

<p>No sooner are the lips still than the soul
awakes, and sets forth on its labours; for
silence is an element that is full of surprise,
danger and happiness, and in these the soul
possesses itself in freedom. If it be indeed
your desire to give yourself over to another,
be silent; and if you fear being silent with
him&mdash;unless this fear be the proud uncertainty,
or hunger, of the love that yearns
for prodigies&mdash;fly from him, for your soul
knows well how far it may go. There are
men in whose presence the greatest of
heroes would not dare to be silent; and
even the soul that has nothing to conceal
trembles lest another should discover its
secret. Some there are that have no
silence, and that kill the silence around
them, and these are the only creatures that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
pass through life unperceived. To them
it is not given to cross the zone of revelation,
the great zone of the firm and
faithful light. We cannot conceive what
sort of man is he who has never been
silent. It is to us as though his soul were
featureless. ‘We do not know each other
yet,’ wrote to me one whom I hold dear
above all others, ‘we have not yet dared to
be silent together.’ And it was true:
already did we love each other so deeply
that we shrank from the superhuman
ordeal. And each time that silence fell
upon us&mdash;the angel of the supreme truth,
the messenger that brings to the heart the
tidings of the unknown&mdash;each time did we
feel that our souls were craving mercy on
their knees, were begging for a few hours
more of innocent falsehood, a few hours
of ignorance, a few hours of childhood....
And none the less must its hour come. It
is the sun of love, and it ripens the fruit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the soul, as the sun of heaven ripens the
fruits of the earth. But it is not without
cause that men fear it; for none can ever
tell what will be the <i>quality</i> of the silence
which is about to fall upon them. Though
all words may be akin, every silence differs
from its fellow; and, with rare exceptions,
it is an entire destiny that will be governed
by the <i>quality</i> of this first silence which is
descending upon two souls. They blend:
we know not where, for the reservoirs of
silence lie far above the reservoirs of
thought, and the strange resultant brew is
either sinisterly bitter or profoundly sweet.
Two souls, admirable both and of equal
power, may yet give birth to a hostile
silence, and wage pitiless war against each
other in the darkness; while it may be that
the soul of a convict shall go forth and
commune in divine silence with the soul of
a virgin. The result can never be foretold;
all this comes to pass in a heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that never warns; and therefore it is that
the tenderest of lovers will often defer to
the last hour of all the solemn entry of
the great revealer of the depths of our
being....</p>

<p>For they too are well aware&mdash;the love
that is truly love brings the most frivolous
back to life’s centre&mdash;they too are well
aware that all that had gone before was
but as children playing outside the gates,
and that it is now that the walls are falling
and existence lying bare. Their silence
will be even as are the gods within them;
and if in this first silence, there be not
harmony, there can be no love in their
souls, for the silence will never change. It
may rise or it may fall between two souls,
but <i>its nature</i> can never alter; and even
until the death of the lovers will it retain
the form, the attitude and the power that
were its own when, for the first time, it
came into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>As we advance through life, it is more
and more brought home to us that nothing
takes place that is not in accord with some
curious, preconceived design: and of this
we never breathe a word, we scarcely dare
to let our minds dwell upon it, but of its
existence, somewhere above our heads, we
are absolutely convinced. The most
fatuous of men smiles, at the first encounters,
as though he were the accomplice
of the destiny of his brethren. And in
this domain, even those who can speak the
most profoundly realise&mdash;they, perhaps,
more than others&mdash;that words can never
express the real, special relationship that
exists between two beings. Were I to
speak to you at this moment of the
gravest things of all&mdash;of love, death or
destiny&mdash;it is not love, death or destiny
that I should touch; and, my efforts notwithstanding,
there would always remain
between us a truth which had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
spoken, which we had not even thought of
speaking; and yet it is this truth only,
voiceless though it has been, which will have
lived with us for an instant, and by which
we shall have been wholly absorbed. For
that truth was <i>our truth</i> as regards death,
destiny or love, and it was in silence only
that we could perceive it. And nothing
save only the silence will have had any
importance. ‘My sisters,’ says a child in
the fairy-story, ‘you have each of you a
secret thought&mdash;I wish to know it.’ We,
too, have something that people wish to
know, but it is hidden far above the secret
thought&mdash;it is our secret silence. But all
questions are useless. When our spirit is
alarmed, its own agitation becomes a
barrier to the second life that lives in this
secret; and, would we know what it is that
lies hidden there, we must cultivate silence
among ourselves, for it is then only that
for one instant the eternal flowers unfold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
their petals, the mysterious flowers whose
form and colour are ever changing in
harmony with the soul that is by their side.
As gold and silver are weighed in pure
water, so does the soul test its weight in
silence, and the words that we let fall have
no meaning apart from the silence that
wraps them round. If I tell some one that
I love him&mdash;as I may have told a hundred
others&mdash;my words will convey nothing to
him; but the silence which will ensue, if I
do indeed love him, will make clear in
what depths lie the roots of my love,
and will in its turn give birth to a conviction,
that shall itself be silent; and
in the course of a lifetime, this silence
and this conviction will never again be
the same....</p>

<p>Is it not silence that determines and
fixes the savour of love? Deprived of it,
love would lose its eternal essence and
perfume. Who has not known those silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
moments which separated the lips to reunite
the souls? It is these that we must
ever seek. There is no silence more docile
than the silence of love, and it is indeed
the only one that we may claim for ourselves
alone. The other great silences,
those of death, grief, or destiny, do not
belong to us. They come towards us at
their own hour, following in the track of
events, and those whom they do not meet
need not reproach themselves. But we can
all go forth to meet the silences of love.
They lie in wait for us, night and day, at
our threshold, and are no less beautiful
than their brothers. And it is thanks to
them that those who have seldom wept
may know the life of the soul almost as
intimately as those to whom much grief
has come: and therefore it is that such of
us as have loved deeply have learnt
many secrets that are unknown to others:
for thousands and thousands of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
quiver in silence on the lips of true
friendship and love, that are not to
be found in the silence of other lips,
to which friendship and love are unknown....</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE AWAKENING OF<br />THE SOUL</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A TIME will come, perhaps&mdash;and many
things there are that herald its approach&mdash;a
time will come perhaps when our souls
will know of each other without the intermediary
of the senses. Certain it is that
there passes not a day but the soul adds to
its ever-widening domain. It is very much
nearer to our visible self, and takes a far
greater part in all our actions, than was the
case two or three centuries ago. A spiritual
epoch is perhaps upon us; an epoch to
which a certain number of analogies are
found in history. For there are periods
recorded, when the soul, in obedience to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
unknown laws, seemed to rise to the very
surface of humanity, whence it gave clearest
evidence of its existence and of its power.
And this existence and this power reveal
themselves in countless ways, diverse and
unforeseen. It would seem, at moments
such as these, as though humanity were on
the point of struggling from beneath the
crushing burden of matter that weighs it
down. A spiritual influence is abroad that
soothes and comforts; and the sternest,
direst laws of Nature yield here and there.
Men are nearer to themselves, nearer to
their brothers; in the look of their eyes,
in the love of their hearts, there is deeper
earnestness and tenderer fellowship. Their
understanding of women, children, animals,
plants&mdash;nay, of all things&mdash;becomes more
pitiful and more profound. The statues,
paintings and writings that these men have
left us may perhaps not be perfect, but,
none the less does there dwell therein a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
secret power, an indescribable grace, held
captive and imperishable for ever. A
mysterious brotherhood and love must
have shone forth from the eyes of these
men; and signs of a life that we cannot
explain are everywhere, vibrating by the
side of the life of every day.</p>

<p>Such knowledge as we possess of ancient
Egypt induces us to believe that she passed
through one of these spiritual epochs. At
a very remote period in the history of
India, the soul must have drawn very near
to the surface of life, to a point, indeed,
that it has never since touched; and unto this
day strange phenomena owe their being to
the recollection, or lingering remnants, of
its almost immediate presence. Many other
similar moments there have been, when the
spiritual element seemed to be struggling
far down in the depths of humanity, like a
drowning man battling for life beneath the
waters of a great river. Bethink you of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Persia, for instance, of Alexandria, and the
two mystic centuries of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there have been
centuries in which purest intellect and
beauty reigned supreme, though the soul lay
unrevealed. Thus it was far from Greece
and Rome, and from the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries in France. (As regards
this last, however, we may perhaps be speaking
only of the surface; for in its depths
many mysteries lie concealed&mdash;we must remember
Claude de Saint-Martin, Cagliostro&mdash;who
is passed over too lightly&mdash;Pascalis,
and many others besides.) Something is
lacking, we know not what; barriers are
stretched across the secret passages; the eyes
of beauty are sealed. Well-nigh hopeless, indeed,
is the attempt to convey this in words,
or to explain why the atmosphere of divinity
and fatality that enwraps the Greek dramas
does not seem to us to be the true atmosphere
of the soul. Majestic and all-abiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
as is the mystery that lingers on the horizon
of these matchless tragedies, it is yet not
the pitiful, brotherly mystery, quickened
into profound activity, that we find in
other works less great and less beautiful.
And to come nearer to our own time&mdash;though
Racine may indeed be the unerring
poet of the woman’s heart, who would dare
to claim for him that he has ever taken one
step towards her soul? What can you tell
me of the soul of Andromache, of Britannicus?
Racine’s characters have no knowledge
of themselves beyond the words by
which they express themselves, and not one
of these words can pierce the dykes that
keep back the sea. His men and women
are alone, fearfully alone, on the surface
of a planet that no longer revolves in
the heavens. If they were to be silent,
they would cease to be. They have no
<i>invisible principle</i>, and one might almost
believe that some isolating substance had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
crept between their spirit and themselves,
between the life which has its roots in every
created thing and that which, for one
fleeting moment, brushes against a passion,
a grief or a hope. Truly there are
centuries in which the soul lies dormant
and slumbers undisturbed.</p>

<p>But to-day it is clearly making a mighty
effort. Its manifestations are everywhere,
and they are strangely urgent, pressing,
imperious even, as though the order had
been given, and no time must be lost. It
must be preparing for a decisive struggle;
and none can foretell the issues that may
be dependent on the result, be this victory
or flight. Perhaps never to this day has
it enlisted in its service such diverse, irresistible
forces. It is as though an invisible
wall hemmed it in, and one knows not
whether it be quivering in its death-throb
or quickened by a new life. I will say
nothing of the occult powers, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
signs are everywhere&mdash;of magnetism, telepathy,
levitation, the unsuspected properties
of radiating matter, and countless other
phenomena that are battering down the
door of orthodox science. These things
are known of all men, and can easily be
verified. And truly they may well be the
merest bagatelle by the side of the vast
upheaval that is actually in progress, for
the soul is like a dreamer, enthralled by
sleep, who struggles with all his might to
move an arm or raise an eyelid.</p>

<p>Other regions there are where its action
is even more effective, though the crowd
there is less regardful, and none but trained
eyes can see. Does it not seem as though
the supreme cry of the soul were at last
about to pierce the dense clouds of error
that still envelop it in music? Do not
certain pictures by foreign painters reveal
the sacred majesty of an invisible presence,
as it never has been revealed before?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Are there not masterpieces in literature
that are illumined by a flame which differs
in its very essence from the strangest
beacon-fires that lit up the writings of
bygone days? A transformation of silence&mdash;strange
and inexplicable&mdash;is upon us,
and the reign of the <i>positive sublime</i>,
absolute to this day, seems destined to be
overthrown. I will not linger on this
subject, for the time has not yet come for
lucid discussion of these things; but I feel
that a more pressing offer of spiritual
freedom has rarely been made to mankind.
Nay, there are moments when it bears the
semblance of an ultimatum; and therefore
does it behove us to neglect nothing, but
indeed with all eagerness to accept this
imperious invitation, that is like unto the
dream that is lost for ever, unless instantaneously
seized. We must be heedful; it
is not without fit reason that our soul
bestirs itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Though it be perhaps from the table-lands
of speculative thought that this
agitation is the most clearly to be noted,
yet may there well be signs of it in the
most ordinary paths of life, unsuspected of
any; for not a flower opens on the hill-top
but at length it falls into the valley.
Has it fallen already? I know not. But
this much at least is abundantly proved to
us, that in the work-a-day lives of the
very humblest of men, spiritual phenomena
manifest themselves&mdash;mysterious, direct
workings, that bring soul nearer to soul;
and of all this we can find no record in
former times. And the reason must surely
be that these things were not so clearly
evident then: for at every period there
have been men who penetrated to the
innermost recesses of life, to its most secret
affinities: and all that they learned of the
heart, the soul and the spirit of their epoch
has been handed down to us. It may well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
be that similar influences were at work even
in those times; but they could not have been
as universal, as active and vigorous as they
are to-day, nor could they have sunk so
deep into the very life-springs of the race;
for in that case, they had surely not
escaped the notice of those sages, and been
passed by in silence. And I do not refer
now to ‘scientific spiritism,’ or its telepathic
phenomena, to ‘materialisation,’ or
other manifestations that I have enumerated
above: but to the incidents, the interventions,
that occur unceasingly in the
dreariest lives of all, those of the men who
are the most forgetful of their eternal
rights. Also must it be borne in mind
that we are not considering the ordinary
text-book psychology&mdash;which concerns
itself only with such spiritual phenomena
as are the most closely interwoven with the
material, having indeed usurped the
beautiful name of Psyche&mdash;the psychology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of which I speak is transcendental, and
throws light on the direct relationship that
exists between soul and soul, and on the
<i>sensibility</i> as well as the <i>extraordinary
presence</i> of the soul. It is a science that is
in its infancy; but by it shall men be taken
a full step higher, and very speedily shall
it dismiss for ever the elementary psychology
that has been dominant to this day.</p>

<p>This ‘immediate’ psychology is descending
from the mountain tops, and laying
siege to the humblest of valleys; and even
in the most mediocre of writings is its
presence to be felt. And indeed, than
this, nothing could prove more clearly that
the pressure of the soul has increased among
mankind, and that its mysterious influence
is diffusing itself among the people. But
we are now drawing near to things that are
well-nigh unspeakable, and such examples
as one can give are necessarily ordinary and
incomplete. The following are elementary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and readily appreciable. In former days,
if there was question, for a moment, of a
presentiment, of the strange impression
produced by a chance meeting or a look,
of a decision that the unknown side of
human reason had governed, of an intervention,
or a force, inexplicable and yet
understood, of the secret laws of sympathy
and antipathy, of elective and instinctive
affinities, of the overwhelming influence of
the thing that had not been spoken&mdash;in
former days, these problems would have
been carelessly passed by, and, besides, it
was but seldom that they intruded themselves
upon the serenity of the thinker.
They seemed to come about by the merest
chance. That they are ever pressing upon
life, unceasingly and with prodigious force&mdash;this
was unsuspected of all&mdash;and the
philosopher hastened back to familiar
studies of passion, and of incident that
floated on the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>These spiritual phenomena, to which, in
bygone days, even the greatest and wisest
of our brothers scarcely gave a thought,
are to-day being earnestly studied by the
very smallest; and herein are we shown
once again that the human soul is a plant
of matchless unity, whose branches, when
the hour is come, all burst into blossom
together. The peasant, to whom the power
of expressing that which lies in his soul
should suddenly be given, would at this
moment pour forth ideas that were not yet
in the soul of Racine. And thus it is that
men of a genius much inferior to that of
Shakespeare or Racine have yet had revealed
to them glimpses of a secretly luminous
life, whose outer crust, alone, had come
within the ken of those masters. For,
however great the soul, it avails not that it
should wander in isolation through space
or time. Unaided, it can do but little.
It is the flower of the multitude. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the spiritual sea is storm-tossed, and its
whole surface restless and troubled, then is
the moment ripe for the mighty soul to
appear; but if it come at time of slumber,
its utterance will be but of the dreams of
sleep. Hamlet&mdash;to take the most illustrious
of all examples&mdash;Hamlet, at Elsinore&mdash;at
every moment does he advance to the
very brink of awakening; and yet, though
his haggard face be damp with icy sweat,
there are words that he cannot utter, words
that to-day would doubtless flow readily
from his lips, because the soul of the
passer-by, be he tramp or thief, would be
there to help him. For, in truth, it would
seem that already there are fewer veils that
enwrap the soul; and were Hamlet now to
look into the eyes of his mother, or of
Claudius, there would be revealed to him
the things that, then, he did not know. Is
it thoroughly clear to you&mdash;this is one of
the strangest, most disquieting of truths&mdash;is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
it thoroughly clear to you that, if there
be evil in your heart, your mere presence
will probably proclaim it to-day a hundred
times more clearly than would have been
the case two or three centuries ago? Is it
fully borne home to you that if you have
perchance this morning done anything that
shall have brought sadness to a single
human being, the peasant, with whom you
are about to talk of the rain or the storm,
will know of it&mdash;his soul will have been
warned even before his hand has thrown
open the door? Though you assume the
face of a saint, a hero or a martyr, the eye
of the passing child will not greet you
with the same unapproachable smile if
there lurk within you an evil thought, an
injustice, or a brother’s tears. A hundred
years ago the soul of that child would
perhaps have passed, unheeding, by the side
of yours....</p>

<p>Truly it is becoming difficult to cherish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
hatred, envy, or treachery in one’s heart,
secure from observation; for the souls
even of the most indifferent are incessantly
keeping vigil around us. Our ancestors
have not spoken of these things, and we
realise that the life in which we bestir ourselves
is quite other than that which they
have depicted. Have they deceived us, or
did they not know? Signs and words no
longer count for anything, and in mystic
circles it is the mere presence that decides
almost all.</p>

<p>Even the ancient ‘will-power’&mdash;the
logical will-power that men have professed
to understand so well&mdash;even this is being
transformed in its turn, and moulded beneath
the pressure of mighty, deep searching,
inexplicable laws. The last refuges
are disappearing, and men are drawing
closer to each other. Far above words and
acts do they judge their fellows&mdash;nay, far
above thought&mdash;for that which they see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
though they understand it not, lies well
beyond the domain of thought. And this
is one of the great signs by which the
spiritual periods I spoke of before shall be
known. It is felt on all sides that the
conditions of work-a-day life are changing,
and the youngest of us already differ entirely
in speech and action from the men
of the preceding generation. A mass of
useless conventions, habits, pretences, and
intermediaries are being swept into the
gulf; and it is by the invisible alone that,
though we know it not, nearly all of us
judge each other. If I enter your room
for the first time you will not pronounce
the secret sentence that, according to the
laws of practical psychology, each man pronounces
in the presence of his fellow. In
vain shall you try to tell me whither you
have been to learn who I am, but you
shall come back to me, bearing the weight
of unspeakable certitudes. Your father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
perhaps, would have judged me otherwise,
and would have been mistaken. We can
but believe that man will soon touch man,
and that the atmosphere will change.
‘Have we,’ asks Claude de Saint-Martin,
the great ‘unknown philosopher,’ ‘have
we advanced one step further on the
radiant path of enlightenment, that leads
to the simplicity of men?’ Let us wait
in silence: perhaps ere long we shall be
conscious of ‘the murmur of the gods.’</p>

<h2 class="p4 b2">THE PRE-DESTINED</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THEY are known to most men, and
there are few mothers who have not
seen them. Perhaps they are as inevitable
as life’s sorrows; and the men among
whom they dwell become the better for
the knowledge of them, and the sadder,
and the more gentle.</p>

<p>They are strange. As children, life
seems nearer to them than to other
children; they appear to suspect nothing,
and yet is there in their eyes so profound
a certainty that we feel they must know
all, that there must have been evenings
when they found time to tell themselves
their secret. At the moment when their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
brothers are still groping their way blindly
in the mysterious land between birth and
life, they have already understood; they
are erect, ready with hand and soul. In
all haste, but wisely and with minute care,
do they prepare themselves to live; and
this very haste is a sign upon which
mothers, the discreet, unsuspected confidants
of all that cannot be told, can scarce bring
themselves to look.</p>

<p>Their stay among us is often so short
that we are unconscious of their presence;
they go away without saying a word, and
are for ever unknown to us. But others
there are who linger for a moment, who
look at us with an eager smile, and seem to
be on the point of confessing that they
know all; and then, towards their twentieth
year, they leave us, hurriedly, muffling their
footsteps, as though they had just discovered
that they had chosen the wrong
dwelling-place, and had been about to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
their lives among men whom they did not
know.</p>

<p>They themselves say but little, and there
is a cloud that falls around them at the
moment when men seem on the point of
touching them, or when hurt has been done
them. Some days there are when they
seem to be of us, and among us, but a
sudden evening comes and they are so far
away that we dare not look at them, or ask
a question. It is as though they were on
life’s further shore, and the feeling rushes
in upon us that now, at last, the hour has
come for affirming that which is graver,
deeper, more human, more real than friendship,
pity or love; for saying the thing
that is piteously flapping its wings at the
back of our throat, and craving for utterance&mdash;the
thing that our ignorance crushes,
that we never have said, that we never
shall say, for so many lives are spent in
silence! And time rushes on; and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
is there of us but has lingered and waited
till it was too late, and there was no one to
listen to his words?</p>

<p>Why have they come to us&mdash;why do
they go so soon? Is it only that we may
be convinced of the utter aimlessness of life?
It is a mystery that ever eludes us, and all
our searchings are vain. I have often seen
these things happen; one day they were so
near to me that I scarcely knew was it myself
or another whom they concerned....</p>

<p>For it was thus that my brother died.
And though he alone had heard the warning
whisper, be it ever so unconsciously&mdash;for
from his earliest days he had concealed the
message of disease within him&mdash;yet surely
had the knowledge of what was to come
been borne in upon us also. What are the
signs that set apart the creatures for whom
dire events lie in wait? Nothing is visible,
and yet all is revealed. They are afraid of
us, for that we are ever crying out to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of our knowledge, struggle against it as we
may; and when we are with them, they can
see that, in our hearts, we are oppressed by
their destiny. Something there is that we
hide from most men, and we ourselves are
ignorant of what this thing may be. Strange
secrets of life and death pass between two
creatures who meet for the first time; and
many other secrets besides, nameless to this
day, but which at once thrust their impress
upon our bearing, our features, the look of
our eyes; and even while we press the hand
of our friend, our soul will have soared
perhaps beyond the confines of this life. It
may be that when two men are together,
they are unconscious of any hidden thoughts,
but there are things that lie deeper, and are
far more imperious, than thought. We are
not the lords of these unfathomable gifts;
and we are ever betraying the presence of
the prophet to whom speech is not given.
We are never the same with others as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
when we are alone; we are different,
even, when we are in the dark with them,
and the look in our eyes changes as the
past or future flashes before us; and therefore
it is that, though we know it not,
we are ever watchful and on our guard.
When we meet those who are not to live
long, we are only conscious of the fate that
is hanging over them; we see nothing else.
If they could they would deceive us, so
that they might the more readily deceive
themselves. They do all in their power to
mislead us; they imagine that their eager
smile, their burning interest in life, will
conceal the truth; but none the less does
the event already loom large before us, and
seem indeed to be the mainstay, nay, the
very reason of their existence. Death has
again betrayed them, and they realise, in
bitter sadness, that nothing is hidden from
us, that there are certain voices that cannot
be still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Who can tell us of the power which
events possess&mdash;whether they issue from
us, or whether we owe our being to them?
Do we attract them, or are we attracted by
them? Do we mould them, or do they
mould us? Are they always unerring in
their course? Why do they come to us
like the bee to the hive, like the dove
to the cote; and where do they find a
resting-place when we are not there to
meet them? Whence is it that they come
to us; and why are they shaped in our
image, as though they were our brothers?
Are their workings in the past or in the
future; and are the more powerful of them
those that are no longer, or those that are
not yet? Is it to-day or to-morrow that
moulds us? Do we not all spend the
greater part of our lives under the shadow
of an event that has not yet come to pass?
I have noticed the same grave gestures, the
footsteps that seemed to tend towards a goal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
that was all too near, the presentiments that
chilled the blood, the fixed, immovable look&mdash;I
have noticed all these in the men, even,
whose end was to come about by accident,
the men on whom death would suddenly
seize from without. And yet were they as
eager as their brethren, who bore the seeds
of death within them. Their faces were
the same. To them, too, life was fraught
with more seriousness than to those who
were to live their full span. The same
careful, silent watchfulness marked their
actions. They had no time to lose; they
had to be in readiness at the same hour;
so completely had this event, which no
prophet could have foretold, become the
very life of their life.</p>

<p>It is death that is the guide of our life,
and our life has no goal but death. Our
death is the mould into which our life
flows: it is death that has shaped our
features. Of the dead alone should portraits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
be painted, for it is only they who
are truly themselves, and who, for one
instant, stand revealed even as they are.
What life is there but becomes radiant
when the pure, cold, simple light falls on
it at the last hour? It is, perhaps, the
same light that floats around children’s
faces when they smile at us; and the
silence that steals over us then is akin to
that of the chamber where there will be
peace for evermore. I have known many
whom the same death was leading by the
hand, and when my memory dwells upon
them I see a band of children, of youths and
maidens, who seem to be all coming forth
from the same house. A strange fraternity
already unites them: it may be that they
recognise each other by birth-marks we
cannot discover, that they furtively exchange
solemn signals of silence. They
are the eager children of precocious death.
At school we were vaguely conscious of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
them. They seemed to be at the same
time seeking and avoiding each other,
like people who are afflicted with the same
infirmity. They were to be seen together,
in remote corners of the garden, under the
trees. Their mysterious smile flew fitfully
across their lips, and there lurked a gravity
beneath, a curious fear lest a secret should
escape. Silence would almost always fall
upon them, when those who were to live
drew near. Were they already speaking
of the event, or did they know that the
event was speaking through them, and in
their despite? Were they forming a circle
round it, and trying to keep it hidden from
indifferent eyes? There were times when
they seemed to be looking down upon us
from a lofty tower; and, for all that we
were the stronger, we dared not molest
them. For truly there is nothing that can
ever be really hidden; and whosoever
meets me knows all that I have done and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
shall do, all that I have thought and do
think&mdash;nay, he knows the very day on
which I shall die; but the means of telling
what he knows is not given to him, though
he speak never so softly, and whisper to
his heart. We pass heedlessly by the side
of all that our hands cannot touch; and
perhaps too great a knowledge would be
ours if all that we do know were revealed
to us. Our real life is not the life we live,
and we feel that our deepest, nay, our most
intimate thoughts are quite apart from ourselves,
for we are other than our thoughts
and our dreams. And it is only at special
moments&mdash;it may be by merest accident&mdash;that
we live our own life. Will the day ever
dawn when we shall be what we are?...
In the meanwhile, we felt that they were
strangers in our midst. A sensation of
awe crept into our life. Sometimes they
would walk with us along the corridor, or
in the courtyard, and we could scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
keep pace with them. Sometimes they
would join us at our games, and the game
would no longer be the same. There were
some who could not find their brethren.
They would wander in solitude in our
midst, while we played and shouted: they
had no friends among those who were not
about to die. And yet we loved them,
and the deepest friendliness shone from
their eyes. What was there that divided
us from them? What is there that divides
us all? What is this sea of mysteries in
whose depths we have our being? The
love that we felt was the love that seeks
not to express itself, because it is not of
this world. It is a love, perhaps, that
cannot be put to the proof; it may seem
feeble, uncertain, and the smallest, most
ordinary friendship may appear to triumph
over it&mdash;but none the less does its life lie
deeper than our life, and none the less,
notwithstanding its seeming indifference,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
is it reserved for a time when doubt and
uncertainty shall be no longer....</p>

<p>Its voice does not make itself heard now
because its moment for speaking has not
yet come; and it is never those whom we
enfold in our arms that we love the most
deeply. For there is a side of life&mdash;and it
is the best, the purest, the noblest side&mdash;which
never blends with the ordinary life,
and the eyes even of lovers themselves can
seldom pierce through the masonry that is
built up of silence and love....</p>

<p>Or was it that we avoided them, because,
though younger than ourselves, they
still were our elders?... Did we know
that they were not of our age, and did we
fear them, as though they were sitting in
judgment upon us? A curious steadfastness
already lurked in their eyes; and if,
in our moments of agitation, their glance
rested upon us, it would soothe and comfort
us, we knew not why, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
would be an instant of strangest silence.
We would turn round: they were watching
us and smiling gravely. There were
two for whom a violent death was lying in
wait&mdash;I remember their faces well. But
almost all were timid, and tried to pass by
unperceived. They were weighed down
by some deadly sense of shame, they
seemed to be ever beseeching forgiveness
for a fault they knew not of, but which
was near at hand. They came towards us
and our eyes met; we drew asunder,
silently, and all was clear to us, though we
knew nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a><br /><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4 b2">MYSTIC MORALITY</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is only too evident that the invisible
agitations of the kingdoms within us
are arbitrarily set on foot by the thoughts
we shelter. Our myriad intuitions are the
veiled queens who steer our course through
life, though we have no words in which to
speak of them. How strangely do we
diminish a thing as soon as we try to
express it in words! We believe we have
dived down to the most unfathomable
depths, and when we reappear on the
surface, the drop of water that glistens on
our trembling finger-tips no longer resembles
the sea from which it came. We
believe we have discovered a grotto that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
stored with bewildering treasure; we come
back to the light of day, and the gems we
have brought are false&mdash;mere pieces of
glass&mdash;and yet does the treasure shine on,
unceasingly, in the darkness! There is
something between ourselves and our soul
that nothing can penetrate; and there are
moments, says Emerson, ‘in which we
court suffering, in the hope that here at
least we shall find reality, sharp peaks and
edges of truth.’</p>

<p>I have said elsewhere that the souls of
mankind seemed to be drawing nearer to
each other, and even if this be not a statement
that can be proved, it is none the less
based upon deep-rooted, though obscure,
convictions. It is indeed difficult to
advance facts in its support, for facts are
nothing but the laggards, the spies and
camp followers of the great forces we
cannot see. But surely there are moments
when we seem to feel, more deeply than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
did our fathers before us, that we are not
in the presence of ourselves alone. Neither
those who believe in a God, nor those who
disbelieve, are found to act in themselves
as though they were sure of being alone.
We are watched, we are under strictest
supervision, and it comes from elsewhere
than the indulgent darknesses of each
man’s conscience! Perhaps the spiritual
vases are less closely sealed now than in
bygone days, perhaps more power has
come to the waves of the sea within us?
I know not: all that we can state with
certainty is that we no longer attach the
same importance to a certain number of
traditional faults, but this is in itself a
token of a spiritual victory.</p>

<p>It would seem as though our code of
morality were changing&mdash;advancing with
timid steps towards loftier regions that
cannot yet be seen. And the moment has
perhaps come when certain new questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
should be asked. What would happen,
let us say, if our soul were suddenly to
take visible shape, and were compelled to
advance into the midst of her assembled
sisters, stripped of all her veils, but laden
with her most secret thoughts, and dragging
behind her the most mysterious, inexplicable
acts of her life? Of what would she be
ashamed? Which are the things she fain
would hide? Would she, like a bashful
maiden, cloak beneath her long hair the
numberless sins of the flesh? She knows
not of them, and those sins have never
come near her. They were committed a
thousand miles from her throne; and the
soul even of the prostitute would pass
unsuspectingly through the crowd, with
the transparent smile of the child in her
eyes. She has not interfered, she was
living her life where the light fell on
her, and it is this life only that she can
recall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Are there any sins or crimes of which
she could be guilty? Has she betrayed,
deceived, lied? Has she inflicted suffering
or been the cause of tears? Where was
she while this man delivered over his
brother to the enemy? Perhaps, far away
from him, she was sobbing; and from
that moment she will have become more
beautiful and more profound. She will
feel no shame for that which she has not
done; she can remain pure in the midst of
terrible murder. Often, she will transform
into inner radiance all the evil wrought
before her. These things are governed by
an invisible principle; and hence, doubtless,
has arisen the inexplicable indulgence of the
gods.</p>

<p>And our indulgence, too. Strive as we
may, we are bound to pardon; and when
death, ‘the great Conciliator,’ has passed
by, is there one of us who does not fall on
his knees and silently, with every token of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
forgiveness, bend over the departing soul?
When I stand before the rigid body of my
bitterest enemy: when I look upon the
pale lips that slandered me, the sightless
eyes that so often brought the tears to
mine, the cold hands that may have
wrought me so much wrong&mdash;do you
imagine that I can still think of revenge?
Death has come and atoned for all. I
have no grievance against the soul of the
man before me. Instinctively do I recognise
that it soars high above the gravest faults
and the cruellest wrongs (and how admirable
and full of significance is this instinct!).
If there linger still a regret within me, it is
not that I am unable to inflict suffering in
my turn, but it is perhaps that my love was
not great enough and that my forgiveness
has come too late....</p>

<p>One might almost believe that these
things were already understood by us, deep
down in our soul. We do not judge our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
fellows by their acts&mdash;nay, not even by
their most secret thoughts; for these are
not always undiscernible, and we go far
beyond the undiscernible. A man shall
have committed crimes reputed to be the
vilest of all, and yet it may be that even
the blackest of these shall not have
tarnished, for one single moment, the
breath of fragrance and ethereal purity that
surrounds his presence; while at the
approach of a philosopher or martyr our
soul may be steeped in unendurable gloom.
It may happen that a saint or hero shall
choose his friend from among men whose
faces bear the stamp of every degraded
thought; and that, by the side of others,
whose brows are radiant with lofty and
magnanimous dreams, he shall not feel a
‘human and brotherly atmosphere’ about
him. What tidings do these things bring
us? And wherein lies their significance?
Are there laws deeper than those by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
deeds and thoughts are governed? What are
the things we have learned and why do we
always act in accordance with rules that none
ever mention, but which are the only rules
that cannot err? For it may be boldly
declared that, appearances notwithstanding,
neither hero nor saint has chosen wrongly.
They have but obeyed, and even though
the saint be deceived and sold by the man
he has preferred, still will there abide with
him something imperishable, something by
which he shall know that he was right and
that he has nothing to regret. The soul
will ever remember that the other soul was
pure....</p>

<p>When we venture to move the mysterious
stone that covers these mysteries, the
heavily charged air surges up from the gulf,
and words and thoughts fall around us like
poisoned flies. Even our inner life seems
trivial by the side of these unchanging
deepnesses. When the angels stand before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
you, will you glory in never having sinned;
and is there not an inferior innocence?
When Jesus read the wretched thoughts of
the Pharisees who surrounded the paralytic
of Capernaum, are you sure that as He
looked at them, He judged their soul&mdash;and
condemned it&mdash;without beholding, far away
behind their thoughts, a brightness that was
perhaps everlasting? And would He be a
God if His condemnation were irrevocable?
But why does He speak as though He
lingered on the threshold? Will the basest
thought or the noblest inspiration leave a
mark on the diamond’s surface? What god,
that is indeed on the heights, but must smile
at our gravest faults, as we smile at the
puppies on the hearthrug? And what god
would he be who would not smile? If you
become truly pure, do you think you will
try to conceal the petty motives of your
great actions from the eyes of the angels
before you? And yet are there not in us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
many things that will look pitiful indeed
before the gods assembled on the mountain?
Surely that must be, and our soul knows
full well that it will have to render its
account. It lives in silence, and the hand
of a great judge is ever upon it, though his
sentences are beyond our ken. What
accounts will it have to render? Where
shall we find the code of morality that can
enlighten us? Is there a mysterious
morality that holds sway in regions far
beyond our thoughts? Are our most
secret desires only the helpless satellites of a
central star, that is hidden from our eyes?
Does a transparent tree exist within us,
and are all our actions and all our virtues
only its ephemeral flowers and leaves?
Indeed we know not what are the wrongs
that our soul can commit, nor what there
can be that should make us blush before a
higher intelligence or before another soul;
and yet which of us feels that he is pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and does not dread the coming of the
judge? And where is there a soul that is
not afraid of another soul?</p>

<p class="pc2 elarge">*</p>

<p class="p2">Here, we are no longer in the well-known
valleys of human and psychic life.
We find ourselves at the door of the third
enclosure: that of the divine life of the
mystics. We have to grope timidly, and
make sure of every footstep, as we cross the
threshold. And even when the threshold
is crossed, where shall certainty be found?
Where shall we discover those marvellous
laws that we are perhaps constantly
disobeying: laws of whose existence our
conscience is ignorant, though our soul has
been warned? Whence comes the shadow
of a mysterious transgression that at times
creeps over our life and makes it so hard
to bear? What are the great spiritual sins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of which we can be guilty? Will it be our
shame to have striven against our soul, or
is there an invisible struggle between our
soul and God? And is this struggle so
strangely silent that not even a whisper
floats on the air? Is there a moment
when we can hear the queen whose lips
are sealed? She is sternly silent when
events do but float on the surface; but
there are others perhaps that we scarcely
heed, which have their roots deep down in
eternity. Some one is dying, some one
looks at you, or cries, some other is
coming towards you for the first time, or
an enemy is passing by&mdash;may she not
perhaps whisper then? And if you listened
to her, while already you no longer love,
in the future, the friend at whom you now
are smiling? But all this is nothing, and
is not even near to the outer lights of
the abyss. One cannot speak of these
things&mdash;the solitude is too great. ‘In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
truth,’ says Novalis, ‘it is only here and
there that the soul bestirs itself; when will
it move as a whole, and when will humanity
begin to feel with one conscience?’ It is
only when this takes place that some will
learn. We must wait in patience till this
superior conscience be gradually, slowly,
formed. Then perhaps some one will
come to whom it will be given to express
what it is that we all feel as regards this
side of the soul, which is like to the face of
the moon, that none have perceived since
the world began.</p>

<h2 class="p4 b2">ON WOMEN</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">IN these domains also are the laws unknown.
Far above our heads, in the
very centre of the sky, shines the star of
our destined love; and it is in the atmosphere
of that star, and illumined by its
rays, that every passion that stirs us will
come to life, even to the end. And
though we choose to right or to left of us,
on the heights or in the shallows; though,
in our struggle to break through the
enchanted circle that is drawn around all
the acts of our life, we do violence to the
instinct that moves us, and try our hardest
to choose against the choice of destiny, yet
shall the woman we elect always have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to us straight from the unvarying star.
And if, like Don Juan, we take a thousand
and three to our embraces, still shall we
find, on that evening when arms fall
asunder and lips disunite, that it is always
the same woman, good or bad, tender or
cruel, loving or faithless, that is standing
before us.</p>

<p>For indeed we can never emerge from
the little circle of light that destiny traces
about our footsteps; and one might almost
believe that the extent and the hue of this
impassable ring are known even to the
men who are furthest from us. It is the
tinge of its spiritual rays that they perceive
first of all, and therefore will it come about
that they will either smilingly hold out
their hand to us or draw it back in fear.
A superior atmosphere exists, in which we
all know each other; and there is a
mysterious truth&mdash;deeper far than the
material truth&mdash;to which we at once have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
recourse, when we try to form a conception
of a stranger. Have we not all experienced
these things, which take place in the
impenetrable regions of almost astral
humanity? If you receive a letter that
has come to you from some far-away island
lost in the heart of the ocean, from a
stranger whose very existence was unknown
to you, are you quite sure that it is
really a stranger who has written to you?
And, as you read, do not certain deep-rooted,
infallible convictions&mdash;to which
ordinary convictions are as nothing&mdash;come
to you concerning this soul that is thus
meeting yours, in spheres known to the
gods alone? And, further, can you not
understand that this soul, that was dreaming
of yours, heedless of time or space,
that this soul, too, had certitudes akin to
your own? Strangest recognitions take
place on all sides, and we cannot hide our
existence. Perhaps nothing brings into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
broader daylight the subtle bonds that
interconnect all mankind than the little
mysteries which attend the exchange of a
few letters between two strangers. This
is perhaps one of the minute crevices&mdash;wretchedly
insignificant, no doubt, but so
few there are that the faintest glimmer of
light must content us&mdash;this is perhaps one
of the minute crevices in the door of darkness,
through which we are allowed to
peer for one instant, and so conceive to
ourselves what must be taking place in the
grotto of treasures, undiscovered to this
day. Look through the passive correspondence
of any man, and you shall find
in it an astonishing unity. I know neither
of the two men who have written to me this
morning, yet am I already aware that my
reply to the one will differ in its essence
from my reply to the other. I have
caught a glimpse of the invisible. And,
in my turn, when some one, whom I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
never seen, writes to me, I know quite
well that had he been writing to the friend
who is now before me, his letter had not
been exactly the same. A difference will
there always be&mdash;but it is spiritual and
intangible. It is the invisible signal of the
soul that salutes its fellow. Doubtless
must there be regions outside our ken
where none are unknown; a common
fatherland whither we may go and meet
each other, and whence the return knows
no hardship.</p>

<p>And it is in this common fatherland
also that we chose the women we loved,
wherefore it is that we cannot have erred,
nor can they have erred either. The
kingdom of love is, before all else, the
great kingdom of certitude, for it is within
its bounds that the soul is possessed of the
utmost leisure. There, truly, they have
naught to do but to recognise each other,
offer deepest admiration, and ask their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
questions&mdash;tearfully, like the maid who
has found the sister she had lost&mdash;while,
far away from them, arm links itself in arm
and breaths are mingling.... At last
has a moment come when they can smile
and live their own life&mdash;for a truce has
been called in the stern routine of daily
existence&mdash;and it is perhaps from the
heights of this smile and these ineffable
glances that springs the mysterious perfume
that pervades love’s dreariest moments,
that preserves for ever the memory of the
time when the lips first met....</p>

<p>Of the true, pre-destined love alone, do
I speak here. When Fate sends forth the
woman it has chosen for us&mdash;sends her
forth from the fastnesses of the great
spiritual cities in which we, all unconsciously,
dwell, and she awaits us at the
crossing of the road we have to traverse
when the hour is come&mdash;we are warned at
the first glance. Some there are who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
attempt to force the hand of Fate. Wildly
pressing down their eyelids, so as not to
see that which had to be seen&mdash;struggling
with all their puny strength against the
eternal forces&mdash;they will contrive perhaps
to cross the road and go towards another,
sent thither but not for them. But, strive
as they may, they will not succeed in
‘stirring up the dead waters that lie in
the great tarn of the future.’ Nothing
will happen; the pure force will not
descend from the heights, and those wasted
hours and kisses will never become part
of the real hours and kisses of their
life....</p>

<p>There are times when destiny shuts her
eyes, but she knows full well that, when
evening falls, we shall return to her, and
that the last word must be hers. She may
shut her eyes, but the time till she re-open
them is time that is lost....</p>

<p>It would seem that women are more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
largely swayed by destiny than ourselves.
They submit to its decrees with far more
simplicity; nor is there sincerity in the
resistance they offer. They are still
nearer to God, and yield themselves with
less reserve to the pure workings of the
mystery. And therefore is it, doubtless,
that all the incidents in our life in which
they take part seem to bring us nearer to
what might almost be the very fountain-head
of destiny. It is above all when by
their side that moments come, unexpectedly,
when a ‘clear presentiment’ flashes across
us, a presentiment of a life that does not
always seem parallel to the life we know of.
They lead us close to the gates of our
being. May it not be during one of those
profound moments, when his head is
pillowed on a woman’s breast, that the
hero learns to know the strength and
steadfastness of his star? And indeed will
any true sentiment of the future ever come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to the man who has not had his resting-place
in a woman’s heart?</p>

<p>Yet again do we enter the troubled
circles of the higher conscience. Ah! how
true it is that, here, too, ‘the so-called
psychology is a hobgoblin that has usurped,
in the sanctuary itself, the place reserved
for the veritable images of the gods.’ For
it is not the surface that always concerns us&mdash;nay,
nor is it even the deepest of hidden
thoughts. Do you imagine that love knows
only of thoughts, and acts, and words, and
that the soul never emerges from its
dungeon? Do I need to be told whether
she whom I take in my arms to-day is
jealous or faithful, gay or sad, sincere or
treacherous? Do you think that these
wretched words can attain the heights
whereon our souls repose and where our
destiny fulfils itself in silence? What
care I whether she speak of rain or jewels,
of pins or feathers; what care I though she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
appear not to understand? Do you think
that it is for a sublime word I thirst when
I feel that a soul is gazing into my soul?
Do I not know that the most beautiful of
thoughts dare not raise their heads when
the mysteries confront them? I am ever
standing at the sea-shore; and, were I
Plato, Pascal, or Michael Angelo, and the
woman I loved merely telling me of her
earrings, the words I would say and the
words she would say would appear but the
same as they floated on the waves of the
fathomless inner sea, that each of us would
be contemplating in the other. Let but
my very loftiest thought be weighed in the
scale of life or love, it will not turn the
balance against the three little words that
the maid who loves me shall have whispered
of her silver bangles, her pearl necklace, or
her trinkets of glass....</p>

<p>It is we who do not understand, for that
we never rise above the earth-level of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
intellect. Let us but ascend to the first
snows of the mountain, and all inequalities
are levelled by the purifying hand of the
horizon that opens before us. What difference
then between a pronouncement of
Marcus Aurelius and the words of the
child complaining of the cold? Let us be
humble, and learn to distinguish between
accident and essence. Let not ‘sticks that
float’ cause us to forget the prodigies of
the gulf. The most glorious thoughts and
the most degraded ideas can no more ruffle
the eternal surface of our soul than,
amidst the stars of Heaven, Himalaya or
precipice can alter the surface of the earth.
A look, a kiss, and the certainty of a great
invisible presence: all is said; and I know
that she who is by my side is my equal....</p>

<p>But truly this equal is admirable, and
strange; and, when love comes to her, even
the lowest of wantons possesses that which
we never have, inasmuch as, in her thoughts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
love is always eternal. Therefore it is,
perhaps, that, besides their primitive instincts,
all women have communications
with the unknown that are denied to us.
Great is the distance that separates the best
of men from the treasures of the second
boundary; and, when a solemn moment of
life demands a jewel from this treasure,
they no longer remember the paths that
thither lead, and vainly offer to the imperious,
undeceivable circumstance the false
trinkets that their intellect has fashioned.
But the woman never forgets the path that
leads to the centre of her being; and no
matter whether I find her in opulence or in
poverty, in ignorance or in fulness of
knowledge, in shame or in glory, do I but
whisper one word that has truly come forth
from the virgin depths of my soul, she will
retrace her footsteps along the mysterious
paths that she has never forgotten, and
without a moment’s hesitation will she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
bring back to me, from out her inexhaustible
stores of love, a word, a look, or a
gesture that shall be no less pure than my
own. It is as though her soul were ever
within call; for by day and night is she
prepared to give answer to the loftiest
appeals from another soul; and the ransom
of the poorest is undistinguishable from the
ransom of a queen....</p>

<p>With reverence must we draw near to
them, be they lowly or arrogant, inattentive
or lost in dreams, be they smiling still or
plunged in tears; for they know the things
that we do not know, and have a lamp that
we have lost. Their abiding-place is at the
foot itself of the Inevitable, whose well-worn
paths are visible to them more clearly
than to us. And thence it is that their
strange intuitions have come to them, their
gravity at which we wonder; and we feel
that, even in their most trifling actions,
they are conscious of being upheld by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
strong, unerring hands of the gods. I said
before that they drew us nearer to the
gates of our being: verily might we believe,
when we are with them, that that primeval
gate is opening, amidst the bewildering
whisper that doubtless waited on the birth
of things, then when speech was yet hushed,
for fear lest command or forbidding should
issue forth, unheard....</p>

<p>She will never cross the threshold of that
gate; and she awaits us within, where are
the fountain-heads. And when we come
and knock from without, and she opens
to our bidding, her hand will still keep
hold of latch and key. She will look, for
one instant, at the man who has been sent
to her, and in that brief moment she has
learned all that had to be learned, and the
years to come have trembled to the end
of time.... Who shall tell us of what
consists the first look of love, ‘that magic
wand made of a ray of broken light,’ the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
ray that has issued forth from the eternal
home of our being, that has transformed
two souls, and given them twenty centuries
of youth? The door may open again, or
close; pay no heed, nor make further
effort, for all is decided. She knows. She
will no longer concern herself with the
things you do, or say, or even think; and
if she notice them, it will be but with a
smile, and unconsciously will she fling from
her all that does not help to confirm the
certitudes of that first glance. And if you
think you have deceived her, and that
her impression is wrong, be sure that it is
she who is right, and you yourself who are
mistaken; for you are more truly that
which you are in her eyes than that which
in your soul you believe yourself to be,
and this even though she may forever misinterpret
the meaning of a gesture, a smile
or a tear....</p>

<p>Hidden treasures that have not even a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
name!... I would that all those who have
suffered at women’s hands, and found them
evil, would loudly proclaim it, and give us
their reasons; and if those reasons be well
founded we shall be indeed surprised, and
shall have advanced far forward in the
mystery. For women are indeed the veiled
sisters of all the great things we do not
see. They are indeed nearest of kin to the
infinite that is about us, and they alone can
still smile at it with the intimate grace of
the child, to whom its father inspires no
fear. It is they who preserve here below
the pure fragrance of our soul, like some
jewel from Heaven, which none know how
to use; and were they to depart, the spirit
would reign in solitude in a desert. Theirs
are still the divine emotions of the first
days; and the sources of their being lie,
deeper far than ours, in all that was illimitable.
Those who complain of them know
not the heights whereon the true kisses are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to be found, and verily do I pity them.
And yet, how insignificant do women seem
when we look at them as we pass by! We
see them moving about in their little
homes; this one is bending forward, down
there another is sobbing, a third sings
and the last sews; and there is not one
of us who understands.... We visit them,
as one visits pleasant things; we approach
them with caution and suspicion, and it is
scarcely possible for the soul to enter. We
question them, mistrustfully&mdash;they, who
know already, answer naught, and we go
away, shrugging our shoulders, convinced
that they do not understand.... ‘But what
need for them to understand,’ answers
the poet, who is always right, ‘what need
for them to understand, those thrice happy
ones who have chosen the better part, and
who, even as a pure flame of love in this
earth of ours, token of the celestial fire that
irradiates all things, shine forth only from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the pinnacles of temples and the mastheads
of ships that wander? Some of Nature’s
strangest secrets are often revealed, at
sacred moments, to these maidens who love,
and ingenuously and unconsciously will they
declare them. The sage follows in their
footsteps to gather up the jewels, that in
their innocence and joy they scatter along
the path. The poet, who feels what they
feel, offers homage to their love, and tries,
in his songs, to transplant that love, that is
the germ of the age of gold, to other times
and other countries.’ For what has been
said of the mystics applies above all to
women, since it is they who have preserved
the sense of the mystic in our earth to this
day....</p>

<p class="pc4 slarge">THE TRAGICAL IN<br />DAILY LIFE</p>

<hr class="chap p4" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a><br /><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4 b2">THE TRAGICAL IN<br />DAILY LIFE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is a tragic element in the life
of every day that is far more real,
far more penetrating, far more akin to the
true self that is in us than the tragedy that
lies in great adventure. But, readily as
we all may feel this, to prove it is by no
means easy, inasmuch as this essential tragic
element comprises more than that which is
merely material or merely psychological.
It goes beyond the determined struggle of
man against man, and desire against desire:
it goes beyond the eternal conflict of duty
and passion. Its province is rather to
reveal to us how truly wonderful is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
mere act of living, and to throw light
upon the existence of the soul, self-contained
in the midst of ever-restless immensities;
to hush the discourse of reason
and sentiment, so that above the tumult
may be heard the solemn, uninterrupted
whisperings of man and his destiny. It is
its province to point out to us the uncertain,
dolorous footsteps of the being, as he
approaches, or wanders from, his truth, his
beauty, or his God. And further, to show
us, and make us understand, the countless
other things therewith connected, of which
tragic poets have but vouchsafed us passing
glimpses. And here do we come to an
essential point, for could not these things,
of which we have had only passing glimpses,
be placed in front of the others, and shown
to us first of all? The mysterious chant
of the Infinite, the ominous silence of the
soul and of God, the murmur of Eternity
on the horizon, the destiny or fatality that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
we are conscious of within us, though by
what tokens none can tell&mdash;do not all these
underlie King Lear, Macbeth, Hamlet?
And would it not be possible, by some
interchanging of the rôles, to bring them
nearer to us, and send the actors farther
off? Is it beyond the mark to say that
the true tragic element, normal, deep-rooted,
and universal, that the true tragic
element of life only begins at the moment
when so-called adventures, sorrows, and
dangers have disappeared? Is the arm of
happiness not longer than that of sorrow,
and do not certain of its attributes draw
nearer to the soul? Must we indeed roar
like the Atrides, before the Eternal God
will reveal Himself in our life? and is He
never by our side at times when the air is
calm, and the lamp burns on, unflickering?
When we think of it, is it not the tranquillity
that is terrible, the tranquillity
watched by the stars? and is it in tumult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
or in silence that the spirit of life quickens
within us? Is it not when we are told, at
the end of the story, ‘They were happy,’
that the great disquiet should intrude
itself? What is taking place while they
are happy? Are there not elements of
deeper gravity and stability in happiness,
in a single moment of repose, than in the
whirlwind of passion? Is it not then that
we at last behold the march of time&mdash;ay,
and of many another on-stealing besides,
more secret still&mdash;is it not then that the
hours rush forward? Are not deeper
chords set vibrating by all these things
than by the dagger-stroke of conventional
drama? Is it not at the very moment
when a man believes himself secure from
bodily death that the strange and silent
tragedy of the being and the immensities
does indeed raise its curtain on the stage?
Is it while I flee before a naked sword that
my existence touches its most interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
point? Is life always at its sublimest in a
kiss? Are there not other moments, when
one hears purer voices that do not fade
away so soon? Does the soul only flower
on nights of storm? Hitherto, doubtless,
this belief has prevailed. It is only the
life of violence, the life of bygone days,
that is perceived by nearly all our tragic
writers; and truly may one say that anachronism
dominates the stage, and that
dramatic art dates back as many years as
the art of sculpture. Far different is it
with the other arts&mdash;with painting and
music, for instance&mdash;for these have learned
to select and reproduce those obscurer
phases of daily life that are not the less
deep-rooted and amazing. They know
that all that life has lost, as regards mere
superficial ornament, has been more than
counterbalanced by the depth, the intimate
meaning and the spiritual gravity it has
acquired. The true artist no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
chooses Marius triumphing over the Cimbrians,
or the assassination of the Duke of
Guise, as fit subjects for his art; for he is
well aware that the psychology of victory or
murder is but elementary and exceptional,
and that the solemn voice of men and
things, the voice that issues forth so timidly
and hesitatingly, cannot be heard amidst
the idle uproar of acts of violence. And
therefore will he place on his canvas a
house lost in the heart of the country, an
open door at the end of a passage, a face
or hands at rest, and by these simple
images will he add to our consciousness of
life, which is a possession that it is no
longer possible to lose.</p>

<p>But to the tragic author, as to the
mediocre painter who still lingers over
historical pictures, it is only the violence
of the anecdote that appeals, and in his
representation thereof does the entire
interest of his work consist. And he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
imagines, forsooth, that we shall delight in
witnessing the very same acts that brought
joy to the hearts of the barbarians, with
whom murder, outrage and treachery were
matters of daily occurrence. Whereas it
is far away from bloodshed, battle-cry and
sword-thrust that the lives of most of us
flow on, and men’s tears are silent to-day,
and invisible, and almost spiritual....</p>

<p>Indeed, when I go to a theatre, I feel
as though I were spending a few hours
with my ancestors, who conceived life as
something that was primitive, arid and
brutal; but this conception of theirs
scarcely even lingers in my memory, and
surely it is not one that I can share. I am
shown a deceived husband killing his wife,
a woman poisoning her lover, a son avenging
his father, a father slaughtering his
children, children putting their father to
death, murdered kings, ravished virgins,
imprisoned citizens&mdash;in a word, all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
sublimity of tradition, but alas, how superficial
and material! Blood, surface-tears
and death! What can I learn from creatures
who have but one fixed idea, and who
have no time to live, for that there is a
rival, or a mistress, whom it behoves them
to put to death?</p>

<p>I had hoped to be shown some act of
life, traced back to its sources and to its
mystery by connecting links, that my daily
occupations afford me neither power nor
occasion to study. I had gone thither
hoping that the beauty, the grandeur and
the earnestness of my humble day by day
existence would, for one instant, be revealed
to me, that I would be shown the I know
not what presence, power or God that is
ever with me in my room. I was yearning
for one of the strange moments of a higher
life that flit unperceived through my
dreariest hours; whereas, almost invariably,
all that I beheld was but a man who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
tell me, at wearisome length, why he was
jealous, why he poisoned, or why he
killed.</p>

<p>I admire Othello, but he does not appear
to me to live the august daily life of a
Hamlet, who has the time to live, inasmuch
as he does not act. Othello is admirably
jealous. But is it not perhaps an ancient
error to imagine that it is at the moments
when this passion, or others of equal
violence, possesses us, that we live our
truest lives? I have grown to believe that
an old man, seated in his armchair, waiting
patiently, with his lamp beside him; giving
unconscious ear to all the eternal laws that
reign about his house, interpreting, without
comprehending, the silence of doors and
windows and the quivering voice of the
light, submitting with bent head to the
presence of his soul and his destiny&mdash;an old
man, who conceives not that all the powers
of this world, like so many heedful servants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
are mingling and keeping vigil in his
room, who suspects not that the very sun
itself is supporting in space the little table
against which he leans, or that every star
in heaven and every fibre of the soul are
directly concerned in the movement of an
eyelid that closes, or a thought that springs
to birth&mdash;I have grown to believe that he,
motionless as he is, does yet live in reality
a deeper, more human and more universal
life than the lover who strangles his
mistress, the captain who conquers in
battle, or ‘the husband who avenges his
honour.’</p>

<p>I shall be told, perhaps, that a motionless
life would be invisible, that therefore
animation must be conferred upon it, and
movement, and that such varied movement
as would be acceptable is to be found
only in the few passions of which use has
hitherto been made. I do not know
whether it be true that a static theatre is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
impossible. Indeed, to me it seems to exist
already. Most of the tragedies of Æschylus
are tragedies without movement. In both
the ‘Prometheus’ and the ‘Suppliants,’
events are lacking; and the entire tragedy
of the ‘Chœphoræ’&mdash;surely the most terrible
drama of antiquity&mdash;does but cling,
nightmare-like, around the tomb of Agamemnon,
till murder darts forth, as a
lightning flash, from the accumulation of
prayers, ever falling back upon themselves.
Consider, from this point of view, a few
more of the finest tragedies of the ancients:
‘The Eumenides,’ ‘Antigone,’ ‘Electra,’
‘Œdipus at Colonos.’ ‘They have admired,’
said Racine in his preface to
‘Berenice,’ ‘they have admired the “Ajax”
of Sophocles, wherein there is nothing but
Ajax killing himself with regret for the
fury into which he fell after the arms of
Achilles were denied him. They have
admired “Philoctetes,” whose entire subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
is but the coming of Ulysses with intent
to seize the arrows of Hercules. Even the
“Œdipus,” though full of recognitions, contains
less subject-matter than the simplest
tragedy of our days.’</p>

<p>What have we here but life that is
almost motionless? In most cases, indeed,
you will find that psychological action&mdash;infinitely
loftier in itself than mere material
action, and truly, one might think, well-nigh
indispensable&mdash;that psychological action
even has been suppressed, or at least vastly
diminished, in a truly marvellous fashion,
with the result that the interest centres
solely and entirely in the individual, face to
face with the universe. Here we are no
longer with the barbarians, nor is man
now fretting, himself in the midst of
elementary passions, as though, forsooth,
these were the only things worthy of note:
he is at rest, and we have time to observe
him. It is no longer a violent, exceptional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
moment of life that passes before our eyes&mdash;it
is life itself. Thousands and thousands
of laws there are, mightier and more
venerable than those of passion; but, in
common with all that is endowed with
resistless force, these laws are silent, and
discreet, and slow-moving; and hence it is
only in the twilight that they can be seen
and heard, in the meditation that comes to
us at the tranquil moments of life.</p>

<p>When Ulysses and Neoptolemus come
to Philoctetes and demand of him the arms
of Hercules, their action is in itself as
simple and ordinary as that of a man of
our day who goes into a house to visit an
invalid, of a traveller who knocks at the
door of an inn, or of a mother who, by
the fireside, awaits the return of her child.
Sophocles indicates the character of his
heroes by means of the lightest and
quickest of touches. But it may safely be
said that the chief interest of the tragedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
does not lie in the struggle we witness
between cunning and loyalty, between love
of country, rancour, and headstrong pride.
There is more beyond: for it is man’s
loftier existence that is laid bare to us.
The poet adds to ordinary life something,
I know not what, which is the poet’s secret:
and there comes to us a sudden revelation
of life in its stupendous grandeur, in its
submissiveness to the unknown powers, in
its endless affinities, in its awe-inspiring
misery. Let but the chemist pour a few
mysterious drops into a vessel that seems
to contain the purest water, and at once
masses of crystals will rise to the surface,
thus revealing to us all that lay in abeyance
there where nothing was visible before to
our incomplete eyes. And even thus is it
in ‘Philoctetes’; the primitive psychology
of the three leading characters would seem
to be merely the sides of the vessel containing
the clear water; and this itself is our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
ordinary life, into which the poet is about
to let fall the revelation-bearing drops of
his genius....</p>

<p>Indeed, it is not in the actions but in
the words that are found the beauty and
greatness of tragedies that are truly beautiful
and great; and this not solely in the
words that accompany and explain the
action, for there must perforce be another
dialogue besides the one which is superficially
necessary. And indeed the only
words that count in the play are those that
at first seemed useless, for it is therein that
the essence lies. Side by side with the
necessary dialogue will you almost always
find another dialogue that seems superfluous;
but examine it carefully, and it will
be borne home to you that this is the only
one that the soul can listen to profoundly,
for here alone is it the soul that is being
addressed. You will see, too, that it is the
quality and the scope of this unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
dialogue that determine the quality and
the immeasurable range of the work.
Certain it is that, in the ordinary drama,
the indispensable dialogue by no means
corresponds to reality; and it is just those
words that are spoken by the side of the
rigid, apparent truth, that constitute the
mysterious beauty of the most beautiful
tragedies, inasmuch as these are words
that conform to a deeper truth, and one
that lies incomparably nearer to the invisible
soul by which the poem is upheld. One
may even affirm that a poem draws the
nearer to beauty and loftier truth in the
measure that it eliminates words that
merely explain the action, and substitutes
for them others that reveal, not the so-called
‘soul-state,’ but I know not what
intangible and unceasing striving of the
soul towards its own beauty and truth.
And so much the nearer, also, does it draw
to the true life. To every man does it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
happen, in his work-a-day existence, that
some situation of deep seriousness has to
be unravelled by means of words. Reflect
for an instant. At moments such as those&mdash;nay,
at the most commonplace of times&mdash;is
it the thing you say or the reply you
receive that has the most value? Are not
other forces, other words one cannot hear,
brought into being, and do not these
determine the event? What I say often
counts for so little; but my presence, the
attitude of my soul, my future and my
past, that which will take birth in me and
that which is dead, a secret thought, the
stars that approve, my destiny, the thousands
of mysteries which surround me and float
about yourself&mdash;all this it is that speaks to
you at that tragic moment, all this it is
that brings to me your answer. There is
all this beneath every one of my words,
and each one of yours; it is this, above all,
that we see, it a this, above all, that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
hear, ourselves notwithstanding. If you
have come, you, the ‘outraged husband,’
the ‘deceived lover,’ the ‘forsaken wife,’
intending to kill me, your arm will not be
stayed by my most moving entreaty; but
it may be that there will come towards you,
at that moment, one of these unexpected
forces; and my soul, knowing of their
vigil near to me, may whisper a secret
word whereby, haply, you shall be disarmed.
These are the spheres wherein
adventures come to issue, this is the
dialogue whose echo should be heard.
And it is this echo that one does hear&mdash;extremely
attenuated and variable, it is
true&mdash;in some of the great works mentioned
above. But might we not try to draw
nearer to the spheres where it is ‘in reality’
that everything comes to pass?</p>

<p>It would seem as though the endeavour
were being made. Some time ago, when
dealing with ‘The Master Builder,’ which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
is the one of Ibsen’s dramas wherein this
dialogue of the ‘second degree’ attains the
deepest tragedy, I endeavoured, unskilfully
enough, to fix its secrets. For indeed they
are kindred handmarks traced on the same
wall by the same sightless being, groping
for the same light. ‘What is it,’ I asked,
‘what is it that, in the “Master Builder,”
the poet has added to life, thereby making
it appear so strange, so profound and so
disquieting beneath its trivial surface?’
The discovery is not easy, and the old
master hides from us more than one secret.
It would even seem as though what he has
wished to say were but little by the side of
what he has been compelled to say. He has
freed certain powers of the soul that have
never yet been free, and it may well be
that these have held him in thrall. ‘Look
you, Hilda,’ exclaims Solness, ‘look you!
There is sorcery in you, too, as there is in
me. It is this sorcery that imposes action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
on the powers of the beyond. And we
<i>have</i> to yield to it. Whether we want to
or not, we <i>must</i>.’</p>

<p>There is sorcery in them, as in us all.
Hilda and Solness are, I believe, the first
characters in drama who feel, for an instant,
that they are living in the atmosphere of
the soul; and the discovery of this essential
life that exists in them, beyond the life
of every day, comes fraught with terror.
Hilda and Solness are two souls to whom a
flash has revealed their situation in the true
life. Diverse ways there are by which
knowledge of our fellows may come to us.
Two or three men, perhaps, are seen by
me almost daily. For a long time it is
merely by their gestures that I distinguish
them, by their habits, be these of mind or
body, by the manner in which they feel,
act or think. But, in the course of every
friendship of some duration, there comes
to us a mysterious moment when we seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to perceive the exact relationship of our
friend to the unknown that surrounds
him, when we discover the attitude
destiny has assumed towards him. And it
is from this moment that he truly belongs
to us. We have seen, once and for all, the
treatment held in store for him by events.
We know that however such a one may
seclude himself in the recesses of his
dwelling, in dread lest his slightest movement
stir up that which lies in the great
reservoirs of the future, his forethought
will avail him nothing, and the innumerable
events that destiny holds in reserve will
discover him wherever he hide, and will
knock one after another at his door. And
even so do we know that this other will
sally forth in vain in pursuit of adventure.
He will ever return empty-handed. No
sooner are our eyes thus opened than unerring
knowledge would seem to spring to
life, self-created, within our soul; and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
know with absolute conviction that the
event that seems to be impending over the
head of a certain man will nevertheless
most assuredly not reach him.</p>

<p>From this moment a special part of the
soul reigns over the friendship of even
the most unintelligent, the obscurest of
men. Life has become, as it were,
transposed. And when it happens that
we meet one of the men who are thus
known to us, though we do but speak of
the snow that is falling or the women that
pass by, something there is in each of us
which nods to the other, which examines
and asks its questions without our knowledge,
which interests itself in contingencies
and hints at events that it is impossible for
us to understand....</p>

<p>Thus do I conceive it to be with Hilda
and Solness; it is thus surely that they
regard each other. Their conversation
resembles nothing that we have ever heard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
inasmuch as the poet has endeavoured to
blend in one expression both the inner
and the outer dialogue. A new, indescribable
power dominates this somnambulistic
drama. All that is said therein at once
hides and reveals the sources of an unknown
life. And if we are bewildered at
times, let us not forget that our soul often
appears to our feeble eyes to be but the
maddest of forces, and that there are in
man many regions more fertile, more profound
and more interesting than those of
his reason or his intelligence....</p>

<h2 class="p4 b2">THE STAR</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">WELL might it be said that, from
century to century, a tragic poet
‘has wandered through the labyrinths of
destiny with the torch of poesy in his
hand.’ For in this way has each one,
according to the forces of his hour, fixed
the souls of the annals of man, and it is
divine history that has thus been composed.
It is in the poets alone that we can follow
the countless variations of the great unchanging
power; and to follow them is
indeed interesting, for at the root of the
idea that they have formed of this power
is to be found, perhaps, the purest essence
of a nation’s soul. It is a power that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
never entirely ceased to be, yet moments
there are when it scarcely seems to stir;
and at such moments one feels that life is
neither very active nor very profound.
Once only has it been the object of undivided
worship; then was it, even for
the gods, an awe-inspiring mystery. And
there is a thing that is passing strange&mdash;it
was the very period when the featureless
divinity seemed most terrible and most
incomprehensible that was the most beautiful
period of mankind, and the people
to whom destiny wore the most formidable
aspect were the happiest people of all.</p>

<p>It would seem that a secret force must
underlie this idea, or that the idea is itself
the manifestation of a force. Does man
develop in the measure that he recognises
the greatness of the unknown that sways
him, or is it the unknown that develops
in proportion to the man? To-day the
idea of destiny would seem to be again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
awakening, and to go forth in search of it
were perhaps no unprofitable quest. But
where shall it be found? To go in search
of destiny&mdash;what is this but to seek all the
sorrows of man? There is no destiny of
joy, no star that bodes of happiness. The
star that is so called is only a star of forbearance.
Yet is it well that we should
sally forth at times in search of our
sorrows, so that we may learn to know
them and admire them; and this even
though the great shapeless mass of destiny
be not encountered at the end.</p>

<p>Seeking our sorrows, we shall be the
most effectively seeking ourselves, for
truly may it be said that the value of
ourselves is but the value of our melancholy
and our disquiet. As we progress, so do
they become deeper, nobler and more
beautiful; and Marcus Aurelius is to be
admired above all men, because, better than
all men, has he understood how much there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
is of the soul in the meek resigned smile it
must wear, at the depths of us. Thus
is it, too, with the sorrows of humanity.
They follow a road which resembles the
road of our own sorrows; but it is longer,
and surer, and must lead to fatherlands
that the last comers alone shall know.
This road also has physical sorrow for its
starting-point; it has only just rounded
the fear of the gods, and to-day it halts by
a new abyss, whose depths the very best of
us have not yet sounded.</p>

<p>Each century holds another sorrow dear,
for each century discerns another destiny.
Certain it is that we no longer interest
ourselves, as was formerly the case, in the
catastrophes of passion; and the quality
of the sorrow revealed in the most tragic
masterpieces of the past is inferior to the
quality of the sorrows of to-day. It is
only indirectly that these tragedies affect
us now; only by means of that which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
brought to bear on the simple accidents of
love or hatred they reproduce, by the
reflection and new nobility of sentiment
that the pain of living has created within
us.</p>

<p>There are moments when it would seem
as though we were on the threshold of a
new pessimism, mysterious and, perhaps,
very pure. The most redoubtable sages,
Schopenhauer, Carlyle, the Russians, the
Scandinavians, and the good optimist
Emerson, too (for than a wilful optimist
there is nothing more discouraging), all
these have passed our melancholy by, unexplained.
We feel that, underlying all
the reasons they have essayed to give us,
there are many other profounder reasons,
whose discovery has been beyond them.
The sadness of man which seemed beautiful
even to them, is still susceptible of
infinite ennobling, until at last a creature
of genius shall have uttered the final word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of the sorrow that shall, perhaps, wholly
purify....</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, we are in the hands of
strange powers, whose intentions we are
on the eve of divining. At the time of
the great tragic writers of the new era, at
the time of Shakespeare, Racine, and their
successors, the belief prevailed that all
misfortunes came from the various passions
of the heart. Catastrophes did not hover
between two worlds: they came hence to
go thither, and their point of departure
was known. Man was always the master.
Much less was this the case at the time of
the Greeks, for then did fatality reign on
the heights; but it was inaccessible, and
none dared interrogate it. To-day it is
fatality that we challenge, and this is
perhaps the distinguishing note of the new
theatre. It is no longer the effects of
disaster that arrest our attention; it is
disaster itself, and we are eager to know its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
essence and its laws. It was the <i>nature</i>
of disaster with which the earliest tragic
writers were, all unconsciously, preoccupied,
and this it was that, though they knew it
not, threw a solemn shadow round the hard
and violent gestures of external death; and
it is this, too, that has become the rallying-point
of the most recent dramas, the centre
of light with strange flames gleaming,
about which revolve the souls of women and
of men. And a step has been taken towards
the mystery so that life’s terrors may be
looked in the face.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to discover from
what point of view our latest tragic writers
appear to regard the disaster that forms the
basis of all dramatic poems. They see it
from a nearer point of vision than the
Greeks, and they have penetrated deeper
into the fertile darknesses of its inner
circle. The divinity is perhaps the same;
they know nothing of it, yet do they study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
it more closely. Whence does it come,
whither does it go, why does it descend
upon us? These were problems to which
the Greeks barely gave a thought. Is it
written within us, or is it born at the same
time as ourselves? Does it of its own
accord start forward to meet us, or is
it summoned by conniving voices that
we cherish at the depths of us? If we
could but follow, from the heights of
another world, the ways of the man over
whom a great sorrow is impending! And
what man is there that does not laboriously,
though all unconsciously, himself
fashion the sorrow that is to be the pivot
of his life!</p>

<p>The Scotch peasants have a word that
might be applied to every existence. In
their legends they give the name of ‘Fey’
to the frame of mind of a man who, notwithstanding
all his efforts, notwithstanding
all help and advice, is forced by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
irresistible impulse, towards an inevitable
catastrophe. It is thus that James I., the
James of Catherine Douglas, was ‘fey’
when he went, notwithstanding the terrible
omens of earth, heaven and hell, to spend the
Christmas holidays in the gloomy castle of
Perth, where his assassin, the traitor Robert
Graeme, lay in wait for him. Which of us,
recalling the circumstances of the most
decisive misfortune of his life, but has felt
himself similarly possessed? Be it well
understood that I speak here only of active
misfortunes, of those that might have
been prevented: for there are passive
misfortunes (such as the death of a person
we adore) which simply come towards us,
and cannot be influenced by any movement
of ours. Bethink you of the fatal day of
your life. Have we not all been forewarned;
and though it may seem to
us now that destiny might have been
changed by a step we did not take, a door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
we did not open, a hand we did not raise,
which of us but has struggled vainly on the
topmost walls of the abyss, struggled
without vigour and without hope, against
a force that was invisible and apparently
without power?</p>

<p>The breath of air stirred by the door I
opened, one evening, was for ever to extinguish
my happiness, as it would have
extinguished a flickering lamp; and now,
when I think of it, I cannot tell myself
that I did not know.... And yet, it
was nothing important that had taken me
to the threshold. I could have gone away,
shrugging my shoulders: there was no
human reason that could force me to knock
on the panel. No human reason, nothing
but destiny....</p>

<p class="pc1 slarge">*</p>

<p class="p1">Herein there is still some resemblance to
the fatality of Œdipus, and yet it is already
different. One might say that it is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
same fatality seen <i>ab intra</i>. Mysterious
powers hold sway within us, and these
would seem to be in league with adventures.
We all cherish enemies within our soul.
They know what they do and what they
force us to do, and when they lead us to
the event, they let fall half-uttered words
of warning&mdash;too few to stop us on the
road&mdash;but sufficient to make us regret,
when it is too late, that we did not listen
more attentively to their wavering, ironical
advice. What object can they have, these
powers that seek our destruction as though
they were self-existing and did not perish
with us, seeing that it is in us only that
they have life? What is it that sets in
motion all the confederates of the universe,
who fatten on our blood?</p>

<p>The man for whom the hour of misfortune
has sounded is caught up by an
invisible whirlwind, and for years back
have these powers been combining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
innumerable incidents that must bring him
to the necessary moment, to the exact
spot where tears lie in wait for him.
Remember all your efforts, all your presentiments,
all the unavailing offers of help.
Remember, too, the kindly circumstances
that pitied you, and tried to bar your
passage, but you thrust them aside like so
many importunate beggars. And yet were
they humble, timid sisters, who desired but
to save you, and they went away without
saying a word, too weak and too helpless
to struggle against decided things&mdash;where
decided it is known to God alone....</p>

<p>Scarcely has the disaster befallen us than
we have the strange sensation of having
obeyed an eternal law; and, in the midst
of the greatest sorrow, there is I know not
what mysterious comfort that rewards us
for our obedience. Never do we belong
more completely to ourselves than on the
morrow of an irreparable catastrophe. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
seems, then, as though we had found
ourselves again, as though we had won
back a part of ourselves that was necessary
and unknown. A curious calm steals over
us. For days past, almost without our
knowledge, notwithstanding that we were
able to smile at faces and flowers, the rebel
forces of our soul had been waging terrible
battle on the borders of the abyss, and
now that we are at the depths of it, all
breathes freely.</p>

<p>Even thus, without respite, do these rebel
forces struggle in the soul of every one of
us; and there are times when we may see
the shadow of these combats wherein our
soul may not intervene, but we pay no
heed, for to all save the unimportant do
we shut our eyes. At a time when my
friends are about me it may happen that,
in the midst of talk and shouts of laughter,
there shall suddenly steal over the face of
one of them something that is not of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
world. A motiveless silence shall instantly
prevail, and for a second’s space all shall be
unconsciously looking forth with the eyes
of the soul. Whereupon, the words and
smiles, that had disappeared like frightened
frogs in a lake, will again mount to the
surface, more violent than before. But the
invisible, here as everywhere, has gathered
its tribute. Something has understood that
a fight was over, that a star was rising or
falling and that a destiny had just been
decided....</p>

<p>Perhaps it had been decided before; and
who knows whether the struggle be not a
mere simulacrum? If I push open to-day the
door of the house wherein I am to meet
the first smiles of a sorrow that shall know
no end, I do these things for a longer time
than one imagines. Of what avail to cultivate
an ego on which we have so little
influence? It is our star which it behoves
us to watch. It is good or bad, pallid or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
puissant, and not by all the might of the
sea can it be changed. Some there are who
may confidently play with their star as one
might play with a glass ball. They may
throw it and hazard it where they list;
faithfully will it ever return to their hands.
They know full well that it cannot be
broken. But there are many others who
dare not even raise their eyes towards
their star, without it detach itself from
the firmament and fall in dust at their
feet....</p>

<p>But it is dangerous to speak of the star,
dangerous even to think of it; for it is
often the sign that it is on the point of
extinction....</p>

<p>We find ourselves here in the abysses
of night, where we await what has to be.
There is no longer question of free will,
which we have left thousands of leagues
below: we are in a region where the will
itself is but destiny’s ripest fruit. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
must not complain; something is already
known to us, and we have discovered a
few of the ways of fortune. We lie in
wait like the birdcatcher studying the
habits of migratory birds, and when an
event is signalled on the horizon we know
full well that it will not remain there alone,
but that its brothers will flock in troops to
the same spot. Vaguely have we learned
that there are certain thoughts, certain
souls, that attract events; that some
beings there are who divert events in
their flight, as there are others who cause
them to congregate from the four quarters
of the globe.</p>

<p>Above all do we know that certain ideas
are fraught with extreme danger; that do
we but for an instant deem ourselves in
safety, this alone suffices to draw down the
thunderbolt; we know that happiness
creates a void, into which tears will speedily
be hurled. After a time, too, we learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
something of the preferences of events. It
is soon borne home to us that if we take a
few steps along the path of life by the side
of this one of our brothers, the ways of
fortune will no longer be the same, whereas,
with this other, our existence will encounter
unvarying events, coming in regular order.
We feel that some beings there are who
protect in the unknown, others who drag
us into danger there; we feel that there are
some who awaken the future, others who
lull it into slumber. We suspect, further,
that things at their birth are but feeble,
that they draw their force from within us,
and that, in every adventure, there is a
brief moment when our instinct warns us
that we are still the lords of destiny. In
fine, there are some who dare assert that
we can learn to be happy, that, as we
become better, so do we meet men of loftier
mind; that a man who is good attracts,
with irresistible force, events as good as he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and that, in a beautiful soul, the saddest
fortune is transformed into beauty....</p>

<p>Indeed, is it not within the knowledge
of us all that goodness beckons to goodness,
and that those for whom we devote
ourselves are always the same; that they
are always the same, those whom we betray?
When the same sorrow knocks at two
adjoining doors, at the houses of the just
and the unjust, will its method of action be
identical in both? If you are pure, will
not your misfortunes be pure? To have
known how to change the past into a few
saddened smiles&mdash;is this not to master the
future? And does it not seem that, even
in the inevitable, there is something we can
keep back? Do not great hazards lie
dormant that a too sudden movement of
ours may awaken on the horizon; and
would this misfortune have befallen you to-day,
but for the thoughts that this morning
kept too noisy festival in your soul? Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
this all that our wisdom has been able to
glean in the darkness? Who would dare
affirm that in these regions there be more
substantial truths? In the meanwhile, let
us learn how to smile, let us learn how to
weep, in the silence of humblest kindliness.
Slowly there rises above these things the
shrouded face of the destiny of to-day. Of
the veil that formerly covered it, a minute
corner has been lifted, and there, where the
veil is not, do we recognise, to our disquiet,
on the one side, <i>the power of those who live
not yet</i>, on the other, <i>the power of the dead</i>.
The mystery has again been shifted further
from us&mdash;that is all. We have enlarged
the icy hand of destiny; and we find that,
in its shadow, the hands of our ancestors
are clasped by the hands of our sons yet
unborn. One act there was that we deemed
the sanctuary of all our rights, and love
remained the supreme refuge of all those
on whom the chains of life weighed too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
heavily. Here, at least, in the isolation of
this secret temple, we told ourselves that no
one entered with us. Here, for an instant,
we could breathe; here, at last, it was our
soul that reigned, and free was its choice in
that which was the centre of liberty itself!
But now we are told that it is not for our
own sake that we love. We are told that
in the very temple of love we do but obey
the unvarying orders of an invisible throng.
We are told that a thousand centuries
divide us from ourselves when we choose the
woman we love, and that the first kiss of
the betrothed is but the seal that thousands
of hands, craving for birth, impress upon
the lips of the mother they desire. And,
further, we know that the dead do not
die. We know now that it is not in our
churches that they are to be found, but in
the houses, the habits, of us all. That
there is not a gesture, a thought, a sin, a
tear, an atom of acquired consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
that is lost in the depths of the earth; and
that at the most insignificant of our acts our
ancestors arise, not in their tombs where
they move not, but in ourselves, where they
always live....</p>

<p>Thus are we led by past and future.
And the present, which is the substance of
us, sinks to the bottom of the sea, like
some tiny island at which two irreconcilable
oceans have been unceasingly gnawing.
Heredity, will, destiny, all mingle noisily
in our soul; but, notwithstanding everything,
far above everything, it is the silent
star that reigns. No matter with what
temporary labels we may bedeck the
monstrous vases that contain the invisible,
words can tell us scarcely anything of that
which should be told. Heredity, nay
destiny itself, what are these but a ray of
this star, a ray that is lost in the mysterious
night? And all that is might well be more
mysterious still. ‘We give the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
destiny to all that limits us,’ says one of
the great sages of our time: wherefore it
behoves us to be grateful to all those who
tremblingly grope their way the side of the
frontier. ‘If we are brutal and barbarous,’
he goes on, ‘fatality takes a form that is
brutal and barbarous. As refinement comes
to us, so do our mishaps become refined.
If we rise to spiritual culture, antagonism
takes unto itself a spiritual form.’ It is
perhaps true that even as our soul soars
aloft, so does it purify destiny, although it
is also true that we are menaced by the self-same
sorrows that menace the savages.
But we have other sorrows of which they
have no suspicion; and the spirit, as it
rises, does but discover still more, at every
horizon. ‘We give the name of destiny
to all that limits us.’ Let us do our
utmost that destiny become not too circumscribed.
It is good to enlarge one’s sorrows,
since thus does enlargement come to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
consciousness, and there, there alone do we
truly feel that we live. And it is also the
only means of fulfilling our supreme duty
towards other worlds; since it is probably
on us alone that it is incumbent to augment
the consciousness of the earth.</p>

<p class="pc4 slarge">THE INVISIBLE GOODNESS</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a><br /><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4 b2">THE INVISIBLE GOODNESS</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is a thing, said to me one evening the
sage I had chanced to meet by the sea
shore, whereon the waves were breaking
almost noiselessly&mdash;it is a thing that we
scarcely notice, that none seem to take into
account, and yet do I conceive it to be one
of the forces that safeguard mankind. In
a thousand diverse ways do the gods from
whom we spring reveal themselves within
us, but it may well be that this unnoticed
secret goodness, to which sufficiently direct
allusion has never yet been made, is the
purest token of their eternal life. Whence
it comes we know not. It is there in its
simplicity, smiling on the threshold of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
soul; and those in whom its smiles lie
deepest, or shine forth most frequently,
may make us suffer day and night and
they will, yet shall it be beyond our power
to cease to love them....</p>

<p>It is not of this world, and still are there
few agitations of ours in which it takes not
part. It cares not to reveal itself even in
look or tear. Nay, it seeks concealment,
for reasons one cannot divine. It is as
though it were afraid to make use of its
power. It knows that its most involuntary
movement will cause immortal things to
spring to life about it; and we are miserly
with immortal things. Why are we so
fearful lest we exhaust the heaven within
us? We dare not act upon the whisper of
the God who inspires us. We are afraid
of everything that cannot be explained by
word or gesture: and we shut our eyes to
all that we do, ourselves notwithstanding,
in the empire where explanations are vain!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Whence comes the timidity of the divine
in man? For truly might it be said that
the nearer a movement of our soul
approaches the divine, so much the more
scrupulously do we conceal it from the
eyes of our brethren. Can it be that man
is nothing but a frightened god? Or has
the command been laid upon us that the
superior powers must not be betrayed?
Upon all that does not form part of this
too visible world there rests the tender
meekness of the little ailing girl, for whom
her mother will not send when strangers
come to the house. And therefore it is
that this secret goodness of ours has never
yet passed through the silent portals of
our soul. It lives within us like a prisoner
forbidden to approach the barred window
of her cell. But indeed, what matter
though it do not approach? Enough that
it be there. Hide as it may, let it but
raise its head, move a link of its chain or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
open its hand, and the prison is illumined,
the pressure of radiance from within bursts
open the iron barrier, and then, suddenly,
there yawns a gulf between words and
beings, a gulf peopled with agitated angels:
silence falls over all: the eyes turn away
for a moment and two souls embrace tearfully
on the threshold....</p>

<p>It is not a thing that comes from this
earth of ours, and all descriptions can be of
no avail. They who would understand
must have, in themselves too, <i>the same point
of sensibility</i>. If you have never in your
life felt the power of <i>your invisible goodness</i>,
go no further; it would be useless.
But are there really any who have not felt
this power, and have the worst of us never
been invisibly good? I know not: of so
many in this world does the aim seem to
be the discouragement of the divine in
their soul. And yet there needs but one
instant of respite for the divine to spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
up again, and even the wickedest are not
incessantly on their guard; and hence
doubtless has it arisen that so many of the
wicked are good, unseen of all, whereas
divers saints and sages are not invisibly
good....</p>

<p>More than once have I been the cause
of suffering, he went on, even as each
being is the cause of suffering about him.
I have caused suffering because we are in a
world where all is held together by invisible
threads, in a world where none are alone,
and where the gentlest gesture of love or
kindliness may so often wound the innocence
by our side!&mdash;I have caused suffering, too,
because there are times when the best and
tenderest are impelled to seek I know not
what part of themselves in the grief of
others. For, indeed, there are seeds that
only spring up in our soul beneath the rain
of tears shed because of us, and none the
less do these seeds produce good flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and salutary fruit. What would you? It
is no law of our making, and I know not
whether I would dare to love the man who
had made no one weep. Frequently,
indeed, will the greatest suffering be caused
by those whose love is greatest, for a strange
timid, tender cruelty is most often the
anxious sister of love. On all sides does
love search for the proofs of love, and the
first proofs&mdash;who is not prone to discover
them in the tears of the beloved?</p>

<p>Even death could not suffice to reassure
the lover who dared to give ear to the unreasoning
claims of love; for to the
intimate cruelty of love, the instant of
death seems too brief; over beyond death
there is yet room for a sea of doubts, and
even in those who die together may disquiet
still linger as they die. Long,
slowly falling tears are needed here. Grief
is love’s first food, and every love that
has not been fed on a little pure suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
must die like the babe that one had tried
to nourish on the nourishment of a man.
Will the love inspired by the woman who
always brought the smile to your lips be
quite the same as the love you feel for her
who at times called forth your tears?
Alas! needs must love weep, and often
indeed is it at the very moment when the
sobs burst forth that love’s chains are
forged and tempered for life....</p>

<p>Thus, he continued, I have caused
suffering because I loved, and also have I
caused suffering because I did not love&mdash;but
how great was the difference in the
two cases! In the one the slowly dropping
tears of well-tried love seemed already to
know, at the depths of them, that they were
bedewing all that was ineffable in our
united souls; in the other the poor tears
knew that they were falling in solitude on
a desert. But it is at those very moments
when the soul is all ear&mdash;or, haply, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
soul&mdash;that I have recognised the might of
an invisible goodness that could offer to
the wretched tears of an expiring love the
divine illusions of a love on the eve of
birth. Has there never come to you one
of those sorrowful evenings when dejection
lay heavy upon your unsmiling kisses, and
it at length dawned upon your soul that it
had been mistaken? With direst difficulty
did your words ring forth in the cold air
of the separation that was to be final; you
were about to part for ever, and your
almost lifeless hands were outstretched for
the farewell of a departure that should
know no return, when suddenly your soul
made an imperceptible movement within
itself. On that instant did the soul by the
side of you awake on the summits of its
being; something sprang to life in regions
loftier far than the love of jaded lovers;
and for all that the bodies might shrink
asunder, henceforth would the souls never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
forget that for an instant they had beheld
each other high above mountains they had
never seen, and that for a second’s space
they had been good with a goodness they
had never known until that day....</p>

<p>What can this be, this mysterious movement
that I speak of here in connection
with love only, but which may well take
place in the smallest events of life? Is it
I know not what sacrifice or inner embrace,
is it the profoundest desire to be soul for a
soul, or the consciousness, ever quickening
within us, of the presence of a life that is
invisible, but equal to our own? Is it all
that is admirable and sorrowful in the mere
act of living that, at such moments, floods
our being&mdash;is it the aspect of life, one and
indivisible? I know not; but in truth it
is then that we feel that there lurks, somewhere,
an unknown force; it is then that
we feel that we are the treasures of an unknown
God who loves all, that not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
gesture of this God may pass unperceived,
and that we are at length in the region of
things that do not betray themselves....</p>

<p>Certain it is that, from the day of our
birth to the day of our death, we never
emerge from this clearly defined region,
but wander in God like helpless sleepwalkers,
or like the blind who despairingly
seek the very temple in which they do
indeed befind themselves. We are there
in life, man against man, soul against soul,
and day and night are spent under arms.
We never see each other, we never touch
each other. We see nothing but bucklers
and helmets, we touch nothing but iron
and brass. But let a tiny circumstance,
come from the simpleness of the sky, for
one instant only cause the weapons to fall,
are there not always tears beneath the
helmet, childlike smiles behind the buckler,
and is not another verity revealed?</p>

<p>He thought for a moment, then went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
on, more sadly: A woman&mdash;as I believe I
told you just now&mdash;a woman to whom I had
caused suffering against my will&mdash;for the
most careful of us scatter suffering around
them without their knowledge&mdash;a woman
to whom I had caused suffering against
my will, revealed to me one evening the
sovereign power of this invisible good.
To be good we must needs have suffered;
but perhaps it is necessary to have caused
suffering before we can become better.
This was brought home to me that evening.
I felt that I had arrived, alone, at
that sad zone of kisses when it seems to us
that we are visiting the hovels of the poor,
while she, who had lingered on the road,
was still smiling in the palace of the first
days. Love, as men understand it, was
dying between us like a child stricken with
a disease come one knows not whence, a
disease that has no pity. We said nothing.
It would be impossible for me to recall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
what my thoughts were at that earnest
moment. They were doubtless of no significance.
I was probably thinking of the
last face I had seen, of the quivering gleam
of a lantern at a deserted street corner;
and, nevertheless, <i>everything took place</i> in a
light a thousand times purer, a thousand
times higher, than had there intervened all
the forces of pity and love which I command
in my thoughts and my heart. We
parted, and not a word was spoken, but at
one and the same moment had we understood
our inexpressible thought. We know
now that another love had sprung to life, a
love that demands not the words, the little
attentions and smiles of ordinary love.
We have never met again. Perhaps centuries
will elapse before we ever do meet
again.</p>

<p class="pps4 p1">‘Much is to learn, much to forget,<br />
Through worlds I shall traverse not a few’</p>

<p class="pn1">before we shall again find ourselves <i>in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
same movement of the soul</i> as on that evening:
but we can well afford to wait....</p>

<p>And thus, ever since that day, have I
greeted, in all places, even in the very
bitterest of moments, the beneficent presence
of this marvellous power. He who
has but once clearly seen it, shall never
again find it possible to turn away from its
face. You will often behold it smiling in
the last retreat of hatred, in the depths of
the cruellest tears. And yet does it not
reveal itself to the eyes of the body. Its
nature changes from the moment that it
manifests itself by means of an exterior act;
and we are no longer in the truth according
to the soul, but in a kind of falsehood
as conceived by man. Goodness and love
that are self-conscious have no influence
on the soul, for they have departed from
the kingdoms where they have their dwelling;
but, do they only remain blind, they
can soften Destiny itself. I have known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
more than one man who performed every
act of kindness and mercy without touching
a single soul; and I have known others,
who seemed to live in falsehood and injustice,
yet were no souls driven from
them nor did any for an instant even believe
that these men were not good. Nay,
more, even those who do not know you,
who are merely told of your acts of goodness
and deeds of love&mdash;if you be not good
according to the invisible goodness, these,
even, will feel that something is lacking,
and they will never be touched in the
depths of their being. One might almost
believe that there exists, somewhere, a place
where all is weighed in the presence of the
spirits, or perhaps, out yonder, the other
side of the night, a reservoir of certitudes
whither the silent herd of souls flock every
morning to slake their thirst.</p>

<p>Perhaps we do not yet know what the
word ‘to love’ means. There are within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
us lives in which we love unconsciously.
To love thus means more than to have
pity, to make inner sacrifices, to be anxious
to help and give happiness; it is a thing
that lies a thousand fathoms deeper, where
our softest, swiftest, strongest words cannot
reach it. At moments we might believe it
to be a recollection, furtive but excessively
keen, of the great primitive unity. There
is in this love a force that nothing can
resist. Which of us&mdash;an’ he question himself
the side of the light, from which our
gaze is habitually averted&mdash;which of us but
will find in himself the recollection of
certain strange workings of this force?
Which of us, when by the side of the most
ordinary person perhaps, but has suddenly
become conscious of the advent of something
that none had summoned? Was it
the soul, or perhaps life, that had turned
within itself like a sleeper on the point of
awakening? I know not; nor did you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
know, and no one spoke of it; but you did
not separate from each other as though
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>To love thus is to love according to the
soul; and there is no soul that does not
respond to this love. For the soul of man
is a guest that has gone hungry these centuries
back, and never has it to be summoned
twice to the nuptial feast.</p>

<p>The souls of all our brethren are ever
hovering about us, craving for a caress,
and only waiting for the signal. But how
many beings there are who all their life
long have not dared make such a signal!
It is the disaster of our entire existence that
we live thus away from our soul, and stand
in such dread of its slightest movement.
Did we but allow it to smile frankly in its
silence and its radiance, we should be
already living an eternal life. We have
only to think for an instant how much it
succeeds in accomplishing during those rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
moments when we knock off its chains&mdash;for
it is our custom to enchain it as though
it were distraught&mdash;what it does in love,
for instance, for there we do permit it at
times to approach the lattices of external life.
And would it not be in accordance with
the primal truth if all men were to feel that
they were face to face with each other, even
as the woman feels with the man she loves?</p>

<p>This invisible and divine goodness, of
which I only speak here because of its
being one of the surest and nearest signs of
the unceasing activity of our soul, this
invisible and divine goodness ennobles, in
decisive fashion, all that it has unconsciously
touched. Let him who has a grievance
against his fellow, descend into himself and
seek out whether he never has been good in
the presence of that fellow. For myself, I
have never met any one by whose side I
have felt my invisible goodness bestir
itself, without he has become, at that very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
instant, better than myself. Be good at the
depths of you, and you will discover that
those who surround you will be good even
to the same depths. Nothing responds
more infallibly to the secret cry of goodness
than the secret cry of goodness that is
near. While you are actively good in the
invisible, all those who approach you will
unconsciously do things that they could
not do by the side of any other man.
Therein lies a force that has no name; a
spiritual rivalry that knows no resistance.
It is as though this were the actual place
where is the sensitive spot of our soul; for
there are souls that seem to have forgotten
their existence and to have renounced
everything that enables the being to rise;
but, once touched here, they all draw themselves
erect; and in the divine plains of the
secret goodness, the most humble of souls
cannot endure defeat.</p>

<p>And yet it is possible that nothing is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
changing in the life one sees; but is it only
that which matters, and is our existence
indeed confined to actions we can take in
our hand like stones on the high road? If
you ask yourself, as we are told we should
ask every evening, ‘What of immortal have
I done to-day?’ Is it always on the
material side that we can count, weigh and
measure unerringly; is it there that you
must begin your search? It is possible for
you to cause extraordinary tears to flow; it
is possible that you may fill a heart with
unheard of certitudes, and give eternal life
unto a soul, and no one shall know of it,
nor shall you even know yourself. It may
be that nothing is changing; it may be
that were it put to the test all would
crumble, and that this goodness we speak
of would yield to the smallest fear. It
matters not. Something divine has happened;
and somewhere must our God have
smiled. May it not be the supreme aim of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
life thus to bring to birth the inexplicable
within ourselves; and do we know how
much we add to ourselves when we awake
something of the incomprehensible that
slumbers in every corner? Here you have
awakened love which will not fall asleep
again. The soul that your soul has
regarded, that has wept with you the holy
tears of the solemn joy that none may
behold, will bear you no resentment, not
even in the midst of torture. It will not
even feel the need of forgiving. So convinced
is it of one knows not what, that
nothing can henceforth dim or efface the
smile that it wears within; for nothing can
ever separate two souls which, for an
instant, ‘have been good together.’</p>

<h2 class="p4 b2">THE DEEPER LIFE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is well that men should be reminded
that the very humblest of them has the
power to ‘fashion, after a divine model
that he chooses not, a great moral personality,
composed in equal parts of himself
and the ideal; and that if anything lives in
fullest reality, of a surety it is that.’</p>

<p>Each man has to seek out his own special
aptitude for a higher life in the midst of
the humble and inevitable reality of daily
existence. Than this there can be no
nobler aim in life. It is only by the
communications we have with the infinite
that we are to be distinguished from each
other. If the hero is greater than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
wretch who marches by his side, it is because
at a certain moment of his existence there
has come to him a fuller consciousness of
one of these communications. If it is true
that creation does not stop at man and that
we are surrounded by invisible beings who
are superior to us, their superiority can
only consist in that they have, with the
infinite, communications whose nature we
cannot even imagine.</p>

<p>It lies within our power to increase these
communications. In the life of every man
has there been a day when the heavens
opened of their own accord, and it is
almost always from that very instant that
dates his true spiritual personality. It is
doubtless at that instant that are formed
the invisible, eternal features that we reveal,
though we know it not, to angels
and to souls. But with most men it is
chance alone that has caused the heavens to
open; and they have not chosen the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
whereby the angels know them in the
infinite, nor have they understood how to
ennoble and purify its features&mdash;which do
indeed but owe their being to an accidental
joy or sadness, an accidental thought
or fear.</p>

<p>Our veritable birth dates from the day
when, for the first time, we feel at the
deepest of us that there is something grave
and unexpected in life. Some there are
who realise suddenly that they are not
alone under the sky. To others will it be
brusquely revealed, while shedding a tear
or giving a kiss, that ‘the source of all that
is good and holy from the universe up to
God is hidden behind a night, full of too
distant stars’; a third will see a divine
hand stretched forth between his joy and
his misfortune; and yet another will have
understood that it is the dead who are in
the right. One will have had pity, another
will have admired or been afraid. Often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
does it need almost nothing, a word, a
gesture, a little thing that is not even a
thought. ‘Before, I loved thee as a brother,
John,’ says one of Shakespeare’s heroes,
admiring the other’s action, ‘but now I do
respect thee as my soul.’ On that day it
is probable that a being will have come into
the world.</p>

<p>We can be born thus more than once;
and each birth brings us a little nearer to
our God. But most of us are content to
wait till an event, charged with almost
irresistible radiance, intrudes itself violently
upon our darkness, and enlightens us, in
our despite. We await I know not what
happy coincidence, when it may so come
about that the eyes of our soul shall be
open at the very moment that something
extraordinary takes place. But in everything
that happens is there light; and the
greatness of the greatest of men has but
consisted in that they had trained their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
eyes to be open to every ray of this light.
Is it indeed essential that your mother
should breathe her last in your arms, that
your children should perish in a shipwreck,
and that you yourself should pass by the
side of death, for you at length to understand
that you have your being in an
incomprehensible world where you shall
be for ever, where an unseen God, who is
eternally alone, dwells with His creatures?
Must your betrothed die in a fire, or
disappear before your eyes in the green
depths of the ocean, for it to be revealed
to you for an instant that the last limits of
the kingdom of love transcend perhaps the
scarcely visible flames of Mira, Altair or
Berenice’s tresses? Had your eyes been
open, might you not have beheld in a kiss
that which to-day you perceive in a
catastrophe? Are the divine recollections
that slumber in our souls to be awakened
only by the lance-thrusts of grief? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
sage needs no such violent arousing. He
sees a tear, a maiden’s gesture, a drop of
water that falls; he listens to a passing
thought, presses a brother’s hand, approaches
a lip, with open eyes and open soul. He
never ceases to behold that of which you
have caught but a passing glimpse; and a
smile will readily tell him all that it needed
a tempest, or even the hand of death, to
reveal to you.</p>

<p>For what are in reality the things
we call ‘Wisdom,’ ‘Virtue,’ ‘Heroism,’
‘sublime hours,’ and ‘great moments of
life,’ but the moments when we have more
or less issued forth from ourselves, and
have been able to halt, be it only for an
instant, on the step of one of the eternal
gates whence we see that the faintest cry,
the most colourless thought, and most
nerveless gestures do not drop into nothingness;
or that if they do indeed thus drop,
the fall itself is so immense that it suffices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to give an august character to our life?
Why wait till the firmament shall open
amid the roar of the thunderbolt? We
must watch for the happy moments when
it opens in silence; and it is ever thus
opening. You seek God in your life, and
you say God appears not. But in what
life are there not thousands of hours akin
to the hour in that drama where all are
waiting for the divine intervention, and
none perceive it, till an invisible thought
that has flitted across the consciousness of
a dying man suddenly reveals itself, and
an old man cries out, sobbing for joy and
terror, ‘But God, there is God!’....</p>

<p>Must we always be warned, and can we
only fall on our knees when some one is
there to tell us that God is passing by?
If you have loved profoundly you have
needed no one to tell you that your soul
was a thing as great in itself as the world;
that the stars, the flowers, the waves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
night and sea were not solitary; that it
was on the threshold of appearances that
everything began, but nothing ended, and
that the very lips you kissed belonged to a
creature who was loftier, much purer, and
much more beautiful than the one whom
your arms enfolded. You have beheld
that which in life cannot be seen without
ecstasy. But cannot we live as though we
always loved? It was this that the saints
and heroes did; this and nothing more.
Ah! truly too much of our life is spent in
waiting, like the blind men in the legend
who had travelled far so that they might
hear their God. They were seated on the
steps, and when asked what they were
doing in the courtyard of the sanctuary,
‘We are waiting,’ they replied, shaking
their heads, ‘and God has not yet
said a single word.’ But they had not
seen that the brass doors of the temple
were closed, and they knew not that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
edifice was resounding with the voice of
their God. Never for an instant does
God cease to speak; but no one thinks of
opening the doors. And yet, with a little
watchfulness, it were not difficult to hear
the word that God must speak concerning
our every act.</p>

<p>We all live in the sublime. Where else
can we live? That is the only place of
life. And if aught be lacking, it is not the
chance of living in heaven, rather is it
watchfulness and meditation, also perhaps
a little ecstasy of soul. Though you have
but a little room, do you fancy that God
is not there, too, and that it is impossible
to live therein a life that shall be somewhat
lofty? If you complain of being alone, of
the absence of events, of loving no one
and being unloved, do you think that the
words are true? Do you imagine that
one can possibly be alone, that love can be
a thing one knows, a thing one sees; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
events can be weighed like the gold and
silver of ransom? Cannot a living thought&mdash;proud
or humble, it matters not; so it
come but from your soul, it is great for
you&mdash;cannot a lofty desire, or simply a
moment of solemn watchfulness to life,
enter a little room? And if you love
not, or are unloved, and can yet see with
some depth of insight that thousands of
things are beautiful, that the soul is great
and life almost unspeakably earnest, is
that not as beautiful as though you loved
or were loved? And if the sky itself is
hidden from you, ‘does not the great
starry sky,’ asks the poet, ‘spread over our
soul, in spite of all, under guise of death?’
... All that happens to us is divinely
great, and we are always in the centre of a
great world. But we must accustom ourselves
to live like an angel who has just
sprung to life, like a woman who loves, or
a man on the point of death. If you knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
that you were going to die to-night, or
merely that you would have to go away
and never return, would you, looking
upon men and things for the last time, see
them in the same light that you have
hitherto seen them? Would you not love
as you never yet have loved? Is it the
virtue or evil of the appearances around
you that would be magnified? Would it
be given you to behold the beauty or the
ugliness of the soul? Would not everything,
down to actual evil and suffering,
be transformed into love, overflowing with
gentlest tears? Does not, to quote the
sage, each opportunity for pardon rob
departure or death of something of its
bitterness? And yet, in the radiance or
sorrow or death, is it towards truth or
error that one has taken the last steps one
is allowed to take?</p>

<p>Is it the living or the dying who can see
and are in the right? Ah! thrice happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
they who have thought, spoken, and acted
so as to receive the approval of those who
are about to die, or to whom a great sorrow
has given clearer insight! The sage, to
whom none would hearken in life, can
meet with no sweeter reward. If you
have lived in obscure beauty, you have no
cause for disquiet. At the end there must
always sound within the heart of man an
hour of supreme justice; and misfortune
opens eyes that were never open before.
Who knows whether at this very moment
your shadow be not passing over the soul
of a dying man and be not recognised by
him as the shadow of one who already
knew the truth? May it not be at the
bedside of the last agony that is woven the
veritable and most precious crown of sage
and hero, and of all who have known how
to live earnestly amid the sorrows, lofty,
pure, and discreet, of life according to the
soul?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Death,’ says Lavater, ‘does not only
beautify our inanimate form; nay, the mere
thought of death gives a more beautiful
form to life itself.’ And even so does
every thought, that is infinite as death,
beautify our life. But we must not deceive
ourselves. To every man there come
noble thoughts, that pass across his heart
like great white birds. Alas! they do not
count; they are strangers whom we are
surprised to see, whom we dismiss with
importunate gesture. Their time is too
short to touch our life. Our soul will not
become earnest and deep-searching, as is
the soul of the angels, for that we have,
for one fleeting instant, beheld the universe
in the shadow of death or eternity, in the
radiance of joy or the flames of beauty and
love. We have all known moments such
as these, moments that have but left worthless
ashes behind. These things must be
habitual with us; it is of no avail that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
should come by chance. We must learn to
live in a beauty, an earnestness, that shall
have become part of ourselves. In life,
there is no creature so degraded but knows
full well which is the noble and beautiful
thing that he should do; but this noble and
beautiful thing is not strong enough within
him. It is this invisible and abstract
strength that it must be our endeavour to
increase, first of all. And this strength
increases only in those who have acquired
the habit of resting, more frequently than
others, upon the summits where life absorbs
the soul, upon the heights whence we see
that every act and every thought are infallibly
bound up with something great and
immortal. Look upon men and things with
the inner eye, with its form and desire,
never forgetting that the shadow they throw
as they pass by, upon hillock or wall, is but
the fleeting image of a mightier shadow,
which, like the wing of an imperishable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
swan, floats over every soul that draws near
to their soul. Do not believe that thoughts
such as these can be mere ornaments, and
without influence upon the lives of those
who admit them. It is far more important
that one’s life should be perceived than
that it should be transformed; for no
sooner has it been perceived, than it transforms
itself of its own accord. These
thoughts of which I speak make up the
secret treasure of heroism; and, on the
day that life compels us to disclose this
treasure, we are startled to find therein no
forces other than those by which we are
impelled towards perfect beauty. Then it
is no longer necessary that a great king
should die for us to remember that ‘the
world does not end at the house-doors,’
and not an evening passes but the smallest
thing suffices to ennoble the soul.</p>

<p>Yet it is not by telling yourself that God
is great and that you move in His radiance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that you will be able to live in the beauty
and fertile depths where the heroes dwelt.
You may perhaps remind yourself, day and
night, that the hands of all the invisible
powers are waving over your head like a
tent with countless folds, and yet shall the
least gesture of these hands be imperceptible
to you. It behoves you to be keenly
vigilant; and better had you watch in the
market-place than slumber in the temple.
Beauty and grandeur are everywhere; for
it needs but an unexpected incident to
reveal them to us. This is known to nearly
all men; but know it though they may, it
is only when fortune or death lashes them
that they grope around the wall of life in
search of the crevices through which God
may be seen. They know full well that
there are eternal crevices even in the
humble walls of a hovel, and that the
smallest window cannot take away a line or
a star from the immensity of heavenly space.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
But it is not enough to possess a truth; it
is essential that the truth should possess us.</p>

<p>And yet are we in a world where the
smallest events assume, spontaneously, a
beauty that ever becomes purer and loftier.
There is nothing that coalesces more readily
than earth and sky; if your eyes have
rested upon the stars, before enfolding in
your arms the woman you love, your
embrace will not be the same as though you
had merely looked at the walls of your
room. Be sure that the day you lingered
to follow a ray of light through a crevice
in the door of life, you did something as
great as though you had bandaged the
wounds of your enemy, for at that moment
did you no longer have any enemies.</p>

<p>Our lives must be spent seeking our
God, for God hides; but His artifices, once
they be known, seem so simple and smiling!
From that moment, the merest nothing
reveals His presence, and the greatness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
our life depends on so little! Even thus
may the verse of a poet, in the midst of
the humble incidents of ordinary days,
suddenly reveal to us something that is
stupendous. No solemn word has been
pronounced, and we feel that nothing has
been called forth; and yet, why has an
ineffable face beckoned to us from behind
an old man’s tears, why does a vast night,
starred with angels, extend over the smile
of a child, and why, around a yes or no,
murmured by a soul that sings and busies
itself with other matters, do we suddenly
hold our breath for an instant and say to
ourselves, ‘Here is the house of God, and
this one of the approaches to heaven’?</p>

<p>It is because these poets have been more
heedful than we to the ‘never-ending
shadow.’ ... That is the essence of supreme
poetry, that, and that alone, and its sole
aim is to keep open ‘the great road that
leads from the seen to the unseen.’ But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
that is life’s supreme aim, too, and it is
easier far to attain in life than in the
noblest of poems, for these have had to
abandon the two great wings of silence.
Not a single day is trivial. It is essential
that this idea should sink into our life and
take root therein. There is no question of
being sad. Small joys, faint smiles, and
great tears, all these fill up the same nook
in time and space. You can play in life as
innocently ‘as a child about a death-bed,’
and it is not the tears that are indispensable.
Smiles as well as tears open the gates of the
other world. Go or come, you will find all
you need in the darkness, but never forget
that you are close to the gate.</p>

<p class="pc slarge">*</p>

<p>After this lengthy digression, I return
to my starting-point, which was that ‘it is
well that men should be reminded that the
very humblest of them has the power to
fashion, after a divine model that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
chooses not, a great moral personality,
composed in equal parts of himself and the
ideal.’ It is only in the depths of life that
this ‘great moral personality’ can be
carved out; and only by means of incessant
‘revelations of the divine’ can we add
to the stores of the ideal we require. To
every man is it given to attain in spirit to
the heights of virtuous life, and to know at
all times what his conduct should be, would
he act like a hero or a saint. But more
than this is needed. It is essential that the
spiritual atmosphere about us should be
transformed to such a degree that it ends
by resembling the atmosphere of Swedenborg’s
beautiful countries of the age of
gold, wherein the air permitted not a falsehood
to leave the lips. An instant comes
then, when the smallest ill that we fain
would commit falls at our feet like a
leaden ball upon a disc of bronze; when
everything changes, though we know it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
not, into beauty, love, or truth. But this
atmosphere enwraps those only who have
been heedful to ventilate their life sufficiently
by at times flinging open the
gates of the other world. It is when we
are near to those gates that we see; it is
when we are near to those gates that we
love. For to love one’s neighbour does
not mean only to give oneself to him, to
serve, help, and sustain others. We may
possibly be neither good, nor noble, nor
beautiful, even in the midst of the greatest
sacrifice; and the sister of charity who
dies by the bedside of a typhoid patient
may perchance have a mean, rancorous,
miserable soul. To love one’s neighbour
in the immovable depths means to love in
others that which is eternal; for one’s
neighbour, in the truest sense of the term,
is that which approaches the nearest to God;
in other words, all that is best and purest
in man; and it is only by ever lingering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
near the gates I spoke of, that you can
discover the divine in the soul. Then will
you be able to say with the great Jean
Paul: ‘When I desire to love most tenderly
one who is dear to me, and wish to
forgive him everything, I have but to look
at him for a few moments in silence.’ To
learn to love, one must first learn to see.
‘I lived for twenty years by my sister’s
side,’ said a friend to me, one day, ‘and <i>I
saw her</i> for the first time at the moment
of our mother’s death.’ Here, too, it had
been necessary that death should violently
fling open an eternal gate, so that two
souls might behold each other in a ray of
the primeval light. Is there one amongst
us who has not near to him sisters he has
never seen?</p>

<p>Happily, even in those whose vision is
most limited, there is always something
that acts in silence as though they had
seen. It is possible, perhaps, that to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
good is only to be in a little light what
all are in darkness. Therefore, doubtless,
is it well that we should endeavour to raise
our life, and should strive towards summits
where ill-doing becomes impossible.
And therefore, too, is it well to accustom
the eye to behold events and men in a
divine atmosphere. But even that is not
indispensable; and how small must the
difference seem to the eyes of a God!
We are in a world where truth reigns at
the bottom of things, and where it is not
truth but falsehood that needs to be explained.
If the happiness of your brother
sadden you, do not despise yourself; you
will not have to travel far along the road
before you will come across something in
yourself that will not be saddened. And
even though you do not travel the road, it
matters little: something there was that was
not sad....</p>

<p>Those who think of nothing have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
same truth as those who think of God; the
truth is a little further from the threshold,
that is all. ‘Even in the life that is
most ordinary,’ says Renan, ‘the part that
is done for God is enormous. The lowest
of men would rather be just than unjust:
we all worship, we all pray, numbers of
times every day, without knowing it.’
And we are surprised when chance suddenly
reveals to us the importance of this
divine part. There are about us thousands
and thousands of poor creatures who have
nothing of beauty in their lives: they
come, they go, in obscurity, and we believe
that all is dead within them; and no one
pays any heed. And then one day a simple
word, an unexpected silence, a little tear
that springs from the source of beauty
itself, tell us that they have found the
means of raising aloft, in the shadow of
their soul, an ideal a thousand times more
beautiful than the most beautiful things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
their ears have ever heard, or their eyes
ever seen. Oh, noble and pallid ideals of
silence and shadow! It is you, above all,
who call forth the smile of the angels, it is
you, above all, who soar direct to God!
In what myriads of hovels, in what dens of
misery, in what prisons, perhaps, are you
not being cherished at this moment, cherished
with the purest blood and tears of an
unhappy soul that has never smiled; even
as the bees, at the time when all the flowers
are dead about them, still offer to her who
is to be their queen a honey a thousand
times more precious than the honey they
give to their little sisters of daily life....
Which of us has not met, more than once,
along the paths of life, a forsaken soul that
has yet not lost the courage to cherish, in
the darkness, a thought diviner and purer
than all those that so many others had the
power to choose in the light? Here, too,
it is simplicity that is God’s favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
slave; and it is enough, perhaps, that a
few sages should know what has to be
done, for the rest of us to act as though
we knew too....</p>

<h2 class="p4 b2">THE INNER BEAUTY</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">NOTHING in the whole world is so
athirst for beauty as the soul, nor
is there anything to which beauty clings so
readily. There is nothing in the world
capable of such spontaneous up-lifting, of
such speedy ennoblement; nothing that
offers more scrupulous obedience to the
pure and noble commands it receives.
There is nothing in the world that yields
deeper submission to the empire of a thought
that is loftier than other thoughts. And
on this earth of ours there are but few
souls that can withstand the dominion of
the soul that has suffered itself to become
beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>In all truth might it be said that beauty
is the unique aliment of our soul, for in all
places does it search for beauty, and it
perishes not of hunger even in the most
degraded of lives. For indeed nothing of
beauty can pass by and be altogether unperceived.
Perhaps does it never pass by
save only in our unconsciousness, but its
action is no less puissant in gloom of night
than by light of day; the joy it procures
may be less tangible, but other difference
there is none. Look at the most ordinary
of men, at a time when a little beauty has
contrived to steal into their darkness.
They have come together, it matters not
where, and for no special reason; but no
sooner are they assembled than their very
first thought would seem to be to close
the great doors of life. Yet has each one
of them, when alone, more than once lived
in accord with his soul. He has loved
perhaps, of a surety he has suffered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Inevitably must he, too, have heard the
‘sounds that come from the distant country
of Splendour and Terror’; and many an
evening has he bowed down in silence before
laws that are deeper than the sea. And
yet when these men are assembled it is with
the basest of things that they love to
debauch themselves. They have a strange
indescribable fear of beauty, and as their
number increases so does this fear become
greater, resembling indeed their dread of
silence or of a verity that is too pure.
And so true is this that, were one of them
to have done something heroic in the
course of the day, he would ascribe wretched
motives to his conduct, thereby endeavouring
to find excuses for it, and these motives
would lie readily to his hand in that lower
region where he and his fellows were
assembled. And yet listen: a proud and
lofty word has been spoken, a word that
has in a measure undammed the springs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
life. For one instant has a soul dared to
reveal itself, even such as it is in love and
sorrow, such as it is in face of death and in
the solitude that dwells around the stars of
night. Disquiet prevails, on some faces
there is astonishment, others smile. But
have you never felt at moments such as
those how unanimous is the fervour wherewith
every soul admires, and how unspeakably
even the very feeblest, from the remotest
depths of its dungeon, approves the
word it has recognised as akin to itself?
For they have all suddenly sprung to life
again in the primitive and normal atmosphere
that is their own; and could you but
hearken with angels’ ears, I doubt not but
you would hear mightiest applause in that
kingdom of amazing radiance wherein the
souls do dwell. Do you not think that even
the most timid of them would take courage
unto themselves were but similar words to
be spoken every evening? Do you not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
think that men would live purer lives?
And yet though the word come not again,
still will something momentous have happened,
that must leave still more momentous
trace behind. Every evening will its
sisters recognise the soul that pronounced
the word, and henceforth, be the conversation
never so trivial, its mere presence will,
I know not how, add thereto something of
majesty. Whatever else betide, there has
been a change that we cannot determine.
No longer will such absolute power be
vested in the baser side of things, and
henceforth, even the most terror stricken
of souls will know that there is somewhere
a place of refuge....</p>

<p>Certain it is that the natural and primitive
relationship of soul to soul is a
relationship of beauty. For beauty is the
only language of our soul; none other is
known to it. It has no other life, it can
produce nothing else, in nothing else can it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
take interest. And therefore it is that the
most oppressed, nay, the most degraded of
souls&mdash;if it may truly be said that a soul can
be degraded&mdash;immediately hail with acclamation
every thought, every word or deed,
that is great and beautiful. Beauty is the
only element wherewith the soul is organically
connected, and it has no other standard
of judgment. This is brought home to us
at every moment of our life, and is no less
evident to the man by whom beauty may
more than once have been denied than to
him who is ever seeking it in his heart.
Should a day come when you stand in
profoundest need of another’s sympathy,
would you go to him who was wont to
greet the passage of beauty with a sneering
smile? Would you go to him whose shake
of the head had sullied a generous action
or a mere impulse that was pure? Even
though perhaps you had been of those who
commended him, you would none the less,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
when it was truth that knocked at your
door, turn to the man who had known how
to prostrate himself and love. In its very
depths had your soul passed its judgment,
and it is this silent and unerring judgment
that will rise to the surface, after thirty
years perhaps, and send you towards a
sister who shall be more truly you than
you are yourself, for that she has been
nearer to beauty....</p>

<p>There needs but so little to encourage
beauty in our soul; so little to awaken the
slumbering angels; or perhaps is there no
need of awakening&mdash;it is enough that we
lull them not to sleep. It requires more
effort to fall, perhaps, than to rise. Can
we, without putting constraint upon ourselves,
confine our thoughts to everyday
things at times when the sea stretches
before us, and we are face to face with the
night? And what soul is there but knows
that it is ever confronting the sea, ever in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
presence of an eternal night? Did we but
dread beauty less it would come about that
nought else in life would be visible; for in
reality it is beauty that underlies everything,
it is beauty alone that exists. There
is no soul but is conscious of this, none that
is not in readiness; but where are those
that hide not their beauty? And yet must
one of them ‘begin.’ Why not dare to
be the one to ‘begin’? The others are
all watching eagerly around us like little
children in front of a marvellous palace.
They press upon the threshold, whispering
to each other and peering through every
crevice, but there is not one who dares put
his shoulder to the door. They are all
waiting for some grown-up person to come
and fling it open. But hardly ever does
such a one pass by.</p>

<p>And yet what is needed to become the
grown-up person for whom they lie in wait?
So little! The soul is not exacting. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
thought that is almost beautiful&mdash;a thought
that you speak not, but that you cherish
within you at this moment, will irradiate
you as though you were a transparent vase.
They will see it and their greeting to you
will be very different than had you been
meditating how best to deceive your
brother. We are surprised when certain
men tell us that they have never come
across real ugliness, that they cannot conceive
that a soul can be base. Yet need
there be no cause for surprise. These men
had ‘begun.’ They themselves had been
the first to be beautiful, and had therefore
attracted all the beauty that passed by, as a
lighthouse attracts the vessels from the
four corners of the horizon. Some there
are who complain of women, for instance,
never dreaming that, the first time a man
meets a woman, a single word or thought
that denies the beautiful or profound will
be enough to poison for ever <i>his existence</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in her soul. ‘For my part,’ said a sage to
me one day, ‘I have never come across a
single woman who did not bring to me
something that was great.’ He was great
himself first of all; therein lay his secret.
There is one thing only that the soul can
never forgive; it is to have been compelled
to behold, or share, or pass close to an ugly
action, word, or thought. It cannot forgive,
for forgiveness here were but the denial of
itself. And yet with the generality of
men, ingenuity, strength and skill do but
imply that the soul must first of all be
banished from their life, and that every
impulse that lies too deep must be carefully
brushed aside. Even in love do they act
thus, and therefore it is that the woman,
who is so much nearer the truth, can
scarcely ever live a moment of the true life
with them. It is as though men dreaded
the contact of their soul, and were anxious
to keep its beauty at immeasurable distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Whereas, on the contrary, we should
endeavour to move in advance of ourselves.
If at this moment you think or say something
that is too beautiful to be true in
you&mdash;if you have but endeavoured to think
or say it to-day, on the morrow it will be
true. We must try to be more beautiful
than ourselves; we shall never distance our
soul. We can never err when it is question
of silent or hidden beauty. Besides, so
long as the spring within us be limpid, it
matters but little whether error there be
or not. But do any of us ever dream of
making the slightest unseen effort? And
yet in the domain where we are everything
is effective, for that everything is waiting.
All the doors are unlocked, we have but to
push them open, and the palace is full of
manacled queens. A single word will very
often suffice to clear the mountain of refuse.
Why not have the courage to meet a base
question with a noble answer? Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
imagine it would pass quite unnoticed or
merely arouse surprise? Do you not think
it would be more akin to the discourse
that would naturally be held between two
souls? We know not where it may give
encouragement, where freedom. Even he
who rejects your words will, in spite of
himself, have taken a step towards the
beauty that is within him. Nothing of
beauty dies without having purified something,
nor can aught of beauty be lost.
Let us not be afraid of sowing it along the
road. It may remain there for weeks or
years, but like the diamond it cannot dissolve,
and finally there will pass by some one
whom its glitter will attract; he will pick it
up and go his way, rejoicing. Then why
keep back a lofty, beautiful word, for that
you doubt whether others will understand?
An instant of higher goodness was impending
over you; why hinder its coming, even
though you believe not that those about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
you will profit thereby? What if you are
among men of the valley, is that sufficient
reason for checking the instinctive movement
of your soul towards the mountain
peaks? Does darkness rob deep feeling of
its power? Have the blind nought but
their eyes wherewith to distinguish those
who love them from those who love them
not? Can the beauty not exist that is not
understood, and is there not in every man
something that does understand&mdash;in regions
far beyond what he seems to understand,
far beyond, too, what he believes he understands?
‘Even to the very wretchedest of
all,’ said to me one day the loftiest minded
creature it has ever been my happiness to
know, ‘even to the very wretchedest of all
I never have the courage to say anything
in reply that is ugly or mediocre.’ I have
for a long time followed that man’s life,
and have seen the inexplicable power he
exercised over the most obscure, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
unapproachable, the blindest, even the most
rebellious of souls. For no tongue can tell
the power of a soul that strives to live in
an atmosphere of beauty, and is actively
beautiful in itself. And indeed is it not
the quality of this activity that renders a
life either miserable or divine?</p>

<p>If we could but probe to the root of
things it might well be discovered that it
is by the strength of some souls that are
beautiful that others are sustained in life.
Is it not the idea we each form of certain
chosen ones that constitutes the only living,
effective morality? But in this idea how
much is there of the soul that is chosen,
how much of him who chooses? Do not
these things blend very mysteriously, and
does not this ideal morality lie infinitely
deeper than the morality of the most
beautiful books? A far-reaching influence
exists therein whose limits it is indeed difficult
to define, and a fountain of strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
whereat we all of us drink many times a
day. Would not any weakness in one of
those creatures whom you thought perfect
and loved in the region of beauty, at once
lessen your confidence in the universal
greatness of things, and would your admiration
for them suffer?</p>

<p>And again, I doubt whether anything in
the world can beautify a soul more
spontaneously, more naturally, than the
knowledge that somewhere in its neighbourhood
there exists a pure and noble
being whom it can unreservedly love.
When the soul has veritably drawn near to
such a being, beauty is no longer a lovely,
lifeless thing that one exhibits to the
stranger, for it suddenly takes unto itself
an imperious existence, and its activity
becomes so natural as to be henceforth
irresistible. Wherefore you will do well
to think it over, for none are alone, and
those who are good must watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Plotinus, in the eighth book of the fifth
‘Ennead,’ after speaking of the beauty
that is ‘intelligible’&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, divine, concludes
thus: ‘As regards ourselves, we are
beautiful when we belong to ourselves, and
ugly when we lower ourselves to our
inferior nature. Also are we beautiful
when we know ourselves, and ugly when
we have no such knowledge.’ Bear it in
mind, however, that here we are on the
mountains, where not to know oneself
means far more than mere ignorance of
what takes place within us at moments of
jealousy or love, fear or envy, happiness
or unhappiness. Here not to know oneself
means to be unconscious of all the
divine that throbs in man. As we wander
from the gods within us so does ugliness
enwrap us; as we discover them, so do we
become more beautiful. But it is only by
revealing the divine that is in us that
we may discover the divine in others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Needs must one god beckon to another,
and no signal is so imperceptible but they
will every one of them respond. It cannot
be said too often that, be the crevice never
so small, it will yet suffice for all the
waters of heaven to pour into our soul.
Every cup is stretched out to the unknown
spring, and we are in a region where none
think of aught but beauty. If we could
ask of an angel what it is that our souls do
in the shadow, I believe the angel would
answer, after having looked for many years
perhaps, and seen far more than the things
the soul seems to do in the eyes of men,
‘They transform into beauty all the little
things that are given to them.’ Ah! we
must admit that the human soul is
possessed of singular courage! Resignedly
does it labour, its whole life long, in the
darkness whither most of us relegate it,
where it is spoken to by none. There,
never complaining, does it do all that in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
power lies, striving to tear from out the
pebbles we fling to it the nucleus of eternal
light that peradventure they contain. And
in the midst of its work it is ever lying in
wait for the moment when it may show, to
a sister who is more tenderly cared for, or
who chances to be nearer, the treasures it
has so toilfully amassed. But thousands
of existences there are that no sister visits;
thousands of existences wherein life has
infused such timidity into the soul that it
departs without saying a word, without
even once having been able to deck itself
with the humblest jewels of its humble
crown....</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of all, does it watch over
everything from out its invisible heaven.
It warns and loves, it admires, attracts,
repels. At every fresh event does it rise
to the surface, where it lingers till it be
thrust down again, being looked upon as
wearisome and insane. It wanders to and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
fro, like Cassandra at the gates of the
Atrides. It is ever giving utterance to
words of shadowy truth, but there are
none to listen. When we raise our eyes it
yearns for a ray of sun or star, that it may
weave into a thought, or, haply, an
impulse, which shall be unconscious and
very pure. And if our eyes bring it
nothing, still will it know how to turn its
pitiful disillusion into something ineffable,
that it will conceal even till its death.
When we love, how eagerly does it drink
in the light from behind the closed door&mdash;keen
with expectation, it yet wastes not
a minute, and the light that steals through
the apertures becomes beauty and truth to
the soul. But if the door opens not (and
how many lives are there wherein it does
open?) it will go back into its prison, and
its regret will perhaps be a loftier verity
that shall never be seen, for we are now in
the region of transformations whereof none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
may speak; and though nothing born this
side of the door can be lost, yet does it
never mingle with our life....</p>

<p>I said just now that the soul changed
into beauty the little things we gave to it.
It would even seem, the more we think of
it, that the soul has no other reason for
existence, and that all its activity is consumed
in amassing, at the depths of us, a
treasure of indescribable beauty. Might
not everything naturally turn into beauty,
were we not unceasingly interrupting the
arduous labours of our soul? Does not
evil itself become precious so soon as it has
gathered therefrom the deep lying diamond
of repentance? The acts of injustice
whereof you have been guilty, the tears
you have caused to flow, will not these
end too by becoming so much radiance
and love in your soul? Have you ever
cast your eyes into this kingdom of
purifying flame that is within you?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Perhaps a great wrong may have been
done you to-day, the act itself being mean
and disheartening, the mode of action of
the basest, and ugliness wrapped you round
as your tears fell. But let some years
elapse, then give one look into your soul,
and tell me whether, beneath the recollection
of that act, you see not something
that is already purer than thought; an
indescribable, unnameable force that has
nought in common with the forces of this
world; a mysterious inexhaustible spring
of the other life, whereat you may drink
for the rest of your days. And yet will
you have rendered no assistance to the untiring
queen; other thoughts will have
filled your mind, and it will be without
your knowledge that the act will have
been purified in the silence of your being,
and will have flown into the precious
waters that lie in the great reservoir of
truth and beauty, which, unlike the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
shallower reservoir of true or beautiful
thoughts, has an ever unruffled surface,
and remains for all time out of reach of
the breath of life. Emerson tells us that
there is not an act or event in our life but,
sooner or later, casts off its outer shell,
and bewilders us by its sudden flight, from
the very depths of us, on high into the
empyrean. And this is true to a far
greater extent than Emerson had foreseen,
for the further we advance in these
regions, the diviner are the spheres we
discover.</p>

<p>We can form no adequate conception of
what this silent activity of the souls that
surround us may really mean. Perhaps you
have spoken a pure word to one of your
fellows by whom it has not been understood.
You look upon it as lost and
dismiss it from your mind. But one day,
peradventure, the word comes up again
extraordinarily transformed, and revealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the unexpected fruit it has borne in the
darkness; then silence once more falls over
all. But it matters not; we have learned
that nothing can be lost in the soul, and
that even to the very pettiest there come
moments of splendour. It is unmistakably
borne home to us that even the unhappiest
and the most destitute of men have at the
depths of their being and in spite of themselves
a treasure of beauty that they cannot
despoil. They have but to acquire the
habit of dipping into this treasure. It
suffices not that beauty should keep solitary
festival in life; it has to become a festival
of every day. There needs no great effort
to be admitted into the ranks of those
‘whose eyes no longer behold earth in
flower and sky in glory in infinitesimal
fragments, but indeed in sublime masses,’
and I speak here of flowers and sky that
are purer and more lasting than those that
we behold. Thousands of channels there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
are through which the beauty of our soul
may sail even unto our thoughts. Above
all is there the wonderful, central channel
of love.</p>

<p>Is it not in love that are found the
purest elements of beauty that we can
offer to the soul? Some there are who do
thus in beauty love each other. And to
love thus means that, little by little, the
sense of ugliness is lost; that one’s eyes
are closed to all the littlenesses of life, to
all but the freshness and virginity of the
very humblest of souls. Loving thus, we
have no longer even the need to forgive.
Loving thus, we can no longer have
anything to conceal, for that the ever-present
soul transforms all things into
beauty. It is to behold evil in so far only
as it purifies indulgence, and teaches us no
longer to confound the sinner with his sin.
Loving thus do we raise on high within
ourselves all those about us who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
attained an eminence where failure has
become impossible; heights whence a
paltry action has so far to fall that,
touching earth, it is compelled to yield up
its diamond soul. It is to transform,
though all unconsciously, the feeblest intention
that hovers about us into illimitable
movement. It is to summon all that is
beautiful in earth, heaven or soul, to the
banquet of love. Loving thus, we do
indeed exist before our fellows as we exist
before God. It means that the least
gesture will call forth the presence of the
soul with all its treasure. No longer is
there need of death, disaster or tears for
that the soul shall appear; a smile suffices.
Loving thus, we perceive truth in happiness
as profoundly as some of the heroes
perceived it in the radiance of greatest
sorrow. It means that the beauty that
turns into love is undistinguishable from
the love that turns into beauty. It means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to be able no longer to tell where the ray
of a star leaves off and the kiss of an
ordinary thought begins. It means to have
come so near to God that the angels possess
us. Loving thus, the same soul will have
been so beautified by us all that it will
become, little by little, the ‘unique angel’
mentioned by Swedenborg. It means that
each day will reveal to us a new beauty in
that mysterious angel, and that we shall
walk together in a goodness that shall ever
become more and more living, loftier and
loftier. For there exists also a lifeless
beauty, made up of the past alone; but the
veritable love renders the past useless, and
its approach creates a boundless future of
goodness, without disaster and without
tears. To love thus is but to free one’s
soul, and to become as beautiful as the soul
thus freed. ‘If, in the emotion that this
spectacle cannot fail to awaken in thee,’
says the great Plotinus, when dealing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
kindred matters&mdash;and of all the intellects
known to me that of Plotinus draws the
nearest to the divine&mdash;‘If, in the emotion
that this spectacle cannot fail to awaken in
thee, thou proclaimest not that it is beautiful;
and if, plunging thine eyes into
thyself, thou dost not then feel the charm
of beauty, it is in vain that, thy disposition
being such, thou shouldst seek the intelligible
beauty; for thou wouldst seek it
only with that which is ugly and impure.
Therefore it is that the discourse we hold
here is not addressed to all men. But if
thou hast recognised beauty within thyself,
see that thou rise to the recollection of the
intelligible beauty.’</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
