      FOREWORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      My sons and daughters have tried to persuade me to remodel these memoirs
      of my grandfather into a latter-day romance. But I have thought it wiser
      to leave them as he wrote them. Albeit they contain some details not of
      interest to the general public, to my notion it is such imperfections as
      these which lend to them the reality they bear. Certain it is, when
      reading them, I live his life over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Needless to say, Mr. Richard Carvel never intended them for publication.
      His first apology would be for his Scotch, and his only defence is that he
      was not a Scotchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lively capital which once reflected the wit and fashion of Europe has
      fallen into decay. The silent streets no more echo with the rumble of
      coaches and gay chariots, and grass grows where busy merchants trod.
      Stately ball-rooms, where beauty once reigned, are cold and empty and
      mildewed, and halls, where laughter rang, are silent. Time was when every
      wide-throated chimney poured forth its cloud of smoke, when every andiron
      held a generous log,&mdash;andirons which are now gone to decorate Mr.
      Centennial's home in New York or lie with a tag in the window of some
      curio shop. The mantel, carved in delicate wreaths, is boarded up, and an
      unsightly stove mocks the gilded ceiling. Children romp in that room with
      the silver door-knobs, where my master and his lady were wont to sit at
      cards in silk and brocade, while liveried blacks entered on tiptoe. No
      marble Cupids or tall Dianas fill the niches in the staircase, and the
      mahogany board, round which has been gathered many a famous toast and wit,
      is gone from the dining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Carvel's town house in Annapolis stands to-day, with its
      neighbours, a mournful relic of a glory that is past.

      CHAPTER I. LIONEL CARVEL, OF CARVEL HALL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lionel Carvel, Esq., of Carvel Hall, in the county of Queen Anne, was no
      inconsiderable man in his Lordship's province of Maryland, and indeed he
      was not unknown in the colonial capitals from Williamsburg to Boston. When
      his ships arrived out, in May or June, they made a goodly showing at the
      wharves, and his captains were ever shrewd men of judgment who sniffed a
      Frenchman on the horizon, so that none of the Carvel tobacco ever went, in
      that way, to gladden a Gallic heart. Mr. Carvel's acres were both rich and
      broad, and his house wide for the stranger who might seek its shelter, as
      with God's help so it ever shall be. It has yet to be said of the Carvels
      that their guests are hurried away, or that one, by reason of his worldly
      goods or position, shall be more welcome than another.
    </p>
    <p>
      I take no shame in the pride with which I write of my grandfather, albeit
      he took the part of his Majesty and Parliament against the Colonies. He
      was no palavering turncoat, like my Uncle Grafton, to cry &ldquo;God save the
      King!&rdquo; again when an English fleet sailed up the bay. Mr. Carvel's hand
      was large and his heart was large, and he was respected and even loved by
      the patriots as a man above paltry subterfuge. He was born at Carvel Hall
      in the year of our Lord 1696, when the house was, I am told, but a small
      dwelling. It was his father, George Carvel, my great-grandsire, reared the
      present house in the year 1720, of brick brought from England as ballast
      for the empty ships; he added on, in the years following, the wide wings
      containing the ball-room, and the banquet-hall, and the large library at
      the eastern end, and the offices. But it was my grandfather who built the
      great stables and the kennels where he kept his beagles and his fleeter
      hounds. He dearly loved the saddle and the chase, and taught me to love
      them too. Many the sharp winter day I have followed the fox with him over
      two counties, and lain that night, and a week after, forsooth, at the
      plantation of some kind friend who was only too glad to receive us. Often,
      too, have we stood together from early morning until dark night, waist
      deep, on the duck points, I with a fowling-piece I was all but too young
      to carry, and brought back a hundred red-heads or canvas-backs in our
      bags. He went with unfailing regularity to the races at Annapolis or
      Chestertown or Marlborough, often to see his own horses run, where the
      coaches of the gentry were fifty and sixty around the course; where a
      negro, or a hogshead of tobacco, or a pipe of Madeira was often staked at
      a single throw. Those times, my children, are not ours, and I thought it
      not strange that Mr. Carvel should delight in a good main between two
      cocks, or a bull-baiting, or a breaking of heads at the Chestertown fair,
      where he went to show his cattle and fling a guinea into the ring for the
      winner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it must not be thought that Lionel Carvel, your ancestor, was wholly
      unlettered because he was a sportsman, though it must be confessed that
      books occupied him only when the weather compelled, or when on his back
      with the gout. At times he would fain have me read to him as he lay in his
      great four-post bed with the flowered counterpane, from the Spectator,
      stopping me now and anon at some awakened memory of his youth. He never
      forgave Mr. Addison for killing stout, old Sir Roger de Coverley, and
      would never listen to the butler's account of his death. Mr. Carvel, too,
      had walked in Gray's Inn Gardens and met adventure at Fox Hall, and seen
      the great Marlborough himself. He had a fondness for Mr. Congreve's
      Comedies, many of which he had seen acted; and was partial to Mr. Gay's
      Trivia, which brought him many a recollection. He would also listen to
      Pope. But of the more modern poetry I think Mr. Gray's Elegy pleased him
      best. He would laugh over Swift's gall and wormwood, and would never be
      brought by my mother to acknowledge the defects in the Dean's character.
      Why? He had once met the Dean in a London drawing-room, when my
      grandfather was a young spark at Christ Church, Oxford. He never tired of
      relating that interview. The hostess was a very great lady indeed, and
      actually stood waiting for a word with his Reverence, whose whim it was
      rather to talk to the young provincial. He was a forbidding figure, in his
      black gown and periwig, so my grandfather said, with a piercing blue eye
      and shaggy brow. He made the mighty to come to him, while young Carvel
      stood between laughter and fear of the great lady's displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew of your father,&rdquo; said the Dean, &ldquo;before he went to the colonies.
      He had done better at home, sir. He was a man of parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has done indifferently well in Maryland, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Carvel, making
      his bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hath gained wealth, forsooth,&rdquo; says the Dean, wrathfully, &ldquo;and might
      have had both wealth and fame had his love for King James not turned his
      head. I have heard much of the colonies, and have read that doggerel 'Sot
      Weed Factor' which tells of the gluttonous life of ease you lead in your
      own province. You can have no men of mark from such conditions, Mr.
      Carvel. Tell me,&rdquo; he adds contemptuously, &ldquo;is genius honoured among you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, it is honoured, your Reverence,&rdquo; said my grandfather, &ldquo;but never
      encouraged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This answer so pleased the Dean that he bade Mr. Carvel dine with him next
      day at Button's Coffee House, where they drank mulled wine and old sack,
      for which young Mr. Carvel paid. On which occasion his Reverence
      endeavoured to persuade the young man to remain in England, and even went
      so far as to promise his influence to obtain him preferment. But Mr.
      Carvel chose rather (wisely or not, who can judge?) to come back to Carvel
      Hall and to the lands of which he was to be master, and to play the
      country squire and provincial magnate rather than follow the varying
      fortunes of a political party at home. And he was a man much looked up to
      in the province before the Revolution, and sat at the council board of his
      Excellency the Governor, as his father had done before him, and
      represented the crown in more matters than one when the French and savages
      were upon our frontiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although a lover of good cheer, Mr. Carvel was never intemperate. To the
      end of his days he enjoyed his bottle after dinner, nay, could scarce get
      along without it; and mixed a punch or a posset as well as any in our
      colony. He chose a good London-brewed ale or porter, and his ships brought
      Madeira from that island by the pipe, and sack from Spain and Portugal,
      and red wine from France when there was peace. And puncheons of rum from
      Jamaica and the Indies for his people, holding that no gentleman ever
      drank rum in the raw, though fairly supportable as punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carvel's house stands in Marlborough Street, a dreary mansion enough.
      Praised be Heaven that those who inherit it are not obliged to live there
      on the memory of what was in days gone by. The heavy green shutters are
      closed; the high steps, though stoutly built, are shaky after these years
      of disuse; the host of faithful servants who kept its state are nearly all
      laid side by side at Carvel Hall. Harvey and Chess and Scipio are no more.
      The kitchen, whither a boyish hunger oft directed my eyes at twilight,
      shines not with the welcoming gleam of yore. Chess no longer prepares the
      dainties which astonished Mr. Carvel's guests, and which he alone could
      cook. The coach still stands in the stables where Harvey left it, a
      lumbering relic of those lumbering times when methinks there was more of
      goodwill and less of haste in the world. The great brass knocker, once
      resplendent from Scipio's careful hand, no longer fantastically reflects
      the guest as he beats his tattoo, and Mr. Peale's portrait of my
      grandfather is gone from the dining-room wall, adorning, as you know, our
      own drawing-room at Calvert House.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shut my eyes, and there comes to me unbidden that dining-room in
      Marlborough Street of a gray winter's afternoon, when I was but a lad. I
      see my dear grandfather in his wig and silver-laced waistcoat and his blue
      velvet coat, seated at the head of the table, and the precise Scipio has
      put down the dumb-waiter filled with shining cut-glass at his left hand,
      and his wine chest at his right, and with solemn pomp driven his black
      assistants from the room. Scipio was Mr. Carvel's butler. He was forbid to
      light the candles after dinner. As dark grew on, Mr. Carvel liked the
      blazing logs for light, and presently sets the decanter on the corner of
      the table and draws nearer the fire, his guests following. I recall well
      how jolly Governor Sharpe, who was a frequent visitor with us, was wont to
      display a comely calf in silk stocking; and how Captain Daniel Clapsaddle
      would spread his feet with his toes out, and settle his long pipe between
      his teeth. And there were besides a host of others who sat at that fire
      whose names have passed into Maryland's history,&mdash;Whig and Tory
      alike. And I remember a tall slip of a lad who sat listening by the
      deep-recessed windows on the street, which somehow are always covered in
      these pictures with a fine rain. Then a coach passes,&mdash;a mahogany
      coach emblazoned with the Manners's coat of arms, and Mistress Dorothy and
      her mother within. And my young lady gives me one of those demure bows
      which ever set my heart agoing like a smith's hammer of a Monday.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. SOME MEMORIES OF CHILDHOOD
    </h2>
    <p>
      A traveller who has all but gained the last height of the great
      mist-covered mountain looks back over the painful crags he has mastered to
      where a light is shining on the first easy slope. That light is ever
      visible, for it is Youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      After nigh fourscore and ten years of life that Youth is nearer to me now
      than many things which befell me later. I recall as yesterday the day
      Captain Clapsaddle rode to the Hall, his horse covered with sweat, and the
      reluctant tidings of Captain Jack Carvel's death on his lips. And
      strangely enough that day sticks in my memory as of delight rather than
      sadness. When my poor mother had gone up the stairs on my grandfather's
      arm the strong soldier took me on his knee, and drawing his pistol from
      his holster bade me snap the lock, which I was barely able to do. And he
      told me wonderful tales of the woods beyond the mountains, and of the
      painted men who tracked them; much wilder and fiercer they were than those
      stray Nanticokes I had seen from time to time near Carvel Hall. And when
      at last he would go I clung to him, so he swung me to the back of his
      great horse Ronald, and I seized the bridle in my small hands. The noble
      beast, like his master, loved a child well, and he cantered off lightly at
      the captain's whistle, who cried &ldquo;bravo&rdquo; and ran by my side lest I should
      fall. Lifting me off at length he kissed me and bade me not to annoy my
      mother, the tears in his eyes again. And leaping on Ronald was away for
      the ferry with never so much as a look behind, leaving me standing in the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      And from that time I saw more of him and loved him better than any man
      save my grandfather. He gave me a pony on my next birthday, and a little
      hogskin saddle made especially by Master Wythe, the London saddler in the
      town, with a silver-mounted bridle. Indeed, rarely did the captain return
      from one of his long journeys without something for me and a handsome
      present for my mother. Mr. Carvel would have had him make his home with us
      when we were in town, but this he would not do. He lodged in Church
      Street, over against the Coffee House, dining at that hostelry when not
      bidden out, or when not with us. He was much sought after. I believe there
      was scarce a man of note in any of the colonies not numbered among his
      friends. 'Twas said he loved my mother, and could never come to care for
      any other woman, and he promised my father in the forests to look after
      her welfare and mine. This promise, you shall see, he faithfully kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though you have often heard from my lips the story of my mother, I must
      for the sake of those who are to come after you, set it down here as
      briefly as I may. My grandfather's bark 'Charming Sally', Captain Stanwix,
      having set out from Bristol on the 15th of April, 1736, with a fair wind
      astern and a full cargo of English goods below, near the Madeiras fell in
      with foul weather, which increased as she entered the trades. Captain
      Stanwix being a prudent man, shortened sail, knowing the harbour of
      Funchal to be but a shallow bight in the rock, and worse than the open sea
      in a southeaster. The third day he hove the Sally to; being a stout craft
      and not overladen she weathered the gale with the loss of a jib, and was
      about making topsails again when a full-rigged ship was descried in the
      offing giving signals of distress. Night was coming on very fast, and the
      sea was yet running too high for a boat to live, but the gallant captain
      furled his topsails once more to await the morning. It could be seen from
      her signals that the ship was living throughout the night, but at dawn she
      foundered before the Sally's boats could be put in the water; one of them
      was ground to pieces on the falls. Out of the ship's company and
      passengers they picked up but five souls, four sailors and a little girl
      of two years or thereabouts. The men knew nothing more of her than that
      she had come aboard at Brest with her mother, a quiet, delicate lady who
      spoke little with the other passengers. The ship was 'La Favourite du
      Roy', bound for the French Indies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Stanwix's wife, who was a good, motherly person, took charge of
      the little orphan, and arriving at Carvel Hall delivered her to my
      grandfather, who brought her up as his own daughter. You may be sure the
      emblem of Catholicism found upon her was destroyed, and she was baptized
      straightway by Doctor Hilliard, my grandfather's chaplain, into the
      Established Church. Her clothes were of the finest quality, and her little
      handkerchief had worked into the corner of it a coronet, with the initials
      &ldquo;E de T&rdquo; beside it. Around her neck was that locket with the gold chain
      which I have so often shown you, on one side of which is the miniature of
      the young officer in his most Christian Majesty's uniform, and on the
      other a yellow-faded slip of paper with these words: &ldquo;Elle est la mienne,
      quoiqu'elle ne porte pas mou nom.&rdquo; &ldquo;She is mine, although she does not
      bear my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather wrote to the owners of 'La Favourite du Roy', and likewise
      directed his English agent to spare nothing in the search for some clew to
      the child's identity. All that he found was that the mother had been
      entered on the passenger-list as Madame la Farge, of Paris, and was bound
      for Martinico. Of the father there was no trace whatever. The name &ldquo;la
      Farge&rdquo; the agent, Mr. Dix, knew almost to a certainty was assumed, and the
      coronet on the handkerchief implied that the child was of noble parentage.
      The meaning conveyed by the paper in the locket, which was plainly a
      clipping from a letter, was such that Mr. Carvel never showed it to my
      mother, and would have destroyed it had he not felt that some day it might
      aid in solving the mystery. So he kept it in his strongbox, where he
      thought it safe from prying eyes. But my Uncle Grafton, ever a deceitful
      lad, at length discovered the key and read the paper, and afterwards used
      the knowledge he thus obtained as a reproach and a taunt against my
      mother. I cannot even now write his name without repulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new member of the household was renamed Elizabeth Carvel, though they
      called her Bess, and of a course she was greatly petted and spoiled, and
      ruled all those about her. As she grew from childhood to womanhood her
      beauty became talked about, and afterwards, when Mistress Carvel went to
      the Assembly, a dozen young sparks would crowd about the door of her
      coach, and older and more serious men lost their heads on her account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her devotion to Mr. Carvel was such, however, that she seemed to care but
      little for the attention she received, and she continued to grace his
      board and entertain his company. He fairly worshipped her. It was his
      delight to surprise her with presents from England, with rich silks and
      brocades for gowns, for he loved to see her bravely dressed. The spinet he
      gave her, inlaid with ivory, we have still. And he caused a chariot to be
      made for her in London, and she had her own horses and her groom in the
      Carvel livery.
    </p>
    <p>
      People said it was but natural that she should fall in love with Captain
      Jack, my father. He was the soldier of the family, tall and straight and
      dashing. He differed from his younger brother Grafton as day from night.
      Captain Jack was open and generous, though a little given to rash
      enterprise and madcap adventure. He loved my mother from a child. His
      friend Captain Clapsaddle loved her too, and likewise Grafton, but it soon
      became evident that she would marry Captain Jack or nobody. He was my
      grandfather's favourite, and though Mr. Carvel had wished him more
      serious, his joy when Bess blushingly told him the news was a pleasure to
      see. And Grafton turned to revenge; he went to Mr. Carvel with the paper
      he had taken from the strong-box and claimed that my mother was of
      spurious birth and not fit to marry a Carvel. He afterwards spread the
      story secretly among the friends of the family. By good fortune little
      harm arose therefrom, since all who knew my mother loved her, and were
      willing to give her credit for the doubt; many, indeed, thought the story
      sprang from Grafton's jealousy and hatred. Then it was that Mr. Carvel
      gave to Grafton the estate in Kent County and bade him shift for himself,
      saying that he washed his hands of a son who had acted such a part.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Clapsaddle came to the wedding in the long drawing-room at the
      Hall and stood by Captain Jack when he was married, and kissed the bride
      heartily. And my mother cried about this afterwards, and said that it
      grieved her sorely that she should have given pain to such a noble man.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the blow which left her a widow, she continued to keep Mr. Carvel's
      home. I recall her well, chiefly as a sad and beautiful woman, stately
      save when she kissed me with passion and said that I bore my father's
      look. She drooped like the flower she was, and one spring day my
      grandfather led me to receive her blessing and to be folded for the last
      time in those dear arms. With a smile on her lips she rose to heaven to
      meet my father. And she lies buried with the rest of the Carvels at the
      Hall, next to the brave captain, her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I grew up with my grandfather, spending the winters in town and the
      long summers on the Eastern Shore. I loved the country best, and the old
      house with its hundred feet of front standing on the gentle slope rising
      from the river's mouth, the green vines Mr. Carvel had fetched from
      England all but hiding the brick, and climbing to the angled roof; and the
      velvet green lawn of silvery grass brought from England, descending gently
      terrace by terrace to the waterside, where lay our pungies and barges.
      There was then a tiny pillared porch framing the front door, for our
      ancestors never could be got to realize the Maryland climate, and would
      rarely build themselves wide verandas suitable to that colony. At Carvel
      Hall we had, to be sure, the cool spring house under the willows for
      sultry days, with its pool dished out for bathing; and a trellised arbour,
      and octagonal summer house with seats where my mother was wont to sit
      sewing while my grandfather dreamed over his pipe. On the lawn stood the
      oaks and walnuts and sycamores which still cast their shade over it, and
      under them of a summer's evening Mr. Carvel would have his tea alone; save
      oftentimes when a barge would come swinging up the river with ten
      velvet-capped blacks at the oars, and one of our friendly neighbours&mdash;Mr.
      Lloyd or Mr. Bordley, or perchance little Mr. Manners&mdash;would stop for
      a long evening with him. They seldom came without their ladies and
      children. What romps we youngsters had about the old place whilst our
      elders talked their politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      In childhood the season which delighted me the most was spring. I would
      count the days until St. Taminas, which, as you knew, falls on the first
      of May. And the old custom was for the young men to deck themselves out as
      Indian bucks and sweep down on the festivities around the Maypole on the
      town green, or at night to surprise the guests at a ball and force the
      gentlemen to pay down a shilling, and sometimes a crown apiece, and the
      host to give them a bowl of punch. Then came June. My grandfather
      celebrated his Majesty's birthday in his own jolly fashion, and I had my
      own birthday party on the tenth. And on the fifteenth, unless it chanced
      upon a Sunday, my grandfather never failed to embark in his pinnace at the
      Annapolis dock for the Hall. Once seated in the stern between Mr. Carvel's
      knees, what rapture when at last we shot out into the blue waters of the
      bay and I thought of the long summer of joy before me. Scipio was
      generalissimo of these arrangements, and was always at the dock punctually
      at ten to hand my grandfather in, a ceremony in which he took great pride,
      and to look his disapproval should we be late. As he turned over the key
      of the town house he would walk away with a stern dignity to marshal the
      other servants in the horse-boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fifteenth of June two children sat with bated breath in the pinnace,&mdash;Dorothy
      Manners and myself. Mistress Dolly was then as mischievous a little
      baggage as ever she proved afterwards. She was coming to pass a week at
      the Hall, her parents, whose place was next to ours, having gone to
      Philadelphia on a visit. We rounded Kent Island, which lay green and
      beautiful in the flashing waters, and at length caught sight of the old
      windmill, with its great arms majestically turning, and the cupola of
      Carvel House shining white among the trees; and of the upper spars of the
      shipping, with sails neatly furled, lying at the long wharves, where the
      English wares Mr. Carvel had commanded for the return trips were
      unloading. Scarce was the pinnace brought into the wind before I had
      leaped ashore and greeted with a shout the Hall servants drawn up in a
      line on the green, grinning a welcome. Dorothy and I scampered over the
      grass and into the cool, wide house, resting awhile on the easy sloping
      steps within, hand in hand. And then away for that grand tour of
      inspection we had been so long planning together. How well I recall that
      sunny afternoon, when the shadows of the great oaks were just beginning to
      lengthen. Through the greenhouses we marched, monarchs of all we surveyed,
      old Porphery, the gardener, presenting Mistress Dolly with a crown of
      orange blossoms, for which she thanked him with a pretty courtesy her
      governess had taught her. Were we not king and queen returned to our
      summer palace? And Spot and Silver and Song and Knipe, the wolf-hound,
      were our train, though not as decorous as rigid etiquette demanded, since
      they were forever running after the butterflies. On we went through the
      stiff, box-bordered walks of the garden, past the weather-beaten sundial
      and the spinning-house and the smoke-house to the stables. Here old
      Harvey, who had taught me to ride Captain Daniel's pony, is equerry, and
      young Harvey our personal attendant; old Harvey smiles as we go in and out
      of the stalls rubbing the noses of our trusted friends, and gives a gruff
      but kindly warning as to Cassandra's heels. He recalls my father at the
      same age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas Tree, the carpenter, sits sunning himself on his bench before the
      shop, but mysteriously disappears when he sees us, and returns presently
      with a little ship he has fashioned for me that winter, all complete with
      spars and sails, for Jonas was a shipwright on the Severn in the old
      country before he came as a king's passenger to the new. Dolly and I are
      off directly to the backwaters of the river, where the new boat is
      launched with due ceremony as the Conqueror, his Majesty's latest
      ship-of-the-line. Jonas himself trims her sails, and she sets off right
      gallantly across the shallows, heeling to the breeze for all the world
      like a real man-o'-war. Then the King would fain cruise at once against
      the French, but Queen Dorothy must needs go with him. His Majesty points
      out that when fighting is to be done, a ship of war is no place for a
      woman, whereat her Majesty stamps her little foot and throws her crown of
      orange blossoms from her, and starts off for the milk-house in high
      dudgeon, vowing she will play no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it ends as it ever will end, be the children young or old, for the
      French pass from his Majesty's mind and he runs after his consort to
      implore forgiveness, leaving poor Jonas to take care of the Conqueror.
    </p>
    <p>
      How short those summer days? All too short for the girl and boy who had so
      much to do in them. The sun rising over the forest often found us peeping
      through the blinds, and when he sank into the bay at night we were still
      running, tired but happy, and begging patient Hester for half an hour
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawd, Marse Dick,&rdquo; I can hear her say, &ldquo;you an' Miss Dolly's been on yo'
      feet since de dawn. And so's I, honey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so we had. We would spend whole days on the wharves, all bustle and
      excitement, sometimes seated on the capstan of the Sprightly Bess or
      perched in the nettings of the Oriole, of which ship old Stanwix was now
      captain. He had grown gray in Mr. Carvel's service, and good Mrs. Stanwix
      was long since dead. Often we would mount together on the little horse
      Captain Daniel had given me, Dorothy on a pillion behind, to go with my
      grandfather to inspect the farm. Mr. Starkie, the overseer, would ride
      beside us, his fowling-piece slung over his shoulder and his holster on
      his hip; a kind man and capable, and unlike Mr. Evans, my Uncle Grafton's
      overseer, was seldom known to use his firearms or the rawhide slung across
      his saddle. The negroes in their linsey-woolsey jackets and checked
      trousers would stand among the hills grinning at us children as we passed;
      and there was not one of them, nor of the white servants for that matter,
      that I could not call by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this time I was busily wooing Mistress Dolly; but she, little
      minx, would give me no satisfaction. I see her standing among the
      strawberries, her black hair waving in the wind, and her red lips redder
      still from the stain. And the sound of her childish voice comes back to me
      now after all these years. And this was my first proposal:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy, when you grow up and I grow up, you will marry me, and I shall
      give you all these strawberries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will marry none but a soldier,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;and a great man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then will I be a soldier,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;and greater than the Governor
      himself.&rdquo; And I believed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa says I shall marry an earl,&rdquo; retorts Dorothy, with a toss of her
      pretty head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no earls among us,&rdquo; I exclaimed hotly, for even then I had some
      of that sturdy republican spirit which prevailed among the younger
      generation. &ldquo;Our earls are those who have made their own way, like my
      grandfather.&rdquo; For I had lately heard Captain Clapsaddle say this and much
      more on the subject. But Dorothy turned up her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go home when I am eighteen,&rdquo;&mdash;she said, &ldquo;and I shall meet
      his Majesty the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And to such an argument I found no logical answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marmaduke Manners and his lady came to fetch Dorothy home. He was a
      foppish little gentleman who thought more of the cut of his waistcoat than
      of the affairs of the province, and would rather have been bidden to lead
      the assembly ball than to sit in council with his Excellency the Governor.
      My first recollection of him is of contempt. He must needs have his
      morning punch just so, and complained whiningly of Scipio if some
      perchance were spilled on the glass. He must needs be taken abroad in a
      chair when it rained. And though in the course of a summer he was often at
      Carvel Hall he never tarried long, and came to see Mr. Carvel's guests
      rather than Mr. Carvel. He had little in common with my grandfather, whose
      chief business and pleasure was to promote industry on his farm. Mr.
      Marmaduke was wont to rise at noon, and knew not wheat from barley, or
      good leaf from bad; his hands he kept like a lady's, rendering them almost
      useless by the long lace on the sleeves, and his chief pastime was
      card-playing. It was but reasonable therefore, when the troubles with the
      mother country began, that he chose the King's side alike from indolence
      and contempt for things republican.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Mrs. Manners I shall say more by and by.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a mischievous delight in giving Mr. Manners every annoyance my
      boyish fancy could conceive. The evening of his arrival he and Mr. Carvel
      set out for a stroll about the house, Mr. Marmaduke mincing his steps, for
      it had rained that morning. And presently they came upon the windmill with
      its long arms moving lazily in the light breeze, near touching the ground
      as they passed, for the mill was built in the Dutch fashion. I know not
      what moved me, but hearing Mr. Manners carelessly humming a minuet while
      my grandfather explained the usefulness of the mill, I seized hold of one
      of the long arms as it swung by, and before the gentlemen could prevent
      was carried slowly upwards. Dorothy screamed, and her father stood stock
      still with amazement and fear, Mr. Carvel being the only one who kept his
      presence of mind. &ldquo;Hold on tight, Richard!&rdquo; I heard him cry. It was dizzy
      riding, though the motion was not great, and before I had reached the
      right angle I regretted my rashness. I caught a glimpse of the Bay with
      the red sun on it, and as I turned saw far below me the white figure of
      Ivie Rawlinson, the Scotch miller, who had run out. &ldquo;O haith!&rdquo; he shouted.
      &ldquo;Hand fast, Mr. Richard!&rdquo;&mdash;And so I clung tightly and came down
      without much inconvenience, though indifferently glad to feel the ground
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marmaduke, as I expected, was in a great temper, and swore he had not
      had such a fright for years. He looked for Mr. Carvel to cane me stoutly:
      But Ivie laughed heartily, and said: &ldquo;I wad yell gang far for anither
      laddie wi' the spunk, Mr. Manners,&rdquo; and with a sly look at my grandfather,
      &ldquo;Ilka day we hae some sic whigmeleery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I think Mr. Carvel was not ill pleased with the feat, or with Mr.
      Marmaduke's way of taking it. For afterwards I overheard him telling the
      story to Colonel Lloyd, and both gentlemen laughing over Mr. Manners's
      discomfiture.

      It is a nigh impossible task on the memory to trace those influences by
      which a lad is led to form his life's opinions, and for my part I hold
      that such things are bred into the bone, and that events only serve to
      strengthen them. In this way only can I account for my bitterness, at a
      very early age, against that King whom my seeming environment should have
      made me love. For my grandfather was as stanch a royalist as ever held a
      cup to majesty's health. And children are most apt before they can reason
      for themselves to take the note from those of their elders who surround
      them. It is true that many of Mr. Carvel's guests were of the opposite
      persuasion from him: Mr. Chase and Mr. Carroll, Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Bordley,
      and many others, including our friend Captain Clapsaddle. And these
      gentlemen were frequently in argument, but political discussion is Greek
      to a lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carvel, as I have said, was most of his life a member of the Council,
      a man from whom both Governor Sharpe and Governor Eden were glad to take
      advice because of his temperate judgment and deep knowledge of the people
      of the province. At times, when his Council was scattered, Governor Sharpe
      would consult Mr. Carvel alone, and often have I known my grandfather to
      embark in haste from the Hall in response to a call from his Excellency.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas in the latter part of August, in the year 1765, made memorable by
      the Stamp Act, that I first came in touch with the deep-set feelings of
      the times then beginning, and I count from that year the awakening of the
      sympathy which determined my career. One sultry day I was wading in the
      shallows after crabs, when the Governor's messenger came drifting in, all
      impatience at the lack of wind. He ran to the house to seek Mr. Carvel,
      and I after him, with all a boy's curiosity, as fast as my small legs
      would carry me. My grandfather hurried out to order his barge to be got
      ready at once, so that I knew something important was at hand. At first he
      refused me permission to go, but afterwards relented, and about eleven in
      the morning we pulled away strongly, the ten blacks bending to the oars as
      if their lives were at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wind arose before we sighted Greensbury Point, and I saw a bark sailing
      in, but thought nothing of this until Mr. Carvel, who had been silent and
      preoccupied, called for his glass and swept her decks. She soon shortened
      sail, and went so leisurely that presently our light barge drew alongside,
      and I perceived Mr. Zachariah Hood, a merchant of the town, returning from
      London, hanging over her rail. Mr. Hood was very pale in spite of his
      sea-voyage; he flung up his cap at our boat, but Mr. Carvel's salute in
      return was colder than he looked for. As we came in view of the dock, a
      fine rain was setting in, and to my astonishment I beheld such a mass of
      people assembled as I had never seen, and scarce standing-room on the
      wharves. We were to have gone to the Governor's wharf in the Severn, but
      my grandfather changed his intention at once. Many of the crowd greeted
      him as we drew near them, and, having landed, respectfully made room for
      him to pass through. I followed him a-tremble with excitement and delight
      over such an unwonted experience. We had barely gone ten paces, however,
      before Mr. Carvel stopped abreast of Mr. Claude, mine host of the Coffee
      House, who cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hast seen his Majesty's newest representative, Mr. Carvel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hood is on board the bark, sir,&rdquo; replied my grandfather. &ldquo;I take it
      you mean Mr. Hood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that I do; Mr. Zachariah Hood, come to lick stamps for his
      brother-colonists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After licking his Majesty's boots,&rdquo; says a wag near by, which brings a
      laugh from those about us. I remembered that I had heard some talk as to
      how Mr. Hood had sought and obtained from King George the office of Stamp
      Distributor for the province. Now, my grandfather, God rest him! was as
      doughty an old gentleman as might well be, and would not listen without
      protest to remarks which bordered sedition. He had little fear of things
      below, and none of a mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My masters,&rdquo; he shouted, with a flourish of his stick, so stoutly that
      people fell back from him, &ldquo;know that ye are met against the law, and
      endanger the peace of his Lordship's government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good enough, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; said Claude, who seemed to be the spokesman.
      &ldquo;But how if we are stamped against law and his Lordship's government? How
      then, sir? Your honour well knows we have naught against either, and are
      as peaceful a mob as ever assembled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brought on a great laugh, and they shouted from all sides, &ldquo;How then,
      Mr. Carvel?&rdquo; And my grandfather, perceiving that he would lose dignity by
      argument, and having done his duty by a protest, was wisely content with
      that. They opened wider the lane for him to pass through, and he made his
      way, erect and somewhat defiant, to Mr. Pryse's, the coachmaker opposite,
      holding me by the hand. The second storey of Pryse's shop had a little
      balcony standing out in front, and here we established ourselves, that we
      might watch what was going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd below grew strangely silent as the bark came nearer and nearer,
      until Mr. Hood showed himself on the poop, when there rose a storm of
      hisses, mingled with shouts of derision. &ldquo;How goes it at St. James, Mr.
      Hood?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Have you tasted his Majesty's barley?&rdquo; And some asked him if
      he was come as their member of Parliament. Mr. Hood dropped a bow, though
      what he said was drowned. The bark came in prettily enough, men in the
      crowd even catching her lines and making them fast to the piles. A
      gang-plank was thrown over. &ldquo;Come out, Mr. Hood,&rdquo; they cried; &ldquo;we are here
      to do you honour, and to welcome you home again.&rdquo; There were leather
      breeches with staves a-plenty around that plank, and faces that meant no
      trifling. &ldquo;McNeir, the rogue,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Carvel, &ldquo;and that hulk of a
      tanner, Brown. And I would know those smith's shoulders in a thousand.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Right, sir,&rdquo; says Pryse, &ldquo;and 'twill serve them proper. when the King's
      troops come among them for quartering.&rdquo; Pryse being the gentry's patron,
      shaped his politics according to the company he was in: he could ill be
      expected to seize one of his own ash spokes and join the resistance. Just
      then I caught a glimpse of Captain Clapsaddle on the skirts of the crowd,
      and with him Mr. Swain and some of the dissenting gentry. And my boyish
      wrath burst forth against that man smirking and smiling on the decks of
      the bark, so that I shouted shrilly: &ldquo;Mr. Hood will be cudgelled and
      tarred as he deserves,&rdquo; and shook my little fist at him, so that many
      under us laughed and cheered me. Mr. Carvel pushed me back into the window
      and out of their sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crew of the bark had assembled on the quarterdeck, stout English tars
      every man of them, armed with pikes and belaying-pins; and at a word from
      the mate they rushed in a body over the plank. Some were thrust off into
      the water, but so fierce was their onset that others gained the wharf,
      laying sharply about them in all directions, but getting full as many
      knocks as they gave. For a space there was a very bedlam of cries and
      broken heads, those behind in the mob surging forward to reach the
      scrimmage, forcing their own comrades over the edge. McNeir had his thigh
      broken by a pike, and was dragged back after the first rush was over; and
      the mate of the bark was near to drowning, being rescued, indeed, by
      Graham, the tanner. Mr. Hood stood white in the gangway, dodging a missile
      now and then, waiting his chance, which never came. For many of the
      sailors were captured and carried bodily to the &ldquo;Rose and Crown&rdquo; and the
      &ldquo;Three Blue Balls,&rdquo; where they became properly drunk on Jamaica rum;
      others made good their escape on board. And at length the bark cast off
      again, amidst jeers and threats, and one-third of her crew missing, and
      drifted slowly back to the roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the dock, after all was quiet, Mr. Carvel stepped into his barge and
      rowed to the Governor's, whose house was prettily situated near Hanover
      Street, with ground running down to the Severn. His Excellency appeared
      much relieved to see my grandfather; Mr. Daniel Dulany was with him, and
      the three gentlemen at once repaired to the Governor's writing-closet for
      consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carvel's town house being closed, we stopped with his Excellency.
      There were, indeed, scarce any of the gentry in town at that season save a
      few of the Whig persuasion. Excitement ran very high; farmers flocked in
      every day from the country round about to take part in the demonstration
      against the Act. Mr. Hood's storehouse was burned to the ground. Mr. Hood
      getting ashore by stealth, came, however, unmolested to Annapolis and
      offered at a low price the goods he had brought out in the bark, thinking
      thus to propitiate his enemies. This step but inflamed them the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather having much business to look to, I was left to my own
      devices, and the devices of an impetuous lad of twelve are not always such
      as his elders would choose for him. I was continually burning with a
      desire to see what was proceeding in the town, and hearing one day a great
      clamour and tolling of bells, I ran out of the Governor's gate and down
      Northwest Street to the Circle, where a strange sight met my eyes. A crowd
      like that I had seen on the dock had collected there, Mr. Swain and Mr.
      Hammond and other barristers holding them in check. Mounted on a one-horse
      cart was a stuffed figure of the detested Mr. Hood. Mr. Hammond made a
      speech, but for the laughter and cheering I could not catch a word of it.
      I pushed through the people, as a boy will, diving between legs to get a
      better view, when I felt a hand upon my shoulder, bringing me up suddenly.
      And I recognized Mr. Matthias Tilghman, and with him was Mr. Samuel Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your grandfather know you are here, lad?&rdquo; said Mr. Tilghman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I paused a moment for breath before I answered: &ldquo;He attended the rally at
      the dock himself, sir, and I believe enjoyed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both gentlemen smiled, and Mr. Chase remarked that if all the other party
      were like Mr. Carvel, troubles would soon cease. &ldquo;I mean not Grafton,&rdquo;
       says he, with a wink at Mr. Tilghman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll warrant, Richard, your uncle would be but ill pleased to see you in
      such company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sir,&rdquo; I replied, for I never feared to speak up, &ldquo;there are you
      wrong. I think it would please my uncle mightily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lad hath indifferent penetration,&rdquo; said Mr, Tilghman, laughing, and
      adding more soberly: &ldquo;If you never do worse than this, Richard, Maryland
      may some day be proud of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hammond having finished his speech, a paper was placed in the hand of
      the effigy, and the crowd bore it shouting and singing to the hill, where
      Mr. John Shaw, the city carpenter, had made a gibbet. There nine and
      thirty lashes were bestowed on the unfortunate image, the people crying
      out that this was the Mosaic Law. And I cried as loud as any, though I
      knew not the meaning of the words. They hung Mr. Hood to the gibbet and
      set fire to a tar barrel under him, and so left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town wore a holiday look that day, and I was loth to go back to the
      Governor's house. Good patriots' shops were closed, their owners parading
      as on Sunday in their best, pausing in knots at every corner to discuss
      the affair with which the town simmered. I encountered old Farris, the
      clockmaker, in his brown coat besprinkled behind with powder from his
      queue. &ldquo;How now, Master Richard?&rdquo; says he, merrily. &ldquo;This is no place for
      young gentlemen of your persuasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next I came upon young Dr. Courtenay, the wit of the Tuesday Club, of whom
      I shall have more to say hereafter. He was taking the air with Mr. James
      Fotheringay, Will's eldest brother, but lately back from Oxford and the
      Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor wore five-pound ruffles and a ten-pound wig, was dressed in
      cherry silk, and carried a long, clouded cane. His hat had the latest
      cock, for he was our macaroni of Annapolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, Richard,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;you are the only other loyalist I have seen
      abroad to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remember swelling with indignation at the affront. &ldquo;I call them Tories,
      sir,&rdquo; I flashed back, &ldquo;and I am none such.&rdquo; &ldquo;No Tory!&rdquo; says he, nudging
      Mr. Fotheringay, who was with him; &ldquo;I had as lief believe your grandfather
      hated King George.&rdquo; I astonished them both by retorting that Mr. Carvel
      might think as he pleased, that being every man's right; but that I chose
      to be a Whig. &ldquo;I would tell you as a friend, young man,&rdquo; replied the
      doctor, &ldquo;that thy politics are not over politic.&rdquo; And they left me
      puzzling, laughing with much relish over some catch in the doctor's words.
      As for me, I could perceive no humour in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now near six of the clock, but instead of going direct to the
      Governor's I made my way down Church Street toward the water. Near the
      dock I saw many people gathered in the street in front of the &ldquo;Ship&rdquo;
       tavern, a time-honoured resort much patronized by sailors. My curiosity
      led me to halt there also. The &ldquo;Ship&rdquo; had stood in that place nigh on to
      three-score years, it was said. Its latticed windows were swung open, and
      from within came snatches of &ldquo;Tom Bowling,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rule Britannia,&rdquo; and many
      songs scarce fit for a child to hear. Now and anon some one in the street
      would throw back a taunt to these British sentiments, which went unheeded.
      &ldquo;They be drunk as lords,&rdquo; said Weld, the butcher's apprentice, &ldquo;and when
      they comes out we'll hev more than one broken head in this street.&rdquo; The
      songs continuing, he cried again, &ldquo;Come out, d-n ye.&rdquo; Weld had had more
      than his own portion of rum that day. Spying me seated on the gate-post
      opposite, he shouted: &ldquo;So ho, Master Carvel, the streets are not for his
      Majesty's supporters to-day.&rdquo; Other artisans who were there bade him leave
      me in peace, saying that my grandfather was a good friend of the people.
      The matter might have ended there had I been older and wiser, but the
      excitement of the day had gone to my head like wine. &ldquo;I am as stout a
      patriot as you, Weld,&rdquo; I shouted back, and flushed at the cheering that
      followed. And Weld ran up to me, and though I was a good piece of a lad,
      swung me lightly onto his shoulder. &ldquo;Harkee, Master Richard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      can get nothing out of the poltroons by shouting. Do you go in and say
      that Weld will fight any mother's son of them single-handed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, to send a lad into a tavern,&rdquo; said old Bobbins, who had known
      my grandfather these many years. But the desire for a row was so great
      among the rest that they silenced him. Weld set me down, and I, nothing
      loth, ran through the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never before been in the &ldquo;Ship,&rdquo; nor, indeed, in any tavern save
      that of Master Dingley, near Carvel Hall. The &ldquo;Ship&rdquo; was a bare place
      enough, with low black beams and sanded floor, and rough tables and chairs
      set about. On that September evening it was stifling hot; and the odours
      from the men, and the spilled rum and tobacco smoke, well-nigh overpowered
      me. The room was filled with a motley gang of sailors, mostly from the
      bark Mr. Hood had come on, and some from H.M.S. Hawk, then lying in the
      harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strapping man-o'-war's-man sat near the door, his jacket thrown open and
      his great chest bared, and when he perceived me he was in the act of
      proposing a catch; 'twas &ldquo;The Great Bell o' Lincoln,&rdquo; I believe; and he
      held a brimming cup of bumbo in his hand. In his surprise he set it
      awkwardly down again, thereby spilling full half of it. &ldquo;Avast,&rdquo; says he,
      with an oath, &ldquo;what's this come among us?&rdquo; and he looked me over with a
      comical eye. &ldquo;A d-d provincial,&rdquo; he went on scornfully, &ldquo;but a gentleman's
      son, or Jack Ball's a liar.&rdquo; Whereupon his companions rose from their
      seats and crowded round me. More than one reeled against me. And though I
      was somewhat awed by the strangeness of that dark, ill-smelling room, and
      by the rough company in which I found myself, I held my ground, and spoke
      up as strongly as I might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weld, the butcher's apprentice, bids me say he will fight any man among
      you single-handed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So ho, my little gamecock, my little schooner with a swivel,&rdquo; said he who
      had called himself Jack Ball, &ldquo;and where can this valiant butcher be
      found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He waits in the street,&rdquo; I answered more boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Split me fore and aft if he waits long,&rdquo; said Jack, draining the rest of
      his rum. And picking me up as easily as did Weld he rushed out of the
      door, and after him as many of his mates as could walk or stagger thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the news had got abroad in the street that the butcher's
      apprentice was to fight one of the Hawk's men, and when I emerged from the
      tavern the crowd had doubled, and people were running hither in all haste
      from both directions. But that fight was never to be. Big Jack Ball had
      scarce set me down and shouted a loud defiance, shaking his fist at Weld,
      who stood out opposite, when a soldierly man on a great horse turned the
      corner and wheeled between the combatants. I knew at a glance it was
      Captain Clapsaddle, and guiltily wished myself at the Governor's. The
      townspeople knew him likewise, and many were slinking away even before he
      spoke, as his charger stood pawing the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this I hear, you villain,&rdquo; said he to Weld, in his deep, ringing
      voice, &ldquo;that you have not only provoked a row with one of the King's
      sailors, but have dared send a child into that tavern with your fool's
      message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Weld was awkward and sullen enough, and no words came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your tongue, you sot,&rdquo; the captain went on, drawing his sword in his
      anger, &ldquo;is it true you have made use of a gentleman's son for your low
      purposes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Weld was still silent, and not a sound came from either side until old
      Robbins spoke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many here can say I warned him, your honour,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warned him!&rdquo; cried the captain. &ldquo;Mr. Carvel has just given you twenty
      pounds for your wife, and you warned him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robbins said no more; and the butcher's apprentice, hanging his head, as
      well he might before the captain, I was much moved to pity for him, seeing
      that my forwardness had in some sense led him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twas in truth my fault, captain,&rdquo; I cried out. The captain looked at me,
      and said nothing. After that the butcher made bold to take up his man's
      defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Carvel was indeed somewhat to blame, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and Weld is
      in liquor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll have him to pay for his drunkenness,&rdquo; said Captain Clapsaddle,
      hotly. &ldquo;Get to your homes,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Ye are a lot of idle hounds, who
      would make liberty the excuse for riot.&rdquo; He waved his sword at the pack of
      them, and they scattered like sheep until none but Weld was left. &ldquo;And as
      for you, Weld,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you'll rue this pretty business, or Daniel
      Clapsaddle never punished a cut-throat.&rdquo; And turning to Jack Ball, he bade
      him lift me to the saddle, and so I rode with him to the Governor's
      without a word; for I knew better than to talk when he was in that mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was made to tarry and sup with his Excellency and my
      grandfather, and I sat perforce a fourth at the table, scarce daring to
      conjecture as to the outcome of my escapade. But as luck would have it,
      the Governor had been that day in such worry and perplexity, and my
      grandfather also, that my absence had passed unnoticed. Nor did my good
      friend the captain utter a word to them of what he knew. But afterwards he
      called me to him and set me upon his knee. How big, and kind, and strong
      he was, and how I loved his bluff soldier's face and blunt ways. And when
      at last he spoke, his words burnt deep in my memory, so that even now I
      can repeat them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I perceive you are like your father. I love your
      spirit greatly, but you have been overrash to-day. Remember this, lad,
      that you are a gentleman, the son of the bravest and truest gentleman I
      have ever known, save one; and he is destined to high things.&rdquo; I know now
      that he spoke of Colonel Washington. &ldquo;And that your mother,&rdquo; here his
      voice trembled,&mdash;&ldquo;your mother was a lady, every inch of her, and too
      good for this world. Remember, and seek no company, therefore, beyond that
      circle in which you were born. Fear not to be kind and generous, as I know
      you ever will be, but choose not intimates from the tavern.&rdquo; Here the
      captain cleared his throat, and seemed to seek for words. &ldquo;I fear there
      are times coming, my lad,&rdquo; he went on presently, &ldquo;when every man must
      choose his side, and stand arrayed in his own colours. It is not for me to
      shape your way of thinking. Decide in your own mind that which is right,
      and when you have so decided,&rdquo;&mdash;he drew his sword, as was his habit
      when greatly moved, and placed his broad hand upon my head,&mdash;&ldquo;know
      then that God is with you, and swerve not from thy course the width of
      this blade for any man.&rdquo;
     </p>

      We sat upon a little bench in the Governor's garden, in front of us the
      wide Severn merging into the bay, and glowing like molten gold in the
      setting sun. And I was thrilled with a strange reverence such as I have
      sometimes since felt in the presence of heroes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. GRAFTON WOULD HEAL AN OLD BREACH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Doctor Hilliard, my grandfather's chaplain, was as holy a man as ever wore
      a gown, but I can remember none of his discourses which moved me as much
      by half as those simple words Captain Clapsaddle had used. The worthy
      doctor, who had baptized both my mother and father, died suddenly at
      Carvel Hall the spring following, of a cold contracted while visiting a
      poor man who dwelt across the river. He would have lacked but three years
      of fourscore come Whitsuntide. He was universally loved and respected in
      that district where he had lived so long and ably, by rich and poor alike,
      and those of many creeds saw him to his last resting-place. Mr. Carroll,
      of Carrollton, who was an ardent Catholic, stood bareheaded beside the
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Hilliard was indeed a beacon in a time when his profession among us
      was all but darkness, and when many of the scandals of the community might
      be laid at the door of those whose duty it was to prevent them. The fault
      lay without doubt in his Lordship's charter, which gave to the
      parishioners no voice in the choosing of their pastors. This matter was
      left to Lord Baltimore's whim. Hence it was that he sent among us so many
      fox-hunting and gaming parsons who read the service ill and preached
      drowsy and illiterate sermons. Gaming and fox-hunting, did I say? These
      are but charitable words to cover the real characters of those impostors
      in holy orders, whose doings would often bring the blush of shame to your
      cheeks. Nay, I have seen a clergyman drunk in the pulpit, and even in
      those freer days their laxity and immorality were such that many flocked
      to hear the parsons of the Methodists and Lutherans, whose simple and
      eloquent words and simpler lives were worthy of their cloth. Small wonder
      was it, when every strolling adventurer and soldier out of employment took
      orders and found favour in his Lordship's eyes, and were given the fattest
      livings in place of worthier men, that the Established Church fell
      somewhat into disrepute. Far be it from me to say that there were not good
      men and true in that Church, but the wag who writ this verse, which became
      a common saying in Maryland, was not far wrong for the great body of them:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Who is a monster of the first renown?
        A lettered sot, a drunkard in a gown.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      My grandfather did not replace Dr. Hilliard at the Hall, afterwards saying
      the prayers himself. The doctor had been my tutor, and in spite of my
      waywardness and lack of love for the classics had taught me no little
      Latin and Greek, and early instilled into my mind those principles
      necessary for the soul's salvation. I have often thought with regret on
      the pranks I played him. More than once at lesson-time have I gone off
      with Hugo and young Harvey for a rabbit hunt, stealing two dogs from the
      pack, and thus committing a double offence. You may be sure I was well
      thrashed by Mr. Carvel, who thought the more of the latter misdoing,
      though obliged to emphasize the former. The doctor would never raise his
      hand against me. His study, where I recited my daily tasks, was that small
      sunny room on the water side of the east wing; and I well recall him as he
      sat behind his desk of a morning after prayers, his horn spectacles
      perched on his high nose and his quill over his ear, and his ink-powder
      and pewter stand beside him. His face would grow more serious as I scanned
      my Virgil in a faltering voice, and as he descanted on a passage my eye
      would wander out over the green trees and fields to the glistening water.
      What cared I for &ldquo;Arma virumque&rdquo; at such a time? I was watching Nebo
      a-fishing beyond the point, and as he waded ashore the burden on his
      shoulders had a much keener interest for me than that AEneas carried out
      of Troy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Uncle Grafton came to Dr. Hilliard's funeral, choosing this opportunity
      to become reconciled to my grandfather, who he feared had not much longer
      to live. Albeit Mr. Carvel was as stout and hale as ever. None of the
      mourners at the doctor's grave showed more sorrow than did Grafton. A
      thousand remembrances of the good old man returned to him, and I heard him
      telling Mr. Carroll and some other gentlemen, with much emotion, how he
      had loved his reverend preceptor, from whom he had learned nothing but
      what was good. &ldquo;How fortunate are you, Richard,&rdquo; he once said, &ldquo;to have
      had such a spiritual and intellectual teacher in your youth. Would that
      Philip might have learned from such a one. And I trust you can say, my
      lad, that you have made the best of your advantages, though I fear you are
      of a wild nature, as your father was before you.&rdquo; And my uncle sighed and
      crossed his hands behind his back. &ldquo;'Tis perhaps better that poor John is
      in his grave,&rdquo; he said. Grafton had a word and a smile for every one about
      the old place, but little else, being, as he said, but a younger son and a
      poor man. I was near to forgetting the shilling he gave Scipio. 'Twas not
      so unostentatiously done but that Mr. Carvel and I marked it. And
      afterwards I made Scipio give me the coin, replacing it with another, and
      flung it as far into the river as ever I could throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      As was but proper to show his sorrow at the death of the old chaplain he
      had loved so much, Grafton came to the Hall drest entirely in black. He
      would have had his lady and Philip, a lad near my own age, clad likewise
      in sombre colours. But my Aunt Caroline would none of them, holding it to
      be the right of her sex to dress as became its charms. Her silks and laces
      went but ill with the low estate my uncle claimed for his purse, and
      Master Philip's wardrobe was twice the size of mine. And the family
      travelled in a coach as grand as Mr. Carvel's own, with panels wreathed in
      flowers and a footman and outrider in livery, from which my aunt descended
      like a duchess. She embraced my grandfather with much warmth, and kissed
      me effusively on both cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is dear Richard?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Philip, come at once and greet
      your cousin. He has not the look of the Carvels,&rdquo; she continued volubly,
      &ldquo;but more resembles his mother, as I recall her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, madam,&rdquo; my grandfather answered somewhat testily, &ldquo;he has the
      Carvel nose and mouth, though his chin is more pronounced. He has
      Elizabeth's eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But my aunt was a woman who flew from one subject to another, and she had
      already ceased to think of me. She was in the hall. &ldquo;The dear old home?&rdquo;
       she cries, though she had been in it but once before, regarding lovingly
      each object as her eye rested upon it, nay, caressingly when she came to
      the great punch-bowl and the carved mahogany dresser, and the Peter Lely
      over the broad fireplace. &ldquo;What memories they must bring to your mind, my
      dear,&rdquo; she remarks to her husband. &ldquo;'Tis cruel, as I once said to dear
      papa, that we cannot always live under the old rafters we loved so well as
      children.&rdquo; And the good lady brushes away a tear with her embroidered
      pocket-napkin. Tears that will come in spite of us all. But she brightens
      instantly and smiles at the line of servants drawn up to welcome them.
      &ldquo;This is Scipio, my son, who was with your grandfather when your father
      was born, and before.&rdquo; Master Philip nods graciously in response to
      Scipio's delighted bow. &ldquo;And Harvey,&rdquo; my aunt rattles on. &ldquo;Have you any
      new mares to surprise us with this year, Harvey?&rdquo; Harvey not being as
      overcome with Mrs. Grafton's condescension as was proper, she turns again
      to Mr. Carvel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, father, I see you are in sore need of a woman's hand about the old
      house. What a difference a touch makes, to be sure.&rdquo; And she takes off her
      gloves and attacks the morning room, setting an ornament here and another
      there, and drawing back for the effect. &ldquo;Such a bachelor's hall as you are
      keeping!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We still have Willis, Caroline,&rdquo; remonstrates my grandfather, gravely. &ldquo;I
      have no fault to find with her housekeeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, father; men never notice,&rdquo; Aunt Caroline replies in an
      aggrieved tone. And when Willis herself comes in, auguring no good from
      this visit, my aunt gives her the tips of her fingers. And I imagine I see
      a spark fly between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Grafton, he was more than willing to let bygones be bygones between
      his father and himself. Aunt Caroline said with feeling that Dr.
      Hilliard's death was a blessing, after all, since it brought a
      long-separated father and son together once more. Grafton had been
      misjudged and ill-used, and he called Heaven to witness that the quarrel
      had never been of his seeking,&mdash;a statement which Mr. Carvel was at
      no pains to prove perjury. How attentive was Mr. Grafton to his father's
      every want. He read his Gazette to him of a Thursday, though the old
      gentleman's eyes are as good as ever. If Mr. Carvel walks out of an
      evening, Grafton's arm is ever ready, and my uncle and his worthy lady are
      eager to take a hand at cards before supper. &ldquo;Philip, my dear,&rdquo; says my
      aunt, &ldquo;thy grandfather's slippers,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Philip, my love, thy
      grandfather's hat and cane.&rdquo; But it is plain that Master Philip has not
      been brought up to wait on his elders. He is curled with a novel in his
      grandfather's easy chair by the window. &ldquo;There is Dio, mamma, who has
      naught to do but serve grandpapa,&rdquo; says he, and gives a pull at the cord
      over his head which rings the bell about the servants' ears in the hall
      below. And Dio, the whites of his eyes showing, comes running into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing, Diomedes,&rdquo; says Mr. Carvel. &ldquo;Master Philip will fetch what
      I need.&rdquo;. Master Philip's papa and mamma stare at each other in a surprise
      mingled with no little alarm, Master Philip being to all appearances
      intent upon his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; says my grandfather, gently. I had more than once heard him
      speak thus, and well knew what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replies my cousin, without looking up. &ldquo;Follow me, sir,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Carvel, in a voice so different that Philip drops his book. They went up
      the stairs together, and what occurred there I leave to the imagination.
      But when next Philip was bidden to do an errand for Mr. Carvel my
      grandfather said quietly: &ldquo;I prefer that Richard should go, Caroline.&rdquo; And
      though my aunt and uncle, much mortified, begged him to give Philip
      another chance, he would never permit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, a great effort was made to restore Philip to his
      grandfather's good graces. At breakfast one morning, after my aunt had
      poured Mr. Carvel's tea and made her customary compliment to the blue and
      gold breakfast china, my Uncle Grafton spoke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that Dr. Hilliard is gone, father, what do you purpose concerning
      Richard's schooling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall go to King William's school in the autumn,&rdquo; Mr. Carvel replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the autumn!&rdquo; cried my uncle. &ldquo;I do not give Philip even the short
      holiday of this visit. He has his Greek and his Virgil every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can repeat the best passages,&rdquo; my aunt chimes in. &ldquo;Philip, my dear,
      recite that one your father so delights in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However unwilling Master Philip had been to disturb himself for errands,
      he was nothing loth to show his knowledge, and recited glibly enough
      several lines of his Virgil verbatim; thereby pleasing his fond parents
      greatly and my grandfather not a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will add a crown to your savings, Philip,&rdquo; says his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here is a pistole to spend as you will,&rdquo; says Mr. Carvel, tossing him
      the piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, father, I do not encourage the lad to be a spendthrift,&rdquo; says
      Grafton, taking the pistole himself. &ldquo;I will place this token of your
      appreciation in his strong-box. You know we have a prodigal strain in the
      family, sir.&rdquo; And my uncle looks at me significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be as I say, Grafton,&rdquo; persists Mr. Carvel, who liked not to be
      balked in any matter, and was not over-pleased at this reference to my
      father. And he gave Philip forthwith another pistole, telling his father
      to add the first to his saving if he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Richard must have his chance,&rdquo; says my Aunt Caroline, sweetly, as she
      rises to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, here is a crown for you, Richard,&rdquo; says my uncle, smiling. &ldquo;Let us
      hear your Latin, which should be purer than Philip's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather glanced uneasily at me across the table; he saw clearly the
      trick Grafton had played me, I think. But for once I was equal to my
      uncle, and haply remembered a line Dr. Hilliard had expounded, which
      fitted the present case marvellously well. With little ceremony I tossed
      back the crown, and slowly repeated those words used to warn the Trojans
      against accepting the Grecian horse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad,&rdquo; cried Mr. Carvel, slapping his knee, &ldquo;the lad bath beaten you on
      your own ground, Grafton.&rdquo; And he laughed as my grandfather only could
      laugh, until the dishes rattled on the table. But my uncle thought it no
      matter for jesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was also well versed in politics for a lad of his age, and could
      discuss glibly the right of Parliament to tax the colonies. He denounced
      the seditious doings in Annapolis and Boston Town with an air of easy
      familiarity, for Philip had the memory of a parrot, and 'twas easy to
      perceive whence his knowledge sprang. But when my fine master spoke
      disparagingly of the tradesmen as at the bottom of the trouble, my
      grandfather's patience came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what think you lies beneath the wealth and power of England, Philip?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her nobility, sir, and the riches she draws from her colonies,&rdquo; retorts
      Master Philip, readily enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; Mr. Carvel said gravely. &ldquo;She owes her greatness to her
      merchants, or tradesmen, as you choose to call them. And commerce must be
      at the backbone of every great nation. Tradesmen!&rdquo; exclaimed my
      grandfather. &ldquo;Where would any of us be were it not for trade? We sell our
      tobacco and our wheat, and get money in return. And your father makes a
      deal here and a deal there, and so gets rich in spite of his pittance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Uncle Grafton raised his hand to protest, but Mr. Carvel continued: &ldquo;I
      know you, Grafton, I know you. When a lad it was your habit to lay aside
      the money I gave you, and so pretend you had none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And 'twas well I learned then to be careful,&rdquo; said my uncle, losing for
      the instant his control, &ldquo;for you loved the spend-thrift best, and I
      should be but a beggar now without my wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I loved not John's carelessness with money, but other qualities in him
      which you lacked,&rdquo; answered Mr. Carvel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grafton shot a swift glance at me; and so much of malice and of hatred was
      conveyed in that look that with a sense of prophecy I shuddered to think
      that some day I should have to cope with such craft. For he detested me
      threefold, and combined the hate he bore my dead father and mother with
      the ill-will he bore me for standing in his way and Philip's with my
      grandfather's property. But so deftly could he hide his feelings that he
      was smiling again instantly. To see once, however, the white belly of the
      shark flash on the surface of the blue water is sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg of you not to jest of me before the lads, father,&rdquo; said Grafton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows there was little jest in what I said,&rdquo; replied Mr. Carvell
      soberly, &ldquo;and I care not who hears it. Your own son will one day know you
      well enough, if he does not now. Do not imagine, because I am old, that I
      am grown so foolish as to believe that a black sheep can become white save
      by dye. And dye will never deceive such as me. And Philip,&rdquo; the shrewd old
      gentleman went on, turning to my cousin, &ldquo;do not let thy father or any
      other make thee believe there cannot be two sides to every question. I
      recognize in your arguments that which smacks of his tongue, despite what
      he says of your reading the public prints and of forming your own
      opinions. And do not condemn the Whigs, many of whom are worthy men and
      true, because they quarrel with what they deem an unjust method of
      taxation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grafton had given many of the old servants cause to remember him. Harvey
      in particular, who had come from England early in the century with my
      grandfather, spoke with bitterness of him. On the subject of my uncle, the
      old coachman's taciturnity gave way to torrents of reproach. &ldquo;Beware of
      him as has no use for horses, Master Richard,&rdquo; he would say; for this
      trait in Grafton in Harvey's mind lay at the bottom of all others. At my
      uncle's approach he would retire into his shell like an oyster, nor could
      he be got to utter more than a monosyllable in his presence. Harvey's face
      would twitch, and his fingers clench of themselves as he touched his cap.
      And with my Aunt Caroline he was the same. He vouchsafed but a curt reply
      to all her questions, nor did her raptures over the stud soften him in the
      least. She would come tripping into the stable yard, daintily holding up
      her skirts, and crying, &ldquo;Oh, Harvey, I have heard so much of Tanglefoot. I
      must see him before I go.&rdquo; Tanglefoot is led out begrudgingly enough, and
      Aunt Caroline goes over his points, missing the greater part of them, and
      remarking on the depth of chest, which is nothing notable in Tanglefoot.
      Harvey winks slyly at me the while, and never so much as offers a word of
      correction. &ldquo;You must take Philip to ride, Richard, my dear,&rdquo; says my
      aunt. &ldquo;His father was never as fond of it as I could have wished. I hold
      that every gentleman should ride to hounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunts Harvey, when she is gone to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Philip to hunt, indeed! Foxes to hunt foxes!&rdquo; And he gives vent to
      a dry laugh over his joke, in which I cannot but join. &ldquo;Horsemen grows.
      Eh, Master Richard? There was Captain Jack, who jumped from the cradle
      into the saddle, and I never once seen a horse get the better o' him. And
      that's God's truth.&rdquo; And he smooths out Tanglefoot's mane, adding
      reflectively, &ldquo;And you be just like him. But there was scarce a horse in
      the stables what wouldn't lay back his ears at Mr. Grafton, and small
      blame to 'em, say I. He never dared go near 'em. Oh, Master Philip comes
      by it honestly enough. She thinks old Harvey don't know a thoroughbred
      when he sees one, sir. But Mrs. Grafton's no thoroughbred; I tell 'ee
      that, though I'm saying nothing as to her points, mark ye. I've seen her
      sort in the old country, and I've seen 'em here, and it's the same the
      world over, in Injy and Chiny, too. Fine trappings don't make the horse,
      and they don't take thoroughbreds from a grocer's cart. A Philadelphy
      grocer,&rdquo; sniffs this old aristocrat. &ldquo;I'd knowed her father was a grocer
      had I seen her in Pall Mall with a Royal Highness, by her gait, I may say.
      Thy mother was a thoroughbred, Master Richard, and I'll tell 'ee another,&rdquo;
       he goes on with a chuckle, &ldquo;Mistress Dorothy Manners is such another; you
      don't mistake 'em with their high heads and patreeshan ways, though her
      father be one of them accidents as will occur in every stock. She's one to
      tame, sir, and I don't envy no young gentleman the task. But this I
      knows,&rdquo; says Harvey, not heeding my red cheeks, &ldquo;that Master Philip, with
      all his satin small-clothes, will never do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, it was no secret that my Aunt Caroline had been a Miss Flaven, of
      Philadelphia, though she would have had the fashion of our province to
      believe that she belonged to the Governor's set there; and she spoke in
      terms of easy familiarity of the first families of her native city,
      deceiving no one save herself, poor lady. How fondly do we believe, with
      the ostrich, that our body is hidden when our head is tucked under our
      wing! Not a visitor in Philadelphia but knew Terence Flaven, Mrs. Grafton
      Carvel's father, who not many years since sold tea and spices and soap and
      glazed teapots over his own counter, and still advertised his cargoes in
      the public prints. He was a broad and charitable-minded man enough, and
      unassuming, but gave way at last to the pressure brought upon him by his
      wife and daughter, and bought a mansion in Front Street. Terence Flaven
      never could be got to stay there save to sleep, and preferred to spend his
      time in his shop, which was grown greatly, chatting with his customers,
      and bowing the ladies to their chariots. I need hardly say that this
      worthy man was on far better terms than his family with those personages
      whose society they strove so hard to attain.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of Miss Flaven's marriage to my uncle 'twas a piece of gossip
      in every month that he had taken her for her dower, which was not
      inconsiderable; though to hear Mr. and Mrs. Grafton talk they knew not
      whence the next month's provender was to come. They went to live in Kent
      County, as I have said, spending some winters in Philadelphia, where Mr.
      Grafton was thought to have interests, though it never could be discovered
      what his investments were. On hearing of his marriage, which took place
      shortly before my father's, Mr. Carvel expressed neither displeasure nor
      surprise. But he would not hear of my mother's request to settle a portion
      upon his younger son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has the Kent estate, Bess,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which is by far too good for
      him. Never doubt but that the rogue can feather his own nest far better
      than can I, as indeed he hath already done. And by the Lord,&rdquo; cried Mr.
      Carvel, bringing his fist down upon the card-table where they sat, &ldquo;he
      shall never get another farthing of my money while I live, nor afterwards,
      if I can help it! I would rather give it over to Mr. Carroll to found a
      nunnery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so that matter ended, for Mr. Carvel could not be moved from a purpose
      he had once made. Nor would he make any advances whatsoever to Grafton, or
      receive those hints which my uncle was forever dropping, until at length
      he begged to be allowed to come to Dr. Hilliard's funeral, a request my
      grandfather could not in decency refuse. 'Twas a pathetic letter in truth,
      and served its purpose well, though it was not as dust in the old
      gentleman's eyes. He called me into his bedroom and told me that my Uncle
      Grafton was coming at last. And seeing that I said nothing thereto, he
      gave me a queer look and bade me treat them as civilly as I knew how. &ldquo;I
      well know thy temper, Richard,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I fear 'twill bring thee
      trouble enough in life. Try to control it, my lad; take an old man's
      advice and try to control it.&rdquo; He was in one of his gentler moods, and
      passed his arm about me, and together we stood looking silently through
      the square panes out into the rain, at the ducks paddling in the puddles
      until the darkness hid them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And God knows, lad that I was, I tried to be civil to them. But my tongue
      rebelled at the very sight of my uncle ('twas bred into me, I suppose),
      and his fairest words seemed to me to contain a hidden sting. Once, when
      he spoke in his innuendo of my father, I ran from the room to restrain
      some act of violence; I know not what I should have done. And Willis found
      me in the deserted, study of the doctor, where my hot tears had stained
      the flowered paper on the wall. She did her best to calm me, good soul,
      though she had her own troubles with my Lady Caroline to think about at
      the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had one experience with Master Philip before our visitors betook
      themselves back to Kent, which, unfortunate as it was, I cannot but relate
      here. My cousin would enter into none of those rough amusements in which I
      passed my time, for fear, I took it, of spoiling his fine broadcloths or
      of losing a gold buckle. He never could be got to wrestle, though I
      challenged him more than once. And he was a well-built lad, and might,
      with a little practice, have become skilled in that sport. He laughed at
      the homespun I wore about the farm, saying it was no costume for a
      gentleman's son, and begged me sneeringly to don leather breeches. He
      would have none of the company of those lads with whom I found pleasure,
      young Harvey, and Willis's son, who was being trained as Mr. Starkie's
      assistant. Nor indeed did I disdain to join in a game with Hugo, who had
      been given to me, and other negro lads. Philip saw no sport in a wrestle
      or a fight between two of the boys from the quarters, and marvelled that I
      could lower myself to bet with Harvey the younger. He took not a spark of
      interest in the gaming cocks we raised together to compete at the local
      contests and at the fair, and knew not a gaff from a cockspur. Being one
      day at my wits' end to amuse my cousin, I proposed to him a game of quoits
      on the green beside the spring-house, and thither we repaired, followed by
      Hugo, and young Harvey come to look on. Master Philip, not casting as well
      as he might, cries out suddenly to Hugo: &ldquo;Begone, you black dog! What
      business have you here watching a game between gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my servant, cousin,&rdquo; I said quietly, &ldquo;and no dog, if you please.
      And he is under my orders, not yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Philip, having scarcely scored a point, was in a rage. &ldquo;And I'll not
      have him here,&rdquo; he shouted, giving poor Hugo a cuff which sent him
      stumbling over the stake. And turning to me; continued insolently: &ldquo;Ever
      since we came here I have marked your manner toward us, as though my
      father had no right in my grandfather's house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then could I no longer contain myself. I heard young Harvey laugh, and
      remark: &ldquo;'Tis all up with Master Philip now.&rdquo; But Philip, whatever else he
      may have been, was no coward, and had squared off to face me by the time I
      had run the distance between the stakes. He was heavier than I, though not
      so tall; and he parried my first blow and my second, and many more; having
      lively work of it, however, for I hit him as often as I was able. To speak
      truth, I had not looked for such resistance, and seeing that I could not
      knock him down, out of hand, I grew more cool and began to study what I
      was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take off your macaroni coat,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I have no wish to ruin your
      clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he only jeered in return: &ldquo;Take off thy wool-sack.&rdquo; And Hugo, getting
      to his feet, cried out to me not to hurt Marse Philip, that he had meant
      no harm. But this only enraged Philip the more, and he swore a round oath
      at Hugo and another at me, and dealt a vicious blow at my stomach, whereat
      Harvey called out to him to fight fair. He was more skilful at the science
      of boxing than I, though I was the better fighter, having, I am sorry to
      say, fought but too often before. And presently, when I had closed one of
      his eyes, his skill went all to pieces, and he made a mad rush at me. As
      he went by I struck him so hard that he fell heavily and lay motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Harvey ran into the spring-house and filled his hat as I bent over
      my cousin. I unbuttoned his waistcoat and felt his heart, and rejoiced to
      find it beating; we poured cold water over his face and wrists. By then,
      Hugo, who was badly frightened, had told the news in the house, and I saw
      my Aunt Caroline come running over the green as fast as her tight stays
      would permit, crying out that I had killed her boy, her dear Philip. And
      after her came my Uncle Grafton and my grandfather, with all the servants
      who had been in hearing. I was near to crying myself at the thought that I
      should grieve my grandfather. And my aunt, as she knelt over Philip,
      pushed me away, and bade me not touch him. But my cousin opened one of his
      eyes, and raised his hand to his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven he is not killed!&rdquo; exclaims Aunt Caroline, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, indeed!&rdquo; echoes my uncle, and gives me a look as much as to
      say that I am not to be thanked for it. &ldquo;I have often warned you, sir,&rdquo; he
      says to Mr. Carvel, &ldquo;that we do not inherit from stocks and stones. And so
      much has come of our charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew, lad that I was; that he spoke of my mother; and my blood boiled
      within me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care, sir, with your veiled insults,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;or I will serve
      you as I have served your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grafton threw up his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have we harboured, father?&rdquo; says he. But Mr. Carvel seized him by
      the shoulder. &ldquo;Peace, Grafton, before the servants,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and cease
      thy crying, Caroline. The lad is not hurt.&rdquo; And being a tall man, six feet
      in his stockings, and strong despite his age, he raised Philip from the
      grass, and sternly bade him walk to the house, which he did, leaning on
      his mother's arm. &ldquo;As for you, Richard,&rdquo; my grandfather went on, &ldquo;you will
      go into my study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Into his study I went, where presently he came also, and I told him the
      affair in as few words as I might. And he, knowing my hatred of falsehood,
      questioned me not at all, but paced to and fro, I following him with my
      eyes, and truly sorry that I had given him pain. And finally he dismissed
      me, bidding me make it up with my cousin, which I was nothing loth to do.
      What he said to Philip and his father I know not. That evening we shook
      hands, though Philip's face was much swollen, and my uncle smiled, and was
      even pleasanter than before, saying that boys would be boys. But I think
      my Aunt Caroline could never wholly hide the malice she bore me for what I
      had done that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last the visitors were gone, every face on the plantation wore a
      brighter look. Harvey said: &ldquo;God bless their backs, which is the only part
      I ever care to see of their honours.&rdquo; And Willis gave us a supper fit for
      a king. Mr. Lloyd and his lady were with us, and Mr. Carvel told his old
      stories of the time of the First George, many of which I can even now
      repeat: how he and two other collegians fought half a dozen Mohocks in
      Norfolk Street, and fairly beat them; and how he discovered by chance a
      Jacobite refugee in Greenwich, and what came of it; nor did he forget that
      oft-told episode with Dean Swift. And these he rehearsed in such merry
      spirit and new guise that we scarce recognized them, and Colonel Lloyd so
      choked with laughter that more than once he had to be hit between the
      shoulders.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. &ldquo;IF LADIES BE BUT YOUNG AND FAIR&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      No boyhood could have been happier than mine, and throughout it, ever
      present with me, were a shadow and a light. The shadow was my Uncle
      Grafton. I know not what strange intuition of the child made me think of
      him so constantly after that visit he paid us, but often I would wake from
      my sleep with his name upon my lips, and a dread at my heart. The light&mdash;need
      I say?&mdash;was Miss Dorothy Manners. Little Miss Dolly was often at the
      Hall after that happy week we spent together; and her home, Wilmot House,
      was scarce three miles across wood and field by our plantation roads. I
      was a stout little fellow enough, and before I was twelve I had learned to
      follow to hounds my grandfather's guests on my pony; and Mr. Lloyd and Mr.
      Carvel when they shot on the duck points. Ay, and what may surprise you,
      my dears, I was given a weak little toddy off the noggin at night, while
      the gentlemen stretched their limbs before the fire, or played at whist or
      loo Mr. Carvel would have no milksop, so he said. But he early impressed
      upon me that moderation was the mark of a true man, even as excess was
      that of a weak one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was no wonder that I frequently found my way to Wilmot House
      alone. There I often stayed the whole day long, romping with Dolly at
      games of our own invention, and many the time I was sent home after dark
      by Mrs. Manners with Jim, the groom. About once in the week Mr. and Mrs.
      Manners would bring Dorothy over for dinner or tea at the Hall. She grew
      quickly&mdash;so quickly that I scarce realized&mdash;into a tall slip of
      a girl, who could be wilful and cruel, laughing or forgiving, shy or
      impudent, in a breath. She had as many moods as the sea. I have heard her
      entertain Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Bordley and the ladies, and my grandfather, by
      the hour, while I sat by silent and miserable, but proud of her all the
      same. Boylike, I had grown to think of her as my possession, tho' she gave
      me no reason whatever. I believe I had held my hand over fire for her, at
      a word. And, indeed, I did many of her biddings to make me wonder, now,
      that I was not killed. It used to please her, Ivie too, to see me go the
      round of the windmill, tho' she would cry out after I left the ground. And
      once, when it was turning faster than common and Ivie not there to
      prevent, I near lost my hold at the top, and was thrown at the bottom with
      such force that I lay stunned for a full minute. I opened my eyes to find
      her bending over me with such a look of fright and remorse upon her face
      as I shall never forget. Again, walking out on the bowsprit of the
      'Oriole' while she stood watching me from the dock, I lost my balance and
      fell into the water. On another occasion I fought Will Fotheringay, whose
      parents had come for a visit, because he dared say he would marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is to marry an earl,&rdquo; I cried, tho' I had thrashed another lad for
      saying so. &ldquo;Mr. Manners is to take her home when she is grown, to marry
      her to an earl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least she will not marry you, Master Richard,&rdquo; sneered Will. And then
      I hit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, even at that early day the girl's beauty was enough to make her
      talked about. And that foolish little fop, her father, had more than once
      declared before a company in our dining room that it was high time another
      title came into his family, and that he meant to take Dolly abroad when
      she was sixteen. Lad that I was, I would mark with pain the blush on Mrs.
      Manners's cheek, and clinch my fists as she tried to pass this off as a
      joke of her husband's. But Dolly, who sat next me at a side table, would
      make a wry little face at my angry one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall call me 'my lady,' Richard. And sometimes, if you are good, you
      shall ride inside my coroneted coach when you come home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, that was the worst of it! The vixen was conscious of her beauty. But
      her airs were so natural that young and old bowed before her. Nothing but
      worship had she had from the cradle. I would that Mr. Peale had painted
      her in her girlhood as a type of our Maryland lady of quality. Harvey was
      right when he called her a thoroughbred. Her nose was of patrician
      straightness, and the curves of her mouth came from generations of proud
      ancestors. And she had blue eyes to conquer and subdue; with long lashes
      to hide them under when she chose, and black hair with blue gloss upon it
      in the slanting lights. I believe I loved her best in the riding-habit
      that was the colour of the red holly in our Maryland woods. At
      Christmas-tide, when we came to the eastern shore, we would gallop
      together through miles of country, the farmers and servants tipping and
      staring after her as she laid her silver-handled whip upon her pony. She
      knew not the meaning of fear, and would take a fence or a ditch that a man
      might pause at. And so I fell into the habit of leading her the easy way
      round, for dread that she would be hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      How those Christmas times of childhood come sweeping back on my memory!
      Often, and without warning, my grandfather would say to me: &ldquo;Richard, we
      shall celebrate at the Hall this year.&rdquo; And it rarely turned out that
      arrangements had not been made with the Lloyds and the Bordleys and the
      Manners, and other neighbours, to go to the country for the holidays. I
      have no occasion in these pages to mention my intimacy with the sons and
      daughters of those good friends of the Carvels', Colonel Lloyd and Mr.
      Bordley. Some of them are dead now, and the rest can thank God and look
      back upon worthy and useful lives. And if any of these, my old playmates,
      could read this manuscript, perchance they might feel a tingle of
      recollection of Children's Day, when Maryland was a province. We rarely
      had snow; sometimes a crust upon the ground that was melted into paste by
      the noonday sun, but more frequently, so it seems to me, a foggy, drizzly
      Christmas, with the fires crackling in saloon and lady's chamber. And when
      my grandfather and the ladies and gentlemen, his guests, came down the
      curving stairs, there were the broadly smiling servants drawn up in the
      wide hall,&mdash;all who could gather there,&mdash;and the rest on the
      lawn outside, to wish &ldquo;Merry Chris'mas&rdquo; to &ldquo;de quality.&rdquo; The redemptioners
      in front, headed by Ivie and Jonas Tree, tho' they had long served their
      terms, and with them old Harvey and his son; next the house blacks and the
      outside liveries, and then the oldest slaves from the quarters. This line
      reached the door, which Scipio would throw open at &ldquo;de quality's&rdquo;
       appearance, disclosing the rest of the field servants, in bright-coloured
      gowns, and the little negroes on the green. Then Mr. Carvel would make
      them a little speech of thanks and of good-will, and white-haired Johnson
      of the senior quarters, who had been with my great-grandfather, would
      start the carol in a quaver. How clear and sweet the melody of those negro
      voices comes back to me through the generations! And the picture of the
      hall, loaded with holly and mistletoe even to the great arch that spanned
      it, with the generous bowls of egg-nog and punch on the mahogany by the
      wall! And the ladies our guests, in cap and apron, joining in the swelling
      hymn; ay, and the men, too. And then, after the breakfast of sweet ham and
      venison, and hot bread and sausage, made under Mrs. Willis, and tea and
      coffee and chocolate steaming in the silver, and ale for the gentlemen if
      they preferred, came the prayers and more carols in the big drawing-room.
      And then music in the big house, or perhaps a ride afield to greet the
      neighbours, and fiddling and dancing in the two big quarters, Hank's and
      Johnson's, when the tables were cleared after the bountiful feast Mr.
      Carvel was wont to give them. There was no stint, my dears,&mdash;naught
      but good cheer and praising God in sheer happiness at Carvel Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night there was always a ball, sometimes at Wilmot House, sometimes at
      Colonel Lloyd's or Mr. Bordley's, and sometimes at Carvel Hall, for my
      grandfather dearly loved the company of the young. He himself would lead
      off the minuet,&mdash;save when once or twice his Excellency Governor
      Sharpe chanced to be present,&mdash;and would draw his sword with the
      young gallants that the ladies might pass under. And I have seen him join
      merrily in the country dances too, to the clapping of hands of the
      company. That was before Dolly and I were let upon the floor. We sat with
      the other children, our mammies at our sides, in the narrow gallery with
      the tiny rail that ran around the ball-room, where the sweet odour of the
      green myrtleberry candles mixed with that of the powder and perfume of the
      dancers. And when the beauty of the evening was led out, Dolly would lean
      over the rail, and pout and smile by turns. The mischievous little baggage
      could hardly wait for the conquering years to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came soon enough, alack! The season Dorothy was fourteen, we had a
      ball at the Hall the last day of the year. When she was that age she had
      near arrived at her growth, and was full as tall as many young ladies of
      twenty. I had cantered with her that morning from Wilmot House to Mr.
      Lloyd's, and thence to Carvel Hall, where she was to stay to dinner. The
      sun was shining warmly, and after young Harvey had taken our horses we
      strayed through the house, where the servants were busy decorating, and
      out into my grandfather's old English flower garden, and took the seat by
      the sundial. I remember that it gave no shadow. We sat silent for a while,
      Dorothy toying with old Knipe, lying at our feet, and humming gayly the
      burden of a minuet. She had been flighty on the ride, with scarce a word
      to say to me, for the prospect of the dance had gone to her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a new suit to wear to-night, to see the New Year in, Master
      Sober?&rdquo; she asked presently, looking up. &ldquo;I am to wear a brocade that came
      out this autumn from London, and papa says I look like a duchess when I
      have my grandmother's pearls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always the ball!&rdquo; cried I, slapping my boots in a temper. &ldquo;Is it, then,
      such a matter of importance? I am sure you have danced before&mdash;at my
      birthdays in Marlboro' Street and at your own, and Will Fotheringay's, and
      I know not how many others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replies Dolly, sweetly; &ldquo;but never with a real man. Boys like
      you and Will and the Lloyds do not count. Dr. Courtenay is at Wilmot
      House, and is coming to-night; and he has asked me out. Think of it,
      Richard! Dr. Courtenay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A plague upon him! He is a fop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fop!&rdquo; exclaimed Dolly, her humour bettering as mine went down. &ldquo;Oh, no;
      you are jealous. He is more sought after than any gentleman at the
      assemblies, and Miss Dulany vows his steps are ravishing. There's for you,
      my lad! He may not be able to keep pace with you in the chase, but he has
      writ the most delicate verses ever printed in Maryland, and no other man
      in the colony can turn a compliment with his grace. Shall I tell you more?
      He sat with me for over an hour last night, until mamma sent me off to
      bed, and was very angry at you because I had engaged to ride with you
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose you wish you had stayed with him,&rdquo; I flung back, hotly. &ldquo;He
      had spun you a score of fine speeches and a hundred empty compliments by
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had been better company than you, sir,&rdquo; she laughed provokingly. &ldquo;I
      never heard you turn a compliment in your life, and you are now seventeen.
      What headway do you expect to make at the assemblies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; I answered, rather sadly than otherwise. For she had touched me
      upon a sore spot. &ldquo;But if I cannot win a woman save by compliments,&rdquo; I
      added, flaring up, &ldquo;then may I pay a bachelor's tax!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My lady drew her whip across my knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must tell us we are beautiful, Richard,&rdquo; said she, in another tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have but to look in a pier-glass,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;And, besides, that is
      not sufficient. You will want some rhyming couplet out of a mythology
      before you are content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;but you have wit, if you can but be got angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned over the dial's face, and began to draw the Latin numerals with
      her finger. So arch, withal, that I forgot my ill-humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would but agree to stay angry for a day,&rdquo; she went on, in a low
      tone, &ldquo;perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you would be better company,&rdquo; said Dorothy. &ldquo;You would surely be
      more entertaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy, I love you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. I know that,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I think you have said that
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I admitted it sadly. &ldquo;But I should be a better husband than Dr.
      Courtenay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La!&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;I am not thinking of husbands. I shall have a good time,
      sir, I promise you, before I marry. And then I should never marry you. You
      are much too rough, and too masterful. And you would require obedience. I
      shall never obey any man. You would be too strict a master, sir. I can see
      it with your dogs and your servants. And your friends, too. For you thrash
      any boy who does not agree with you. I want no rough squire for a husband.
      And then, you are a Whig. I could never marry a Whig. You behaved
      disgracefully at King William's School last year. Don't deny it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deny it!&rdquo; I cried warmly; &ldquo;I would as soon deny that you are an arrant
      flirt, Dorothy Manners, and will be a worse one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall have my fling,&rdquo; said the minx. &ldquo;I shall begin to-night, with
      you for an audience. I shall make the doctor look to himself. But there is
      the dressing-bell.&rdquo; And as we went into the house, &ldquo;I believe my mother is
      a Whig, Richard. All the Brices are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you are a Tory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a loyalist,&rdquo; says my lady, tossing her head proudly; &ldquo;and we are one
      day to kiss her Majesty's hand, and tell her so. And if I were the Queen,&rdquo;
       she finished in a flash, &ldquo;I would teach you surly gentlemen not to
      meddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she swept up the stairs so stately, that Scipio was moved to say
      slyly: &ldquo;Dem's de kind of ladies, Marse Richard, I jes dotes t' wait on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of the affair at King William's School I shall tell later.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had some dozen guests staying at the Hall for the ball. At dinner my
      grandfather and the gentlemen twitted her, and laughed heartily at her apt
      retorts, and even toasted her when she was gone. The ladies shook their
      heads and nudged one another, and no doubt each of the mothers had her
      notion of what she would do in Mrs. Manners's place. But when my lady came
      down dressed for the ball in her pink brocade with the pearls around her
      neck, fresh from the hands of Nester and those of her own tremulous mammy,
      Mr. Carvel must needs go up to her and hold her at arm's length in
      admiration, and then kiss her on both her cheeks. Whereat she blushed
      right prettily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and can this be Richard's little playmate grown?
      Upon my word, Miss Dolly, you'll be the belle of the ball. Eh, Lloyd?
      Bless me, bless me, you must not mind a kiss from an old man. The young
      ones may have their turn after a while.&rdquo; He laughed as my grandfather only
      could laugh, and turned to me, who had reddened to my forehead. &ldquo;And so,
      Richard, she has outstripped you, fair and square. You are only an awkward
      lad, and she&mdash;why, i' faith, in two years she'll be beyond my
      protection. Come, Miss Dolly,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;I'll show you the mistletoe, that
      you may beware of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he led her off on his arm. &ldquo;The old year and the new, gentlemen!&rdquo; he
      cried merrily, as he passed the door, with Dolly's mammy and Nester
      simpering with pride on the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company arrived in coach and saddle, many having come so far that they
      were to stay the night. Young Mr. Beall carried his bride on a pillion
      behind him, her red riding-cloak flung over her ball dress. Mr. Bordley
      and family came in his barge, Mr. Marmaduke and his wife in coach and
      four. With them was Dr. Courtenay, arrayed in peach-coloured coat and
      waistcoat, with black satin breeches and white silk stockings, and
      pinchbeck buckles a-sparkle on his shoes. How I envied him as he descended
      the stairs, stroking his ruffles and greeting the company with the
      indifferent ease that was then the fashion. I fancied I saw his eyes
      wander among the ladies, and not marking her he crossed over to where I
      stood disconsolate before the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Richard, my lad,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you are quite grown since I saw you. And
      the little girl that was your playmate,&mdash;Miss Dolly, I mean,&mdash;has
      outstripped me, egad. She has become suddenly une belle demoiselle, like a
      rose that blooms in a night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered nothing at all. But I had given much to know whether my stolid
      manner disconcerted him. Unconsciously I sought the bluff face above the
      chimney, depicted in all its ruggedness by the painter of King Charles's
      day, and contrasted with the bundle of finery at my side. Dr. Courtenay
      certainly caught the look. He opened his snuff-box, took a pinch, turned
      on his heel, and sauntered off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say, Richard?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lloyd, coming up to me, laughing,
      for he had seen the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I looked merely at the man of Marston Moor, sir, and said nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, 'twas a better answer than if you had used your tongue, I think,&rdquo;
       answered my friend. But he teased me a deal that night when Dolly danced
      with the doctor, and my grandfather bade me look to my honours. My young
      lady flung her head higher than ever, and made a minuet as well as any
      dame upon the floor, while I stood very glum at the thought of the prize
      slipping from my grasp. Now and then, in the midst of a figure, she would
      shoot me an arch glance, as much as to say that her pinions were strong
      now. But when it came to the country dances my lady comes up to me ever so
      prettily and asks the favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis a monstrous state, indeed, when I have to beg you for a reel!&rdquo; says
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so was I made happy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. I FIRST SUFFER FOR THE CAUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the eighteenth century the march of public events was much more eagerly
      followed than now by men and women of all stations, and even children.
      Each citizen was ready, nay, forward, in taking an active part in all
      political movements, and the children mimicked their elders. Old William
      Farris read his news of a morning before he began the mending of his
      watches, and by evening had so well digested them that he was primed for
      discussion with Pryse, of the opposite persuasion, at the Rose and Crown.
      Sol Mogg, the sexton of St. Anne's, had his beloved Gazette in his pocket
      as he tolled the church bell of a Thursday, and would hold forth on the
      rights and liberties of man with the carpenter who mended the steeple.
      Mrs. Willard could talk of Grenville and Townshend as knowingly as her
      husband, the rich factor, and Francie Willard made many a speech to us
      younger Sons of Liberty on the steps of King William's School. We younger
      sons, indeed, declared bitter war against the mother-country long before
      our conservative old province ever dreamed of secession. For Maryland was
      well pleased with his Lordship's government.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fear that I got at King William's School learning of a far different
      sort than pleased my grandfather. In those days the school stood upon the
      Stadt House hill near School Street, not having moved to its present
      larger quarters. Mr. Isaac Daaken was then Master, and had under him some
      eighty scholars. After all these years, Mr. Daaken stands before me a
      prominent figure of the past in an ill-fitting suit of snuff colour. How
      well I recall that schoolroom of a bright morning, the sun's rays shot
      hither and thither, and split violet, green, and red by the bulging glass
      panes of the windows. And by a strange irony it so chanced that where the
      dominie sat&mdash;and he moved not the whole morning long save to reach
      for his birches&mdash;the crimson ray would often rest on the end of his
      long nose, and the word &ldquo;rum&rdquo; be passed tittering along the benches. For
      some men are born to the mill, and others to the mitre, and still others
      to the sceptre; but Mr. Daaken was born to the birch. His long, lanky legs
      were made for striding after culprits, and his arms for caning them. He
      taught, among other things, the classics, of course, the English language
      grammatically, arithmetic in all its branches, book-keeping in the Italian
      manner, and the elements of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry with their
      applications to surveying and navigation. He also wrote various sorts of
      hands, fearful and marvellous to the uninitiated, with which he was wont
      to decorate my monthly reports to my grandfather. I can shut my eyes and
      see now that wonderful hyperbola in the C in Carvel, which, after
      travelling around the paper, ended in intricate curves and a flourish
      which surely must have broken the quill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last day of every month would I fetch that scrolled note to Mr.
      Carvel, and he laid it beside his plate until dinner was over. And then,
      as sure as the sun rose that morning, my flogging would come before it
      set. This done with, and another promised next month provided Mr. Daaken
      wrote no better of me, my grandfather and I renewed our customary footing
      of love and companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Daaken, unwittingly or designedly, taught other things than those
      I have mentioned above. And though I never once heard a word of politics
      fall from his lips, his school shortly became known to all good Tories as
      a nursery of conspiracy and sedition. There are other ways of teaching
      besides preaching, and of that which the dominie taught best he spoke not
      a word. He was credited, you may well believe, with calumnies against King
      George, and once my Uncle Grafton and Mr. Dulany were for clapping him in
      jail, avowing that he taught treason to the young. I can account for the
      tone of King William's School in no other way than to say that patriotism
      was in the very atmosphere, and seemed to exude in some mysterious way
      from Mr. Daaken's person. And most of us became infected with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dominie lived outside the town, in a lonely little hamlet on the
      borders of the Spa. At two of the clock every afternoon he would dive
      through School Street to the Coffee House, where the hostler would have
      his bony mare saddled and waiting. Mr. Daaken by no chance ever entered
      the tavern. I recall one bright day in April when I played truant and had
      the temerity to go afishing on Spa Creek with Will Fotheringay, the bass
      being plentiful there. We had royal sport of it that morning, and two
      o'clock came and went with never a thought, you may be sure. And presently
      I get a pull which bends my English rod near to double, and in my
      excitement plunge waist deep into the water, Will crying out directions
      from the shore, when suddenly the head of Mr. Daaken's mare is thrust
      through the bushes, followed by Mr. Daaken himself. Will stood stock still
      from fright, and I was for dropping my rod and cutting, when I was
      arrested by the dominie calling out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care, Master Carvel; have a care, sir. You will lose him. Play
      him, sir; let him run a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And down he leaps from his horse and into the water after me, and together
      we landed a three-pound bass, thereby drenching his snuff-coloured suit.
      When the big fish lay shining in the basket, the dominie smiled grimly at
      William and me as we stood sheepishly by, and without a word he drew his
      clasp knife and cut a stout switch from the willow near, and then and
      there he gave us such a thrashing as we remembered for many a day after.
      And we both had another when we reached home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; said Mr. Dulany to my grandfather, &ldquo;I would strongly counsel
      you to take Richard from that school. Pernicious doctrines, sir, are in
      the air, and like diseases are early caught by the young. 'Twas but
      yesterday I saw Richard at the head of a rabble of the sons of riff-raff,
      in Green Street, and their treatment of Mr. Fairbrother hath set the whole
      town by the ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Mr. Dulany had said was true. The lads of Mr. Fairbrother's school
      being mostly of the unpopular party, we of King William's had organized
      our cohorts and led them on to a signal victory. We fell upon the enemy
      even as they were emerging from their stronghold, the schoolhouse, and
      smote them hip and thigh, with the sheriff of Anne Arundel County a
      laughing spectator. Some of the Tories (for such we were pleased to call
      them) took refuge behind Mr. Fairbrother's skirts, who shook his cane
      angrily enough, but without avail. Others of the Tory brood fought
      stoutly, calling out: &ldquo;God save the King!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Down with the traitors!&rdquo;
       On our side Francie Willard fell, and Archie Dennison raised a lump on my
      head the size of a goose egg. But we fairly beat them, and afterwards must
      needs attack the Tory dominie himself. He cried out lustily to the sheriff
      and spectators, of whom there were many by this time, for help, but got
      little but laughter for his effort. Young Lloyd and I, being large lads
      for our age, fairly pinioned the screeching master, who cried out that he
      was being murdered, and keeping his cane for a trophy, thrust him bodily
      into his house of learning, turned the great key upon him, and so left
      him. He made his escape by a window and sought my grandfather in the Duke
      of Marlboro' Street as fast as ever his indignant legs would carry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of his interview with Mr. Carvel I know nothing save that Scipio was
      requested presently to show him the door, and conclude therefrom that his
      language was but ill-chosen. Scipio's patrician blood was wont to rise in
      the presence of those whom he deemed outside the pale of good society, and
      I fear he ushered Mr. Fairbrother to the street with little of that
      superior manner he used to the first families. As for Mr. Daaken, I feel
      sure he was not ill-pleased at the discomfiture of his rival, though it
      cost him five of his scholars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our schoolboy battle, though lightly undertaken, was fraught with no
      inconsiderable consequences for me. I was duly chided and soundly whipped
      by my grandfather for the part I had played; but he was inclined to pass
      the matter after that, and set it down to the desire for fighting common
      to most boyish natures. And he would have gone no farther than this had it
      not been that Mr. Green, of the Maryland Gazette, could not refrain from
      printing the story in his paper. That gentleman, being a stout Whig, took
      great delight in pointing out that a grandson of Mr. Carvel was a
      ringleader in the affair. The story was indeed laughable enough, and many
      a barrister's wig nodded over it at the Coffee House that day. When I came
      home from school I found Scipio beside my grandfather's empty seat in the
      dining-room, and I learned that Mr. Carvel was in the garden with my Uncle
      Grafton and the Reverend Bennett Allen, rector of St. Anne's. I well knew
      that something out of the common was in the wind to disturb my
      grandfather's dinner. Into the garden I went, and under the black walnut
      tree I beheld Mr. Carvel pacing up and down in great unrest, his Gazette
      in his hand, while on the bench sat my uncle and the rector of St. Anne's.
      So occupied was each in his own thought that my coming was unperceived;
      and I paused in my steps, seized suddenly by an instinctive dread, I know
      not of what. The fear of Mr. Carvel's displeasure passed from my mind so
      that I cared not how soundly he thrashed me, and my heart filled with a
      yearning, born of the instant, for that simple and brave old gentleman.
      For the lad is nearer to nature than the man, and the animal oft scents a
      danger the master cannot see. I read plainly in Mr. Allen's handsome face,
      flushed red with wine as it ever was, and in my Uncle Grafton's looks a
      snare to which I knew my grandfather was blind. I never rightly understood
      how it was that Mr. Carvel was deceived in Mr. Allen; perchance the secret
      lay in his bold manner and in the appearance of dignity and piety he wore
      as a cloak when on his guard. I caught my breath sharply and took my way
      toward them, resolved to make as brave a front as I might. It was my
      uncle, whose ear was ever open, that first heard my footstep and turned
      upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is Richard, now, father,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave him so square a look that he bent his head to the ground. My
      grandfather stopped in his pacing and his eye rested upon me, in sorrow
      rather than in anger, I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; he began, and paused. For the first time in my life I saw him
      irresolute. He looked appealingly at the rector, who rose. Mr. Allen was a
      man of good height and broad shoulders, with piercing black eyes,
      reminding one more of the smallsword than aught else I can think of. And
      he spoke solemnly, in a deep voice, as though from the pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear it is my duty, Richard, to say what Mr. Carvel cannot. It grieves
      me to tell you, sir, that young as you are you have been guilty of treason
      against the King, and of grave offence against his Lordship's government.
      I cannot mitigate my words, sir. By your rashness, Richard, and I pray it
      is such, you have brought grief to your grandfather in his age, and
      ridicule and reproach upon a family whose loyalty has hitherto been
      unstained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I scarce waited for him to finish. His pompous words stung me like the
      lash of a whip, and I gave no heed to his cloth as I answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have grieved my grandfather, sir, I am heartily sorry, and will
      answer to him for what I have done. And I would have you know, Mr. Allen,
      that I am as able as any to care for the Carvel honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I spoke with a vehemence, for the thought carried me beyond myself, that
      this upstart parson his Lordship had but a year since sent among us should
      question our family reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember that Mr. Allen is of the Church, Richard,&rdquo; said my grandfather,
      severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear he has little respect for Church or State, sir,&rdquo; Grafton put in.
      &ldquo;You are now reaping the fruits of your indulgence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned to my grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are my protector, sir,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;And if it please you to tell me
      what I now stand accused of, I submit most dutifully to your
      chastisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fair words, indeed, nephew Richard,&rdquo; said my uncle, &ldquo;and I draw from
      them that you have yet to hear of your beating an honest schoolmaster
      without other provocation than that he was a loyal servant to the King,
      and wantonly injuring the children of his school.&rdquo; He drew from his pocket
      a copy of that Gazette Mr. Carvel held in his hand, and added ironically:
      &ldquo;Here, then, are news which will doubtless surprise you, sir. And knowing
      you for a peaceful lad, never having entertained such heresies as those
      with which it pleases Mr. Green to credit you, I dare swear he has drawn
      on his imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took the paper in amaze, not knowing why my grandfather, who had ever
      been so jealous of others taking me to task, should permit the rector and
      my uncle to chide me in his presence. The account was in the main true
      enough, and made sad sport of Mr. Fairbrother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not been caned for this, sir?&rdquo; said I to my grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words seemed to touch Mr. Carvel, and I saw a tear glisten in his
      eye as he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have, Richard, and stoutly. But your uncle and Mr. Allen seem to
      think that your offence warrants more than a caning, and to deem that you
      have been actuated by bad principles rather than by boyish spirits.&rdquo; He
      paused to steady his voice, and I realized then for the first time how
      sacred he held allegiance to the King. &ldquo;Tell me, my lad,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tell
      me, as you love God and the truth, whether they are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the moment I shrank from speaking, perceiving what a sad blow to Mr.
      Carvel my words must be. And then I spoke up boldly, catching the exulting
      sneer on my Uncle Grafton's face and the note of triumph reflected in Mr.
      Allen's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never deceived you, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and will not now hide from you
      that I believe the colonies to have a just cause against his Majesty and
      Parliament.&rdquo; The words came ready to my lips: &ldquo;We are none the less
      Englishmen because we claim the rights of Englishmen, and, saving your
      presence, sir, are as loyal as those who do not. And if these principles
      be bad,&rdquo; I added to my uncle, &ldquo;then should we think with shame upon the
      Magna Charta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather stood astonished at such a speech from me, whom he had
      thought a lad yet without a formed knowledge of public affairs. But I was,
      in fact, supersaturated with that of which I spoke, and could have given
      my hearers many able Whig arguments to surprise them had the season
      befitted. There was silence for a space after I had finished, and then Mr.
      Carvel sank right heavily upon the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Carvel against the King!&rdquo; was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I been alone with him I should have cast myself at his feet, for it
      hurt me sorely to see him so. As it was, I held my head high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Carvels ever did what they believed right, sir,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;You
      would not have me to go against my conscience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this he replied nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evil has been done, as I feared, father,&rdquo; said Grafton, presently;
      &ldquo;we must now seek for the remedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me question the lad,&rdquo; Mr. Allen softly interposed. &ldquo;Tell me, Richard,
      who has influenced you to this way of thinking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw his ruse, and was not to be duped by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men who have not feared to act bravely against oppression, sir,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; exclaimed my uncle, with fervour, &ldquo;that I have been more
      careful of Philip's associations, and that he has not caught in the
      streets and taverns this noxious creed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no danger from Philip; he remembers his family name,&rdquo; said the
      rector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Carvel, bitterly, &ldquo;there is no danger from Philip. Like
      his father, he will ever believe that which best serves him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grafton, needless to say, did not pursue such an argument, but rising,
      remarked that this deplorable affair had kept him long past his dinner
      hour, and that his services were as ever at his father's disposal. He
      refused to stay, though my grandfather pressed him of course, and with a
      low bow of filial respect and duty and a single glance at the rector, my
      uncle was gone. And then we walked slowly to the house and into the dining
      room, Mr. Carvel leading the procession, and I an unwilling rear, knowing
      that my fate would be decided between them. I thought Mr. Allen's grace
      would never end, and the meal likewise; I ate but little, while the two
      gentlemen discussed parish matters. And when at last Scipio had retired,
      and the rector of St. Anne's sat sipping the old Madeira, his countenance
      all gravity, but with a relish he could not hide, my grandfather spoke up.
      And though he addressed himself to the guest, I knew full well what he
      said was meant for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you see, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am sore perplexed and troubled. We Carvels,
      Mr. Allen, have ever been stanch to Church and King. My great-grandsire
      fought at Naseby and Marston Moor for Charles, and suffered exile in his
      name. 'Twas love for King James that sent my father hither, though he
      swore allegiance to Anne and the First George. I can say with pride that
      he was no indifferent servant to either, refusing honours from the
      Pretender in '15, when he chanced to be at home. An oath is an oath, sir,
      and we have yet to be false to ours. And the King, say I, should, next to
      God, be loved and loyally served by his subjects. And so I have served
      this George, and his grandfather before him, according to the talents
      which were given me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ably, sir, permit me to say,&rdquo; echoed the rector, heartily. Too
      heartily, methought. And he carefully filled his pipe with choice leaf out
      of Mr. Carvel's inlaid box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be that as it may, I have done my best, as we must all do. Pardon me,
      sir, for speaking of myself. But I have brought up this lad from a child,
      Mr. Allen,&rdquo; said Mr. Carvel, his words coming slowly, as if each gave him
      pain, &ldquo;and have striven to be an example to him in all things. He has few
      of those faults which I most fear; God be thanked that he loves the truth,
      for there is yet a chance of his correction. A chance, said I?&rdquo; he cried,
      his speech coming more rapid, &ldquo;nay, he shall be cured! I little thought,
      fool that I was, that he would get this pox. His father fought and died
      for the King; and should trouble come, which God forbid, to know that
      Richard stood against his Majesty would kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And well it might, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; said the divine. He was for the moment
      sobered, as weak men must be in the presence of those of strong
      convictions. My grandfather had half risen in his chair, and the lines of
      his smooth-shaven face deepened visibly with the pain of the feelings to
      which he gave utterance. As for me, I was well-nigh swept away by a
      bigness within me, and torn between love and duty, between pity and the
      reason left me, and sadly tried to know whether my dear parent's life and
      happiness should be weighed against what I felt to be right. I strove to
      speak, but could say nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be removed from the influences,&rdquo; the rector ventured, after a
      halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he must indeed,&rdquo; said my grandfather. &ldquo;Why did I not send him to
      Eton last fall? But it is hard, Mr. Allen, to part with the child of our
      old age. I would take passage and go myself with him to-morrow were it not
      for my duties in the Council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eton! I would have sooner, I believe, wrought by the side of any rascally
      redemptioner in the iron mines of the Patapsco than have gone to Eton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for the present, sir, I would counsel you to put the lad's studies in
      the charge of some able and learned man, that his mind may be turned from
      the disease which has fed upon it. Some one whose loyalty is beyond
      question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who so fit as yourself, Mr. Allen?&rdquo; returned my grandfather, relief
      plain in his voice. &ldquo;You have his Lordship's friendship and confidence,
      and never has rector of St. Anne's or of any other parish brought letters
      to his Excellency to compare with yours. And so I crave your help in this
      time of need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Allen showed becoming hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear you do me greater honour than I deserve, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he answered,
      a strain of the pomp coming back, &ldquo;though my gracious patron is disposed
      to think well of me, and I shall strive to hold his good opinion. But I
      have duties of parish and glebe to attend, and Master Philip Carvel
      likewise in my charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I held my breath for my grandfather's reply. The rector, however, had read
      him, and well knew that a show of reluctance would but inflame him the
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How now, sir?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Surely, as you love the King, you will not
      refuse me in this strait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Allen rose and grasped him by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and you put it thus, I cannot refuse you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thought of it was too much. I ran to my grandfather crying: &ldquo;Not Mr.
      Allen, sir, not Mr. Allen. Any one else you please,&mdash;Mr. Fairbrother
      even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rector drew back haughtily. &ldquo;It is clear, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
      Richard has other preferences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And be damned to them!&rdquo; shouted my grandfather. &ldquo;Am I to be ruled by this
      headstrong boy? He has beat Mr. Fairbrother, and shall have no
      skimmed-milk supervision if I can help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it was settled that I should be tutored by the rector of St.
      Anne's, and I took my seat beside my cousin Philip in his study the very
      next day.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. GRAFTON HAS HIS CHANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      To add to my troubles my grandfather was shortly taken very ill with the
      first severe sickness he had ever in his life endured. Dr. Leiden came and
      went sometimes thrice daily, and for a week he bore a look so grave as to
      frighten me. Dr. Evarts arrived by horse from Philadelphia, and the two
      physicians held long conversations in the morning room, while I listened
      at the door and comprehended not a word of their talk save when they spoke
      of bleeding. And after a very few consultations, as is often the way in
      their profession, they disagreed and quarrelled, and Dr. Evarts packed
      himself back to Philadelphia in high dudgeon. Then Mr. Carvel began to
      mend.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many who came regularly to inquire of him, and each afternoon I
      would see the broad shoulders and genial face of Governor Sharpe in the
      gateway, completing his walk by way of Marlboro' Street. I loved and
      admired him, for he had been a soldier himself before he came out to us,
      and had known and esteemed my father. His Excellency should surely have
      been knighted for his services in the French war. Once he spied me at the
      window and shook his cane pleasantly, and in he walks to the room where I
      sat reading of the victories of Blenheim and Malplaquet, for chronicles of
      this sort I delighted in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha, Richard,&rdquo; says he, taking up the book, &ldquo;'tis plain whither your
      tastes lead you. Marlboro was a great general, and as sorry a scoundrel as
      ever led troops to battle. Truly,&rdquo; says he, musing, &ldquo;the Lord often makes
      queer choice in his instruments for good.&rdquo; And he lowered himself into the
      easy chair and crossed his legs, regarding me very comically. &ldquo;What's this
      I hear of your joining the burghers and barristers, and trouncing poor Mr.
      Fairbrother and his flock, and crying 'Liberty forever!' in the very ears
      of the law?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;His Majesty will have need of such lads as you, I
      make no doubt, and should such proceedings come to his ears I would not
      give a pipe for your chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not but laugh, confused as I was, at his Excellency's rally. And
      this I may say, that had it pleased Providence to give me dealing with
      such men of the King's side as he, perchance my fortunes had been altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in any good cause, sir,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I would willingly give my life
      to his Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said his Excellency, raising his eyebrows, &ldquo;I see clearly you are of
      the rascals. But a lad must have his fancies, and when your age I was hot
      for the exiled Prince. I acquired more sense as I grew older. And better
      an active mind, say I, than a sluggard partisan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this stage of our talk came in my Uncle Grafton, and bowing low to the
      Governor made apology that some of the elders of the family had not been
      there to entertain him. He told his Excellency that he had never left the
      house save for necessary business, which was true for once, my uncle
      having taken up his abode with us during that week. But now, thanking
      Heaven and Dr. Leiden and his own poor effort, he could report his dear
      father to be out of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Governor Sharpe answered shortly that he had been happy to hear the good
      news from Scipio. &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I was well enough entertained, for I
      have a liking for this lad, and to speak truth I saw him here as I came up
      the walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My uncle smiled deprecatingly, and hid any vexation he might have had from
      this remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that Richard lacks wisdom as yet, your Excellency,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
      has many of his father's headstrong qualities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you most providentially escaped,&rdquo; his Excellency put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grafton bit his lip. &ldquo;Necessity makes us all careful, sir,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Necessity does more than that, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; returned the Governor, who
      was something of a wit; &ldquo;necessity often makes us fools, if we be not
      careful. But give me ever a wanton fool rather than him of necessity's
      handiwork. And as for the lad,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;let him not trouble you. Such as
      he, if twisted a little in the growth, come out straight enough in the
      end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I think the Governor little knew what wormwood was this to my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis heartily to be hoped, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for his folly has brought
      trouble enough behind it to those who have his education and his welfare
      in hand, and I make no doubt is at the bottom of my father's illness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this injustice I could not but cry out, for all the town knew, and my
      grandfather himself best of all, that the trouble from which he now
      suffered sprang from his gout. And yet my heart was smitten at the thought
      that I might have hastened or aggravated the attack. The Governor rose. He
      seized his stick aggressively and looked sharply at Grafton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;my friend Mr. Carvel is far too wise to be
      upset by a boyish prank which deserves no notice save a caning. And that,
      my lad,&rdquo; he added lightly, &ldquo;I dare swear you got with interest.&rdquo; And he
      called for a glass of the old Madeira when Scipio came with the tray, and
      departed with a polite inquiry after my Aunt Caroline's health, and a
      prophecy that Mr. Carvel would soon be taking the air again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been high doings indeed in Marlboro' Street that miserable week.
      My grandfather took to his bed of a Saturday afternoon, and bade me go
      down to Mr. Aikman's, the bookseller, and fetch him the latest books and
      plays. That night I became so alarmed that I sent Diomedes for Dr. Leiden,
      who remained the night through. Sunday was well gone before the news
      reached York Street, when my Aunt Caroline came hurrying over in her
      chair, and my uncle on foot. They brushed past Scipio at the door, and
      were pushing up the long flight when they were stopped on the landing by
      Dr. Leiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is my father, sir?&rdquo; Grafton cried, &ldquo;and why was I not informed at
      once of his illness? I must see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your vater can see no one, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; said the doctor, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; says my uncle, &ldquo;you dare to refuse me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so lout, I bray you,&rdquo; says the doctor; &ldquo;I tare any ting vere life is
      concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will see him,&rdquo; says Grafton, in a sort of helpless rage, for the
      doctor's manner baffled him. &ldquo;I will see him before he dies, and no man
      alive shall say me nay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then my Aunt Caroline gathered up her skirt, and made shift to pass the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to nurse him,&rdquo; said she, imperiously, and, turning to where I
      stood near, she added: &ldquo;Bid a servant fetch from York Street what I shall
      have need of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor smiled, but stood firm. He cared little for aught in heaven or
      earth, did Dr. Leiden, and nothing whatever for Mr. and Mrs. Grafton
      Carvel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I peg you, matam, do not disturp yourself,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Mr. Carvel is aply
      attended by an excellent voman, Mrs. Villis, and he has no neet of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried my aunt; &ldquo;this is too much, sir, that I am thrust out of my
      father-in-law's house, and my place taken by a menial. That woman able!&rdquo;
       she fumed, dropping suddenly her cloak of dignity; &ldquo;Mr. Carvel's charity
      is all that keeps her here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then my uncle drew himself up. &ldquo;Dr. Leiden,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;kindly oblige me by
      leaving my father's house, and consider your services here at an end. And
      Richard,&rdquo; he goes on to me, &ldquo;send my compliments to Dr. Drake, and request
      him to come at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was stepping forward to say that I would do nothing of the kind, when
      the doctor stopped me by a signal, as much as to say that the quarrel was
      wide enough without me. He stood with his back against the great arched
      window flooded with the yellow light of the setting sun, a little black
      figure in high relief, with a face of parchment. And he took a pinch of
      snuff before he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here py Mr. Carvel's orters, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and py tose alone vill
      I leaf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this is how the Chippendale piece was broke, which you, my children,
      and especially Bess, admire so extravagantly. It stood that day behind the
      doctor, and my uncle, making a violent move to get by, struck it, and so
      it fell with a great crash lengthwise on the landing; and the wonderful
      vases Mr. Carroll had given my grandfather rolled down the stairs and lay
      crushed at the bottom. Withal he had spoken so quietly, Dr. Leiden
      possessed a temper drawn from his Teutonic ancestors. With his little face
      all puckered, he swore so roundly at my uncle in some lingo he had got
      from his father,&mdash;High German or Low German,&mdash;I know not what,
      that Grafton and his wife were glad enough to pick their way amongst the
      broken bits of glass and china, to the hall again. Dr. Leiden shook his
      fist at their retreating persons, saying that the Sabbath was no day to do
      murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed them with the pretence of picking up what was left of the
      ornaments. What between anger against the doctor and Mrs. Willis, and
      fright and chagrin at the fall of the Chippendale piece, my aunt was in
      such a state of nervous flurry that she bade the ashy Scipio call her
      chairmen, and vowed, in a trembling voice, she would never again enter a
      house where that low-bred German was to be found. But my Uncle Grafton was
      of a different nature. He deemed defeat but a postponement of the object
      he wished to gain, and settled himself in the library with a copy of
      &ldquo;Miller on the Distinction of Ranks in Society.&rdquo; He appeared at supper
      suave as ever, gravely concerned as to his father's health, which formed
      the chief topic between us. He gave me to understand that he would take
      the green room until the old gentleman was past danger. Not a word, mind
      you, of Dr. Leiden, nor did my uncle express a wish to go into the
      sick-room, from which even I was forbid. Nay, the next morning he met the
      doctor in the hall and conversed with him at some length over the case as
      though nothing had occurred between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While my Uncle Grafton was in the house I had opportunity of marking the
      intimacy which existed between him and the rector of St. Anne's. The
      latter swung each evening the muffled knocker, and was ushered on tiptoe
      across the polished floor to the library where my uncle sat in state. It
      was often after supper before the rector left, and coming in upon them
      once I found wine between them and empty decanters on the board, and they
      fell silent as I passed the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our dear friend Captain Clapsaddle was away when my grandfather fell sick,
      having been North for three months or more on some business known to few.
      'Twas generally supposed he went to Massachusetts to confer with the
      patriots of that colony. Hearing the news as he rode into town, he came
      booted and spurred to Marlboro' Street before going to his lodgings. I ran
      out to meet him, and he threw his arms about me on the street so that
      those who were passing smiled, for all knew the captain. And Harvey, who
      always came to take the captain's horse, swore that he was glad to see a
      friend of the family once again. I told the captain very freely of my
      doings, and showed him the clipping from the Gazette, which made him laugh
      heartily. But a shade came upon his face when I rehearsed the scene we had
      with my uncle and Mr. Allen in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;Mr. Carvel hath sent you to Mr. Allen on your uncle's
      advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;to do my uncle justice, he said not a word to Mr.
      Carvel about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain turned the subject. He asked me much concerning the rector and
      what he taught me, and appeared but ill-pleased at that I had to tell him.
      But he left me without so much as a word of comment or counsel. For it was
      a principle with Captain Clapsaddle not to influence in any way the minds
      of the young, and he would have deemed it unfair to Mr. Carvel had he
      attempted to win my sympathies to his. Captain Daniel was the first the
      old gentleman asked to see when visitors were permitted him, and you may
      be sure the faithful soldier was below stairs waiting for the summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was some three weeks with my new tutor, the rector, before my
      grandfather's illness, and went back again as soon as he began to mend. I
      was not altogether unhappy, owing to a certain grim pleasure I had in
      debating with him, which I shall presently relate. There was much to annoy
      and anger me, too. My cousin Philip was forever carping and criticising my
      Greek and Latin, and it was impossible not to feel his sneer at my back
      when I construed. He had pat replies ready to correct me when called upon,
      and 'twas only out of consideration for Mr. Carvel that I kept my hands
      from him when we were dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the rector disliked Philip in his way as much as did I in mine.
      The Reverend Bennett Allen, indeed, might have been a very good fellow had
      Providence placed him in a different setting; he was one of those whom his
      Excellency dubbed &ldquo;fools from necessity.&rdquo; He should have been born with a
      fortune, though I can think of none he would not have run through in a
      year or so. But nature had given him aristocratic tastes, with no other
      means toward their gratification than good looks, convincing ways, and a
      certain bold, half-defiant manner, which went far with his Lordship and
      those like him, who thought Mr. Allen excellent good company. With the
      rector, as with too many others, holy orders were but a means to an end.
      It was a sealed story what he had been before he came to Governor Sharpe
      with Baltimore's directions to give him the best in the colony. But our
      rakes and wits, and even our solid men, like my grandfather, received him
      with open arms. He had ever a tale on his tongue's end tempered to the ear
      of his listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who had most influenced my way of thinking, Mr. Allen had well demanded.
      The gentleman was none other than Mr. Henry Swain, Patty's father. Of her
      I shall speak later. He was a rising barrister and man of note among our
      patriots, and member of the Lower House; a diffident man in public, with
      dark, soulful eyes, and a wide, white brow, who had declined a nomination
      to the Congress of '65. At his fireside, unknown to my grandfather and to
      Mr. Allen, I had learned the true principles of government. Before the
      House Mr. Swain spoke only under extraordinary emotion, and then he gained
      every ear. He had been my friend since childhood, but I never knew the
      meaning and the fire of oratory until curiosity brought me to the gallery
      of the Assembly chamber in the Stadt House, where the barrister was on his
      feet at the time. I well remember the tingle in my chest as I looked and
      listened. And I went again and again, until the House sat behind closed
      doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, when Mr. Allen brought forth for my benefit those arguments of the
      King's party which were deemed their strength, I would confront him with
      Mr. Swain's logic. He had in me a tough subject for conversion. I was put
      to very small pains to rout my instructor out of all his positions,
      because indolence, and lack of interest in the question, and contempt for
      the Americans, had made him neglect the study of it. And Philip, who
      entered at first glibly enough at the rector's side, was soon drawn into
      depths far beyond him. Many a time was Mr. Allen fain to laugh at his
      blunders. I doubt not my cousin had the facts straight enough when he rose
      from the breakfast table at home; but by the time he reached the rectory
      they were shaken up like so many parts of a puzzle in a bag, and past all
      straightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector was especially bitter toward the good people of Boston Town,
      whom he dubbed Puritan fanatics. To him Mr. Otis was but a meddling fool,
      and Mr. Adams a traitor whose head only remained on his shoulders by grace
      of the extreme clemency of his Majesty, which Mr. Allen was at a loss to
      understand. When beaten in argument, he would laugh out some sneer that
      would set my blood simmering. One morning he came in late for the lesson,
      smelling strongly of wine, and bade us bring our books out under the fruit
      trees in the garden. He threw back his gown and tilted his cap, and
      lighting his pipe began to speak of that act of Townshend's, passed but
      the year before, which afterwards proved the King's folly and England's
      ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Principle!&rdquo; exclaimed my fine clergyman at length, blowing a great whiff
      among the white blossoms. &ldquo;Oons! your Americans worship his Majesty
      stamped upon a golden coin. And though he saved their tills from plunder
      from the French, the miserly rogues are loth to pay for the service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose, and taking a guinea-piece from my pocket, held it up before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They care this much for gold, sir, and less for his Majesty, who cares
      nothing for them,&rdquo; I said. And walking to the well near by, I dropped the
      piece carelessly into the clear water. He was beside me before it left my
      hand, and Philip also, in time to see the yellow coin edging this way and
      that toward the bottom. The rector turned to me with a smile of cynical
      amusement playing over his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a spirit has brought more than one brave fellow to Tyburn, Master
      Carvel,&rdquo; he said. And then he added reflectively, &ldquo;But if there were more
      like you, we might well have cause for alarm.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII. OVER THE WALL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dorothy treated me ill enough that spring. Since the minx had tasted power
      at Carvel Hall, there was no accounting for her. On returning to town Dr.
      Courtenay had begged her mother to allow her at the assemblies, a request
      which Mrs. Manners most sensibly refused. Mr. Marmaduke had given his
      consent, I believe, for he was more impatient than Dolly for the days when
      she would become the toast of the province. But the doctor contrived to
      see her in spite of difficulties, and Will Fotheringay was forever at her
      house, and half a dozen other lads. And many gentlemen of fashion like the
      doctor called ostensibly to visit Mrs. Manners, but in reality to see Miss
      Dorothy. And my lady knew it. She would be lingering in the drawing-room
      in her best bib and tucker, or strolling in the garden as Dr. Courtenay
      passed, and I got but scant attention indeed. I was but an awkward lad,
      and an old playmate, with no novelty about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Richard,&rdquo; she would say to me as I rode or walked beside her, or sat
      at dinner in Prince George Street, &ldquo;I know every twist and turn of your
      nature. There is nothing you could do to surprise me. And so, sir, you are
      very tiresome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You once found me useful enough to fetch and carry, and amusing when I
      walked the Oriole's bowsprit,&rdquo; I replied ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you make me jealous?&rdquo; says she, stamping her foot. &ldquo;A score of
      pretty girls are languishing for a glimpse of you,&mdash;Jennie and Bess
      Fotheringay, and Betty Tayloe, and Heaven knows how many others. They are
      actually accusing me of keeping you trailing. 'La, girls!' said I, 'if you
      will but rid me of him for a day, you shall have my lasting gratitude.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she turned to the spinet and began a lively air. But the taunt struck
      deeper than she had any notion of. That spring arrived out from London on
      the Belle of the Wye a box of fine clothes my grandfather had commanded
      for me from his own tailor; and a word from a maid of fifteen did more to
      make me wear them than any amount of coaxing from Mr. Allen and my Uncle
      Grafton. My uncle seemed in particular anxious that I should make a good
      appearance, and reminded me that I should dress as became the heir of the
      Carvel house. I took counsel with Patty Swain, and then went to see Betty
      Tayloe, and the Fotheringay girls, and the Dulany girls, near the
      Governor's. And (fie upon me!) I was not ill-pleased with the brave
      appearance I made. I would show my mistress how little I cared. But the
      worst of it was, the baggage seemed to trouble less than I, and had the
      effrontery to tell me how happy she was I had come out of my shell, and
      broken loose from her apron-strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, they would soon begin to think I meant to marry you, Richard,&rdquo;
       says she at supper one Sunday before a tableful, and laughed with the
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not credit you with such good sense, my dear,&rdquo; says her mother,
      smiling kindly at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dolly bit her lip, and did not join in that part of the merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fled to Patty Swain for counsel, nor was it the first time in my life I
      had done so. Some good women seem to have been put into this selfish world
      to comfort and advise. After Prince George Street with its gilt and
      marbles and stately hedged gardens, the low-beamed, vine-covered house in
      the Duke of Gloucester Street was a home and a rest. In my eyes there was
      not its equal in Annapolis for beauty within and without. Mr. Swain had
      bought the dwelling from an aged man with a history, dead some nine years
      back. Its furniture, for the most part, was of the Restoration, of simple
      and massive oak blackened by age, which I ever fancied better than the
      Frenchy baubles of tables and chairs with spindle legs, and cabinets of
      glass and gold lacquer which were then making their way into the fine
      mansions of our town. The house was full of twists and turns, and steps up
      and down, and nooks and passages and queer hiding-places which we children
      knew, and in parts queer leaded windows of bulging glass set high in the
      wall, and older than the reign of Hanover. Here was the shrine of
      cleanliness, whose high-priestess was Patty herself. Her floors were like
      satin-wood, and her brasses lights in themselves. She had come honestly
      enough by her gifts, her father having married the daughter of an able
      townsman of Salem, in the Massachusetts colony, when he had gone north
      after his first great success in court. Now the poor lady sat in a padded
      armchair from morning to night, beside the hearth in winter, and under the
      trees in summer, by reason of a fall she had had. There she knitted all
      the day long. Her placid face and quiet way come before me as I write.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friendship with Patty had begun early. One autumn day when I was a
      little lad of eight or nine, my grandfather and I were driving back from
      Whitehall in the big coach, when we spied a little maid of six by the
      Severn's bank, with her apron full of chestnuts. She was trudging bravely
      through the dead leaves toward the town. Mr. Carvel pulled the cord to
      stop, and asked her name. &ldquo;Patty Swain, and it please your honour,&rdquo; the
      child answered, without fear. &ldquo;So you are the young barrister's daughter?&rdquo;
       says he, smiling at something I did not understand. She nodded. &ldquo;And how
      is it you are so far from home, and alone, my little one?&rdquo; asked Mr.
      Carvel again. For some time he could get nothing out of her; but at length
      she explained, with much coaxing, that her big brother Tom had deserted
      her. My grandfather wished that Tom were his brother, that he might be
      punished as he deserved. He commanded young Harvey to lift the child into
      the coach, chestnuts and all, and there she sat primly between us. She was
      not as pretty as Dorothy, so I thought, but her clear gray eyes and simple
      ways impressed me by their very honesty, as they did Mr. Carvel. What must
      he do but drive her home to Green Street, where Mr. Swain then lived in a
      little cottage. Mr. Carvel himself lifted her out and kissed her, and
      handed her to her mother at the gate, who was vastly overcome by the
      circumstance. The good lady had not then received that fall which made her
      a cripple for life. &ldquo;And will you not have my chestnuts, sir, for your
      kindness?&rdquo; says little Patty. Whereat my grandfather laughed and kissed
      her again, for he loved children, and wished to know if she would not be
      his daughter, and come to live in Marlboro' Street; and told the story of
      Tom, for fear she would not. He was silent as we drove away, and I knew he
      was thinking of my own mother at that age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after this Mr. Swain bought the house in the Duke of Gloucester
      Street. This, as you know, is back to back with Marlboro. To reach Patty's
      garden I had but to climb the brick wall at the rear of our grounds, and
      to make my way along the narrow green lane left there for perhaps a
      hundred paces of a lad, to come to the gate in the wooden paling. In
      return I used to hoist Patty over the wall, and we would play at
      children's games under the fruit trees that skirted it. Some instinct kept
      her away from the house. I often caught her gazing wistfully at its wings
      and gables. She was not born to a mansion, so she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your father is now rich,&rdquo; I objected. I had heard Captain Daniel say
      so. &ldquo;He may have a mansion of his own and he chooses. He can better afford
      it than many who are in debt for the fine show they make.&rdquo; I was but
      repeating gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see the grand company come in, when your grandfather has
      them to dine,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Sometimes we have grand gentlemen come to
      see father in their coaches, but they talk of nothing but politics. We
      never have any fine ladies like&mdash;like your Aunt Caroline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I startled her by laughing derisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I pray you never may, Patty,&rdquo; was all I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never told Dolly of my intimacy with the barrister's little girl over
      the wall. This was not because I was ashamed of the friendship, but arose
      from a fear-well-founded enough&mdash;that she would make sport of it. At
      twelve Dolly had notions concerning the walks of life that most other
      children never dream of. They were derived, of course, from Mr. Marmaduke.
      But the day of reckoning arrived. Patty and I were romping beside the back
      wall when suddenly a stiff little figure in a starched frock appeared
      through the trees in the direction of the house, followed by Master Will
      Fotheringay in his visiting clothes. I laugh now when I think of that
      formal meeting between the two little ladies. There was no time to hoist
      Miss Swain over the wall, or to drive Miss Manners back upon the house.
      Patty stood blushing as though caught in a guilty act, while she of the
      Generations came proudly on, Will sniggering behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this, Richard?&rdquo; asks Miss Manners, pointing a small forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patty Swain, if you must know!&rdquo; I cried, and added boylike: &ldquo;And she is
      just as good as you or me, and better.&rdquo; I was quite red in the face, and
      angry because of it. &ldquo;This is Dorothy Manners, Patty, and Will
      Fotheringay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment was a pregnant one. But I was resolved to carry the matter out
      with a bold front. &ldquo;Will you join us at catch and swing?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will promptly declared that he would join, for Patty was good to look
      upon. Dolly glanced at her dress, tossed her head, and marched back alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Richard!&rdquo; cried Patty; &ldquo;I shall never forgive myself! I have made you
      quarrel with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His sweetheart,&rdquo; said Will, wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; said I. Which was not so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patty felt no resentment for my miss's haughty conduct, but only a tearful
      penitence for having been the cause of a strife between us. Will's
      arguments and mine availed nothing. I must lift her over the wall again,
      and she went home. When we reached the garden we found Dolly seated beside
      her mother on my grandfather's bench, from which stronghold our combined
      tactics were powerless to drag her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dolly was gone, I asked my grandfather in great indignation why Patty
      did not play with the children I knew, with Dorothy and the Fotheringays.
      He shook his head dubiously. &ldquo;When you are older, Richard, you will
      understand that our social ranks are cropped close. Mr. Swain is an honest
      and an able man, though he believes in things I do not. I hear he is
      becoming wealthy. And I have no doubt,&rdquo; the shrewd old gentleman added,
      &ldquo;that when Patty grows up she will be going to the assemblies, though it
      was not so in my time.&rdquo; So liberal was he that he used to laugh at my
      lifting her across the wall, and in his leisure delight to listen to my
      accounts of her childish housekeeping. Her life was indeed a contrast to
      Dorothy's. She had all the solid qualities that my lady lacked in early
      years. And yet I never wavered in my liking to the more brilliant and
      wayward of the two. The week before my next birthday, when Mr. Carvel drew
      me to him and asked me what I wished for a present that year, as was his
      custom, I said promptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to have Patty Swain at my party, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you shall, my lad,&rdquo; he cried, taking his snuff and eying me with
      pleasure. &ldquo;I am glad to see, Richard, that you have none of Mr.
      Marmaduke's nonsense about you. She is a good girl, i' faith, and more of
      a lady now than many who call themselves such. And you shall have your
      present to boot. Hark'ee, Daniel,&rdquo; said he to the captain; &ldquo;if the child
      comes to my house, the poll-parrots and follow-me-ups will be wanting her,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the getting her to go was a matter of five days. For Patty was
      sensitive, like her father, and dreaded a slight. Not so with Master Tom,
      who must, needs be invited, too. He arrived half an hour ahead of time,
      arrayed like Solomon, and without his sister! I had to go for Patty,
      indeed, after the party had begun, and to get the key to the wicket in the
      wall to take her in that way, so shy was she. My dear grandfather showed
      her particular attention. And Miss Dolly herself, being in the humour,
      taught her a minuet.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that she came to all my birthdays, and lost some of her shyness. And
      was invited to other great houses, even as Mr. Carvel had predicted. But
      her chief pleasure seemed ever her duty. Whether or no such characters
      make them one and the same, who can tell? She became the light of her
      father's house, and used even to copy out his briefs, at which task I
      often found her of an evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Tom, that graceless scamp, I never could stomach him. I wondered
      then, as I have since, how he was the brother of such a sister. He could
      scarce bide his time until Mr. Swain should have a coach and a seat in the
      country with the gentry. &ldquo;A barrister,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;is as good as any one
      else. And if my father came out a redemptioner, and worked his way, so had
      old Mr. Dulany. Our family at home was the equal of his.&rdquo; All of which was
      true, and more. He would deride Patty for sewing and baking, vowing that
      they had servants enough now to do the work twice over. She bore with him
      with a patience to be marvelled at; and I could never get it through my
      head why Mr. Swain indulged him, though he was the elder, and his mother's
      favourite. Tom began to dress early. His open admiration was Dr.
      Courtenay, his confessed hope to wear five-pound ruffles and gold sword
      knots. He clung to Will Fotheringay with a tenacity that became proverbial
      among us boys, and his boasts at King William's School were his father's
      growing wealth and intimacy with the great men of the province.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I grew older, I took the cue of political knowledge, as I have said,
      from Mr. Swain rather than Captain Daniel, who would tell me nothing. I
      fell into the habit of taking supper in Gloucester Street. The meal was
      early there. And when the dishes were cleared away, and the barrister's
      pipe lit, and Patty and her mother had got their sewing, he would talk by
      the hour on the legality of our resistance to the King, and discuss the
      march of affairs in England and the other colonies. He found me a ready
      listener, and took pains to teach me clearly the right and wrong of the
      situation. 'Twas his religion, even as loyalty to the King was my
      grandfather's, and he did not think it wrong to spread it. He likewise
      instilled into me in that way more of history than Mr. Allen had ever
      taught me, using it to throw light upon this point or that. But I never
      knew his true power and eloquence until I followed him to the Stadt House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patty was grown a girl of fifteen then, glowing with health, and had ample
      good looks of her own. 'Tis odd enough that I did not fall in love with
      her when Dolly began to use me so outrageously. But a lad of eighteen is
      scarce a rational creature. I went and sat before my oracle upon the
      vine-covered porch under the eaves, and poured out my complaint. She laid
      down her needlework and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You silly boy,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;can't you see that she herself has prescribed
      for you? She was right when she told you to show attention to Jenny. And
      if you dangle about Miss Dolly now, you are in danger of losing her. She
      knows it better than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had Jenny to ride the very next day. Result: my lady smiled on me more
      sweetly than ever when I went to Prince George Street, and vowed Jenny had
      never looked prettier than when she went past the house. This left my
      victory in such considerable doubt that I climbed the back wall forthwith
      in my new top-boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you looked for her to be angry?&rdquo; said Patty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unreasoning vanity!&rdquo; she cried, for she knew how to speak plain. &ldquo;By your
      confession to me you have done this to please her, for she warned you at
      the beginning it would please her. And now you complain of it. I believe I
      know your Dorothy better than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so I got but little comfort out of Patty that time.

      CHAPTER IX. UNDER FALSE COLOURS
    </h2>
    <p>
      And now I come to a circumstance in my life I would rather pass over
      quickly. Had I steered the straight course of my impulse I need never have
      deceived that dear gentleman whom I loved and honoured above any in this
      world, and with whom I had always lived and dealt openly. After my
      grandfather was pronounced to be mending, I went back to Mr. Allen until
      such time as we should be able to go to the country. Philip no longer
      shared my studies, his hours having been changed from morning to
      afternoon. I thought nothing of this, being content with the rector's
      explanation that my uncle had a task for Philip in the morning, now that
      Mr. Carvel was better. And I was well content to be rid of Philip's
      company. But as the days passed I began to mark an absence still stranger.
      I had my Horace and my Ovid still: but the two hours from eleven to one,
      which he was wont to give up to history and what he was pleased to call
      instruction in loyalty, were filled with other matter. Not a word now of
      politics from Mr. Allen. Not even a comment from him concerning the
      spirited doings of our Assembly, with which the town was ringing. That
      body had met but a while before, primed to act on the circular drawn up by
      Mr. Adams of Massachusetts. The Governor's message had not been so prompt
      as to forestall them, and I am occupied scarce the time in the writing of
      this that it took our brave members to adopt the petition to his Majesty
      and to pass resolutions of support to our sister colony of the North. This
      being done, and a most tart reply penned to his Excellency, they ended
      that sitting and passed in procession to the Governor's mansion to deliver
      it, Mr. Speaker Lloyd at their head, and a vast concourse of cheering
      people at their heels. Shutters were barred on the Tory houses we passed.
      And though Mr. Allen spied me in the crowd, he never mentioned the
      circumstance. More than once I essayed to draw from him an opinion of Mr.
      Adams's petition, which was deemed a work of great moderation and merit,
      and got nothing but evasion from my tutor. That he had become suddenly an
      American in principle I could not believe. At length I made bold to ask
      him why our discussions were now omitted. He looked up from the new play
      he was reading on the study lounge, with a glance of dark meaning I could
      not fathom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are learning more than I can teach you in Gloucester Street, and at
      the Stadt House,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth I was at a loss to understand his attitude until the day in June
      my grandfather and I went to Carvel Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman was weak still, so feeble that he had to be carried to
      his barge in a chair, a vehicle he had ever held in scorn. But he was
      cheerful, and his spirit remained the same as of old: but for that spirit
      I believe he had never again risen from his bed in Marlboro' Street. My
      uncle and the rector were among those who walked by his side to the dock,
      and would have gone to the Hall with him had he permitted them. He was
      kind enough to say that my arm was sufficient to lean on.
    </p>
    <p>
      What peace there was sitting once again under the rustling trees on the
      lawn with the green river and the blue bay spread out before us, and
      Scipio standing by with my grandfather's punch. Mr. Carvel would have me
      rehearse again all that had passed in town and colony since his illness,
      which I did with as much moderation as I was able. And as we talked he
      reached out and took my hand, for I sat near him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, I have heard tidings of you that gladden my heart, and they have
      done more than Dr. Leiden's physic for this old frame of mine. I well knew
      a Carvel could never go a wrong course, lad, and you least of any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tidings, sir?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, tidings,&rdquo; answered Mr. Carvel. Such a note of relief and gladness
      there was in the words as I had not heard for months from him, and a vague
      fear came upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scipio,&rdquo; he said merrily, &ldquo;a punch for Mr. Richard.&rdquo; And when the glass
      was brought my grandfather added: &ldquo;May it be ever thus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drained the toast, not falling into his humour or comprehending his
      reference, but dreading that aught I might say would disturb him, held my
      peace. And yet my apprehension increased. He set down his glass and
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no hope of this yet, Richard, for you were ever slow to change.
      Your conversion does credit to Mr. Allen as well as to you. In short, sir,
      the rector gives me an excellent good account of your studies, and adds
      that the King hath gained another loyal servant, for which I thank God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have no words to write of my feelings then. My head swam and my hand
      trembled on my grandfather's, and I saw dimly the old gentleman's face
      aglow with joy and pride, and knew not what to say or do. The answer I
      framed, alas, remained unspoken. From his own lips I had heard how much
      the news had mended him, and for once I lacked the heart, nay, the
      courage, to speak the truth. But Mr. Carvel took no heed of my silence,
      setting it down to another cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, my son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is no need of sending you to Eton next
      fall. I am not much longer for this earth, and can ill spare you: and Mr.
      Allen kindly consents to prepare you for Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Allen consents to that, sir?&rdquo; I gasped. I think, could I have laid
      hands on the rector then, I would have thrashed him, cloth and all, within
      an inch of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as if to crown my misery Mr. Carvel rose, and bearing heavily on my
      shoulder led me to the stable where Harvey and one of the black grooms
      stood in livery to receive us. Harvey held by the bridle a blooded bay
      hunter, and her like could scarce be found in the colony. As she stood
      arching her neck and pawing the ground, I all confusion and shame, my
      grandfather said simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, this is Firefly. I have got her for you from Mr. Randolph, of
      Virginia, for you are now old enough to have a good mount of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that night I lay awake, trying to sift some motive for Mr. Allen's
      deceit. For the life of me I could see no farther than a desire to keep me
      as his pupil, since he was well paid for his tuition. Still, the game did
      not seem worth the candle. However, he was safe in his lie. Shrewd rogue
      that he was, he well knew that I would not risk the attack a
      disappointment might bring my grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      What troubled me most of all was the fear that Grafton had reaped the
      advantage of the opportunity the illness gave him, and by his insidious
      arts had worked himself back into the good graces of his father. You must
      not draw from this, my dears, that I feared for the inheritance. Praised
      be God, I never thought of that! But I came by nature to hate and to fear
      my uncle, as I hated and feared the devil. I saw him with my father's
      eyes, and with my mother's, and as my grandfather had seen him in the old
      days when he was strong. Instinct and reason alike made me loathe him. As
      the months passed, and letters in Grafton's scroll hand came from the Kent
      estate or from Annapolis, my misgivings were confirmed by odd remarks that
      dropped from Mr. Carvel's lips. At length arrived the revelation itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear, Richard,&rdquo; he had said querulously, &ldquo;I fear that all these years I
      have done your uncle an injustice. Dear Elizabeth was wont to plead for
      him before she died, but I would never listen to her. I was hearty and
      strong then, and my heart was hard. And a remembrance of many things was
      fresh in my mind.&rdquo; He paused for breath, as was his habit now. And I said
      nothing. &ldquo;But Grafton has striven to wipe out the past. Sickness teaches
      us that we must condone, and not condemn. He has lived a reputable life,
      and made the most of the little start I gave him. He has supported his
      Majesty and my Lord in most trying times. And his Excellency tells me that
      the coming governor, Eden, will surely reward him with a seat in the
      Council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought of Governor Sharpe's biting words to Grafton. The Governor knew
      my uncle well, and I was sure he had never sat at his Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A son is a son, Richard,&rdquo; continued Mr. Carvel. &ldquo;You will one day find
      that out. Your uncle has atoned. He hath been faithful during my illness,
      despite my cold treatment. And he hath convinced me that your welfare is
      at his heart. I believe he is fond of you, my lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No greater sign of breaking health did I need than this, that Mr. Carvel
      should become blind to Grafton's hypocrisy; forget his attempts to prevent
      my father's marriage, and to throw doubt upon my mother's birth. The agony
      it gave me, coming as it did on top of the cruel deception, I shall not
      dwell upon. And the thought bursting within me remained unspoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw less of Dorothy then than I had in any summer of my life before. In
      spite of Mrs. Manners, the chrysalis had burst into the butterfly, and
      Wilmot House had never been so gay. It must be remembered that there were
      times when young ladies made their entrance into the world at sixteen, and
      for a beauty to be unmarried at twenty-two was rare indeed. When I went to
      Wilmot House to dine, the table would be always full, and Mr. Marmaduke
      simpering at the head of it, his air of importance doubled by his
      reflected glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We see nothing of you, my lad,&rdquo; he would say; &ldquo;you must not let these
      young gallants get ahead of you. How does your grandfather? I must pay my
      compliments to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of gallants there were enough, to be sure. Dr. Courtenay, of course, with
      a nosegay on his coat, striving to catch the beauty's eye. And Mr.
      Worthington and Mr. Dulany, and Mr. Fitzhugh and Mr. Paca, and I know not
      how many other young bachelors of birth and means. And Will Fotheringay,
      who spent some of his time with me at the Hall. Silver and China, with the
      Manners coat-of-arms, were laid out that had not seen the light for many
      along day. And there were picnics, and sailing parties, and dances galore,
      some of which I attended, but heard of more. It seemed to me that my lady
      was tiring of the doctor's compliments, and had transferred her fickle
      favour to young Mr. Fitzhugh, who was much more worthy, by the way. As for
      me, I had troubles enough then, and had become used in some sort to being
      shelved.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night in July,&mdash;'twas the very day Mr. Carvel had spoken to me of
      Grafton,&mdash;I had ridden over to Wilmot House to supper. I had little
      heart for going, but good Mrs. Manners herself had made me promise, and I
      could: not break my word. I must have sat very silent and preoccupied at
      the table, where all was wit and merriment. And more than once I saw the
      laughter leave Dorothy's face, and caught her eyes upon; me with such a
      look as set my beast throbbing. They would not meet my own, but would turn
      away instantly. I was heavy indeed that night, and did not follow the
      company into the ballroom, but made my excuses to Mrs. Manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawn lay bathed in moonlight; and as I picked, my way over it toward
      the stables for Firefly, I paused to look back at the house aglow, with
      light, the music of the fiddles and the sound of laughter floating out of
      the open windows. Even as I gaped a white figure was framed in the
      doorway, paused a moment on the low stone step, and then came on until it
      stood beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not well, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am well,&rdquo; I answered. I scarcely knew my own voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your grandfather worse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dorothy; he seems better to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood seemingly irresolute, her eyes new lifted, now falling before
      mine. Her slender arms bare, save for the little puff at the shoulders;
      her simple dress drawn a little above the waist, then falling straight to
      the white slipper. How real the ecstasy of that moment, and the pain of
      it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not coarse over, as you used to?&rdquo; she asked, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very busy,&rdquo; I replied evasively; &ldquo;Mr. Carvel cannot attend to his
      affairs.&rdquo; I longed to tell her the whole truth, but the words would not
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you are managing the estate all alone,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one else to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; she cried, drawing closer; &ldquo;you are in trouble. I&mdash;I have
      seen it. You are so silent, and&mdash;and you seem to have become older.
      Tell me, is it your Uncle Grafton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So astonished was I at the question, and because she had divined so,
      surely, that I did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; she asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;yes, in part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then came voices calling from the house. They had missed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry, Richard. I shall tell no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand ever so lightly upon mine and was gone. I stood staring
      after her until she disappeared in the door. All the way home I marvelled,
      my thoughts tumultuous, my hopes rising and falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when next I saw her, I thought she had forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had little company at the Hall that year, on account of Mr. Carvel. And
      I had been busy indeed. I sought with all my might to master a business
      for which I had but little taste, and my grandfather complimented me,
      before the season was done, upon my management. I was wont to ride that
      summer at four of a morning to canter beside Mr. Starkie afield, and I
      came to know the yield of every patch to a hogshead and the pound price to
      a farthing. I grew to understand as well as another the methods of curing
      the leaf. And the wheat pest appearing that year, I had the good fortune
      to discover some of the clusters in the sheaves, and ground our
      oyster-shells in time to save the crop. Many a long evening I spent on the
      wharves with old Stanwix, now toothless and living on his pension, with my
      eye on the glow of his pipe and my ear bent to his stories of the sea. It
      was his fancy that the gift of prophecy had come to him with the years;
      and at times, when his look would wander to the black rigging in the
      twilight, he would speak strangely enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, Mr. Richard,&rdquo; he would say; &ldquo;tho' your father was a soldier afore
      ye, ye were born to the deck of a ship-o'-war. Mark an old man's words,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you see the frigate, Stanwix?&rdquo; I laughed once, when he had repeated
      this with more than common solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reply rose above the singing of the locusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sir, that I can. But she's no frigate, sir. Devil knows what she is.
      She looks like a big merchantman to me, such as I've seed in the Injy
      trade, with a high poop in the old style. And her piercin's be not like a
      frigate.&rdquo; He said this with a readiness to startle me, and little enough
      superstition I had. A light was on his seared face, and his pipe lay
      neglected on the boards. &ldquo;Ay, sir, and there be a flag astern of her never
      yet seed on earth, nor on the waters under the earth. The tide is settin'
      in, the tide is settin' in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were words to set me thinking. And many a time they came back to me
      when the old man was laid away in the spot reserved for those who sailed
      the seas for Mr. Carvel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every week I drew up a report for my grandfather, and thus I strove by
      shouldering labour and responsibility to ease my conscience of that load
      which troubled it. For often, as we walked together through the yellow
      fields of an evening, it had been on my tongue to confess the lie Mr.
      Allen had led me into. But the sight of the old man, trembling and
      tremulous, aged by a single stroke, his childlike trust in my strength and
      beliefs, and above all his faith in a political creed which he nigh deemed
      needful for the soul's salvation,&mdash;these things still held me back.
      Was it worth while now, I asked myself, to disturb the peace of that mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the summer wore on to early autumn. And one day I was standing booted
      and spurred in the stables, Harvey putting the bridle upon Firefly, when
      my boy Hugo comes running in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marse Dick!&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;Marse Satan he come in the pinnace, and young
      Marse Satan and Missis Satan, and Marse Satan's pastor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do you mean, Hugo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young ebony's right, sir,&rdquo; chuckled Harvey; &ldquo;'tis the devil and his
      following.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean Mr. Grafton, fellow?&rdquo; I demanded, the unwelcome truth coming
      over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he does,&rdquo; remarked Harvey, laconically. &ldquo;You won't be wanting her
      now, your honour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold my stirrup,&rdquo; I cried, for the news had put me in anger. &ldquo;Hold my
      stirrup, sirrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I believe I took Firefly the best of thirty miles that afternoon and
      brought her back in the half-light, my saddle discoloured with her sweat.
      I clanked into the hall like a captain of horse. The night was sharp with
      the first touch of autumn, and a huge backlog lay on the irons. Around it,
      in a comfortable half-circle sat our guests, Grafton and Mr. Allen and
      Philip smoking and drinking for a whet against supper, and Mrs. Grafton in
      my grandfather's chair. There was an easy air of possession about the
      party of them that they had never before assumed, and the sight made me
      rattle again, the big door behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A surprise for you, my dear nephew,&rdquo; Grafton said gayly, &ldquo;I'll, lay a
      puncheon you did, not, expect us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carvel woke with a start at the sound of the door and said
      querulously, &ldquo;Guests, my lord, and I have done my poor best to make them
      welcome in your absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sense of change in him stung me. How different would his tone have
      been a year ago!
    </p>
    <p>
      He tattooed with his cane, which was the sign he generally made when he
      was ready for bed. Toward night his speech would hurt him. I assisted him
      up, the stairs, my uncle taking his arm on the other side. And together,
      with Diomedes help; we undressed him, Grafton talking in low tomes the
      while: Since this was, an office I was wont to perform, my temper was now
      overwhelming me. But I kept my month closed. At last he had had the simple
      meal Dr. Leiden allowed him, his candles were snuffed, and my uncle and I
      made our way to the hall together: There my aunt and Mr. Allen were at
      picquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper is insupportably late,&rdquo; says she; with a yawn, and rings the
      hand-bell. &ldquo;Scipio,&rdquo; she cries, &ldquo;why are we not served?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took a stride forward. But my uncle raised a restraining hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caroline, remember that this is not our house,&rdquo; says he, reprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There fell a deep silence; the log cracking; and just then the door swung
      on its hinges, and Mr. Starkie entered with the great bunch of keys in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The buildings are all secure; Mr. Richard,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Starkie,&rdquo; I replied. I turned to Scipio, standing by the
      low-boy, his teeth, going like a castanet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may serve at the usual hour, Scipio,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper began stiff as a state banquet. My uncle was conciliatory, with the
      manners of a Crichton. My aunt, not having come from generations of silver
      and self-control, flatly in a bad humour. Mr. Allen talked from force of
      habit, being used to pay in such kind for his meals. But presently the
      madeira, warmed these two into a better spirit. I felt that I had victory
      on my side, and was nothing loth to join them at whist, Philip and I
      against the rector and my aunt, and won something like two pounds apiece
      from them. Grafton made it a rule never to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, when I returned from my inspection, I found the rector
      and Philip had decamped with two of our choice horses, and that my uncle
      and aunt had commanded the barge, and gone to Mr. Lloyd's. I sent for
      Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fore de Lawd, Marse Richard,&rdquo; he wailed, &ldquo;'twan't Scipio's fault. Marse
      Grafton is dry fambly!&rdquo; This was Scipio's strongest argument. &ldquo;I jes'
      can't refuse one of de fambly, Marse Dick; and old Marse he say he too old
      now for quarrellin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that resistance was useless. There was nothing for it but to bide
      any time. And I busied myself with bills of cargo until I heard the horses
      on the drive. Mr. Allen and Philip came swaggering in, flushed with the
      exercise, and calling for punch, and I met them in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word with you, Mr. Allen!&rdquo; I called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand, Mr. Richard, if you like,&rdquo; he said gayly, &ldquo;as soon as this
      thirst of mine be quenched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited while he drained two glasses, when he followed me into the
      library, closing the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;though by a chance you are my mental and spiritual
      adviser, I intend speaking plain. For I know you to be one of the greatest
      rogues in the colony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I watched him narrowly the while, for I had some notion he might run me
      through. But I had misjudged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak plain, by all means,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but first let me ask for some
      tobacco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He filled the bowl of his pipe, and sat him down by the window. For the
      moment I was silent with sheer surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I can't call you out,&rdquo; he went on, surrounding himself with
      clouds of smoke, &ldquo;a lad of eighteen or so. And even if I could, I doubt
      whether I should. I like you, Richard,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You are straight-spoken
      and commanding. In brief, sir, you are the kind of lad I should have been
      had not fate pushed me into a corner, and made me squirm for life's
      luxuries. I hate squirming as much as another. This is prime tobacco,
      Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had come near disarming me; I was on the edge of a dangerous admiration
      for this man of the world, and for the life of me, I could not help liking
      him then. He had a fine presence, was undeniably handsome, and his riding
      clothes were of the latest London cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there not better methods for obtaining what you wish than those you
      practise?&rdquo; I asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; he answered carelessly; &ldquo;but these are well enough, and
      shorter. You were about to do me the honour of a communication?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brought me to my senses. I had, however, lost much of my heat in the
      interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know why you lied to Mr. Carvel about my convictions,
      Mr. Allen,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I am not of the King's party now, and never shall be.
      And you know this better than another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are strong words, Richard, my lad,&rdquo; said he, bringing his eyebrows
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are true words,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;Why did you lie, I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing for a while, but his breath came heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will pass it, I will pass it,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;but, by God! it is
      more than I have had to swallow in all my life before. Look at your
      grandfather, sir!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;behold him on the very brink of the grave,
      and ask me again why I lied to him! His hope of heaven is scarce less
      sacred to him than his love of the King, and both are so tightly wrapped
      about his heart that this knowledge of you would break it. Yes, break his
      heart, I say&rdquo; (and he got to his legs), &ldquo;and you would kill him for the
      sake of a boyish fancy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew he was acting, as well as though he had climbed upon the table and
      said it. And yet he had struck the very note of my own fears, and hit upon
      the one reason why I had not confessed lung ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is more you might have said, Mr. Allen,&rdquo; I remarked presently; &ldquo;you
      have a cause for keeping me under your instruction, and that is behind
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me a strange look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too acute by far,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;your imagination runs with you. I
      have said I like you, and I can teach you classics as well as another. Is
      it not enough to admit that the money I get for your instruction keeps me
      in champagne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not enough,&rdquo; I said stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must guess again, my lad,&rdquo; he answered with a laugh, and left
      the room with the easy grace that distinguished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was armed peace the rest of my uncle's visit. They departed on the
      third day. My Aunt Caroline, when she was not at picquet with Mr. Allen or
      quarrelling with Mrs. Willis or with Grafton himself, yawned without
      cessation. She declared in one of her altercations with her lord and
      master that she would lose her wits were they to remain another day, a
      threat that did not seem to move Grafton greatly. Philip ever maintained
      the right to pitch it on the side of his own convenience, and he chose in
      this instance to come to the rescue of his dear mamma, and turned the
      scales in her favour. He was pleased to characterize the Hall as
      insupportable, and vowed that his clothes would be out of fashion before
      they reached Rousby Hall, their next stopping-place. To do Philip justice,
      he was more honest a rascal than his father, though I am of the opinion
      that he had not the brain for great craft. And he had drawn from his
      mother a love of baubles which kept his mind from scheming. He had little
      to say to me, and I less to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grafton, as may be supposed, made me distinct advances before his
      departure, perceiving the unwisdom of antagonizing me unnecessarily. He
      had the imprudence once to ask of me the facts and figures of the estate;
      and tho' 'twas skilfully done by contrasting his own crops in Kent, you
      may be sure I was on my guard, and that he got nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was near forgetting an incident of their visit which I afterwards had
      good cause to remember. The morning of my talk with Mr. Allen I went to
      the stables to see how he had used Cynthia, and found old Harvey wiping
      her down, and rumbling the while like a crater.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What think you of the rector as a representative of heaven, Harvey?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him a representative of heaven!&rdquo; he snorted; &ldquo;I've heard tell of rotten
      boroughs, and I'm thinking Mr. Allen will be standing for one. What be him
      and Mr. Grafton a-doing here, sir, plotting all kinds o' crime while the
      old gentleman's nigh on his back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plotting?&rdquo; I said, catching at the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, plotting,&rdquo; repeated Harvey, casting his cloth away; &ldquo;murder and all
      the crimes in the calendar, I take it. I hear him and Mr. Grafton among
      the stalls this morning, and when they sees me they look like Knipe, here,
      caught with a fowl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what were they saying?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saying! God only knows their wickedness. I got the words 'Upper Marlboro'
      and 'South River' and 'next voyage,' and that profligate rector wanted to
      know as to how 'Griggs was reliable.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought no more of it at the time, believing it to be some of the small
      rascalities they were forever at. But that name of Griggs (why, the powers
      only know) stuck in my mind to turn up again.

      CHAPTER X. THE RED IN THE CARVEL BLOOD
    </h2>
    <p>
      After that, when we went back to Annapolis for the winter, there was no
      longer any disguise between my tutor and myself. I was not of a mind to
      feign a situation that did not exist, nor to permit him to do so. I gave
      him to understand that tho' I went to him for instruction, 'twas through
      no fault of mine. That I would learn what I pleased and do what pleased
      me. And the rector, a curse upon him, seemed well content with that; nor
      could I come at his devil's reason far wanting me, save for the money, as
      he had declared. There were days when he and I never touched a hook, both
      being out of humour for study, when he told me yarns of Frederick of
      Prussia and his giant guard, of Florence and of Venice, and of the court
      of his Holiness of Rome. For he had drifted about the earth like a log-end
      in the Atlantic, before his Lordship gave him his present berth. We
      passed, too, whole mornings at picquet, I learning enough of Horace to
      quote at the routs we both attended, but a deal more of kings and deuces.
      And as I may add, that he got no more of my money than did I of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wonder of it was that we never became friends. He was two men, this
      rector of St. Anne's, half of him as lovable as any I ever encountered.
      But trust him I never would, always meeting him on the middle ground; and
      there were times, after his talks with Grafton, when his eyes were like a
      cat's, and I was conscious of a sinister note in his dealing which put me
      on my guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will say, my dears, that some change had come over me, that I was no
      longer the same lad I have been telling you of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those days were not these, yet I make no show of hiding or of palliation.
      Was it Dorothy's conduct that drove me? Not wholly. A wild red was ever in
      the Carvel blood, in Captain Jack, in Lionel, in the ancestor of King
      Charles's day, who fought and bled and even gambled for his king. And my
      grandfather knew this; he warned me, but he paid my debts. And I thank
      Heaven he felt that my heart was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was grown now, certainly in stature. And having managed one of the
      largest plantations in the province, I felt the man, as lads are wont
      after their first responsibilities. I commanded my wine at the Coffee
      House with the best of the bucks, and was made a member of the South River
      and Jockey clubs. I wore the clothes that came out to me from London, and
      vied in fashion with Dr. Courtenay and other macaronies. And I drove a
      carriage of mine own, the Carvel arms emblazoned thereon, and Hugo in the
      family livery.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a deal of thought upon the subject, I decided, for a while at least,
      to show no political leanings at all. And this was easier of
      accomplishment than you may believe, for at that time in Maryland Tory and
      Whig were amiable enough, and the young gentlemen of the first families
      dressed alike and talked alike at the parties they both attended. The
      non-importation association had scarce made itself felt in the dress of
      society. Gentlemen of degree discussed differences amicably over their
      decanters. And only on such occasions as Mr. Hood's return, and the
      procession of the Lower House through the streets, and the arrival of the
      Good Intent, did high words arise among the quality. And it was because
      class distinctions were so strongly marked that it took so long to bring
      loyalists and patriots of high rank to the sword's point.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found time to manage such business affairs of Mr. Carvel's as he could
      not attend to himself. Grafton and his family dined in Marlboro' Street
      twice in the week; my uncle's conduct toward me was the very soul of
      consideration, and he compelled that likewise from his wife and his son.
      So circumspect was he that he would have fooled one who knew him a whit
      less than I. He questioned me closely upon my studies, and in my
      grandfather's presence I was forced to answer. And when the rector came to
      dine and read to Mr. Carvel, my uncle catechised him so searchingly on my
      progress that he was pushed to the last source of his ingenuity for
      replies. More than once was I tempted to blurt out the whole wretched
      business, for I well understood there was some deep game between him and
      Grafton. In my uncle's absence, my aunt never lost a chance for an
      ill-natured remark upon Patty, whom she had seen that winter at the
      assemblies and elsewhere. And she deplored the state our people of fashion
      were coming to, that they allowed young girls without family to attend
      their balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can expect little else, father,&rdquo; she would say to Mr. Carvel
      nodding in his chair, &ldquo;when some of our best families openly espouse the
      pernicious doctrines of republicanism. They are gone half mad over that
      Wilkes who should have been hung before this. Philip, dear, pour the wine
      for your grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Patty had been well received. I took her to her first assembly, where
      her simple and unassuming ways had made her an instant favourite; and her
      face, which had the beauty of dignity and repose even so early in life,
      gained her ample attention. I think she would have gone but little had not
      her father laughed her out of some of her domesticity. No longer at Sunday
      night supper in Gloucester Street was the guest seat empty. There was more
      than one guest seat now, and the honest barrister himself was the most
      pleased at the change. As I took my accustomed place on the settle
      cushion,&mdash;Patty's first embroidery,&mdash;he would cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heigho, Richard, our little Miss Prim hath become a belle. And I must
      have another clerk now to copy out my briefs, and a housekeeper soon, i'
      faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Patty would never fail to flush up at the words, and run to perch on her
      father's knee and put her hand over his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you, Mr. Swain?&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;how can you, when 'tis you and
      mother, and Richard here, who make me go into the world? You know I would
      a thousand times rather bake your cakes and clean your silver! But you
      will not hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie!&rdquo; says the barrister. &ldquo;Listen to her, Richard! And yet she will fly
      up the stairs to don a fine gown at the first rap of the knocker. Oh, the
      wenches, the wenches! Are they not all alike, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have changed none since I was a lass,&rdquo; replies the quiet invalid,
      with a smile. &ldquo;And you should know what I was, Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; cries he; &ldquo;none better. Well I recall the salmon and white your
      mother gave you before I came to Salem.&rdquo; He sighed and then laughed at the
      recollection. &ldquo;And when this strapping young Singleton comes, Richard,
      'twould do you good to be hiding there in that cupboard,&mdash;and it
      would hold you,&mdash;and count the seconds until Miss Prim has her skirt
      in her hand and her foot on the lower step. And yet how innocent is she
      now before you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he would invariably be smothered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Percy Singleton!&rdquo; says Patty, with a fine scorn; &ldquo;'twill be Mr. Eglinton,
      the curate, next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This I know,&rdquo; says her father, slapping me on the shoulder, &ldquo;this I know,
      that you are content to see Richard without primping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have known Richard since I was six,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;Richard is one of
      the family. There is no need of disguise from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought, ruefully enough, that it seemed my fate to be one of the family
      everywhere I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just then, as if in judgment, the gate snapped and the knocker
      sounded, and Patty leaped down with a blush. &ldquo;What said I say?&rdquo; cries the
      barrister. &ldquo;I have not seen human nature in court for naught. Run, now,&rdquo;
       says he, pinching her cheek as she stood hesitating whether to fly or
      stay; &ldquo;run and put on the new dress I have bought you. And Richard and I
      will have a cup of ale in the study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor chanced to be Will Fotheringay that time. He was not the only
      one worn out with the mad chase in Prince George Street, and preferred a
      quiet evening with a quiet beauty to the crowded lists of Miss Manners.
      Will declared that the other gallants were fools over the rare touch of
      blue in the black hair: give him Miss Swain's, quoth he, lifting his
      glass,&mdash;hers was; the colour of a new sovereign. Will was not, the
      only one. But I think Percy Singleton was the best of them all, tho' Patty
      ridiculed him&mdash;every chance she got, and even to his face. So will:
      the best-hearted and soberest of women play the coquette. Singleton was
      rather a reserved young Englishman of four and twenty, who owned a large
      estate in Talbot which he was laying out with great success. Of a Whig
      family in the old country, he had been drawn to that party in the new, and
      so, had made Mr. Swain's acquaintance. The next step in his fortunes was
      to fall in love with Patty, which was natural enough. Many a night that
      winter I walked with him from Gloucester Street to the Coffee House, to
      sit an hour over, a battle. And there Master Tom and Dr. Hamilton, and
      other gay macaronies would sometimes join us. Singleton had a greater
      contempt for Tom than I, but bore with him for his sister's sake. For Tom,
      in addition to his other follies, was become an open loyalist, and never
      missed his Majesty's health, though he knew no better than my Hugo the
      question at issue. 'Twas not zeal for King George, however, that made him
      drunk at one of the assemblies, and forced his sister to leave in the
      midst of a dance for very shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Richard, is, there not something you can do?&rdquo; she cried, when, I had
      got her back in the little parlour in Gloucester Street; &ldquo;father has
      argued and, pleaded and threatened in vain. I thought,&mdash;I thought
      perhaps you might help him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am not one to preach, or to boast,&rdquo; I replied soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, looking grave; &ldquo;I know you are wilder than you used to
      be; that you play more than you ought, and higher than you ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suspect at whose door it lies,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis in the blood, Patty,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at me quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you better than you think,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But Tom has not your
      excuse. And if he had only your faults I would say nothing. He does not
      care for those he should, and he is forever in the green-room of the
      theatre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made haste to change the subject, and to give her what comfort I might;
      for she was sobbing before she finished. And the next day I gave Tom a
      round talking-to for having so little regard for his sister, the hem of
      whose skirt he was not worthy to touch. He took it meekly enough, with a
      barrel of pat excuses to come after. And he asked me to lend him my
      phaeton, that he might go a-driving with Miss Crane, of the theatrical
      company, to Round Bay!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile I saw Miss Manners more frequently than was good for my peace of
      mind, and had my turn as her partner at the balls. But I could not bring
      myself to take third or fourth rank in the army that attended her. I, who
      had been her playmate, would not become her courtier. Besides, I had not
      the wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it strange that Dr. Courtenay should pride himself upon the discovery
      of a new beauty? And in the Coffee House, and in every drawing-room in
      town, prophesy for her a career of conquest such as few could boast? She
      was already launched upon that career. And rumour had it that Mr.
      Marmaduke was even then considering taking her home to London, where the
      stage was larger and the triumph greater. Was it surprising that the
      Gazette should contain a poem with the doctor's well-known ear-marks upon
      it? It set the town a-wagging, and left no room for doubt as to who had
      inspired it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Sweet Pandora, tho' formed of Clay,
        Was fairer than the Light of Day.
        By Venus learned in Beauty's Arts,
        And destined thus to conquer Hearts.
        A Goddess of this Town, I ween,
        Fair as Pandora, scarce Sixteen,
        Is destined, e'en by Jove's Command,
        To conquer all of Maryland.
        Oh, Bachelors, play have a Care,
        For She will all your Hearts ensnare.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      So it ran. I think, if dear Mrs. Manners could have had her way, Dolly
      would have passed that year at a certain young ladies' school in New York.
      But Mr. Marmaduke's pride in his daughter's beauty got the better of her.
      The strut in his gait became more marked the day that poem appeared, and
      he went to the Coffee House both morning and evening, taking snuff to hide
      his emotions when Miss Manners was spoken of; and he was perceived by many
      in Church Street arm in arm with Dr. Courtenay himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you may have imagined before now, the doctor's profession was leisure,
      not medicine. He had known ambition once, it was said, and with reason,
      for he had studied surgery in Germany for the mere love of the science.
      After which, making the grand tour in France and Italy, he had taken up
      that art of being a gentleman in which men became so proficient in my
      young days. He had learned to speak French like a Parisian, had hobnobbed
      with wit and wickedness from Versailles to Rome, and then had come back to
      Annapolis to set the fashions and to spend the fortune his uncle lately
      had left him. He was our censor of beauty, and passed judgment upon all
      young ladies as they stepped into the arena. To be noticed by him meant
      success; to be honoured in the Gazette was to be crowned at once a
      reigning belle. The chord of his approval once set a-vibrating, all minor
      chords sang in harmony. And it was the doctor who raised the first public
      toast to Miss Manners. Alas! I might have known it would be so!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Dorothy was not of a nature to remain dependent upon a censor's
      favour. The minx deported herself like any London belle of experience, as
      tho' she had known the world from her cradle. She was not to be deceived
      by the face value of the ladies' praises, nor rebuffed unmercifully by my
      Aunt Caroline, who had held the sceptre in the absence of a younger
      aspirant. The first time these ladies clashed, which was not long in
      coming, my aunt met with a wit as sharp again as her own, and never
      afterwards essayed an open tilt. The homage of men Dolly took as Caesar
      received tribute, as a matter of course. The doctor himself rode to the
      races beside the Manners coach, leaning gallantly over the door. My lady
      held court in her father's box, received and dismissed, smiled and
      frowned, with Courtenay as her master of ceremonies. Mr. Dulany was one of
      the presidents of the Jockey Club that year, and his horse winning the
      honours he presented her with his colours, scarlet and white, which she
      graciously wore. The doctor swore he would import a horse the next season
      on the chance of the privilege. My aunt was furious. I have never
      mentioned her beauty because I never could see it. 'Twas a coarser type
      than attracted me. She was then not greatly above six and thirty,
      appearing young for that age, and she knew the value of lead in judicious
      quantity. At that meet gentlemen came to her box only to tally of Miss
      Manners, to marvel that one so young could have the 'bel air', to praise
      her beauty and addresse, or to remark how well Mr. Durlany's red and white
      became her. With all of which Mrs. Grafton was fain to agree, and must
      even excel, until her small stock of patience was exhausted. To add to her
      chagrin my aunt lost a pretty sum to the rector by Mr. Dulany's horse. I
      came upon her after the race trying to coax her head-dress, through her
      coach door, Mr. Allen having tight hold of her hand the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so he thinks he has found a divinity, does: he?&rdquo; I overheard her
      saying: &ldquo;I, for one, am heartily sick of Dr. Courtenay's motions. Were he,
      to choose, a wench out of the King's passengers I'd warrant our macaronies
      to compose odes to her eyebrows.&rdquo; And at that moment perceiving me she
      added, &ldquo;Why so disconsolate, my dear nephew? Miss Dolly is the craze now,
      and will last about as long as another of the doctor's whims. And then you
      shall have her to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty woman is ever the fashion, Aunt Caroline,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoity-toity,&rdquo; returned my aunt, who had by then succeeded in getting her
      head-gear safe within; &ldquo;the fashion, yes until a prettier comes along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is small danger of that for the present,&rdquo; I said, smiling: &ldquo;Surely
      you can find no fault with this choice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gadzooks! If I were blind, sir, I think I might!&rdquo; she cried unguardedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not dispute that, Aunt Caroline,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as I rode off I heard her giving directions in no mild tone to the
      coachman through Mr. Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perchance you did not know, my dears, that Annapolis had the first theatre
      in all the colonies. And if you care to search through the heap of
      Maryland Gazettes in the garret, I make no doubt you will come across this
      announcement for a certain night in the spring of the year 1769:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       By Permission of his Excellency, the Governor,
          at the New Theatre in Annapolis,
      by the American Company of Comedians, on Monday
    next, being the 22nd of this Instant, will be performed

              ROMEO AND JULIET.

      (Romeo by a young Gentleman for his Diversion.)
            Likewise the Farce called

              MISS IN HER TEENS.

      To begin precisely at Seven of the Clock. Tickets
    to be had at the Printing Office. Box 10s. Pit 1s 6d.
       No Person to be admitted behind the Scenes.
</pre>
    <p>
      The gentleman to perform Romeo was none other than Dr. Courtenay himself.
      He had a gentlemanly passion for the stage, as was the fashion in those
      days, and had organized many private theatricals. The town was in a
      ferment over the event, boxes being taken a week ahead. The doctor himself
      writ the epilogue, to be recited by the beautiful Mrs. Hallam, who had
      inspired him the year before to compose that famous poem beginning:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Around her see the Graces play,
          See Venus' Wanton doves,
          And in her Eye's Pellucid Ray
          See little Laughing Loves.
          Ye gods! 'Tis Cytherea's Face.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      You may find that likewise in Mr. Green's newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new theatre was finished in West Street that spring, the old one
      having proven too small for our gay capital. 'Twas then the best in the
      New World, the censor having pronounced it far above any provincial
      playhouse he had seen abroad. The scenes were very fine, the boxes carved
      and gilded in excellent good taste, and both pit and gallery commodious.
      And we, too, had our &ldquo;Fops' Alley,&rdquo; where our macaronies ogled the fair
      and passed from box to box.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that night of nights when the doctor acted I received an invitation
      from Dolly to Mr. Marmaduke's box, and to supper afterward in Prince
      George Street. When I arrived, the playhouse was lit with myriad candles,&mdash;to
      be snuffed save the footlights presently,&mdash;and the tiers were all
      brilliant with the costumes of ladies and gentlemen. Miss Tayloe and Miss
      Dulany were of our party, with Fitzhugh and Worthington, and Mr. Manners
      for propriety. The little fop spent his evening, by the way, in a box
      opposite, where my Aunt Caroline gabbled to him and Mr. Allen during the
      whole performance. My lady got more looks than any in the house. She
      always drew admiration; indeed, but there had been much speculation of
      late whether she favoured Dr. Courtenay or Fitzhugh, and some had it that
      the doctor's acting would decide between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Romeo came upon the stage he was received with loud applause. But my
      lady showed no interest,&mdash;not she, while the doctor fervently
      recited, &ldquo;Out of her favour, where I am in love.&rdquo; In the first orchard
      scene, with the boldness of a practised lover, he almost ignored Mrs.
      Hallam in the balcony. It seemed as though he cast his burning words and
      languishing glances at my lady in the box, whereupon there was a deal of
      nudging round about. Miss asked for her smelling salts, and declared the
      place was stifling. But I think if the doctor had cherished a hope of her
      affections he lost it when he arrived at the lines, &ldquo;She speaks, yet she
      says nothing.&rdquo; At that unhappy moment Miss Dorothy was deep in
      conversation with Fitzhugh, the audible titter in the audience arousing
      her. How she reddened when she perceived the faces turned her way!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it, Betty?&rdquo; she demanded quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Betty was not spiteful, and would not tell. Fitzhugh himself
      explained, and to his sorrow, for during the rest of the evening she would
      have nothing to do with him. Presently she turned to me. Glancing upward
      to where Patty leaned on the rail between Will Fotheringay and Singleton,
      she whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you can sit here so quiet, Richard. You are showing a deal of
      self-denial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy enough,&rdquo; I answered, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you have a rival,&rdquo; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I have a dozen,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Percy Singleton walking with her in Mr. Galloway's fields but
      yesterday,&rdquo; said Dolly, &ldquo;and as they came out upon the road they looked as
      guilty as if I had surprised them arm in arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that she should think I cared for Patty never entered my head. I was
      thrown all in a heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not be so disturbed,&rdquo; whispers my lady. &ldquo;Singleton has a crooked
      mouth, and I credit Patty with ample sense to choose between you. I adore
      her, Richard. I wish I had her sweet ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I interrupted, when I was somewhat recovered, &ldquo;why should you think
      me in love with Patty? I have never been accused of that before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fie! You deny her?&rdquo; says Dolly. &ldquo;I did not think that of you,
      Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should know better,&rdquo; I replied, with some bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were talking in low tones, Dolly with her head turned from the stage,
      whence the doctor was flinging his impassioned speeches in vain. And
      though the light fell not upon her face, I seemed to feel her looking me
      through and through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not care for Patty?&rdquo; she whispered. And I thought a quiver of
      earnestness was in her voice. Her face was so close to mine that her
      breath fanned my cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why do you ask me? Have I ever been one to make pretences?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you,&rdquo; I said, bending to her ear, &ldquo;is it Fitzhugh, Dorothy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard her laugh softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I thought you might divine, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible? And yet she had played so much with me that I dared not
      risk the fire. She had too many accomplished gallants at her feet to think
      of Richard, who had no novelty and no wit. I sat still, barely conscious
      of the rising and falling voices beyond the footlights, feeling only her
      living presence at my side. She spoke not another word until the playhouse
      servants had relighted the chandeliers, and Dr. Courtenay came in, flushed
      with triumph, for his mead of praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how went it, Miss Manners?&rdquo; says he, very confident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you fell over the orchard wall, doctor,&rdquo; retorts my lady. &ldquo;La! I
      believe I could have climbed it better myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And all he got was a hearty laugh for his pains, Mr. Marmaduke joining in
      from the back of the box. And the story was at the Coffee House early on
      the morrow.

      CHAPTER XI. A FESTIVAL AND A PARTING
    </h2>
    <p>
      My grandfather and I were seated at table together. It was early June, the
      birds were singing in the garden, and the sweet odours of the flowers were
      wafted into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; says he, when Scipio had poured his claret, &ldquo;my illness cheated
      you out of your festival last year. I dare swear you deem yourself too old
      for birthdays now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is with lads,&rdquo; said Mr. Carvel; &ldquo;they will rush into manhood as
      heedless as you please. Take my counsel, boy, and remain young. Do not
      cross the bridge before you have to. And I have been thinking that we
      shall have your fete this year, albeit you are grown, and Miss Dolly is
      the belle of the province. 'Tis like sunshine into my old heart to see the
      lads and lasses again, and to hear the merry, merry fiddling. I will have
      his new Excellency, who seems a good and a kindly man, and Lloyd and
      Tilghman and Dulany and the rest, with their ladies, to sit with me. And
      there will be plenty of punch and syllabub and sangaree, I warrant; and
      tarts and jellies and custards, too, for the misses. Ring for Mrs. Willis,
      my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willis came with her curtsey to the old gentleman, who gave his order then
      and there. He never waited for a fancy of this kind to grow cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall all be children again, on that day, Mrs. Willis,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;And
      I catch any old people about, they shall be thrust straight in the town
      stocks, i' faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willis made another curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We missed it sorely, last year, please your honour,&rdquo; says she, and
      departs smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you shall have your Patty Swain, Richard,&rdquo; Mr. Carvel continued. &ldquo;Do
      you mind how you once asked the favour of inviting her in the place of a
      present? Oons! I loved you for that, boy. 'Twas like a Carvel. And I love
      that lass, Whig or no Whig. 'Pon my soul, I do. She hath demureness and
      dignity, and suits me better than yon whimsical baggage you are all mad
      over. I'll have Mr. Swain beside me, too. I'll warrant I'd teach his
      daughter loyalty in a day, and I had again your years and your spirit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have but to close my eyes, and my fancy takes me back to that birthday
      festival. Think of it, my dears! Near threescore years are gone since
      then, when this old man you call grandfather, and some&mdash;bless me!&mdash;great-grandfather,
      was a lusty lad like Comyn here. But his hand is steady as he writes these
      words and his head clear, because he hath not greatly disabused that life
      which God has given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can I, tho' her face and form are painted on my memory, tell you what
      fair, pert Miss Dorothy was at that time'! Ay, I know what you would say:
      that Sir Joshua's portrait hangs above, executed but the year after, and
      hung at the second exhibition of the Royal Academy. As I look upon it now,
      I say that no whit of its colour is overcharged. And there is likewise Mr.
      Peale's portrait, done much later. I answer that these great masters have
      accomplished what poor, human art can do. But Nature hath given us a
      better picture. &ldquo;Come hither, Bess! Yes, truly, you have Dolly's hair,
      with the very gloss upon it. But fashions have changed, my child, and that
      is not as Dolly wore it.&rdquo; Whereupon Bess goes to the portrait, and
      presently comes back to give me a start. And then we go hand in hand up
      the stairs of Calvert House even to the garret, where an old cedar chest
      is laid away under the eaves. Bess, the minx, well knows it, and takes out
      a prim little gown with the white fading yellow, and white silk mits
      without fingers, and white stockings with clocks, and a gauze cap, with
      wings and streamers, that sits saucily on the black locks; and the
      lawn-embroidered apron; and such dainty, high-heeled slippers with the
      pearls still a-glisten upon the buckles. Away she flies to put them on.
      And then my heart gives a leap to see my Dorothy back again,&mdash;back
      again as she was that June afternoon we went together to my last birthday
      party, her girlish arms bare to the elbow, and the lace about her slender
      throat. Yes, Bess hath the very tilt of her chin, the regal grace of that
      slim figure, and the deep blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandfather, dear, you are crushing the gown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the fire is not yet gone out of this old frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, yes, there they are again, those unpaved streets of old Annapolis
      arched with great trees on either side. And here is Dolly, holding her
      skirt in one hand and her fan in the other, and I in a brave blue coat,
      and pumps with gold buttons, and a cocked hat of the newest fashion. I had
      met her leaning over the gate in Prince George Street. And, what was
      strange for her, so deep in thought that she jumped when I spoke her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy, I have come for you to walk to the party, as we used when we
      were children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As we used when we were children!&rdquo; cried she. And flinging wide the gate,
      stretched out her hand for me to take. &ldquo;And you are eighteen years to-day!
      It seems but last year when we skipped hand in hand to Marlboro' Street
      with Mammy Lucy behind us. Are you coming, mammy?&rdquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mistis, I'se comin',&rdquo; said a voice from behind the golden-rose
      bushes, and out stepped Aunt Lucy in a new turban, making a curtsey to me.
      &ldquo;La, Marse Richard!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to think you'se growed to be a fine
      gemman! 'Taint but t'other day you was kissin' Miss Dolly on de
      plantation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems longer than that to me, Aunt Lucy,&rdquo; I answered, laughing at
      Dolly's blushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have too good a memory, mammy,&rdquo; said my lady, withdrawing her fingers
      from mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bress you, honey! De ole woman doan't forgit some things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she fell back to a respectful six paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those were happy times,&rdquo; said Dorothy. Then the little sigh became a
      laugh. &ldquo;I mean to enjoy myself to-day, Richard. But I fear I shall not see
      as much of you as I used. You are old enough to play the host, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see as much as you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been of late, sir? In Gloucester Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis your own fault, Dolly. You are changeable as the sky,&mdash;to-day
      sunny, and to-morrow cold. I am sure of my welcome in Gloucester Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tripped a step as we turned the corner, and came closer to my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must learn to take me as you find me, dear Richard. To-day I am in a
      holiday humour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some odd note in her tone troubled me, and I glanced at her quickly. She
      was a constant wonder and puzzle to me. After that night at the theatre my
      hopes had risen for the hundredth time, but I had gone to Prince George
      Street on the morrow to meet another rebuff&mdash;and Fitzhugh. So I had
      learned to interpret her by other means than words, and now her mood
      seemed reckless rather than merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not happy, Dolly?&rdquo; I asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;What a silly question!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I believe you are not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In surprise she looked up at me, and then down at the pearls upon her
      satin slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going with you to your birthday festival, Richard. Could we wish for
      more? I am as happy as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may well be, for I might be happier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again her eyes met mine, and she hummed an air. So we came to the gate,
      beside which stood Diomedes and Hugo in the family claret-red. A coach was
      drawn up, and another behind it, and we went down the leafy walk in the
      midst of a bevy of guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no such places nowadays, my dears, as was my grandfather's. The
      ground between the street and the brick wall in the rear was a great
      stretch, as ample in acreage as many a small country-place we have in
      these times. The house was on the high land in front, hedged in by old
      trees, and thence you descended by stately tiers until you came to the
      level which held the dancers. Beyond that, and lower still, a lilied pond
      widened out of the sluggish brook with a cool and rustic spring-house at
      one end. The spring-house was thatched, with windows looking out upon the
      water. Long after, when I went to France, I was reminded of the shy beauty
      of this part of my old home by the secluded pond of the Little Trianon. So
      was it that King Louis's Versailles had spread its influence a thousand
      leagues to our youthful continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather sat in his great chair on the sward beside the fiddlers,
      his old friends gathering around him, as in former years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is the miss that hath already broken half the bachelor hearts in
      town!&rdquo; said he, gayly. &ldquo;What was my prediction, Miss Dolly, when you
      stepped your first dance at Carvel Hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, you do me wrong, Mr. Carvel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I were a buck, you would not break mine, I warrant, unless it were
      tit for tat,&rdquo; said my grandfather; thereby putting me to more confusion
      than Dolly, who laughed with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis well to boast, Mr. Carvel, when we are out of the battle,&rdquo; cried Mr.
      Lloyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly was carried off immediately, as I expected. The doctor and
      Worthington and Fitzhugh were already there, and waiting. I stood by Mr.
      Carvel's chair, receiving the guests, and presently came Mr. Swain and
      Patty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heigho!&rdquo; called Mr. Carvel, when he saw her; &ldquo;here is the young lady that
      hath my old affections. You are right welcome, Mr. Swain. Scipio, another
      chair! 'Tis not over the wall any more, Miss Patty, with our flowered
      India silk. But I vow I love you best with your etui.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Patty, too, was carried off, for you may be sure that Will Fotheringay and
      Singleton were standing on one foot and then the other, waiting for Mr.
      Carvel to have done. Next arrived my aunt, in a wide calash and a wider
      hoop, her stays laced so that she limped, and her hair wonderfully and
      fearfully arranged by her Frenchman. Neither she nor Grafton was slow to
      shower congratulations upon my grandfather and myself. Mr. Marmaduke went
      through the ceremony after them. Dorothy's mother drew me aside. As long
      as I could remember her face had been one that revealed a life's
      disappointment. But to-day I thought it bore a trace of a deeper anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How well I recall this day, eighteen years ago, Richard,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And
      how proud your dear mother was that she had given a son to Captain Jack.
      She had prayed for a son. I hope you will always do your parents credit,
      my dear boy. They were both dear, dear friends of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Aunt Caroline's harsher voice interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gadzooks, ma'am!&rdquo; she cried, as she approached us, &ldquo;I have never in my
      life laid eyes upon such beauty as your daughter's. You will have to take
      her home, Mrs. Manners, to do her justice. You owe it her, ma'am. Come,
      nephew, off with you, and head the minuet with Miss Dolly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather was giving the word to the fiddlers. But whether a desire
      to cross my aunt held me back, or a sense of duty to greet the guests not
      already come, or a vague intuition of some impending news drawn from Mrs.
      Manners and Dorothy, I know not. Mr. Fitzhugh was easily persuaded to take
      my place, and presently I slipped unnoticed into a shaded seat on the side
      of the upper terrace, whence I could see the changing figures on the
      green. And I thought of the birthday festivals Dolly and I had spent here,
      almost since we were of an age to walk. Wet June days, when the broad
      wings of the house rang with the sound of silver laughter and pattering
      feet, and echoed with music from the hall; and merry June days, when the
      laughter rippled among the lilacs, and pansies and poppies and sweet peas
      were outshone by bright gowns and brighter faces. And then, as if to
      complete the picture of the past, my eye fell upon our mammies modestly
      seated behind the group of older people, Aunt Hester and Aunt Lucy, their
      honest, black faces aglow with such unselfish enjoyment as they alone
      could feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      How easily I marked Dorothy among the throng!
    </p>
    <p>
      Other girls found it hard to compress the spirits of youth within the
      dignity of a minuet, and thought of the childish romp of former years. Not
      so my lady. Long afterwards I saw her lead a ball with the first soldier
      and gentleman of the land, but on that Tuesday she carried herself full as
      well, so well that his Excellency and the gentlemen about him applauded
      heartily. As the strains died away and the couples moved off among the
      privet-lined paths, I went slowly down the terrace. Dorothy had come up to
      speak to her mother, Dr. Courtenay lingering impatient at her side. And
      though her colour glowed deeper, and the wind had loosed a wisp of her
      hair, she took his Excellency's compliments undisturbed. Colonel Sharpe,
      our former governor, who now made his home in the province, sat beside
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now where a-deuce were you, Richard?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You have missed as
      pleasing a sight as comes to a man in a lifetime. Why were you not here to
      see Miss Manners tread a minuet? My word! Terpsichore herself could scarce
      have made it go better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the dance, sir, from a safe distance,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll warrant!&rdquo; said he, laughing, while Dolly shot me a wayward glance
      from under her long lashes. &ldquo;I'll warrant your eyes were fast on her from
      beginning to end. Come, sir, confess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His big frame shook with the fun of it, for none in the colony could be
      jollier than he on holiday occasions: and the group of ladies and
      gentlemen beside him caught the infection, so that I was sore put to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your Excellency confess likewise?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I will, Richard, and make patent to all the world that she hath the
      remains of that shuttlecock, my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up gets his Excellency (for so we still called him) and makes Dolly a low
      reverence, kissing the tips of her white fingers. My lady drops a mock
      curtsey in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency can do no less than sue for a dance,&rdquo; drawled Dr.
      Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no more, I fear, sir, not being so nimble as I once was. I resign in
      your favour, doctor,&rdquo; said Colonel Sharpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Courtenay made his bow, his hat tucked under his arm. But he had much
      to learn of Miss Manners if he thought that even one who had been governor
      of the province could command her. The music was just begun again, and I
      making off in the direction of Patty Swain, when I was brought up as
      suddenly as by a rope. A curl was upon Dorothy's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dance belongs to Richard, doctor,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, Courtenay, there you have a buffer!&rdquo; cried Colonel Sharpe, as the
      much-discomfited doctor bowed with a very ill grace; while I, in no small
      bewilderment, walked off with Dorothy. And a parting shot of the delighted
      colonel brought the crimson to my face. Like the wind or April weather was
      my lady, and her ways far beyond such a great simpleton as I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am ever forced to ask you to dance!&rdquo; said Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you about, moping off alone, with a party in your honour, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was watching you, as I told his Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fie!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Why don't you assert yourself, Richard? There was a
      time when you gave me no peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then you rebuked me for dangling,&rdquo; I retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up started the music, the fiddlers bending over their bows with flushed
      faces, having dipped into the cool punch in the interval. Away flung my
      lady to meet Singleton, while I swung Patty, who squeezed my hand in
      return. And soon we were in the heat of it,&mdash;sober minuet no longer,
      but romp and riot, the screams of the lasses a-mingle with our own
      laughter, as we spun them until they were dizzy. My brain was a-whirl as
      well, and presently I awoke to find Dolly pinching my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten me, Richard?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;My other hand, sir. It
      is I down the middle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down we flew between the laughing lines, Dolly tripping with her head
      high, and then back under the clasped hands in the midst of a fire of
      raillery. Then the music stopped. Some strange exhilaration was in
      Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the place where I used to play fairy godmother, and wind
      the flowers into my hair?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      What need to ask?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she commanded decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart!&rdquo; I exclaimed, wondering at this new caprice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we can but slip away unnoticed, they will never find us there,&rdquo; she
      said. And led the way herself, silent. At length we came to the damp shade
      where the brook dived under the corner of the wall. I stooped to gather
      the lilies of the valley, and she wove them into her hair as of old.
      Suddenly she stopped, the bunch poised in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you miss me if I went away, Richard?&rdquo; she asked, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Dolly?&rdquo; I cried, my voice failing. &ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would miss you, and sorely, tho' you give me trouble enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon I shall not be here to trouble you, Richard. Papa has decided that
      we sail next week, on the Annapolis, for home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home!&rdquo; I gasped. &ldquo;England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to make my bow to royalty,&rdquo; replied she, dropping a deep
      curtsey. &ldquo;Your Majesty, this is Miss Manners, of the province of
      Maryland!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But next week!&rdquo; I repeated, with a blank face. &ldquo;Surely you cannot be
      ready for the Annapolis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;McAndrews has instructions to send our things after,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;There!
      You are the first person I have told. You should feel honoured, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat down upon the grass by the brook, and for the moment the sap of life
      seemed to have left me. Dolly continued to twine the flowers. Through the
      trees sifted the voices and the music, sounds of happiness far away. When
      I looked up again, she was gazing into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you glad to go?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered the minx, readily. &ldquo;I shall see the world, and meet
      people of consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are going to England to meet people of consequence!&rdquo; I cried
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How provincial you are, Richard! What people of consequence have we here?
      The Governor and the honourable members of his Council, forsooth! There is
      not a title save his Excellency's in our whole colony, and Virginia is
      scarce better provided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of my feeling I was fain to laugh at this, knowing well that she
      had culled it all from little Mr. Marmaduke himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;We shall have no lack of noted men
      presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mere two-penny heroes,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I know your great men, such as Mr.
      Henry and Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began pulling up the grass savagely by the roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll lay a hundred guineas you have no regrets at leaving any of us, my
      fine miss!&rdquo; I cried, getting to my feet. &ldquo;You would rather be a lady of
      fashion than have the love of an honest man,&mdash;you who have the hearts
      of too many as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes lighted, but with mirth. Laughing, she chose a little bunch of
      the lilies and worked them into my coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, you silly goose!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I dote upon seeing you in a
      temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stood between anger and God knows what other feelings, now starting
      away, now coming back to her. But I always came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have ever said you would marry an earl, Dolly,&rdquo; I said sadly. &ldquo;I
      believe you do not care for any of us one little bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away, so that for the moment I could not see her face, then
      looked at me with exquisite archness over her shoulder. The low tones of
      her voice were of a richness indescribable. 'Twas seldom she made use of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be coming to Oxford, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear not, Dolly,&rdquo; I replied soberly. &ldquo;I fear not, now. Mr. Carvel is
      too feeble for me to leave him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that she turned to me, another mood coming like a gust of wind on the
      Chesapeake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how I wish they were all like you!&rdquo; she cried, with a stamp of her
      foot. &ldquo;Sometimes I despise gallantry. I hate the smooth compliments of
      your macaronies. I thank Heaven you are big and honest and clumsy and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what, Dorothy?&rdquo; I asked, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And stupid,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Now take me back, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had not gone thirty paces before we heard a hearty bass voice singing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;'It was a lover and his lass,
        With a hey, with a ho, with a hey nonino.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And there was Colonel Sharpe, straying along among the privet hedges.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the morning of her sailing came, so full of sadness for me. Why not
      confess, after nigh threescore years, that break of day found me pacing
      the deserted dock. At my back, across the open space, was the irregular
      line of quaint, top-heavy shops since passed away, their sightless windows
      barred by solid shutters of oak. The good ship Annapolis, which was to
      carry my playmate to broader scenes, lay among the shipping, in the gray
      roads just quickening with returning light. How my heart ached that
      morning none shall ever know. But, as the sun shot a burning line across
      the water, a new salt breeze sprang up and fanned a hope into flame. 'Twas
      the very breeze that was to blow Dorothy down the bay. Sleepy apprentices
      took down the shutters, and polished the windows until they shone again;
      and chipper Mr. Denton Jacques, who did such a thriving business opposite,
      presently appeared to wish me a bright good morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that Captain Waring proposed to sail at ten of the clock; but after
      breakfasting, I was of two minds whether to see the last of Miss Dorothy,
      foreseeing a levee in her honour upon the ship. And so it proved. I had
      scarce set out in a pungy from the dock, when I perceived a dozen boats
      about the packet; and when I thrust my shoulders through the gangway,
      there was the company gathered at the mainmast. They made a gay bit of
      colour,&mdash;Dr. Courtenay in a green coat laced with fine Mechlin,
      Fitzhugh in claret and silk stockings of a Quaker gray, and the other
      gentlemen as smartly drest. The Dulany girls and the Fotheringay girls,
      and I know not how many others, were there to see their friend off for
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of them was Dorothy, in a crimson silk capuchin, for we had
      had one of our changes of weather. It was she who spied me as I was
      drawing down the ladder again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Richard!&rdquo; I heard her cry. &ldquo;He has come at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gripped the rope tightly, sprang to the deck, and faced her as she came
      out of the group, her lips parted, and the red of her cheeks vying with
      the hood she wore. I took her hand silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had given you over, Richard,&rdquo; she said, her eyes looking reproachfully
      into mine. &ldquo;Another ten minutes, and I should not have seen you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the topsails were already off the caps, the captain on deck, and
      the men gathered at the capstan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not enough to wish you good-by, Dolly?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be a score of them,&rdquo; said my lady, making a face. &ldquo;But I wish
      to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marmaduke, however, had no notion of allowing a gathering in his
      daughter's honour to be broken up. It had been wickedly said of him, when
      the news of his coming departure got around, that he feared Dorothy would
      fall in love with some provincial beau before he could get her within
      reach of a title. When he observed me talking to her, he hurried away from
      the friends come to see his wife (he had none himself), and seizing me by
      the arm implored me to take good care of my dear grandfather, and to write
      them occasionally of the state of his health, and likewise how I fared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Dorothy will miss you more than any of them, Richard,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;Will you not, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she was gone. I, too, left him without ceremony, to speak to Mrs.
      Manners, who was standing apart, looking shoreward. She started when I
      spoke, and I saw that tears were in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming back soon, Mrs. Manners?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Richard! I don't know,&rdquo; she answered, with a little choke in her
      voice. &ldquo;I hope it will be no longer than a year, for we are leaving all we
      hold dear for a very doubtful pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bade me write to them, as Mr. Marmaduke had, only she was sincere.
      Then the mate came, with his hand to his cap, respectfully to inform
      visitors that the anchor was up and down. Albeit my spirits were low,
      'twas no small entertainment to watch the doctor and his rivals at their
      adieus. Courtenay had at his command an hundred subterfuges to outwit his
      fellows, and so manoeuvred that he was the last of them over the side. As
      for me, luckily, I was not worth a thought. But as the doctor leaned over
      her hand, I vowed in my heart that if Dorothy was to be gained only in
      such a way I would not stoop to it. And in my heart I doubted it. I heard
      Dr. Courtenay hint, looking meaningly at her cloak, that some of his
      flowers would not have appeared amiss there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, doctor,&rdquo; says my lady aloud, with a side glance at me, &ldquo;the wisdom
      of Solomon might not choose out of twenty baskets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this was all the thanks he got for near a boat-load of roses! When at
      length the impatient mate had hurried him off, Dolly turned to me. It was
      not in me to say more than:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Dorothy. And do not forget your old playmate. He will never
      forget you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stood within the gangway. With a quick movement she threw open her
      cloak, and pinned to her gown I saw a faded bunch of lilies of the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had but the time to press her hand. The boatswain's pipe whistled, and
      the big ship was already sliding in the water as I leaped into my pungy,
      which Hugo was holding to the ladder. We pulled off to where the others
      waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Annapolis sailed away down the bay, and never another glimpse we
      caught of my lady.

      CHAPTER XII. NEWS FROM A FAR COUNTRY
    </h2>
    <p>
      If perchance, my dears, there creeps into this chronicle too much of an
      old man's heart, I know he will be forgiven. What life ever worth living
      has been without its tender attachment? Because, forsooth, my hair is
      white now, does Bess flatter herself I do not know her secret? Or does
      Comyn believe that these old eyes can see no farther than the spectacles
      before them? Were it not for the lovers, my son, satins and broadcloths
      had never been invented. And were it not for the lovers, what joys and
      sorrows would we lack in our lives!
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a long summer indeed. And tho' Wilmot House was closed, I often
      rode over of a morning when the dew was on the grass. It cheered me to
      smoke a pipe with old McAndrews, Mr. Manners's factor, who loved to talk
      of Miss Dorothy near as much as I. He had served her grandfather, and
      people said that had it not been for McAndrews, the Manners fortune had
      long since been scattered, since Mr. Marmaduke knew nothing of anything
      that he should. I could not hear from my lady until near the first of
      October, and so I was fain to be content with memories&mdash;memories and
      hard work. For I had complete charge of the plantation now.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Uncle Grafton came twice or thrice, but without his family, Aunt
      Caroline and Philip having declared their independence. My uncle's manner
      to me was now of studied kindness, and he was at greater pains than before
      to give me no excuse for offence. I had little to say to him. He spent his
      visits reading to Mr. Carvel, who sat in his chair all the day long. Mr.
      Allen came likewise, to perform the same office.
    </p>
    <p>
      My contempt for the rector was grown more than ever. On my grandfather's
      account, however, I refrained from quarrelling with him. And, when we were
      alone, my plain speaking did not seem to anger him, or affect him in any
      way. Others came, too. Such was the affection Mr. Carvel's friends bore
      him that they did not desert him when he was no longer the companion he
      had been in former years. We had more company than the summer before.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the autumn a strange thing happened. When we had taken my grandfather
      to the Hall in June, his dotage seemed to settle upon him. He became a
      trembling old man, at times so peevish that we were obliged to summon with
      an effort what he had been. He was suspicious and fault-finding with
      Scipio and the other servants, though they were never so busy for his
      wants. Mrs. Willis's dainties were often untouched, and he would
      frequently sit for hours between slumber and waking, or mumble to himself
      as I read the prints. But about the time of the equinoctial a great gale
      came out of the south so strongly that the water rose in the river over
      the boat landing; and the roof was torn from one of the curing-sheds. The
      next morning dawned clear, and brittle, and blue. To my great surprise,
      Mr. Carvel sent for me to walk with him about the place, that he might see
      the damage with his own eyes. A huge walnut had fallen across the drive,
      and when he came upon it he stopped abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old friend!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;have you succumbed? After all these years have
      you dropped from the weight of a blow?&rdquo; He passed his hand caressingly
      along the trunk, and scarce ever had I seen him so affected. In truth, for
      the instant I thought him deranged. He raised his cane above his shoulder
      and struck the bark so heavily that the silver head sunk deep into the
      wood. &ldquo;Look you, Richard,&rdquo; he said, the water coming into his eyes, &ldquo;look
      you, the heart of it is gone, lad; and when the heart is rotten 'tis time
      for us to go. That walnut was a life friend, my son. We have grown
      together,&rdquo; he continued, turning from me to the giant and brushing his
      cheeks, &ldquo;but by God's good will we shall not die so, for my heart is still
      as young as the days when you were sprouting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he walked back to the house more briskly than he had come, refusing,
      for the first time, my arm. And from that day, I say, he began to mend.
      The lacing of red came again to his cheeks, and before we went back to
      town he had walked with me to Master Dingley's tavern on the highroad, and
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      We moved into Marlboro' Street the first part of November. I had seen my
      lady off for England, wearing my faded flowers, the panniers of the fine
      gentleman in a neglected pile at her cabin door. But not once had she
      deigned to write me. It was McAndrews who told me of her safe arrival. In
      Annapolis rumours were a-flying of conquests she had already made. I found
      Betty Tayloe had had a letter, filled with the fashion in caps and gowns,
      and the mention of more than one noble name. All of this being, for
      unknown reasons, sacred, I was read only part of the postscript, in which
      I figured: &ldquo;The London Season was done almost before we arrived,&rdquo; so it
      ran. &ldquo;We had but the Opportunity to pay our Humble Respects to their
      Majesties; and appear at a few Drum-Majors and Garden Fetes. Now we are
      off to Brighthelmstone, and thence, so Papa says, to Spa and the Continent
      until the end of January. I am pining for news of Maryland, dearest Betty.
      Address me in care of Mr. Ripley, Barrister, of Lincoln's Inn, and bid
      Richard Carvel write me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which does not look as if she were coming back within the year,&rdquo; said
      Betty, as she poured me a dish of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, no! But I did not write. I tried and failed. And then I tried to
      forget. I was constant at all the gayeties, gave every miss in town a
      share of my attention, rode to hounds once a week at Whitehall or the
      South River Club with a dozen young beauties. But cantering through the
      winter mists 'twas Dolly, in her red riding-cloak and white beaver, I saw
      beside me. None of them had her seat in the saddle, and none of them her
      light hand on the reins. And tho' they lacked not fire and skill, they had
      not my lady's dash and daring to follow over field and fallow, stream and
      searing, and be in at the death with heightened colour, but never a look
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the first assembly of the year. I got back from Bentley Manor,
      where I had been a-visiting the Fotheringays, just in time to call for
      Patty in Gloucester Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard the news from abroad, Richard?&rdquo; she asked, as I handed her
      into my chariot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never a line,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pho!&rdquo; exclaimed Patty; &ldquo;you tell me that! Where have you been hiding?
      Then you shall not have it from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had little trouble, however, in persuading her. For news was a rare
      luxury in those days, and Patty was plainly uncomfortable until she should
      have it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not give you the vapours to-night for all the world, Richard,&rdquo;
       she exclaimed. &ldquo;But if you must,&mdash;Dr. Courtenay has had a letter from
      Mr. Manners, who says that Dolly is to marry his Grace of Chartersea.
      There now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am not greatly disturbed,&rdquo; I answered, with a fine, careless air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lanthorn on the chariot was burning bright. And I saw Patty look at
      me, and laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;what a sex is that to which you belong. How ready are
      men to deny us at the first whisper! And I thought you the most constant
      of all. For my part, I credit not a word of it. 'Tis one of Mr.
      Marmaduke's lies and vanities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for my part, I think it true as gospel,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Dolly always held
      a coronet above her colony, and all her life has dreamed of a duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered Patty, more soberly; &ldquo;nay, you do her wrong. You will
      discover one day that she is loyal to the core, tho' she has a fop of a
      father who would serve his Grace's chocolate. We are all apt to talk, my
      dear, and to say what we do not mean, as you are doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were I to die to-morrow, I would repeat it,&rdquo; I exclaimed. But I liked
      Patty the better for what she had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is more news, of less import,&rdquo; she continued, as I was silent.
      &ldquo;The Thunderer dropped anchor in the roads to-day, and her officers will
      be at the assembly. And Betty tells me there is a young lord among them,&mdash;la!
      I have clean forgot the string of adjectives she used,&mdash;but she would
      have had me know he was as handsome as Apollo, and so dashing and
      diverting as to put Courtenay and all our wits to shame. She dined with
      him at the Governor's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I barely heard her, tho' I had seen the man-o'-war in the harbour as I
      sailed in that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assembly hall was filled when we arrived, aglow with candles and
      a-tremble with music, the powder already flying, and the tables in the
      recesses at either end surrounded by those at the cards. A lively scene,
      those dances at the old Stadt House, but one I love best to recall with a
      presence that endeared it to me. The ladies in flowered aprons and caps
      and brocades and trains, and the gentlemen in brilliant coats, trimmed
      with lace and stiffened with buckram. That night, as Patty had predicted,
      there was a smart sprinkling of uniforms from the Thunderer. One of those
      officers held my eye. He was as well-formed a lad, or man (for he was
      both), as it had ever been my lot to see. He was neither tall nor short,
      but of a good breadth. His fair skin was tanned by the weather, and he
      wore his own wavy hair powdered, as was just become the fashion, and tied
      with a ribbon behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, Richard, that must be his Lordship. Why, his good looks are all
      Betty claimed for them!&rdquo; exclaimed Patty. Mr. Lloyd, who was standing by,
      overheard her, and was vastly amused at her downright way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will fetch him directly, Miss Swain,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as I have done for a
      dozen ladies before you.&rdquo; And fetch him he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Swain, this is my Lord Comyn,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Your Lordship, one of the
      boasts of our province.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Patty grew red as the scarlet with which his Lordship's coat was lined.
      She curtseyed, while he made a profound bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Another boast, Mr. Lloyd!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Miss Swain is the tenth I
      have met. But I vow they excel as they proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must meet no more, my Lord,&rdquo; said Patty, laughing at Mr. Lloyd's
      predicament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, then, I will not,&rdquo; declared Comyn. &ldquo;I protest I am satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I was presented. He had won me on the instant with his open smile and
      frank, boyish manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is young Mr. Carvel, whom I hear wins every hunt in the colony?&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear you have been misinformed, my Lord,&rdquo; I replied, flashing with
      pleasure nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, my Lord,&rdquo; Mr. Lloyd struck in; &ldquo;Richard could ride down the devil
      himself, and he were a fox. You will see for yourself to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray we may not start the devil,&rdquo; said his Lordship; &ldquo;or I shall be
      content to let Mr. Carvel run him down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This Comyn was a man after my own fancy, as, indeed, he took the fancy of
      every one at the ball. Though a viscount in his own right, he gave himself
      not half the airs over us provincials as did many of his messmates. Even
      Mr. Jacques, who was sour as last year's cider over the doings of
      Parliament, lost his heart, and asked why we were not favoured in America
      with more of his sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a great mischance Lord Comyn had fallen into the tender clutches of my
      Aunt Caroline. It seemed she had known his uncle, the Honourable Arthur
      Comyn, in New York; and now she undertook to be responsible for his
      Lordship's pleasure at Annapolis, that he might meet only those of the
      first fashion. Seeing him talking to Patty, my aunt rose abruptly from her
      loo and made toward us, all paint and powder and patches, her chin in the
      air, which barely enabled her to look over Miss Swain's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; she cries, &ldquo;I will show you our colonial reel, which is about
      to begin, and I warrant you is gayer than any dance you have at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your very devoted, Mrs. Carvel,&rdquo; says his Lordship, with a bow, &ldquo;but Miss
      Swain has done me the honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lud!&rdquo; cries my aunt, sweeping the room, &ldquo;I vow I cannot keep pace with
      the misses nowadays. Is she here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was but a moment since, ma'am,&rdquo; replied Comyn, instantly, with a
      mischievous look at me, while poor Patty stood blushing not a yard
      distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many who overheard, and who used their fans and their napkins
      to hide their laughter at the very just snub Mrs. Grafton had received.
      And I wondered at the readiness with which he had read her character,
      liking him all the better. But my aunt was not to be disabled by this,&mdash;not
      she. After the dance she got hold of him, keeping him until certain
      designing ladies with daughters took him away; their names charity forbids
      me to mention. But in spite of them all he contrived to get Patty for
      supper, when I took Betty Tayloe, and we were very merry at table
      together. His Lordship proved more than able to take care of himself, and
      contrived to send Philip about his business when he pulled up a chair
      beside us. He drank a health to Miss Swain, and another to Miss Tayloe,
      and was on the point of filling a third glass to the ladies of Maryland,
      when he caught himself and brought his hand down on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad's life!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;but I think she's from Maryland, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded the young ladies, in a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who!&rdquo; exclaimed Comyn. &ldquo;Who but Miss Dorothy Manners! Isn't she from
      Maryland?&rdquo; And marking our astonished nods, he continued: &ldquo;Why, she
      descended upon Mayfair when they were so weary for something to worship,
      and they went mad over her in a s'ennight. I give you Miss Manners!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know her!&rdquo; exclaimed Patty, her voice quivering with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith!&rdquo; said his Lordship, laughing. &ldquo;For a whole month I was her most
      devoted, as were we all at Almack's. I stayed until the last minute for a
      word with her,&mdash;which I never got, by the way,&mdash;and paid near a
      guinea a mile for a chaise to Portsmouth as a consequence. Already she has
      had her choice from a thousand a year up, and I tell you our English
      ladies are green with envy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was stunned, you may be sure. And yet, I might have expected it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your Lordship has left your heart in England,&rdquo; said Betty, with a
      smile, &ldquo;I give you warning you must not tell our ladies here of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not who knows it, Miss Tayloe,&rdquo; he cried. That fustian,
      insincerity, was certainly not one of his faults. &ldquo;I care not who knows
      it. To pass her chariot is to have your heart stolen, and you must needs
      run after and beg mercy. But, ladies,&rdquo; he added, his eye twinkling;
      &ldquo;having seen the women of your colony, I marvel no longer at Miss
      Manners's beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He set us all a-laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear you were not born a diplomat, sir,&rdquo; says Patty. &ldquo;You agree that we
      are beautiful, yet to hear that one of us is more so is small
      consolation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We men turn as naturally to Miss Manners as plants to the sun, ma'am,&rdquo; he
      replied impulsively. &ldquo;Yet none of us dare hope for alliance with so
      brilliant and distant an object. I make small doubt those are Mr. Carvel's
      sentiments, and still he seems popular enough with the ladies. How now,
      sir? How now, Mr. Carvel? You have yet to speak on so tender a subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My eyes met Patty's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be no more politic than you, my Lord,&rdquo; I said boldly, &ldquo;nor will I
      make a secret of it that I adore Miss Manners full as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Richard!&rdquo; cries Patty; and &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cries his Lordship, while Betty
      claps her hands. And then Comyn swung suddenly round in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Carvel!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;By the seven chimes I have heard her mention
      your name. The devil fetch my memory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name!&rdquo; I exclaimed, in surprise, and prodigiously upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, with his hand to his head; &ldquo;some such thought was in
      my mind this afternoon when I heard of your riding. Stay! I have it! I was
      at Ampthill, Ossory's place, just before I left. Some insupportable
      coxcomb was boasting a marvellous run with the hounds nigh across
      Hertfordshire, and Miss Manners brought him up with a round turn and a
      half hitch by relating one of your exploits, Richard Carvel. And take my
      word on't she got no small applause. She told how you had followed a fox
      over one of your rough provincial counties, which means three of
      Hertfordshire, with your arm broken, by Heaven! and how they lifted you
      off at the death. And, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; said my Lord, generously, looking at
      my flushed face, &ldquo;you must give me your hand for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Dorothy in England had thought of me at least. But what booted it if
      she were to marry a duke! My thoughts began to whirl over all Comyn had
      said of her so that I scarce heard a question Miss Tayloe had put.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry Chartersea! That profligate pig!&rdquo; Comyn was saying. &ldquo;She would as
      soon marry a chairman or a chimneysweep, I'm thinking. Why, Miss Tayloe,
      Sir Charles Grandison himself would scarce suit her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good lack!&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;I think Sir Charles would be the very last for
      Dorothy.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XIII. MR. ALLEN SHOWS HIS HAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      So Dorothy's beauty had taken London by storm, even as it had conquered
      Annapolis! However, 'twas small consolation to me to hear his Grace of
      Chartersea called a pig and a profligate while better men danced her
      attendance in Mayfair. Nor, in spite of what his Lordship had said, was I
      quite easy on the score of the duke. It was in truth no small honour to
      become a duchess. If Mr. Marmaduke had aught to say, there was an end to
      hope. She would have her coronet. But in that hour of darkness I counted
      upon my lady's spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Courtenay came to the assembly very late, with a new fashion of
      pinchbeck buckles on his pumps and a new manner of taking snuff. (I caught
      Fotheringay practising this by the stairs shortly after.) Always an
      important man, the doctor's prominence had been increased that day by the
      letter he had received. He was too thorough a courtier to profess any
      grief over Miss Manners's match, and went about avowing that he had always
      predicted a duke for Miss Dorothy. And he drew a deal of pleasure from the
      curiosity of those who begged but one look at the letter. Show it, indeed!
      For no consideration. A private communication from one gentleman to
      another must be respected. Will Fotheringay swore the doctor was a sly
      dog, and had his own reasons for keeping it to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor paid his compliment to the captain of the Thunderer, and to his
      Lordship; hoped that he would see them at the meet on the morrow, tho' his
      gout forbade his riding to hounds. He saluted me in the most friendly way,
      for I played billiards with him at the Coffee House now, and he won my
      money. He had pronounced my phaeton to be as well appointed as any
      equipage in town, and had done me the honour to drive out with me on
      several occasions. It was Betty that brought him humiliation that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of the soar our Pandora hath taken, Miss Betty?&rdquo; says
      he. &ldquo;From a Maryland manor to a ducal palace. 'Tis a fable, egad! No
      less!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I think it is,&rdquo; retorted Betty. &ldquo;Mark me, doctor, Dorothy will
      not put up an instant with a roue and a brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A roue!&rdquo; cries he, &ldquo;and a brute! What the plague, Miss Tayloe! I vow I do
      not understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ask my Lord Comyn, who knows your Duke of Chartersea,&rdquo; said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Courtenay's expression was worth a pistole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comyn know him!&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he does,&rdquo; replied Betty, laughing. &ldquo;His Lordship says Chartersea is
      a pig and a profligate, and I remember not what else. And that Dolly will
      not look at him. And so little Mr. Marmaduke may go a-hunting for another
      title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No wonder I had little desire for dancing that night! I wandered out of
      the assembly-room and through the silent corridors of the Stadt House,
      turning over and over again what I had heard, and picturing Dorothy
      reigning over the macaronies of St. James's Street. She had said nothing
      of this in her letter to Betty, and had asked me to write to her. But now,
      with a duke to refuse or accept, could she care to hear from her old
      playmate? I took no thought of the time, until suddenly my conscience told
      me I had neglected Patty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I entered the hall I saw her at the far end of it talking to Mr. Allen.
      This I thought strange, for I knew she disliked him. Lord Comyn and Mr.
      Carroll, the barrister, and Singleton, were standing by, listening. By the
      time I was halfway across to them the rector turned away. I remember
      thinking afterwards that he changed colour when he said: &ldquo;Your servant,
      Mr. Richard.&rdquo; But I thought nothing of it at the time, and went on to
      Patty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come for a country dance, before we go, Patty,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then something in her mien struck me. Her eyes expressed a pain I had
      remarked in them before only when she spoke to me of Tom, and her lips
      were closed tightly. She flushed, and paled, and looked from Singleton to
      Mr. Carroll. They and his Lordship remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I cannot, Richard. I am going home,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see if the chariot is here,&rdquo; I answered, surprised, but thinking
      of Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going with Mr. Carroll,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope a Carvel never has to be rebuffed twice, nor to be humbled by
      craving an explanation before a company. I was confounded that Patty
      should treat me thus, when I had done nothing to deserve it. As I made for
      the door, burning and indignant, I felt as tho' every eye in the room was
      upon me.' Young Harvey drove me that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marlboro' Street, Mr. Richard?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee House,&rdquo; replied I, that place coming first into my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Harvey seldom took liberties; but he looked down from the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better home, sir; your pardon, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n it!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;drive where I bid you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pulled down the fore-glass, though the night was cold, and began to cast
      about for the cause of Patty's action. And then it was the rector came to
      my mind. Yes, he had been with her just before I came up, and I made sure
      on the instant that my worthy instructor was responsible for the trouble.
      I remembered that I had quarrelled with him the morning before I had gone
      to Bentley Manor, and threatened to confess his villany and my deceit to
      Mr. Carvel. He had answered me with a sneer and a dare. I knew than Patty
      put honour and honesty before all else in the world, and that she would
      not have suffered my friendship for a day had she believed me to lack
      either. But she, who knew me so well, was not likely to believe anything
      he might say without giving me the chance to clear myself. And what could
      he have told her?
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt my anger growing big within me, until I grew afraid of what I would
      do if I were tempted. I had a long score and a heavy score against this
      rector of St. Anne's,&mdash;a score that had been gathering these years.
      And I felt that my uncle was somewhere behind him; that the two of them
      were plotters against me, even as Harvey had declared; albeit my Uncle
      Grafton was little seen in his company now. And finally, in a sinister
      flash of revelation, came the thought that Grafton himself was at the back
      of this deception of my grandfather, as to my principles. Fool that I was,
      it had never occurred to me before. But how was he to gain by it? Did he
      hope that Mr. Carvel, in a fit of anger, would disinherit me when he found
      I had deceived him? Yes. And so had left the matter in abeyance near these
      two years, that the shock might be the greater when it came. I recalled
      now, with a shudder, that never since the spring of my grandfather's
      illness had my uncle questioned me upon my politics. I was seized with a
      fit of fury. I suspected that Mr. Allen would be at the Coffee House after
      the assembly. And I determined to seize the chance at once and have it out
      with him then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inn was ablaze, but as yet deserted; Mr. Claude expectant. He bowed me
      from my chariot door, and would know what took me from the ball. I threw
      him some short answer, bade Harvey go home, saying that I would have some
      fellow light me to Marlboro' Street when I thought proper. And coming into
      the long room I flung aside my greatcoat and commanded a flask of Mr.
      Stephen Bordley's old sherry, some of which Mr. Claude had obtained at
      that bachelor's demise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wine was scarce opened before I heard some sort of stir at the front,
      and two servants in a riding livery of scarlet and white hurried in to
      seek Mr. Claude. The sight of them sufficed mine host, for he went out as
      fast as his legs would go, giving the bell a sharp pull as he passed the
      door; and presently I heard him complimenting two gentlemen into the
      house. The voice of one I knew,&mdash;being no other than Captain
      Clapsaddle's; and him I had not seen for the past six months. I was just
      risen to my feet when they came in at the door beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard!&rdquo; cried the captain, and grasped my hand in both his own. I
      returned his pressure, too much pleased to speak. Then his eye was caught
      by my finery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So ho!&rdquo; says he, shaking his head at me for a sad rogue. &ldquo;Wine and women
      and fine clothes, and not nineteen, or I mistake me. It was so with
      Captain Jack, who blossomed in a week; and few could vie with him, I
      warrant you, after he made his decision. But bless me!&rdquo; he went on,
      drawing back, &ldquo;the lad looks mature, and a fair two inches broader than
      last spring. But why are you not at the assembly, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have but now come from there, sir,&rdquo; I replied, not caring in the
      presence of a stranger to enter into reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      At my answer the captain turned from me to the gentleman behind him, who
      had been regarding us both as we talked. There are some few men in the
      world, I thank God for it, who bear their value on their countenance; who
      stand unmistakably for qualities which command respect and admiration and
      love! We seem to recognize such men, and to wonder where we have seen them
      before. In reality we recognize the virtues they represent. So it was with
      him I saw in front of me, and by his air and carriage I marked him then
      and there as a man born to great things. You all know his face, my dears,
      and I pray God it may live in the sight of those who come after you, for
      generation upon generation!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Washington,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;this is Mr. Richard Carvel, the
      son of Captain Carvel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Washington did not speak at once. He stood regarding me a full minute,
      his eye seeming to penetrate the secrets of my life. And I take pride in
      saying it was an eye I could meet without flinching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father was a brave man, sir,&rdquo; he said soberly, &ldquo;and it seems you
      favour him. I am happy in knowing the son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he stood debating whether he would go to the house of one of
      his many friends in Annapolis, knowing that they would be offended when
      they learned he had stopped at the inn. He often came to town, indeed, but
      seldom tarried long; and it had never been my fortune to see him. Being
      arrived unexpectedly, and obliged to be away early on the morrow, he
      decided to order rooms of Mr. Claude, sat down with me at the table, and
      commenced supper. They had ridden from Alexandria. I gathered from their
      conversation that they were on their way to Philadelphia upon some private
      business, the nature of which, knowing Captain Daniel's sentiments and
      those of Colonel Washington, I went not far to guess. The country was in a
      stir about the Townshend duties; and there being some rumour that all
      these were to be discharged save only that on tea, anxiety prevailed in
      our middle colonies that the merchants of New York would abandon the
      association formed and begin importation. It was of some mission to these
      merchants that I suspected them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I sat beside Colonel Washington, I found myself growing calmer, and
      ashamed of my lack of self-control. Unconsciously, when we come in contact
      with the great of character, we mould our minds to their qualities. His
      very person seemed to exhale, not sanctity, but virility. I felt that this
      man could command himself and others. In his presence self-command came to
      me, as a virtue gone out of him. 'Twas not his speech, I would have you
      know, that took hold of me. He was by no means a brilliant talker, and I
      had the good fortune to see him at his ease, since he and the captain were
      old friends. As they argued upon the questions of the day, the colonel did
      not seek to impress by words, or to fascinate by manner. His opinions were
      calm and moderate, and appeared to me so just as to admit of no appeal. He
      scrupled not to use a forceful word when occasion demanded. And yet, now
      and then, he had a lively way about him with all his dignity. When he had
      finished his supper he bade Mr. Claude bring another bottle of Mr.
      Bordley's sherry, having tested mine, and addressed himself to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would know what my pursuits had been; for my father's sake, what were
      my ambitions? He questioned me about Mr. Carvel's plantation, of which he
      had heard, and appeared pleased with the answers I gave as to its
      management and methods. Captain Daniel was no less so. Mr. Washington had
      agriculture at his finger ends, and gave me some advice which he had found
      serviceable at Mount Vernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis a pity, Richard,&rdquo; said he, smiling thoughtfully at the captain,
      &ldquo;'tis a pity we have no service afield open to our young men. One of your
      spirit and bearing should be of that profession. Captain Jack was as brave
      and dashing an officer as I ever laid eyes on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated, the tingling at the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to think I was born for the sea, sir,&rdquo; I answered, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the captain; &ldquo;what news is this, Richard? 'Slife! how has
      this come about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My anger subdued by Mr. Washington's presence, a curious mood had taken
      its place. A foolish mood, I thought it, but one of feeling things to
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I shall one day take part in a great sea-fight,&rdquo; I said. And,
      tho' ashamed to speak of it, I told him of Stanwix's prophecy that I
      should pace the decks of a man-o'-war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pox on Stanwix!&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;an artful old seadog! I never yet
      knew one who did not think the sun rises and sets from poop to forecastle,
      who did not wheedle with all the young blood to get them to follow a
      bow-legged profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Washington laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge not, Clapsaddle,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;here are two of us trying to get the
      lad for our own bow-legged profession. We are as hot as Methodists to
      convert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small conversion he needed when I was here to watch him, colonel. And he
      rides with any trooper I ever laid eyes on. Why, sir, I myself threw him
      on a saddle before he could well-nigh walk, and 'twere a waste of material
      to put him in the navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what this old man said of a flag not yet seen in heaven or earth
      interests me,&rdquo; said Colonel Washington. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he added with a
      penetration we both remarked, &ldquo;tell me, does your Captain Stanwix follow
      the times? Is he a man to read his prints and pamphlets? In other words,
      is he a man who might predict out of his own heated imagination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sir,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;he nods over his tobacco the day long. And I will
      make bold to swear, he has never heard of the Stamp Act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis strange,&rdquo; said the colonel, musing; &ldquo;I have heard of this second
      sight&mdash;have seen it among my own negroes. But I heartily pray that
      this may be but the childish fancy of an old mariner. How do you interpret
      it, sir?&rdquo; he added, addressing himself to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a prophecy, I can interpret it in but one way,&rdquo; I began, and there I
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Washington. He studied me awhile as though weighing
      my judgment, and went on: &ldquo;Needless to say, Richard, that such a service,
      if it comes, will not be that of his Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it were, colonel, I would not embark in it a step,&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lad has his father's impulse,&rdquo; he said to Captain Daniel. &ldquo;But I
      thought old Mr. Carvel to be one of the warmest loyalists in the
      colonies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bit my lip; for, since that unhappy deception of Mr. Carvel, I had not
      meant to be drawn into an avowal of my sentiments. But I had, alas,
      inherited a hasty tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Washington,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;old Mr. Carvel has ever been a good
      friend to me. And, though I could not but perceive which way the lad was
      tending, I had held it but a poor return for friendship had I sought by
      word or deed to bring him to my way of thinking. Nor have I ever suffered
      his views in my presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, I honour you for it,&rdquo; put in the colonel, warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is naught to my credit,&rdquo; returned the captain. &ldquo;I would not, for the
      sake of my party and beliefs, embitter what remains of my old friend's
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew a long breath and drained the full glass before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Daniel!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;you must hear me now. I have been waiting your
      coming these months. And if Colonel Washington gives me leave, I will
      speak before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonel bade me proceed, avowing that Captain Carvel's son should have
      his best assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that I told them the whole story of Mr. Allen's villany. How I had
      been sent to him because of my Whig sentiments, and for thrashing a Tory
      schoolmaster and his flock. This made the gentlemen laugh, tho' Captain
      Daniel had heard it before. I went on to explain how Mr. Carvel had fallen
      ill, and was like to die; and how Mr. Allen, taking advantage of his
      weakness when he rose from his bed, had gone to him with the lie of having
      converted me. But when I told of the scene between my grandfather and me
      at Carvel Hall, of the tears of joy that the old gentleman shed, and of
      how he had given me Firefly as a reward, the captain rose from his chair
      and looked out of the window into the blackness, and swore a great oath
      all to himself. And the expression I saw come into the colonel's eyes I
      shall never forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you feared the consequences upon your grandfather's health?&rdquo; he asked
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me God!&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I truly believe that to have undeceived him
      would have proved fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, for the sake of the sum he receives for teaching you,&rdquo; cried the
      captain, with another oath, &ldquo;this scoundrelly clergyman has betrayed you
      into a lie. A scheme, by God's life! worthy of a Machiavelli!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen too many of his type in our parishes,&rdquo; said Mr. Washington;
      &ldquo;and yet the bishop of London seems powerless. And so used have we become
      in these Southern colonies to tippling and gaming parsons, that I warrant
      his people accept him as nothing out of the common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is more discreet than the run of them, sir. His parishioners dislike
      him, not because of his irregularities, but because he is attempting to
      obtain All Saints from his Lordship, in addition to St. Anne's. He is
      thought too greedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent, his brow a little furrowed, and drummed with his fingers
      upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this I cannot reconcile,&rdquo; said he, presently, &ldquo;that the reward is out
      of all proportion to the risk. Such a clever rascal must play for higher
      stakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was amazed at his insight. And for the moment was impelled to make a
      clean breast of my suspicions,&mdash;nay, of my convictions of the whole
      devil's plot. But I had no proofs. I remembered that to the colonel my
      uncle was a gentleman of respectability and of wealth, and a member of his
      Excellency's Council. That to accuse him of scheming for my inheritance
      would gain me nothing in Mr. Washington's esteem. And I caught myself
      before I had said aught of Mr. Allen's conduct that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you confronted this rector with his perfidy, Richard?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, colonel, at my first opportunity.&rdquo; And I related how Mr. Allen
      had come to the Hall, and what I had said to him, and how he had behaved.
      And finally told of the picquet we now had during lessons, not caring to
      shield myself. Both listened intently, until the captain broke out. Mr.
      Washington's indignation was the stronger for being repressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will call him out!&rdquo; cried Captain Daniel, fingering his sword, as was
      his wont when angered; &ldquo;I will call him out despite his gown, or else
      horse him publicly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear sir, you will do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;You
      would gain nothing by it for the lad, and lose much. Such rascals walk in
      water, and are not to be tracked. He cannot be approached save through Mr.
      Lionel Carvel himself, and that channel, for Mr. Carvel's sake, must be
      closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he must be shown up!&rdquo; cried the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good will you accomplish?&rdquo; said Mr. Washington; &ldquo;Lord Baltimore is
      notorious, and will not remove him. Nay, sir, you must find a way to get
      the lad from his influence.&rdquo; And he asked me how was my grandfather's
      health at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said that he had mended beyond my hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does he seem to rejoice that you are of the King's party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sir. Concerning politics he seems strangely apathetic, which makes
      me fear he is not so well as he appears. All his life he has felt
      strongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I beg you, Richard, take pains to keep neutral. Nor let any passing
      event, however great, move you to speech or action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain shook his head doubtfully, as tho' questioning the ability of
      one of my temper to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not trust myself, sir,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, declaring it was past his hour for bed, and added some kind
      things which I shall cherish in my memory. As he was leaving he laid his
      hand on my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word of advice, my lad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If by any chance your convictions
      are to come to your grandfather's ears, let him have them from your own
      lips.&rdquo; And he bade me good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain tarried but a moment longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a notion who is to blame for this, Richard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I come
      back from New York, we shall see what we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear he is too slippery for a soldier to catch,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away to bed, telling me to be prudent, and mind the colonel's
      counsel until he returned from the North.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. THE VOLTE COUPE
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was of a serious mind to take the advice. To prove this I called for my
      wrap-rascal and cane, and for a fellow with a flambeau to light me. But
      just then the party arrived from the assembly. I was tempted, and I sat
      down again in a corner of the room, resolved to keep a check upon myself,
      but to stay awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector was the first in, humming a song, and spied me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;will you drink, Richard? Or do I drink with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was already purple with wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God save me from you and your kind!&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sblood! what a devil's nest of fireworks!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he went off
      down the room, still humming, to where the rest were gathered. And they
      were soon between bottle and stopper, and quips a-coursing. There was the
      captain of the Thunderer, Collinson by name, Lord Comyn and two brother
      officers, Will Fotheringay, my cousin Philip, openly pleased to be found
      in such a company, and some dozen other toadeaters who had followed my
      Lord a-chair and a-foot from the ball, and would have tracked him to
      perdition had he chosen to go; and lastly Tom Swain, leering and
      hiccoughing at the jokes, in such a beastly state of drunkenness as I had
      rarely seen him. His Lordship recognized me and smiled, and was pushing
      his chair back, when something Collinson said seemed to restrain him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe I was the butt of more than one jest for my aloofness, though I
      could not hear distinctly for the noise they made. I commanded some French
      cognac, and kept my eye on the rector, and the sight of him was making me
      dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      I forgot the advice I had received, and remembered only the months he had
      goaded me. And I was even beginning to speculate how I could best pick a
      quarrel with him on any issue but politics, when an unexpected incident
      diverted me. Of a sudden the tall, ungainly form of Percy Singleton filled
      the doorway, wrapped in a greatcoat. He swept the room at a glance, and
      then strode rapidly toward the corner where I sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought to find you here,&rdquo; he said, and dropped into a chair beside
      me. I offered him wine, but he refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;what has Patty done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I done that I should be publicly insulted?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insulted!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and did she insult you? She said nothing of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brings you here, then?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to talk, Richard,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;'tis no time tonight. I came to
      fetch you home. Patty sent me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Patty sent him! Why had Patty sent him? But this I did not ask, for I felt
      the devil within me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must first finish this bottle,&rdquo; said I, offhand, &ldquo;and then I have a
      little something to be done which I have set my heart upon. After that I
      will go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, Richard, will you never learn prudence? What is it you speak
      of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew my sword and laid it upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to spit that eel of a rector,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or he will bear a slap in
      the face. And you must see fair play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Singleton seized my coat, at the same time grasping the hilt of my sword
      with the other hand. But neither my words nor my action had gone unnoticed
      by the other end of the room. The company there fell silent awhile, and
      then we heard Captain Collinson talking in even, drawling tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis strange,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what hot sparks a man meets in these colonies.
      They should be stamped out. His Majesty pampers these d&mdash;d Americans,
      is too lenient by far. Gentlemen, this is how I would indulge them!&rdquo; He
      raised a closed fist and brought it down on the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to Tories, but he forgot that Tories were Americans. In those
      days only the meanest of the King's party would listen to such without
      protest from an Englishman. But some of the meaner sort were there: Philip
      and Tom laughed, and Mr. Allen, and my Lord's sycophants. Fotheringay and
      some others of sense shook their heads one to another, comprehending that
      Captain Collinson was somewhat gone in wine. For, indeed, he had not
      strayed far from the sideboard at the assembly. Comyn made a motion to
      rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is already past three bells, sir, and a hunt to-morrow,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From bottle to saddle, and from saddle to bottle, my Lord. We must have
      our pleasure ashore, and sleep at sea,&rdquo; and the captain tipped his flask
      with a leer. He turned his eye uncertainly first on me, then on my Lord.
      &ldquo;We are lately from Boston, gentlemen, that charnel-house of treason, and
      before we leave, my Lord, I must tell them how Mr. Robinson of the customs
      served that dog Otis, in the British Coffee House. God's word, 'twas as
      good as a play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I know not how many got to their feet at that, for the story of the
      cowardly beating of Mr. Otis by Robinson and the army officers had swept
      over the colonies, burning like a flame all true-hearted men, Tory and
      Whig alike. I wrested my sword from Singleton's hold, and in a trice I had
      reached the captain over chairs and table, tearing myself from Fotheringay
      on the way. I struck a blow that measured a man on the floor. Then I drew
      back, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had hit Lord Comyn instead! The captain stood a yard beyond me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing had been so deftly done by the rector of St. Anne's&mdash;Comyn
      jostled at the proper moment between me and Collinson&mdash;that none save
      me guessed beyond an accident; least of all my Lord Comyn himself. He was
      up again directly and his sword drawn, addressing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear witness, my Lord, that I have no desire to fight with you,&rdquo; said I,
      with what coolness I could muster. &ldquo;But there is one here I would give
      much for a chance to run through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I made a step toward Mr. Allen with such a purpose in my face and
      movements that he could not mistake. I saw the blood go from his face; yet
      he was no coward to physical violence. But he (or I?) was saved by the
      Satan's luck that followed him, for my Lord stepped in between us with a
      bow, his cheek red where I had struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my quarrel now, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, my Lord,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It boots not who crosses with him,&rdquo; Captain Collinson put in. &ldquo;His
      Lordship uses the sword better than any here. But it boots not so that he
      is opposed by a loyal servant of the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wheeled on him for this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have you know that loyalty does not consist in outrage and
      murder, sir,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;nor in the ridiculing of them. And brutes
      cannot be loyal save through interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was angered, as I had desired. I had hopes then of shouldering the
      quarrel on to him, for I had near as soon drawn against my own brother as
      against Comyn. I protest I loved him then as one with whom I had been
      reared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me deal with this young gamecock, Comyn,&rdquo; cried the captain, with an
      oath. &ldquo;He seems to think his importance sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Comyn would brook no interference. He swore that no man should strike
      him with impunity, and in this I could not but allow he was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall hear from me, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;and fighting is to be done, sir, let us be through
      with it at once. A large room upstairs is at our disposal; and there is a
      hunt to-morrow which one of us may like to attend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a laugh at this, in which his Lordship joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would to God, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I had no quarrel with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen to that, my Lord,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;there are others here I would rather
      fight.&rdquo; And I gave a meaning look at Mr. Allen. I was of two minds to
      announce the scurvy trick he had played, but saw that I would lose rather
      than gain by the attempt. Up to that time the wretch had not spoken a
      word; now he pushed himself forward, though well clear of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it my duty as Mr. Carvel's tutor, gentlemen, to protest against
      this matter proceeding,&rdquo; he said, a sneer creeping into his voice. &ldquo;Nor
      can I be present at it. Mr. Carvel is young and, besides, is not himself
      with liquor. And, in the choice of politics, he knows not which leg he
      stands upon. My Lord and gentlemen, your most humble and devoted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a bow and, before the retort on my lips could be spoken, left the
      tavern. My cousin Philip left with him. Tom Swain had fallen asleep in his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Collinson and Mr. Furness, of the Thunderer, offered to serve his
      Lordship, which made me bethink that I, too, would have need of some one.
      'Twas then I remembered Singleton, who had passed from my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was standing close behind me, and nodded simply when I asked him. And
      Will Fotheringay came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will act, Richard, if you allow me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I would have you know I
      am in no wise hostile to you, my Lord, and I am of the King's party. But I
      admire Mr. Carvel, and I may say I am not wholly out of sympathy with that
      which prompted his act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a noble speech, and changed Will in my eyes; and I thanked him with
      warmth. He of all that company had the courage to oppose his Lordship!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Claude was called in and, as is the custom in such cases, was told
      that some of us would play awhile above. He was asked for his private
      room. The good man had his suspicions, but could not refuse a party of
      such distinction, and sent a drawer thither with wine and cards. Presently
      we followed, leaving the pack of toadies in sad disappointment below.
    </p>
    <p>
      We gathered about the table and made shift at loo until the fellow had
      retired, when the seconds proceeded to clear the room of furniture, and
      Lord Comyn and I stripped off our coats and waistcoats. I had lost my
      anger, but felt no fear, only a kind of pity that blood should be shed
      between two so united in spirit as we. Yes, my dears, I thought of
      Dorothy. If I died, she would hear that it was like a man&mdash;like a
      Carvel. But the thought of my old grandfather tightened my heart. Then the
      clock on the inn stairs struck two, and the noise of harsh laughter
      floated up to us from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Comyn,&mdash;of what was he thinking? Of some fair home set upon the
      downs across the sea, of some heroic English mother who had kept her tears
      until he was gone? Her image rose in dumb entreaty, invoked by the lad
      before me. What a picture was he in his spotless shirt with the ruffles,
      his handsome boyish face all that was good and honest!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had scarce felt his Lordship's wrist than I knew I had to deal with a
      pupil of Angelo. At first his attacks were all simple, without feint or
      trickery, as were mine. Collinson cursed and cried out that it was
      buffoonery, and called on my Lord not to let me off so easily; swore that
      I fenced like a mercer, that he could have stuck me like a pin-cushion
      twenty and twenty times. Often have I seen two animals thrust into a pit
      with nothing but good-will between them, and those without force them into
      anger and a deadly battle. And so it was, unconsciously, between Comyn and
      me. I forgot presently that I was not dealing with Captain Collinson, and
      my feelings went into my sword. Comyn began to press me, nor did I give
      back. And then, before it came over me that we had to do with life and
      death, he was upon me with a volte coupe, feinting in high carte and
      thrusting in low tierce, his point passing through a fold in my shirt. And
      I were not alive to write these words had I not leaped out of his measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Richard!&rdquo; cried Fotheringay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well made, gads life!&rdquo; from Mr. Furness.
    </p>
    <p>
      We engaged again, our faces hot. Now I knew that if I did not carry the
      matter against him I should be killed out of hand, and Heaven knows I was
      not used to play a passive part. I began to go carefully, but fiercely;
      tried one attack after another that my grandfather and Captain Daniel had
      taught me,&mdash;flanconnades, beats, and lunges. Comyn held me even, and
      in truth I had much to do to defend myself. Once I thought I had him in
      the sword-arm, after a circular parry, but he was too quick for me. We
      were sweating freely by now, and by reason of the buzzing in my ears I
      could scarce hear the applause of the seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      What unlucky chance it was I know not that impelled Comyn to essay again
      the trick by which he had come so near to spitting me; but try it he did,
      this time in prime and seconde. I had come by nature to that intuition
      which a true swordsman must have, gleaned from the eyes of his adversary.
      Long ago Captain Daniel had taught me the remedy for this coupe. I
      parried, circled, and straightened, my body in swift motion and my point
      at Comyn's heart, when Heaven brought me recollection in the space of a
      second. My sword rang clattering on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship understood, but too late. Despairing his life, he made one
      wild lunge at me that had never gone home had I held to my hilt. But the
      rattle of the blade had scarce reached my ears when there came a sharp
      pain at my throat, and the room faded before me. I heard the clock
      striking the half-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was blessed with a sturdy health such as few men enjoy, and came to
      myself sooner than had been looked for, with a dash of cold water. And the
      first face I beheld was that of Colonel Washington. I heard him speaking
      in a voice that was calm, yet urgent and commanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, gentlemen, give back. He is coming to, and must have air.
      Fetch some linen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now God be praised!&rdquo; I heard Captain Daniel cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that his Lordship began to tear his own shirt into strips, and the
      captain bringing a bowl and napkin, the colonel himself washed the wound
      and bound it deftly, Singleton and Captain Daniel assisting. When Mr.
      Washington had finished, he turned to Comyn, who stood, anxious and
      dishevelled, at my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be thankful that you missed the artery, my Lord,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart, Colonel Washington!&rdquo; cried his Lordship. &ldquo;I owe my
      life to his generosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carvel dropped his sword, rather than run me through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll warrant!&rdquo; Captain Daniel put in; &ldquo;'Od's heart! The lad has skill to
      point the eye of a button. I taught him myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Washington stood up and laid his hand on the captain's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is Jack Carvel over again,&rdquo; I heard him say, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to struggle to my feet, to speak, but he restrained me. And
      sending for his servants, he ordered them to have his baggage removed from
      the Roebuck, which was the best bed in the house. At this moment the door
      opened, and Mr. Swain came in hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, gentlemen,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and he is fit to be moved, you will
      let me take him to Marlboro' Street. I have a chariot at the door.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. OF WHICH THE RECTOR HAS THE WORST
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Twas late when I awoke the next day with something of a dull ache in my
      neck, and a prodigious stiffness, studying the pleatings of the bed canopy
      over my head. And I know not how long I lay idly thus when I perceived
      Mrs. Willis moving quietly about, and my grandfather sitting in the
      armchair by the window, looking into Freshwater Lane. As my eyes fell upon
      him my memory came surging back,&mdash;first of the duel, then of its
      cause. And finally, like a leaden weight, the thought of the deception I
      had practised upon him, of which he must have learned ere this. Nay, I was
      sure from the troubled look of his face that he knew of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of my voice he got hastily from his chair and hurried to my
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; he answered, taking my hand, &ldquo;Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I opened my mouth to speak, to confess. But he prevented me, the tears
      filling the wrinkles around his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, lad, nay. We will not talk of it. I know all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Allen has been here&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And be d&mdash;d to him! Be d&mdash;d to him for a wolf in sheep's
      clothing!&rdquo; shouted my grandfather, his manner shifting so suddenly to
      anger that I was taken back. &ldquo;So help me God I will never set foot in St.
      Anne's while he is rector. Nor shall he come to this house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he took three or four disorderly turns about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he continued more quietly, with something of a sigh, &ldquo;I might have
      known how stubborn your mind should be. That you was never one to blow
      from the north one day and from the south the next. I deny not that there
      be good men and able of your way of thinking: Colonel Washington, for one,
      whom I admire and honour; and our friend Captain Daniel. They have been
      here to-day, Richard, and I promise you were good advocates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I knew that I was forgiven. And I could have thrown myself at Mr.
      Carvel's feet for happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Colonel Washington spoken in my favour, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he has. He is upon some urgent business for the North, I believe,
      which he delayed for your sake. Both he and the captain were in my
      dressing-room before I was up, ahead of that scurrilous clergyman, who was
      for pushing his way to my bed-curtains. Ay, the two of them were here at
      nigh dawn this morning, and Mr. Allen close after them. And I own that
      Captain Daniel can swear with such a consuming violence as to put any
      rogue out of countenance. 'Twas all Mr. Washington could do to restrain
      Clapsaddle from booting his Reverence over the balustrade and down two
      runs of the stairs, the captain declaring he would do for every cur's son
      of the whelps. 'Diomedes,' says I, waking up, 'what's this damnable racket
      on the landing? Is Mr. Richard home?' For I had some notion it was you,
      sir, after an over-night brawl. And I profess I would have caned you
      soundly. The fellow answered that Captain Clapsaddle's honour was killing
      Mr. Allen, and went out; and came back presently to say that some tall
      gentleman had the captain by the neck, and that Mr. Allen was picking his
      way down the ice on the steps outside. With that I went in to them in my
      dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What's all this to-do, gentlemen?' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'd have finished that son of a dog,' says the captain, 'and Colonel
      Washington had let me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What, what!' said I. 'How now? What! Drive a clergyman from my house
      gentlemen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What's Richard been at now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Washington asked me to dress, saying that they had something very
      particular to speak about; that they would stay to breakfast with me, tho'
      they were in haste to be gone to New York. I made my compliments to the
      colonel and had them shown to the library fire, and hurried down after
      them. Then they told me of this affair last night, and they cleared you,
      sir. 'Faith,' cried I, 'and I would have fought, too. The lad was in the
      right of it, though I would have him a little less hasty.' D&mdash;n me if
      I don't wish you had knocked that sea captain's teeth into his throat, and
      his brains with them. I like your spirit, sir. A pox on such men as he,
      who disgrace his Majesty's name and set better men against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they told you nothing else, sir?&rdquo; I asked, with misgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That they did. Mr. Washington repeated the confession you made to them,
      sir, in a manner that did you credit. He made me compliments on you,&mdash;said
      that you were a man, sir, though a trifle hasty: in the which I agreed.
      Yes, d&mdash;n me, a trifle hasty like your father. I rejoice that you did
      not kill his Lordship, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The twilight was beginning; and the old gentleman going back to his chair
      was set amusing, gazing out across the bare trees and gables falling gray
      after the sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      What amazed me was that he did not seem to be shocked by the revelation
      near as much as I had feared. So this matter had brought me happiness
      where I looked for nothing but sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the gentlemen are gone north, sir?&rdquo; said I, after a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Richard, these four hours. I commanded an early dinner for them,
      since the colonel was pleased to tarry long enough for a little politics
      and to spin a glass. And I profess, was I to live neighbours with such a
      man, I might come to his way of thinking, despite myself. Though I say it
      that shouldn't, some of his Majesty's ministers are d&mdash;d rascals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed. As I live, I never hoped to hear such words from my
      grandfather's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not seek to convince, like so many of your hotheaded
      know-it-alls,&rdquo; said Mr. Carvel; &ldquo;he leaves a man to convince himself. He
      has great parts, Richard, and few can stand before him.&rdquo; He paused. And
      then his smooth-shaven face became creased in a roguish smile which I had
      often seen upon it. &ldquo;What baggage is this I hear of that you quarrelled
      over at the assembly? Ah, Sir, I fear you are become but a sad rake!&rdquo; says
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by great good fortune Dr. Leiden was shown in at this instant. And the
      candles being lighted, he examined my neck, haranguing the while in his
      vile English against the practice of duelling. He bade me keep my bed for
      two days, thereby giving me no great pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I hope to live,&rdquo; said Mr. Carvel when the doctor was gone, &ldquo;one would
      have thought his Excellency himself had been pinked instead of a whip of a
      lad, for the people who have been here. His Lordship and Dr. Courtenay
      came before the hunt, and young Mr. Fotheringay, and half a score of
      others. Mr. Swain is but now left to go to Baltimore on some barrister's
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was burning to learn what the rector had said to Patty, but it was plain
      Mr. Carvel knew nothing of this part of the story. He had not mentioned
      Grafton among the callers. I wondered what course my uncle would now
      pursue, that his plans to alienate me from my grandfather had failed. And
      I began debating whether or not to lay the whole plot before Mr. Carvel.
      Prudence bade me wait, since Grafton had not consorted with the rector
      openly, at least&mdash;for more than a year. And yet I spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carvel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stirred in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had to repeat, and still I held my tongue. Even as I hesitated there
      came a knock at the door, and Scipio entered, bearing candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Massa Grafton, suh,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle was close at his heels. He was soberly dressed in dark brown
      silk, and his face wore that expression of sorrow and concern he knew how
      to assume at will. After greeting his father with his usual ceremony, he
      came to my bedside and asked gravely how I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How now, Grafton!&rdquo; cried Mr. Carvel; &ldquo;this is no funeral. The lad has
      only a scratch, thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My uncle looked at me and forced a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I am rejoiced to find you are not worried over this matter,
      father,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am but just back from Kent to learn of it, and looked
      to find you in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, sir, I am not worried. I fought a duel in my own day,&mdash;over
      a lass, it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time Grafton's smile was not forced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over a lass, was it?&rdquo; he asked, and added in a tone of relief, &ldquo;and how
      do you, nephew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carvel saved me from replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Od's life!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;no, I did not say this was over a lass. I have
      heard the whole matter; how Captain Collinson, who is a disgrace to the
      service, brought shame upon his Majesty's supporters, and how Richard
      felled the young lord instead. I'll be sworn, and I had been there, I
      myself would have run the brute through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My uncle did not ask for further particulars, but took a chair, and a dish
      of tea from Scipio. His smug look told me plainer than words that he
      thought my grandfather still ignorant of my Whig sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I often wish that this deplorable practice of duelling might be
      legislated against,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Was there no one at the Coffee House
      with character enough to stop the lads?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was my chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Allen was there,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A devil's plague upon him!&rdquo; shouted my grandfather, beating the floor
      with his stick. &ldquo;And the lying hypocrite ever crosses my path, by gad's
      life! I'll tear his gown from his back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I watched Grafton narrowly. Such as he never turn pale, but he set down
      his tea so hastily as to spill the most of it on the dresser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you astound me, my dear father!&rdquo; he faltered; &ldquo;Mr. Allen a lying
      hypocrite? What can he have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; cried my grandfather, sputtering and red as a cherry with
      indignation. &ldquo;He is as rotten within as a pricked pear, I tell you, sir!
      For the sake of retaining the lad in his tuition he came to me and lied,
      sir, just after I had escaped death, and said that by his influence
      Richard had become loyal, and set dependence upon Richard's fear of the
      shock 'twould give me if he confessed&mdash;Richard, who never told me a
      falsehood in his life! And instead of teaching him, he has gamed with the
      lad at the rectory. I dare make oath he has treated your son to a like
      instruction. 'Slife, sir, and he had his deserts, he would hang from a
      gibbet at the Town Gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I raised up in bed to see the effect of this on my uncle. But however the
      wind veered, Grafton could steer a course. He got up and began pacing the
      room, and his agitation my grandfather took for indignation such as his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dog!&rdquo; he cried fiercely. &ldquo;The villain! Philip shall leave him
      to-morrow. And to think that it was I who moved you to put Richard to
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His distress seemed so real that Mr. Carvel replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Grafton, 'twas not your fault. You were deceived as much as I. You
      have put your own son to him. But if I live another twelve hours I shall
      write his Lordship to remove him. What! You shake your head, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not do,&rdquo; said my uncle. &ldquo;Lord Baltimore has had his reasons for
      sending such a scoundrel&mdash;he knew what he was, you may be sure,
      father. His Lordship, sir, is the most abandoned rake in London, and that
      unmentionable crime of his but lately in the magazines&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; my grandfather interrupted; &ldquo;I have seen it. But I will
      publish him in Annapolis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My uncle's answer startled me, so like was it to the argument Colonel
      Washington himself had used.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you publish, sir? Mr. Allen will reply that what he did was
      for the lad's good, and your own. He may swear that since Richard
      mentioned politics no more he had taken his conversion for granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather groaned, and did not speak, and I saw the futility of
      attempting to bring Grafton to earth for a while yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle had recovered his confidence. He had hoped, so he said, that I
      had become a good loyalist: perchance as I grew older I would see the
      folly of those who called themselves Patriots. But my grandfather cried
      out to him not to bother me then. And when at last he was gone, of my own
      volition I proposed to promise Mr. Carvel that, while he lived, I would
      take no active part in any troubles that might come. He stopped me with
      some vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray God there may be no troubles, lad,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but you need
      give me no promise. I would rather see you in the Whig ranks than a
      trimmer, for the Carvels have ever been partisans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried to express my gratitude. But he sighed and wished me good night,
      bidding me get some rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had scarce finished my breakfast the next morning when I heard a loud
      rat-tat-tat upon the street door-surely the footman of some person of
      consequence. And Scipio was in the act of announcing the names when,
      greatly to his disgust, the visitors themselves rushed into my bedroom and
      curtailed the ceremony. They were none other than Dr. Courtenay and my
      Lord Comyn himself. His Lordship had no sooner seen me than he ran to the
      bed, grasped both my hands and asked me how I did, declaring he would not
      have gone to yesterday's hunt had he been permitted to visit me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; cried the doctor, &ldquo;your fame has sprung up like Jonah's gourd.
      The Gazette is but just distributed. Here's for you! 'Twill set the wags
      a-going, I'll warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew the newspaper from his pocket and began to read, stopping now and
      anon to laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rumour hath it that a Young Gentleman of Quality of this Town, who is
      possessed of more Valour than Discretion, and whose Skill at Fence and in
      the Field is beyond his Years, crossed Swords on Wednesday Night with a
      Young Nobleman from the Thunderer. The Cause of this Deplorable Quarrel,
      which had its Origin at the Ball, is purported to have been a Young Lady
      of Wit and Beauty. (&amp; we doubt it not; for, alas! the Sex hath Much to
      answer for of this Kind.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Gentlemen, with their Seconds, repaired after the Assembly to the
      Coffee House. 'Tis said upon Authority that H-s L-dsh-p owes his Life to
      the Noble Spirit of our Young American, who cast down his Blade rather
      than sheathe it in his Adversary's Body, thereby himself receiving a
      Grievous, the' happily not Mortal, Wound. Our Young Gentleman is become
      the Hero of the Town, and the Subject of Prodigious Anxiety of all the
      Ladies thereof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's for you, my lad!&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;Mr. Green has done for you both
      cleverly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul,&rdquo; I cried, raising up in bed, &ldquo;he should be put in the
      gatehouse for his impudence! My Lord,&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't 'My Lord' me,&rdquo; says Comyn; &ldquo;plain 'Jack' will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no resisting such a man: and I said as much. And took his hand
      and called him 'Jack,' the doctor posing before the mirror the while,
      stroking his rues. &ldquo;Out upon you both,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for a brace of
      sentimental fools!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; said Comyn, presently, with a roguish glance at the doctor,
      &ldquo;there were some reason in our fighting had it been over a favour of Miss
      Manners. Eh? Come, doctor,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you will break your neck looking
      for the reflection of wrinkles. Come, now, we must have little Finery's
      letter. I give you my word Chartersea is as ugly as all three heads of
      Cerberus, and as foul as a ship's barrel of grease. I tell you Miss
      Dorothy would sooner marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she might do worse, my Lord,&rdquo; the doctor flung back, with a strut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and better. But I promise you Richard and I are not such fools as to
      think she will marry his Grace. We must have the little coxcomb's letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have it you must, I suppose,&rdquo; returns the doctor. And with that he
      draws it from his pocket, where he has it buttoned in. Then he took a
      pinch of Holland and began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first two pages had to deal with Miss Dorothy's triumph, to which her
      father made full justice. Mr. Manners world have the doctor (and all the
      province) to know that peers of the realm, soldiers, and statesmen were at
      her feet. Orders were as plentiful in his drawing-room as the candles. And
      he had taken a house in Arlington Street, where Horry Walpole lived when
      not at Strawberry, and their entrance was crowded night and day with the
      footmen and chairmen of the grand monde. Lord Comyn broke in more than
      once upon the reading, crying,&mdash;&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; and,&mdash;&ldquo;My word,
      Mr. Manners has not perjured himself thus far. He has not done her justice
      by half.&rdquo; And I smiled at the thought that I had aspired to such a beauty!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Entre noes, mon cher Courtenay,' Mr. Manners writes, 'entre noes, our
      Dorothy hath had many offers of great advantage since she hath been here.
      And but yesterday comes a chariot with a ducal coronet to our door. His
      Grace of Chartersea, if you please, to request a private talk with me. And
      I rode with him straightway to his house in Hanover Square.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Egad! And would gladly have ridden straightway to Newgate, in a ducal
      chariot!&rdquo; cried his Lordship, in a fit of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I rode to Hanover Square,' the doctor continued, 'where we discussed the
      matter over a bottle. His Grace's generosity was such that I could not but
      cry out at it, for he left me to name any settlement I pleased. He must
      have Dorothy at any price, said he. And I give you my honour, mon cher
      Courtenay, that I lost no time in getting back to Arlington Street, and
      called Dorothy down to tell her.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now may I be flayed,&rdquo; said Comyn, &ldquo;if ever there was such another ass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor took more snuff and fell a-laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But hark to this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here's the cream of it all:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will scarce believe me when I say that the baggage was near beside
      herself with anger at what I had to tell her. 'Marry that misshapen duke!'
      cries she, 'I would quicker marry Doctor Johnson!' And truly, I begin to
      fear she hath formed an affection for some like, foul-linened beggar. That
      his Grace is misshapen I cannot deny; but I tried reason upon her. 'Think
      of the coronet, my dear, and of the ancient name to which it belongs.' She
      only stamps her foot and cries out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Coronet fiddlesticks! And are you not content with the name you bear,
      sir?&rdquo; 'Our name is good as any in the three kingdoms,' said I, with truth.
      'Then you would have me, for the sake of the coronet, joined to a wretch
      who is steeped in debauchery. Yes, debauchery, sir! You might then talk,
      forsooth, to the macaronies of Maryland, of your daughter the Duchess.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's spirit for you, my lad!&rdquo; Comyn shouted; &ldquo;I give you Miss
      Dorothy.&rdquo; And he drained a glass of punch Scipio had brought in, Doctor
      Courtenay and I joining him with a will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you go on, sir,&rdquo; I said to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pest on your impatience!&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;I begin to think you are in love
      with her yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure he is,&rdquo; said Comyn; &ldquo;he had lost my esteem and he were not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor gave me an odd look. I was red enough, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I could say naught, my dear Courtenay, to induce her to believe that his
      Grace's indiscretions arose from the wildness of youth. And I pass over
      the injustice she hath unwittingly done me, whose only efforts are for her
      bettering. The end of it all was that I must needs post back to the duke,
      who was stamping with impatience up and down, and drinking Burgundy. I am
      sure I meant him no offence, but told him in as many words, that my
      daughter had refused him. And, will you believe me, sir? He took occasion
      to insult me (I cannot with propriety repeat his speech), and he flung a
      bottle after me as I passed out the door. Was he not far gone in wine at
      the time, I assure you I had called him out for it.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the doctor, when our merriment was somewhat spent,
      &ldquo;I'll lay a pipe of the best Madeira, that our little fool never knows the
      figure he has cut with his Grace.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVI. IN WHICH SOME THINGS ARE MADE CLEAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Thunderer weighed the next day, Saturday, while I was still upon my
      back, and Comyn sailed with her. Not, however, before I had seen him
      again. Our affection was such as comes not often to those who drift
      together to part. And he left me that sword with the jewelled hilt, that
      hangs above my study fire, which he had bought in Toledo. He told me that
      he was heartily sick of the navy; that he had entered only in respect for
      a wish of his father's, the late Admiral Lord Comyn, and that the
      Thunderer was to sail for New York, where he looked for a release from his
      commission, and whence he would return to England. He would carry any
      messages to Miss Manners that I chose to send. But I could think of none,
      save to beg him to remind her that she was constantly in my thoughts. He
      promised me, roguishly enough, that he would have thought of a better than
      that by the time he sighted Cape Clear. And were I ever to come to London
      he would put me up at Brooks's Club, and warrant me a better time and more
      friends than ever had a Caribbee who came home on a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather kept his word in regard to Mr. Allen, and on Sunday
      commanded the coach at eight. We drove over bad roads to the church at
      South River. And he afterwards declined the voluntary aid he hitherto had
      been used to give to St. Anne's. In the meantime, good Mr. Swain had
      called again, bringing some jelly and cake of Patty's own making; and a
      letter writ out of the sincerity of her heart, full of tender concern and
      of penitence. She would never cease to blame herself for the wrong she now
      knew she had done me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though still somewhat weak from my wound and confinement, after dinner
      that Sunday I repaired to Gloucester Street. From the window she saw me
      coming, and, bare-headed, ran out in the cold to meet me. Her eyes rested
      first on the linen around my throat, and she seemed all in a fire of
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought you would come to-day, when I heard you had been to South
      River,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was struck all of a sudden with her looks. Her face was pale, and I saw
      that she had suffered as much again as I. Troubled, I followed her into
      the little library. The day was fading fast, and the leaping flames behind
      the andirons threw fantastic shadows across the beams of the ceiling. We
      sat together in the deep window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have forgiven me, Richard?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hundred times,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I deserved all I got, and more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had not wronged and insulted you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did neither, Patty,&rdquo; I broke in; &ldquo;I have played a double part for the
      first and last time in my life, and I have been justly punished for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twas I sent you to the Coffee House,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;where you might have
      been killed. How I despise myself for listening to Mr. Allen's tales!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was Mr. Allen!&rdquo; I exclaimed, fetching a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I will tell you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, alarmed at her agitation; &ldquo;another time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must,&rdquo; she answered more calmly; &ldquo;it has burned me enough. You recall
      that we were at supper together, with Betty Tayloe and Lord Comyn, and how
      merry we were, altho' 'twas nothing but 'Dorothy' with you gentlemen. Then
      you left me. Afterwards, as I was talking with Mr. Singleton, the rector
      came up. I never have liked the man, Richard, but I little knew his
      character. He began by twitting me for a Whig, and presently he said: 'But
      we have gained one convert, Miss Swain, who sees the error of his ways.
      Scarce a year since young Richard Carvel promised to be one of those with
      whom his Majesty will have to reckon. And he is now become,'&mdash;laughing,&mdash;'the
      King's most loyal and devoted.' I was beside myself. 'That is no subject
      for jest, Mr. Allen,' I cried; I will never believe it of him!' 'Jest!'
      said he; I give you my word I was never soberer in my life.' Then it all
      came to me of a sudden that you sat no longer by the hour with my father,
      as you used, and you denounced the King's measures and ministers no more.
      My father had spoken of it. 'Tell me why he has changed?' I asked,
      faltering with doubt of you, which I never before had felt. 'Indeed, I
      know not,' replied the rector, with his most cynical smile; unless it is
      because old Mr. Carvel might disinherit a Whig. But I see you doubt my
      word, Miss Swain. Here is Mr. Carroll, and you may ask him.' God forgive
      me, Richard! I stopped Mr. Carroll, who seemed mightily surprised. And he
      told me yes, that your grandfather had said but a few days before, and
      with joy, that you were now of his Majesty's party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I might have foreseen this consequence,&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Nor do I
      blame you, Patty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my father has explained all,&rdquo; Patty continued, brightening. &ldquo;His
      admiration for you is increased tenfold, Richard. Your grandfather told
      him of the rector's treachery, which he says is sufficient to make him
      turn Methodist or Lutheran. We went to the curate's service to-day. And&mdash;will
      you hear more, sir? Or do your ears burn? That patriots and loyalists are
      singing your praises from Town Gate to the dock, and regretting that you
      did not kill that detestable Captain Collinson&mdash;but I have something
      else, and of more importance, to tell you, Richard,&rdquo; she continued,
      lowering her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Mr. Carroll had told me stunned me like a blow, such had been my
      faith in you. And when Mr. Allen moved off, I stood talking to Percy
      Singleton and his Lordship without understanding a word of the
      conversation. I could scarce have been in my right mind. It was not your
      going over to the other side that pained me so, for all your people are
      Tories. But I had rather seen you dead than a pretender and a hypocrite,
      selling yourself for an inheritance. Then you came. My natural impulse
      should have been to draw you aside and there accuse you. But this was
      beyond my strength. And when I saw you go away without a word I knew that
      I had been unjust. I could have wept before them all. Mr. Carroll went for
      his coach, and was a full half an hour in getting it. But this is what I
      would tell you in particular, Richard. I have not spoken of it to a soul,
      and it troubles me above all else: While Maria was getting my cardinal I
      heard voices on the other side of the dressing-room door. The supper-room
      is next, you know. I listened, and recognized the rector's deep tones: 'He
      has gone to the Coffee House,' he was saying; Collinson declares that his
      Lordship is our man, if we can but contrive it. He is the best foil in the
      service, and was taught by&mdash;there! I have forgot the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angelo!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Angelo it was. How did you know?&rdquo; she demanded, rising in her
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angelo is the great fencing-master of London,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I heard that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I had no doubt of your innocence. I ran
      out into the assembly room as I was, in my hood, and tried to find Tom.
      But he&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; I said hurriedly; &ldquo;you could not find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at me in gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How everybody stared at me! But little I cared! 'Twas that gave rise to
      Mr. Green's report. I thought of Percy Singleton, and stopped him in the
      midst of a dance to bid him run as fast as his legs would carry him to the
      Coffee House, and to see that no harm befell you. 'I shall hold you
      responsible for Richard,' I whispered. 'You must get him away from Mr.
      Claude's, or I shall never speak to you again.' He did not wait to ask
      questions, but went at once, like the good fellow he is. Then I rode home
      with Maria. I would not have Mr. Carroll come with me, though he begged
      hard. Father was in here, writing his brief. But I was all in pieces,
      Richard, and so shaken with sobbing that I could tell him no more than
      that you had gone to the Coffee House, where they meant to draw you into a
      duel. He took me up to my own room, and I heard him going out to wake
      Limbo to harness, and at last heard him driving away in our coach. I hope
      I may never in my life spend such another hour as I passed then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light in the sky had gone out. I looked up at the girl before me as
      she stood gazing into the flame, her features in strong relief, her lips
      parted, her hair red-gold, and the rounded outlines of her figure
      softened. I wondered why I had never before known her beauty. Perchance it
      was because, until that night, I had never seen her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leaped to my feet and seized her hands. For a second she looked at me,
      startled. Then she tore them away and ran behind the dipping chair in the
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, Richard!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Did Dorothy but know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy is occupied with titles,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patty's lip quivered. And I knew, blundering fool that I was, that I had
      hurt her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you wrong her!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;believe me when I say that she loves you,
      and you only, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loves me!&rdquo; I retorted bitterly,&mdash;brutally, I fear. &ldquo;No. She may have
      once, long ago. But now her head is turned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She loves you now,&rdquo; answered Patty, earnestly; &ldquo;and I think ever will, if
      you but deserve her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that she went away, leaving me to stare after her in perplexity
      and consternation.

      CHAPTER XVII. SOUTH RIVER
    </h2>
    <p>
      My grandfather's defection from St. Anne's called forth a deal of comment
      in Annapolis. His Excellency came to remonstrate, but to no avail, and Mr.
      Carvel denounced the rector in such terms that the Governor was glad to
      turn the subject. My Uncle Grafton acted with such quickness and force as
      would have served to lull the sharpest suspicions. He forbid the rector
      his house, attended the curate's service, and took Philip from his care.
      It was decided that both my cousin and I were to go to King's College
      after Christmas. Grafton's conduct greatly pleased my grandfather. &ldquo;He has
      behaved very loyally in this matter, Richard.&rdquo; he said to me. &ldquo;I grow to
      reproach myself more every day for the injustice I once did him. He is
      heaping coals of fire upon my old head. But, faith! I cannot stomach your
      Aunt Caroline. You do not seem to like your uncle, lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered that I did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was ever the Carvel way not to forget,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Nevertheless,
      Grafton hath your welfare at heart, I think. His affection for you as his
      brother's son is great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O that I had spoken the words that burned my tongue!
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas fell upon Monday of that year, 1769. There was to be a ball at
      Upper Marlboro on the Friday before, to which many of us were invited.
      Though the morning came in with a blinding snowstorm from the north, the
      first of that winter, about ten of the clock we set out from Annapolis an
      exceeding merry party, the ladies in four coaches-and-six, the gentlemen
      and their servants riding at the wheels. We laughed and joked despite the
      storm, and exchanged signals with the fair ones behind the glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we had scarce got two miles beyond the town gate when a messenger
      overtook us with a note for Mr. Carvel, writ upon an odd slip of paper,
      and with great apparent hurry:
    </p>
    <p>
      HONOURED SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have but just come to Annapolis from New York, with Instructions to put
      into your Hands, &amp; no Others, a Message of the greatest Import.
      Hearing you are but now set out for Upper Marlboro I beg of you to return
      for half an Hour to the Coffee House. By so doing you will be of service
      to a Friend, and confer a Favour upon y'r most ob'd't Humble Servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SILAS RIDGEWAY.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our cavalcade had halted while I read, the ladies letting down the glasses
      and leaning out in their concern lest some trouble had befallen me or my
      grandfather. I answered them and bade them ride on, vowing that I would
      overtake the coaches before they reached the Patuxent. Then I turned
      Cynthia's head for town, with Hugo at my heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patty, leaning from the window of the last coach, called out to me as I
      passed. I waved my hand in return, and did not remember until long after
      the anxiety in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I rode, and I rode hard, I pondered over the words of this letter. I
      knew not this Mr. Ridgeway from the Lord Mayor of London; but I came to
      the conclusion before I had reprised the gate that his message was from
      Captain Daniel. And I greatly feared that some evil had befallen my good
      friend. So I came to the Coffee House, and throwing my bridle to Hugo, I
      ran in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Mr. Ridgeway neither in the long room nor in the billiard room nor
      the bar. Mr. Claude told me that indeed a man had arrived that morning
      from the North, a spare person with a hooked nose and scant hair, in a
      brown greatcoat with a torn cape. He had gone forth afoot half an hour
      since. His messenger, a negro lad whose face I knew, was in the stables
      with Hugo. He had never seen the stranger till he met him that morning in
      State House Circle inquiring for Mr. Carvel, and had been given a shilling
      to gallop after me. Impatient as I was to be gone, I sat me down in the
      coffee room, thinking every minute the man must return, and strongly
      apprehensive that Captain Daniel must be in some grave predicament. That
      the favour he asked was of such a nature as I, and not my grandfather,
      could best fulfil.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, about a quarter after noon, my man comes in with Mr. Claude
      close behind him. I liked his looks less than his description, and the
      moment I clapped eyes on him I knew that Captain Daniel had never chose
      such a messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Richard Carvel,&rdquo; said Mr. Claude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow made me a low bow, which I scarcely returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure, 'sir,&rdquo; he began in a whining voice, &ldquo;that I crave your
      forbearance for this prodigious, stupid mistake I have made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistake!&rdquo; I exclaimed hotly; &ldquo;you mean to say, sir, that you have brought
      me back for nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man's eye shifted, and he made me another bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarce know what to say, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he answered with much humility;
      &ldquo;to speak truth, 'twas zeal to my employers, and methought to you, that
      caused you to retrace your steps in this pestiferous storm. I travel,&rdquo; he
      proceeded with some importance, &ldquo;I travel for Messrs. Rinnell and Runn,
      Barristers of the town of New York, and carry letters to men of mark all
      over these middle and southern colonies. And my instructions, sir, were to
      come to Annapolis with all reasonable speed with this double-sealed
      enclosure for Mr. Carvel: and to deliver it to him, and him only, the very
      moment I arrived. As I came through your town I made inquiries, and was
      told by a black fellow in the Circle that Mr. Carvel was but just left for
      Upper Marlboro with a cavalcade of four coaches-and-six and some dozen
      gentlemen with their servants. I am sure my mistake was pardonable, Mr.
      Carvel,&rdquo; he concluded with a smirk; &ldquo;this gentleman was plainly of the
      first quality, as was he to whom I was directed. And as he was about to
      leave town for I knew not how long, I hope I was in the right in bidding
      the black ride after him, for I give you my word the business was most
      pressing for him. I crave your forgiveness, and the pleasure of drinking
      your honour's health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I barely heard the fellow through, and was turning on my heel in disgust,
      when it struck me to ask him what Mr. Carvel he sought, for I feared lest
      my grandfather had got into some lawsuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it please your honour, Mr. Grafton Carvel,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;your uncle, I
      understand. Unfortunately he has gone to his estate in Kent County,
      whither I must now follow him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bade Mr. Claude summon my servant, not stopping to question the man
      further, such was my resentment against him. And in ten minutes we were
      out of the town again, galloping between the nearly filled tracks of the
      coaches, now three hours ahead of us. The storm was increasing, and the
      wind cutting, but I dug into Cynthia so that poor Hugo was put to it to
      hold the pace, and, tho' he had a pint of rum in him, was near perished
      with the cold. As my anger cooled somewhat I began to wonder how Mr. Silas
      Ridgeway, whoever he was, could have been such a simpleton as his story
      made him out. Indeed, he looked more the rogue than the ass; nor could I
      conceive how reliable barristers could hire such a one. I wished heartily
      that I had exhausted him further, and a suspicion crossed my brain that he
      might have come to Mr. Allen, who had persuaded him to deliver a letter to
      Grafton intended for me. Some foreboding beset me, and I was once close to
      a full mind for going back, and slacked Cynthia's pace to a trot. But the
      thought of the pleasures at Upper Marlboro' and the hope of overtaking the
      party at Mr. Dorsey's place, over the Patuxent, where they looked to dine,
      decided me in pushing on. And thus we came to South River, with the snow
      so thick that we could scarce see ten yards in front of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond, the road winds up the hill'around the end of Mr. Wiley's
      plantation and plunges shortly into the woods, gray and cold indeed
      to-day. At their skirt a trail branches off which leads to Mr. Whey's
      warehouses, on the water's edge a mile or so below. And I marked that this
      path was freshly trodden. I recall a small shock of surprise at this, for
      the way was used only in the early autumn to connect with some fields
      beyond the hill. And then I heard a sharp cry from Hugo and pulled Cynthia
      short. He was some ten paces behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marse Dick!&rdquo; he shouted, the whites of his eyes rolled up. &ldquo;We'se gwine
      to be robbed, Marse Dick.&rdquo; And he pointed to the footprints in the snow;
      &ldquo;somefin done tole Hugo not come to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;Mr. Wiley is making his lazy beggars cut wood
      against Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When in this temper the poor fellow had more fear of me than of aught
      else, and he closed up to my horse's flank, glancing apprehensively to the
      right and left, his teeth rattling. We went at a brisk trot. We know not,
      indeed, how to account for many things in this world, for with. each beat
      of Cynthia's feet I found myself repeating the words South River and
      Marlboro, and seeking in my mind a connection to something gone before.
      Then, like a sudden gust of wind, comes to me that strange talk between
      Grafton and the rector, overheard by old Harvey in the stables at Carvel
      Hall. And Cynthia's ears were pointing forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a quick impulse I loosed the lower frogs of my coat, for my sword was
      buckled beneath, and was reaching for one of the brace of pistols in my
      saddle-bags. I had but released them when Hugo cried out: &ldquo;Gawd, Marse
      Dick, run for yo' life!&rdquo; and I caught a glimpse of him flying down the
      road. As I turned a shot rang out, Cynthia reared high with a rough brute
      of a fellow clinging to her bridle. I sent my charge full into his chest,
      and as he tumbled in the snow I dug my spurs to the rowels.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened then is still a blurred picture in my brain. I know that
      Cynthia was shot from under me before she had taken her leap, and we fell
      heavily together. And I was scarcely up again and my sword drawn, when the
      villains were pressing me from all sides. I remember spitting but one, and
      then I heard a great seafaring oath, the first word out of their mouths,
      and I was felled from behind with a mighty blow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. THE &ldquo;BLACK MOLL&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      I have no intention, my dears, of dwelling upon that part of my adventures
      which must be as painful to you as to me, the very recollection of which,
      after all these years, suffices to cause the blood within me to run cold.
      In my youth men whose natures shrank not from encounter with their enemies
      lacked not, I warrant you, a checkered experience. Those of us who are
      wound the tightest go the farthest and strike the hardest. Nor is it
      difficult for one, the last of whose life is being recorded, to review the
      outspread roll of it, and trace the unerring forces which have drawn for
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some, indeed, traverse this world weighing, before they partake, pleasure
      and business alike. But I am not sure, my children, that they better
      themselves; or that God, in His all-wise judgment, prefers them to such as
      are guided by the divine impulse with which He has endowed them. Far be it
      from me to advise rashness or imprudence, as such; nor do I believe you
      will take me so. But I say unto you: do that which is right, and let God,
      not man, be your interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>
      My narrative awaits me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came to my wits with an immoderate feeling of faintness and sickness,
      with no more remembrance of things past than has a man bereft of reason.
      And for some time I swung between sense and oblivion before an
      overpowering stench forced itself upon my nostrils, accompanied by a
      creaking, straining sound and sweeping motion. I could see nothing for the
      pitchy blackness. Then I recalled what had befallen me, and cried aloud to
      God in my anguish, for I well knew I had been carried aboard ship, and was
      at sea. I had oftentimes heard of the notorious press-gang which supplied
      the need of the King's navy, and my first thought was that I had fallen in
      their clutches. But I wondered that they had dared attack a person of my
      consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no pain. I lay in a bunk that felt gritty and greasy to the touch,
      and my hair was matted behind by a clot of blood. I had been stripped of
      my clothes, and put into some coarse and rough material, the colour and
      condition of which I could not see for want of light. I began to cast
      about me, to examine the size of the bunk, which I found to be narrow, and
      plainly at some distance from the deck, for I laid hold upon one of the
      rough beams above me. By its curvature I knew it to be a knee, and thus I
      came to the caulked sides of the vessel, and for the first time heard the
      rattling thud and swish of water on the far side of it. I had no sooner
      made this discovery, which drew from me an involuntary groan, when a
      ship's lanthorn was of a sudden thrust over me, and I perceived behind it
      a head covered with shaggy hair and beard, and beetling brows. Never had I
      been in such a terrifying presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn my blood and bones, life signals at last! Another three bells gone,
      my silks and laces, and we had given you to the sharks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hung his lanthorn to a hook on the beam, and thrust a case-bottle
      of rum toward me, at the same time biting off a great quid of tobacco. For
      all my alarm I saw that his manner was not unkindly, and as I was
      conscious of a consuming thirst I seized and tipped it eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis no fine Madeira, my blood,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;such as I fancy your palate is
      acquainted with. Yet 'tis as fair a Jamaica as ever Griggs put ashore i'
      the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Griggs!&rdquo; I cried, the whole affair coming to me: Griggs, Upper Marlboro',
      South River, Grafton and the rector plotting in the stalls, and Mr. Silas
      Ridgeway the accomplice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Griggs,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;ye may well repeat it, the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-,
      I'll lay a puncheon he'll be hailing you shortly. Guinea Griggs,
      Gold-Coast Griggs, Smuggler Griggs, Skull-and-Bones Griggs. Damn his soul
      and eyes, he hath sent to damnation many a ship's company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drained what remained of the bottle, took down the lanthorn, and left
      me sufficiently terrified to reflect upon my situation, which I found
      desperate enough, my dears. I have no words to describe what I went
      through in that vile, foul-smelling place. My tears flowed fast when I
      thought of my grandfather and of the dear friends I had left behind, and
      of Dorothy, whom I never hoped to see again. And then, perchance 'twas the
      rum put heart into me, I vowed I would face the matter show this
      cut-throat of a Griggs a bold front. Had he meant to murder me, I
      reflected, he had done the business long since. Then I fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      I awoke, I know not how soon, to discover the same shaggy countenance, and
      the lanthorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canst walk, Mechlin?&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can try, at least,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed pleased at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have courage a-plenty, and, by G&mdash;, you will have need of it all
      with that of a Griggs!&rdquo; He gave me his bottle again, and assisted me down,
      and I found that my legs, save for the rocking of the ship, were steady
      enough. I followed him out of the hole in which I had lain on to a deck,
      which, in the half light, I saw covered with slush and filth. It was
      small, and but dimly illuminated by a hatchway, up the which I pushed
      after him, and then another. And so we came to the light of day, which
      near blinded me: so that I was fain to clap my hand to mine eyes, and
      stood for a space looking about me like a man dazed. The wind, tho'
      blowing stiff, was mild, and league after league of the green sea danced
      and foamed in the morning sunlight, and I perceived that I was on a large
      schooner under full sail, the crew of which were littered about at
      different occupations. Some gaming and some drinking, while on the
      forecastle two men were settling a dispute at fisticuffs. And they gave me
      no more notice, nor as much, than I had been a baboon thrust among them.
      From this indifference to a captive I augured no good. Then my conductor,
      whom I rightly judged to be the mate of this devil's crew, took me roughly
      by the shoulder and bade me accompany him to the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we drew near the topgallant poop there sounded in my ears a noise like
      a tempest, which I soon became aware was a man swearing with a prodigious
      vehemence in a fog-horn of a voice. &ldquo;Sdeath and wounds! Where is that
      dog-fish of a Cockle? Damn his entrails, and he is not come soon, I'll
      mast-head him naked, by the seven holy spritsails!&rdquo; And much more and
      worse to the same tune until we passed the door and stood before him, when
      he let out an oath like the death-cry of a monster.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a short, lean man with a leathery face and long, black ropy hair,
      and beady black eyes that caught the light like a cat's. His looks,
      indeed, would have scared a timid person into a fit; but I resolved I
      would die rather than show the fear with which he inspired me. He was
      dressed in an old navy uniform with dirty lace. His cabin was bare enough,
      being scattered about with pistols and muskets and cutlasses, with a
      ragged pallet in one corner, and he sat behind an oaken table covered with
      greasy charts and spilled liquor and tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So ho, you are risen from the dead, are you, my fine buck? Mr.
      What-do-they-call-you?&rdquo; cried the captain, with a word as foul as any he
      had yet uttered. &ldquo;By the Lord, you shall pay for running my bosun
      through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by the Lord, Captain What's-your-name,&rdquo; I cried back, for the rum I
      had taken had heated me, &ldquo;you and your fellow-rascals shall pay in blood
      for this villanous injury!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Griggs got to his feet and seized his hanger, his face like livid marble
      seamed with blue. And from force of habit I made motion for my sword, to
      make the shameful discovery that I was clothed from head to foot in
      linsey-woolsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-d&mdash;-my soul,&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;if I don't slit you like a herring! The
      devil burn me to a cinder if I don't give your guts to the sharks!&rdquo; And he
      made at me in such a fury that I would certainly have been cut to pieces
      had I not grasped a cutlass and parried his blow, Cockle looking on with
      his jaw dropped like a peak without haulyards. With a stroke of my weapon
      I disarmed Captain Griggs, his sword flying through the cabin window. For
      I made up my mind I would better die fighting than expire at a hideous
      torture, which I doubted not he would inflict, and so I took up a posture
      of defence, with one eye on the mate; despite the kind offices of the
      latter below I knew not whether he were disposed to befriend me before the
      captain. What was my astonishment, therefore, to behold Griggs's truculent
      manner change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avast, my man-o-war,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;blood and wounds! I had more than an eye
      when they brought thee aboard, else I would have killed thee like a
      sucking-pig under the forecastle, as I have given oath to do. By the
      Ghost, you are worth seven of that Roger Spratt whom you sent to hell in
      his boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wherewith Cockle, who for all his terrible appearance stood in a mighty
      awe of his captain, set up a loud laugh, and vowed that Griggs knew a man
      when he spared me, and was cursed for his pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you were contracted to murder me, Captain Griggs?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he replied, a devilish gleam coming into his eye, &ldquo;but I have now
      got you and the money to boot. But harkye, I'll stand by my half of the
      bargain, by G&mdash;. If ever you reach Maryland alive, they may hang me
      to the yardarm of a ship-of-the-line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I live long enough, my dears, I hope some day to write for you the
      account of all that befell me on this slaver, Black Moll, for so she was
      called. 'Twould but delay my story now. Suffice it to say that we sailed
      for a fortnight or so in the West India seas. From some observations that
      fell from the mouth of Griggs I gathered that he was searching for an
      island which evaded him; and each day added to his vexation at not finding
      it. At times he was drunk for forty hours at a stretch, when he would shut
      himself in his cabin and leave his ship to the care of Cockle, who
      navigated with the sober portion of the crew. And such a lousy, brawling
      lot of convicts I had never clapped eyes upon. As for me, I was treated
      indifferently well, though 'twas in truth punishment enough to live in
      that filthy ship, to eat their shins of beef and briny pork and wormy
      biscuit, to wear rough clothes that chafed my skin. I shared Cockle's
      cabin, in every way as dirty a place as the den I had left, but with the
      advantage of air, for which I fervently thanked God.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the mate had some little friendship for me, though he was too
      hardened by the life he had led to care a deal what became of me. He
      encouraged me secretly to continue to beard Griggs as I had begun, saying
      that it was my sole chance of a whole skin, and vowing that if he had had
      the courage to pursue the same course his own back had not been checkered
      like a grating. He told me stories of the captain's cruelty which I dare
      not repeat for their very horror, and indeed I lacked not for instances to
      substantiate what he said; men with their backs beaten to a pulp, and
      others with ears cut off, and mouths slit, and toes missing. So that I
      lived in hourly fear lest in some drunken fit Griggs might command me to
      be tortured. But, fortunately, he held small converse with me, and when
      sober busied himself in trying to find the island and in cursing the fate
      by which it eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I existed, and prayed daily for deliverance. I plied Cockle with
      questions as to what they purposed doing with me, but he was wont to turn
      sulky, and would answer me not a word. But once, when he was deeper in his
      cups than common, he let me know that Griggs was to sell me to a certain
      planter. You may well believe that this did not serve to liven my spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, one morning, Captain Griggs came out of his cabin and climbed
      upon the poop, calling all hands aft to the quarterdeck. Whereupon he
      proceeded to make them a speech that for vileness exceeded aught I have
      ever heard before or since. He finished by reminding them that this was
      the anniversary of the scuttling of the sloop Jane, which had made them
      all rich a year before, off the Canaries; the day that he had sent three
      and twenty men over the plank to hell. Wherefore he decreed a holiday, as
      the weather was bright and the trades light, and would serve quadruple
      portions of rum to every man jack aboard; and they set up a cheer that
      started the Mother Careys astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no language to depict the bestiality of that day; and if I had I
      would think it sin to write of it. The helm was lashed on the port tack,
      the haulyards set taut, and all hands down to the lad who was the cook's
      scullion proceeded to get drunk. I took the precaution to have a hanger at
      my side and to slip one of Cockle's pistols within the band of my
      breeches. I was in an exquisite' agony of indecision as to what manner to
      act and how to defend myself from their drunken brutality, for I well knew
      that if I refused to imbibe with them I should probably be murdered for my
      abstemiousness; and, if I drank, the stuff was so near to alcohol that I
      could not hope to keep my senses. While in this predicament I received a
      polite invitation to partake in the captain's company, which I did not see
      my way clear to refuse, and repaired to the cabin accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There I found Griggs and Cockle seated, and a fair-sized barrel of rum
      between them that the captain had just moved thither. By way of welcome he
      shot at me a volley of curses and bade me to fill up, and through fear of
      offending him I took down my first mug with a fair good grace. Then, in
      his own particular language, he began the account of the capture of the
      Jane, taking care in the pauses to see that my mug was full. But, as luck
      would have it, he got no farther than the boarding by the Black Moll's
      crew, when he fell to squabbling with Cockle as to who had been the first
      man over the side; and while they were settling this difference I grasped
      the opportunity to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maudlin scene that met my eyes on deck defies description; some were
      fighting, others grinning with a hideous laughter, and still others
      shouting tavern jokes unspeakable. And suddenly, whilst I was observing
      these things from a niche behind the cabin door, I heard the captain cry
      from within, &ldquo;The ensign, the ensign!&rdquo; Forgetting his dispute with Cockle,
      he bumped past me and made his way with some trouble to the poop. I
      climbed the ladder after him, and to my horror beheld him in a drunken
      frenzy drag a black flag with a rudely painted skull and cross-bones from
      the signal-chest, and with uncertain fingers toggle it to the ensign
      haulyards and hoist to the peak, where it fluttered grimly in the light
      wind like an evil augur on a fair day. At sight of it the wretches on deck
      fell to shouting and huzzaing, Griggs standing leering up at it. Then he
      gravely pulled off his hat and made it a bow, and turned upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salute it, ye lubberly! Ye are no first-rate here,&rdquo; he thundered. &ldquo;Salute
      the flag!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unless fear had kept me sober, 'tis past my understanding why I was not as
      drunk as he. Be that as it may, I was near as quarrelsome, and would as
      soon have worshipped the golden calf as saluted that rag. I flung back
      some reply, and he lugged out and came at me with a spring like a wild
      beast; and his men below, seeing us fall out, made a rush for the poop
      with knives and cutlasses drawn. Betwixt them all I should soon have been
      in slivers had not the main shrouds offered themselves handy. And up them
      I sprung, the captain cutting at my legs as I left the sheer-pole, and I
      stopped not until I reached the schooner's cross-trees, where I drew my
      cutlass. They pranced around the mast and showered me with oaths, for all
      the world like a lot of howling dogs which had treed a cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to feel somewhat easier, and cried aloud that the first of them
      who came up after me would go down again in two pieces. Despite my warning
      a brace essayed to climb the ratlines, as pitiable an attempt as ever I
      witnessed, and fell to the deck again. 'Twas a miracle that they missed
      falling into the sea. And after a while, becoming convinced that they
      could not get at me, and being too far gone to shoot with any accuracy,
      they tumbled off the poop swearing to serve me in a hundred horrible ways
      when they caught me, and fell again to drinking and quarrelling amongst
      themselves. I was indeed in an unenviable plight, by no means sure that I
      would not be slain out of hand when they became sufficiently sober to
      capture me. As I marked the progress of their damnable orgy I cast about
      for some plan to take advantage of their condition. I observed that a
      stupor was already beginning to overcome a few of them. Then suddenly an
      incident happened to drive all else from my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing less, my dears, than a white speck of sail gleaming on the
      southern horizon!
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour I watched it, now in a shiver of apprehension lest it pass us
      by, now weeping in an ecstasy of joy over a possible deliverance. But it
      grew steadily larger, and when about three miles on our port bow I saw
      that the ship was a brigantine. Though she had long been in sight from our
      deck, 'twas not until now that she was made out by a man on the
      forecastle, who set up a cry that brought about him all who could reel
      thither, Griggs staggering out of his cabin and to the nettings. The sight
      sobered him somewhat, for he immediately shouted orders to cast loose the
      guns, himself tearing the breeching from the nine-pounder next him and
      taking out the tompion. About half the crew were in a liquorish stupor
      from which the trump itself could scarce have aroused them; the rest
      responded with savage oaths, swore that they would boil their suppers in
      the blood of the brigantine's men and give their corpses to the sea. They
      fell to work on the port battery in so ludicrous a manner that I was fain
      to laugh despite the gravity of the situation. But when they came to rig
      the powderhoist and a couple of them descended into the magazine with
      pipes lighted, I was in imminent expectation of being blown as high as a
      kite.
    </p>
    <p>
      So absorbed had I been in these preparations that I neglected to watch the
      brigantine, which I discovered to be standing on and off in a very
      undecided manner, as though hesitating to attack. My spirits fell again at
      this, for with all my inexperience I knew her to be a better sailer than
      the Black Moll. Her master, as Griggs remarked, &ldquo;was no d&mdash;d
      slouching lubber, and knew a yardarm from a rattan cane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finally, about six bells of the watch, the stranger wore ship and bore
      down across our bows, hoisting English colours, at sight of which I could
      scarce forbear a cheer. At this instant, Captain Griggs woke to the fact
      that his helm was still lashed, and bestowing a hearty kick on his
      prostrate quartermaster stuck fast to the pitchy seams of the deck, took
      the wheel himself, and easing off before the wind to bring the vessels
      broadside to broadside, commanded that the guns be shooed to the muzzle,
      an order that was barely executed before the brigantine came within close
      range. Aboard her was all order and readiness; the men at her guns fuse in
      hand, an erect and pompous figure of a man, in a cocked hat, on the break
      of her poop. He raised his hand, two puffs of white smoke darted out, and
      I heard first the shrieking of shot, the broadside came crashing round us,
      one tearing through the mainsail below me, another mangling two men in the
      waist of our schooner, and Griggs gave the order to touch off. But two of
      his guns answered, one of which had been so gorged with shot that it burst
      in a hundred pieces and sent the fellow with the swab to perdition, and
      such a hell of blood and confusion as resulted is indescribable. I saw
      Griggs in a wild fit of rage force the helm down, the schooner flying into
      the wind. And by this time, the brigantine having got round and presented
      her port battery, raked us at a bare hundred yards, and I was the first to
      guess by the tilting forward of the mast that our hull was hit between
      wind and water, and was fast settling by the bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schooner was sinking like a gallipot.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day, with the sea flashing blue and white in the sun, I saw men go to
      death with a curse upon their lips and a fever in their eyes, with murder
      and defiance of God's holy will in their hearts. Overtaken in bestiality,
      like the judgment of Nineveh, five and twenty disappeared from beneath me,
      and I had scarce the time to throw off my cutlass before I, too, was
      engulfed. So expired the Black Moll.

      CHAPTER XIX. A MAN OF DESTINY
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was picked up and thrown into the brigantine's long-boat with a head and
      stomach full of salt water, and a heart as light as spray with the joy of
      it all. A big, red-bearded man lifted my heels to drain me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mon's deid,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; cried I, from the bottom-board. &ldquo;No more dead than you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned over so lustily that he dropped my feet, and I sat up, something
      to his consternation. And they had scarce hooked the ship's side when I
      sprang up the sea-ladder, to the great gaping of the boat's crew, and
      stood with the water running off me in rivulets before the captain
      himself. I shall never forget the look of his face as he regarded my sorry
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now by Saint Andrew,&rdquo; exclaimed he, &ldquo;are ye kelpie or pirate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither, captain,&rdquo; I replied, smiling as the comical end of it came up to
      me, &ldquo;but a young gentleman in misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoots!&rdquo; says he, frowning at the grinning half-circle about us, &ldquo;it's
      daft ye are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there he paused, and took of me a second sizing. How he got at my
      birth behind my tangled mat of hair and wringing linsey-woolsey I know not
      to this day. But he dropped his Scotch and merchant-captain's manner, and
      was suddenly a French courtier, making me a bow that had done credit to a
      Richelieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your servant, Mr.&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Carvel, of Carvel Hall, in his Majesty's province of Maryland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed sufficiently impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your very humble servant, Mr. Carvel. 'Tis in faith a privilege to be
      able to serve a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed me toward his cabin, and then in sharp, quick tones he gave an
      order to his mate to get under way, and I saw the men turning to the
      braces with wonder in their eyes. My own astonishment was as great. And
      so, with my clothes sucking to my body and a trail of water behind me like
      that of a wet walrus, I accompanied the captain aft. His quarters were
      indeed a contrast to those of Griggs, being so neat that I paused at the
      door for fear of profaning them; but was so courteously bid to enter that
      I came on again. He summoned a boy from the round house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a bottle of my French brandy. And my compliments to
      Mr. MacMuir, and ask him for a suit of clothes. You are a larger man than
      I, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;or I would fit you out according to your
      station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was too overwhelmed to speak. He poured out a liberal three fingers of
      brandy, and pledged me as handsomely as I had been an admiral come thither
      in mine own barge, instead of a ragged lad picked off a piratical slaver,
      with nothing save my bare word and address. 'Twas then I had space to note
      him more particularly. His skin was the rich colour of a well-seasoned
      ship's bell, and he was of the middle height, owned a slight, graceful
      figure, tapering down at the waist like a top, which had set off a silk
      coat to perfection and soured the beaus with envy. His movements, however,
      had all the decision of a man of action and of force. But his eye it was
      took possession of me&mdash;an unfathomable, dark eye, which bore more
      toward melancholy than sternness, and yet had something of both. He wore a
      clean, ruffled shirt, an exceeding neat coat and breeches of blue
      broadcloth, with plate burnished buttons, and white cotton stockings.
      Truly, this was a person to make one look twice, and think oftener. Then,
      as I went to pledge him, I, too, was caught for his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;John Paul, of the brigantine John, of Kirkcudbright, in
      the West India trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Paul&mdash;&rdquo; I began. But my gratitude stuck fast in my throat
      and flowed out of my eyes. For the thought of the horrors from which he
      had saved me for the first time swept over me; his own kind treatment
      overcame me, and I blubbered like a child. With that he turned his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoots,&rdquo; says he, again, &ldquo;dinna ye thank me. 'Tis naething to scuttle a
      nest of vermin, but the duty of ilka man who sails the seas.&rdquo; By this,
      having got the better of his emotion, he added: &ldquo;And if it has been my
      good fortune to save a gentleman, Mr. Carvel, I thank God for it, as you
      must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Save for a slackness inside the leg and in the hips, Macbluir's clothes
      fitted me well enough, and presently I reappeared in the captain's cabin
      rigged out in the mate's shore suit of purplish drab, and brass-buckled
      shoes that came high over the instep, with my hair combed clear and tied
      with a ribbon behind. I felt at last that I might lay some claim to
      respectability. And what was my surprise to find Captain Paul buried to
      his middle in a great chest, and the place strewn about with laced and
      broidered coats and waistcoats, frocks and Newmarkets, like any tailor's
      shop in Church Street. So strange they looked in those tropical seas that
      he was near to catching me in a laugh as he straightened up. 'Twas then I
      noted that he was a younger man than I had taken him for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gentlemen from the southern colonies are too well nourished, by far,&rdquo;
       says he; &ldquo;you are apt to be large of chest and limb. 'Odds bods, Mr.
      Carvel, it grieves me to see you apparelled like a barber surgeon. If the
      good Lord had but made you smaller, now,&rdquo; and he sighed, &ldquo;how well this
      skyblue frock had set you off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I am content, and more, captain,&rdquo; I replied with a smile, &ldquo;and
      thankful to be safe amongst friends. Never, I assure you, have I had less
      desire for finery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you may well say that, you who have worn silk all your
      life, and will the rest of it, and we get safe to port. But believe me,
      sir, the pleasure of seeing one of your face and figure in such a coat as
      that would not be a small one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And disregarding my blushes and protests, he held up the watchet blue
      frock against me, and it was near fitting me but for my breadth,&mdash;the
      skirts being prodigiously long. I wondered mightily what tailor had thrust
      this garment upon him; its fashion was of the old king's time, the cuffs
      slashed like a sea-officer's uniform, and the shoulders made carefully
      round. But other thoughts were running within me then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; I cut in, &ldquo;you are sailing eastward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he answered absently, fingering some Point d'Espagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no chance of touching in the colonies?&rdquo; I persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonies! No,&rdquo; said he, in the same abstraction; &ldquo;I am making for the
      Solway, being long overdue. But what think you of this, Mr. Carvel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he held up a wondrous vellum-hole waistcoat of a gone-by vintage, and
      I saw how futile it were to attempt to lead him, while in that state of
      absorption, to topics which touched my affair. Of a sudden the
      significance of what he had said crept over me, the word Solway repeating
      itself in my mind. That firth bordered England itself, and Dorothy was in
      London! I became reconciled. I had no particle of objection to the Solway
      save the uneasiness my grandfather would come through, which was beyond
      helping. Fate had ordered things well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I fell to applauding, while the captain tried on (for he was not
      content with holding up) another frock of white drab, which, cuffs and
      pockets, I'll take my oath mounted no less than twenty-four: another plain
      one of pink cut-velvet; tail-coats of silk, heavily broidered with
      flowers, and satin waistcoats with narrow lace. He took an inconceivable
      enjoyment out of this parade, discoursing the while, like a nobleman with
      nothing but dress in his head, or, perhaps, like a mastercutter, about the
      turn of this or that lapel, the length from armpit to fold, and the number
      of button-holes that was proper. And finally he exhibited with evident
      pride a pair of doeskins that buttoned over the calf to be worn with high
      shoes, which I make sure he would have tried on likewise had he been
      offered the slightest encouragement. So he exploited the whole of his
      wardrobe, such an unlucky assortment of finery as I never wish to see
      again; all of which, however, became him marvellously, though I think he
      had looked well in anything. I hope I may be forgiven the perjury I did
      that day. I wondered greatly that such a foible should crop out in a man
      of otherwise sound sense and plain ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, when the last chest was shut again and locked, and I had
      exhausted my ingenuity at commendation, and my patience also, he turned to
      me as a man come out of a trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Od's fish, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you will be starved. I had forgot your
      state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I owned that hunger had nigh overcome me, whereupon he became very
      solicitous, bade the boy bring in supper at once, and in a short time we
      sat down together to the best meal I had seen for a month. It seemed like
      a year. Porridge, and bacon nicely done, and duff and ale, with the sea
      rushing past the cabin windows as we ate, touched into colour by the
      setting sun. Captain Paul did not mess with his mates, not he, and he gave
      me to understand that I was to share his cabin, apologizing profusely for
      what he was pleased to call poor fare. He would have it that he, and not
      I, were receiving favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he said once, &ldquo;you cannot know what a bit of finery is to
      me, who has so little chance for the wearing of it. To discuss with a
      gentleman, a connoisseur (I know a bit of French, Mr. Carvel), is a
      pleasure I do not often come at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His simplicity in this touched me; it was pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How know you I am a gentleman, Captain Paul?&rdquo; I asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should lack discernment, sir,&rdquo; he retorted, with some heat, &ldquo;if I could
      not see as much. Breeding shines through sack-cloth, sir. Besides,&rdquo; he
      continued, in a milder tone, &ldquo;the look of you is candour itself. Though I
      have not greatly the advantage of you in age, I have seen many men, and I
      know that such a face as yours cannot lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Lowrie, the second mate, came in with a report; and I remarked
      that he stood up hat in hand whilst making it, very much as if Captain
      Paul commanded a frigate. The captain went to a locker and brought forth
      some mellow Madeira, and after the mate had taken a glass of it standing,
      he withdrew. Then we lighted pipes and sat very cosey with a lanthorn
      swung between us, and Captain Paul expressed a wish to hear my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave him my early history briefly, dwelling but casually upon the
      position enjoyed in Maryland by my family; but I spoke of my grandfather,
      now turning seventy, gray-haired in the service of King and province. The
      captain was indeed a most sympathetic listener, now throwing in a question
      showing keen Scotch penetration, and anon making a most ludicrous inquiry
      as to the dress livery our footmen wore, and whether Mr. Carvel used
      outriders when he travelled abroad. This was the other side of the man. As
      the wine warmed and the pipe soothed, I spoke at length of Grafton and the
      rector; and when I came to the wretched contrivance by which they got me
      aboard the Black Moll, he was stalking hither and thither about the cabin,
      his fists clenched and his voice thick, breaking into Scotch again and
      vowing that hell were too good for such as they.
    </p>
    <p>
      His indignation, which seemed real and generous, transformed him into
      another man. He showered question after question upon me concerning my
      uncle and Mr. Allen; declared that he had known many villains, but had yet
      to hear of their equals; and finally, cooling a little, gave it as his
      judgment that the crime could never be brought home to them. This was my
      own opinion. He advised me, before we turned in, to &ldquo;gie the parson a
      Grunt&rdquo; as soon as ever I could lay hands upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The John made a good voyage for that season, with fair winds and clear
      skies for the most part. 'Twas a stout ship and a steady, with generous
      breadth of beam, and kept by the master as clean and bright as his
      porringer. He was Emperor aboard her. He spelt Command with a large C, and
      when he inspected, his jacks stood to attention like man-o'-war's men. The
      John mounting only four guns, and but two of them ninepounders, I
      expressed my astonishment that he had dared attack a pirate craft like the
      Black Moll, without knowing her condition and armament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; says he, impressively, for we had become very friendly, &ldquo;I
      would close with a thirty-two and she flew that flag. Why, sir, a bold
      front is half the battle, using circumspection, of a course. A pretty
      woman, whatever her airs and quality, is to be carried the same way, and a
      man ought never to be frightened by appearances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, at our meals, we discussed politics. But he seemed lukewarm
      upon this subject. He had told me that he had a brother William in
      Virginia, who was a hot Patriot. The American quarrel seemed to interest
      him very little. I should like to underscore this last sentence, my dears,
      in view of what comes after. What he said on the topic leaned perhaps to
      the King's side, tho' he was careful to say nothing that would give me
      offence. I was not surprised, for I had made a fair guess of his
      ambitions. It is only honest to declare that in my soberer moments my
      estimate of his character suffered. But he was a strange man,&mdash;a
      genius, as I soon discovered, to rouse the most sluggish nature to
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The joy of sailing is born into some men, and those who are marked for the
      sea go down thither like the very streams, to be salted. Whatever the
      sign, old Stanwix was not far wrong when he read it upon me, and 'twas no
      great while before I was part and parcel of the ship beneath my feet,
      breathing deep with her every motion. What feeling can compare with that I
      tasted when the brigantine lay on her side, the silver spray hurling over
      the bulwarks and stinging me to life! Or, in the watches, to hear the sea
      lashing along her strakes in never ending music! I gave MacMuir his shore
      suit again, and hugely delighted and astonished Captain Paul by donning a
      jacket of Scotch wool and a pair of seaman's boots, and so became a sailor
      myself. I had no mind to sit idle the passage, and the love of it, as I
      have said, was in me. In a fortnight I went aloft with the best of the
      watch to reef topsails, and trod a foot-rope without losing head or
      balance, bent an easing, and could lay hand on any lift, brace, sheet, or
      haulyards in the racks. John Paul himself taught me to tack and wear ship,
      and MacMuir to stow a headsail. The craft came to me, as it were, in a
      hand-gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first I could make nothing of the crew, not being able to understand a
      word of their Scotch; but I remarked, from the first, that they were sour
      and sulky, and given to gathering in knots when the captain or MacMuir had
      not the deck. For Mr. Lowrie, poor man, they had little respect. But they
      plainly feared the first mate, and John Paul most of all. Of me their
      suspicion knew no bounds, and they would give me gruff answers, or none,
      when I spoke to them. These things roused both curiosity and foreboding
      within me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a watch I paced thro' with MacMuir, big and red and kindly, and I was
      not long in letting him know of the interest which Captain Paul had
      inspired within me. His own feeling for him was little short of idolatry.
      I had surmised much as to the rank of life from which the captain had
      sprung, but my astonishment was great when I was told that John Paul was
      the son of a poor gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gardener's son, Mr. MacMuir!&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; said he, solemnly, &ldquo;a guid man an' haly' was auld Paul. Unco
      puir, by reason o' seven bairns. I kennt the daddie weel. I mak sma' doubt
      the captain'll tak ye hame wi' him, syne the mither an' sisters still be
      i' the cot i' Mr. Craik's croft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, MacMuir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is not the captain in some trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For I knew that something, whatever it was, hung heavy on John Paul's mind
      as we drew nearer Scotland. At times his brow would cloud and he would
      fall silent in the midst of a jest. And that night, with the stars jumping
      and the air biting cold (for we were up in the 40's), and the John
      wish-washing through the seas at three leagues the hour, MacMuir told me
      the story of Mungo Maxwell. You may read it for yourselves, my dears, in
      the life of John Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wae's me!&rdquo; he said, with a heave of his big chest, &ldquo;I reca' as yestreen
      the night Maxwell cam aboord. The sun gaed loon a' bluidy, an' belyve the
      morn rose unco mirk an' dreary, wi' bullers (rollers) frae the west like
      muckle sowthers (soldiers) wi' white plumes. I tauld the captain 'twas a'
      the faut o' Maxwell. I ne'er cad bide the blellum. Dour an' din he was,
      wi' ae girn like th' auld hornie. But the captain wadna hark to my rede
      when I tauld him naught but dool wad cooin o' taking Mungo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that John Paul, contrary to MacMuir's advice, had shipped as
      carpenter on the voyage out&mdash;near seven months since&mdash;a man by
      the name of Mungo Maxwell. The captain's motive had nothing in it but
      kindness, and a laudable desire to do a good turn to a playmate of his
      boyhood. As MacMuir said, &ldquo;they had gaed barefit thegither amang the
      braes.&rdquo; The man hailed from Kirkbean, John Paul's own parish. But he had
      within him little of the milk of kindness, being in truth a sour and
      mutinous devil; and instead of the gratitude he might have shown, he
      cursed the fate that had placed him under the gardener's son, whom he
      deemed no better than himself. The John had scarce cleared the Solway
      before Maxwell showed signs of impudence and rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crew was three-fourths made of Kirkcudbright men who had known the
      master from childhood, many of them, indeed, being older than he; they
      were mostly jealous of Paul, envious of the command he had attained to
      over them, and impatient under the discipline he was ever ready to
      inflict. 'Tis no light task to enforce obedience from those with whom one
      has birdnested. But, having more than once felt the weight of his hand,
      they feared him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dissatisfaction among such spreads apace, if a leader is but given; and
      Maxwell was such a one. His hatred for John Paul knew no bounds, and,
      having once tasted of his displeasure, he lay awake o' nights scheming to
      ruin him. And this was the plot: when the Azores should be in the wake,
      Captain Paul was to be murdered as he paced his quarterdeck in the
      morning, the two mates clapt into irons, and so brought to submission. And
      Maxwell, who had no more notion of navigation than a carpenter should, was
      to take the John to God knows where,&mdash;the Guinea coast, most
      probably. He would have no more navy regulations on a merchant brigantine,
      he promised them, nor banyan days, for the matter o' that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily, MacMuir himself discovered the affair on the eve of its
      perpetration, overhearing two men talking in the breadroom, and he ran to
      the cabin with the sweat standing out on his forehead. But the captain
      would have none of the precautions he urged; declared he would walk the
      deck as usual, and vowed he could cope single-handed with a dozen cowards
      like Maxwell. Sure enough, at crowdie-time, the men were seen coming aft,
      with Maxwell in the van carrying a bowl, on the pretext of a complaint
      against the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Paul,&rdquo; said MacMuir, with admiration in his voice and gesture, &ldquo;John
      Paul wasna feart a pickle, but gaed to the mast, whyles I stannt
      chittering i' my claes, fearfu' for his life. He teuk the horns from
      Mungo, priet (tasted) a soup o' the crowdie, an' wi' that he seiz't haut
      o' the man by baith shouthers ere the blastie (scoundrel) raught for 's
      knife. My aith upo't, sir, the lave (rest) o' the batch cowert frae his
      e'e for a' the wand like thumpit tykes.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So ended that mutiny, by the brave act of a brave man. The carpenter was
      clapt into irons himself, and given no less of the cat-o'-nine-tails than
      was good for him, and properly discharged at Tobago with such as had
      supported him. But he brought Captain Paul before the vice-admiralty court
      of that place, charging him with gross cruelty, and this proceeding had
      delayed the brigantine six months from her homeward voyage, to the great
      loss of her owners. And tho' at length the captain was handsomely
      acquitted, his character suffered unjustly, for there lacked not those who
      put their own interpretation upon the affair. He would most probably lose
      the brigantine. &ldquo;He expected as much,&rdquo; said MacMuir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There be mony aboord,&rdquo; he concluded, with a sigh, &ldquo;as'll muckle gash
      (gossip) when we win to Kirkcudbright.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. A SAD HOME-COMING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Lowrie and Auctherlonnie, the Dumfries bo'sun, both of whom would have
      died for the captain, assured me of the truth of MacMuir's story, and
      shook their heads gravely as to the probable outcome. The peculiar
      water-mark of greatness that is woven into some men is often enough to set
      their own community bitter against them. Sandie, the plodding peasant,
      finds it a hard matter to forgive Jamie, who is taken from the plough next
      to his, and ends in Parliament. The affair of Mungo Maxwell, altered to
      suit, had already made its way on more than one vessel to Scotland. For
      according to Lowrie, there was scarce a man or woman in Kirkcudbrightshire
      who did not know that John Paul was master of the John, and (in their
      hearts) that he would be master of more in days to come. Human nature is
      such that they resented it, and cried out aloud against his cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the voyage I had many sober thoughts of my own to occupy me of the
      terrible fate, from which, by Divine inter position, I had been rescued;
      of the home I had left behind. I was all that remained to Mr. Carvel in
      the world, and I was sure that he had given me up for dead. How had he
      sustained the shock? I saw him heavily mounting the stairs upon Scipicks
      arm when first the news was brought to him. Next Grafton would come
      hurrying in from Kent to Marlboro Street, disavowing all knowledge of the
      messenger from New York, and intent only upon comforting his father. And
      when I pictured my uncle soothing him to his face, and grinning behind his
      bed-curtains, my anger would scald me, and the realization of my
      helplessness bring tears of very bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would I not have given then for one word with that honest and
      faithful friend of our family, Captain Daniel! I knew that he suspected
      Grafton: he had told me as much that night at the Coffee House. Perhaps
      the greatest of my fears was that my uncle would deny him access to Mr.
      Carvel when he returned from the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, when the sun settled red upon the horizon, I would think
      of Patty and my friends in Gloucester Street. For I knew they missed me
      sadly of a Sunday at the supper-table. But it has ever been my nature to
      turn forward instead of back, and to accept the twists and flings of
      fortune with hope rather than with discouragement. And so, as we left
      league after, league of the blue ocean behind us, I would set my face to
      the forecastle. For Dorothy was in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a dazzling morning in March, with the brigantine running like a beagle
      in full cry before a heaping sea that swayed her body,&mdash;so I beheld
      for the first time the misty green of the high shores of Ireland. Ah! of
      what heroes' deeds was I capable as I watched the lines come out in bold
      relief from a wonderland of cloud! With what eternal life I seemed to
      tingle! 'Twas as though I, Richard Carvel, had discovered all this colour;
      and when a tiny white speck of a cottage came out on the edge of the
      cliff, I thought irresistibly of the joy to live there the year round with
      Dorothy, with the wind whistling about our gables, and the sea thundering
      on the rocks far below. Youth is in truth a mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long I was gazing at the shifting coast I know not, for a strange
      wildness was within me that made me forget all else, until suddenly I
      became conscious of a presence at my side, and turned to behold the
      captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis a braw sight, Richard,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but no sae bonnie as auld
      Scotland. An' the wind hands, we shall see her shores the morn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice broke, and I looked again to see two great tears rolling upon
      his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Scotland!&rdquo; he pressed on, heedless of them, &ldquo;God aboon kens what she
      is to me! But she hasna' been ower guid to me, laddie.&rdquo; And he walked to
      the taffrail, and stood looking astern that two men who had come aft to
      splice a haulyard might not perceive his disorder. I followed him,
      emboldened to speak at last what was in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Paul,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;MacMuir has told me of your trouble. My
      grandfather is rich, and not lacking in gratitude,&rdquo;&mdash;here I paused
      for suitable words, as I could not solve his expression,&mdash;&ldquo;you, sir,
      whose bravery and charity will have restored me to him, shall not want for
      friends and money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard me through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he replied with an impressiveness that took me aback,
      &ldquo;reward is a thing that should not be spoken of between gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus he left me, upbraiding myself that I should have mentioned money.
      And yet, I reflected secondly, why not? He was no more nor less than a
      master of a merchantman, and surely nothing was out of the common in such
      a one accepting what he had honestly come by. Had my affection for him
      been less sincere, had I not been racked with sympathy, I had laughed over
      his notions of gentility. I resolved, however, that when I had reached
      London and seen Mr. Dix, Mr. Carvel's agent, he should be rewarded despite
      his scruples. And if he lost his ship, he should have one of my
      grandfather's.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at dinner he had plainly forgot any offence, and I had more cause than
      ever to be puzzled over his odd mixture of confidence and aloofness. He
      talked gayly on a score of subjects,&mdash;on dress, of which he was never
      tired, and described ports in the Indies and South America, in a fashion
      that betrayed prodigious powers of acute observation; nor did he lack for
      wit when he spoke of the rich planters who had wined him, and had me much
      in laughter. We fell into a merry mood, in Booth, jingling the glasses in
      many toasts, for he had a list of healths to make me gasp, near as long as
      the brigantine's articles,&mdash;Inez in Havana and Maraquita in
      Cartagena, and Clotilde, the Creole, of Martinico, each had her separate
      charm. Then there was Bess, in Kingston, the relict of a customs official,
      Captain Paul relating with ingenuous gusto a midnight brush with a
      lieutenant of his Majesty, in which the fair widow figured, and showed her
      preference, too. But his adoration for the ladies of the more northern
      colonies, he would have me to understand, was unbounded. For example, Miss
      Arabella Pope of Norfolk, in Virginia,&mdash;and did I know her? No, I had
      not that pleasure, though I assured him the Popes of Virginia were famed.
      Miss Pope danced divinely as any sylph, and the very memory of her
      tripping at the Norfolk Assembly roused the captain to such a pitch of
      enthusiasm as I had never seen in him. Marvellous to say, his own words
      failed him, and he had recourse to the poets:
    </p>

          &ldquo;Her feet beneath her petticoat
          Like little mice stole in and out,
          As if they feared the light;
          But, oh, she dances such a way!
          No sun upon an Easter-day
          Is half so fine a sight.&rdquo;

    <p>
      The lines, he told me, were Sir John Suckling's; and he gave them
      standing, in excellent voice and elegant gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in particular partial to the poets, could quote at will from Gay
      and Thomson and Goldsmith and Gray, and even from Shakespeare, much to my
      own astonishment and humiliation. Saving only Dr. Courtenay of Annapolis I
      had never met his equal for versatility of speech and command of fine
      language; and, having heard that he had been at sea since the age of
      twelve, I made bold to ask him at what school he had got his knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At none, Richard,&rdquo; he answered with pride, &ldquo;saving the rudiments at the
      Parish School at Kirkbean. Why, sir, I hold it to be within every man's
      province to make himself what he will, and I early recognized in Learning
      the only guide for such as me. I may say that I married her for the
      furtherance of my fortunes, and have come to love her for her own sake.
      Many and many the 'tween-watch have I passed in a coil of rope in the
      tops, a volume of the classics in my hand. And 'my happiest days, when not
      at sea, have been spent in my brother William's little library. He hath a
      modest estate near Fredericksburg, in Virginia, and none holds higher than
      he the worth of an education. Ah, Richard,&rdquo; he added, with a certain
      sadness, &ldquo;I fear you little know the value of that which hath been so
      lavishly bestowed upon you. There is no creation in the world to equal
      your fine gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It struck me indeed as strange that a man of his powers should set store
      by such trumpery, and, too, that these notions had not impaired his
      ability as a seaman. I did not reply. He gave no heed, however, but drew
      from a case a number of odes and compositions, which he told me were his
      own. They were addressed to various of his enamouritas, abounded in
      orrery, and were all, I make no doubt, incredibly fine, tho' not so much
      as one sticks in my mind. To speak truth I listened with a very ill grace,
      longing the while to be on deck, for we were about to sight the Isle of
      Man. The wine and the air of the cabin had made my eyes heavy. But
      presently, when he had run through with some dozen or more, he put them
      by, and with a quick motion got from his chair, a light coming into his
      dark eyes that startled me to attention. And I forgot the merchant
      captain, and seemed to be looking forward into the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark you, Richard,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;mark well when I say that my time will
      come, and a day when the best of them will bow to me. And every ell of
      that triumph shall be mine, sir,-ay, every inch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was his force, which sprang from some hidden fire within him, that I
      believed his words as firmly as they had been writ down in the Book of
      Isaiah. Brimming over with enthusiasm, I pledged his coming greatness in a
      reaming glass of Malaga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alack,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;an' they all had your faith, laddie, a fig for the
      prophecy! Ya maun ken th' incentive's the maist o' the battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was more of wisdom in this than I dreamed of then. Here lay hid the
      very keynote of that ambitious character: he stooped to nothing less than
      greatness for a triumph over his slanderers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose betimes the next morning to find the sun peeping above the wavy
      line of the Scottish hills far up the. Solway, and the brigantine sliding
      smoothly along in the lee of the Galloway Rhinns. And, though the month
      was March, the slopes of Burrow Head were green as the lawn of Carvel Hall
      in May, and the slanting rays danced on the ruffed water. By eight of the
      clock we had crept into Kirkcudbright Bay and anchored off St. Mary's
      Isle, the tide running ebb, and leaving a wide brown belt of sand behind
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Mary's Isle! As we looked upon it that day, John Paul and I, and it
      lay low against the bright water with its bare oaks and chestnuts against
      the dark pines, 'twas perhaps as well that the future was sealed to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul had conned the brigantine hither with a master's hand; but
      now that the anchor was on the ground, he became palpably nervous. I had
      donned again good MacMuir's shore suit, and was standing by the gangway
      when the captain approached me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll ye be doing now, Dickie lad?&rdquo; he asked kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      What indeed! I was without money in a foreign port, still dependent upon
      my benefactor. And since he had declared his unwillingness to accept any
      return I was of no mind to go farther into his debt. I thanked him again
      for his goodness in what sincere terms I could choose, and told him I
      should be obliged if he would put me in the way of working my passage to
      London upon some coasting vessel. But my voice was thick, my affection for
      him having grown-past my understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoots!&rdquo; he replied, moved in his turn, &ldquo;whyles I hae siller ye shallna
      lack. Ye maun gae post-chaise to London, as befits yere station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And scouting my expostulations, he commanded the longboat, bidding me be
      ready to go ashore with him. I had nothing to do but to say farewell to
      MacMuir and Lowrie and Auctherlonnie, which was hard enough. For the
      honest first mate I had a great liking, and was touched beyond speech when
      he enjoined me to keep his shore suit as long as I had want of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will be needing it, MacMuir,&rdquo; I said, suspecting he had no other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haith! I am but a plain man, Mr. Carvel, and ye can sen' back the claw
      frae London, wi' this geordie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slipped a guinea into my hand, but this I positively refused to take;
      and to hide my feelings I climbed quickly over the side and into the stern
      of the boat, beside the captain, and was rowed away through the little
      fleet of cobles gathering about the ship. Twisting my neck for a parting
      look at the John, I caught a glimpse of MacMuir's ungainly shoulders over
      the fokesle rail, and I was near to tears as he shouted a hearty &ldquo;God
      speed&rdquo; after me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we drew near the town of Kirkcudbright, which lies very low at the
      mouth of the river Dee, I made out a group of men and women on the
      wharves. The captain was silent, regarding them. When we had got within
      twenty feet or so of the landing, a dame in a red woollen kerchief called
      out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hae ye done wi' Mungo, John Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;CAPTAIN John Paul, Mither Birkie,&rdquo; spoke up a coarse fellow with a rough
      beard. And a laugh went round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, captain! I'll captain him!&rdquo; screamed the carlin, pushing to the front
      as the oars were tossed, &ldquo;I'll tak aith Mr. Currie'll be captaining him
      for his towmond voyage o' piratin'. He be leukin' for ye noo, John Paul.&rdquo;
       With that some of the men on the thwarts, perceiving that matters were
      likely to go ill with the captain, began to chaff with their friends
      above. The respect with which he had inspired them, however, prevented any
      overt insult on their part. As for me, my temper had flared up like the
      burning of a loose charge of powder, and by instinct my right hand sought
      the handle of the mate's hanger. The beldame saw the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' hae ye murder't MacMuir, John Paul, an' gien's claw to a Buckskin
      gowk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knot stirred with an angry murmur: in truth they meant violence,&mdash;nothing
      less. But they had counted without their man, for Paul was born to ride
      greater crises. With his lips set in a line he stepped lightly out of the
      boat into their very midst, and they looked into his eyes to forget time
      and place. MacMuir had told me how those eyes could conquer mutiny, but I
      had not believed had I trot been thereto see the pack of them give back in
      sullen wonder. And so we walked through and on to the little street
      beyond, and never a word from the captain until we came opposite the sign
      of the Hurcheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you await me here, Richard,&rdquo; he said quite calmly; &ldquo;I mast seek Mr.
      Currie, and make my report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have still the remembrance of that pitiful day in the clean little
      village. I went into the inn and sat down upon an oak settle in a corner
      of the bar, under the high lattice, and thought of the bitterness of this
      home-coming. If I was amongst strangers, he was amongst worse: verily, to
      have one's own people set against one is heaviness of heart to a man whose
      love of Scotland was great as John Paul's. After a while the place began
      to fill, Willie and Robbie and Jamie arriving to discuss Paul's return
      over their nappy. The little I could make of their talk was not to my
      liking, but for the captain's sake I kept my anger under as best I could,
      for I had the sense to know that brawling with a lot of alehouse
      frequenters would not advance his cause. At length, however, came in the
      same sneering fellow I had marked on the wharf, calling loudly for swats.
      &ldquo;Ay, Captain Paul was noo at Mr. Curries, syne banie Alan seed him gang
      forbye the kirk.&rdquo; The speaker's name, I learned, was Davie, and he had
      been talking with each and every man in the long-boat. Yes, Mungo Maxwell
      had been cat-o'-ninetailed within an inch of his life; and that was the
      truth; for a trifling offence, too; and cruelly discharged at some
      outlandish port because, forsooth, he would not accept the gospel of the
      divinity of Captain Paul. He would as soon sign papers with the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Davie was gifted with a dangerous kind of humour which I have heard
      called innuendo, and he soon had the bar packed with listeners who laughed
      and cursed turn about, filling the room to a closeness scarce supportable.
      And what between the foul air and my resentment, and apprehension lest
      John Paul would come hither after me, I was in prodigious discomfort of
      body and mind. But there was no pushing my way through them unnoticed,
      wedged as I was in a far corner; so I sat still until unfortunately, or
      fortunately, the eye of Davie chanced to fall upon me, and immediately his
      yellow face lighted malignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! here be the gentleman the captain's brocht hame!&rdquo; he cried,
      emphasizing the two words; &ldquo;as braw a gentleman as eer taen frae pirates,
      an' nae doubt sin to ae bien Buckskin bonnet-laird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw through his game of getting satisfaction out of John Paul thro'
      goading me, and determined he should have his fill of it. For, all in all,
      he had me mad enough to fight three times over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set aside the gentleman,&rdquo; said I, standing up and taking off MacMuir's
      coat, &ldquo;and call me a lubberly clout like yourself, and we will see which
      is the better clout.&rdquo; I put off the longsleeved jacket, and faced him with
      my fists doubled, crying: &ldquo;I'll teach you, you spawn of a dunghill, to
      speak ill of a good man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A clamour of &ldquo;Fecht! fecht!&rdquo; arose, and some of them applauded me, calling
      me a &ldquo;swankie,&rdquo; which I believe is a compliment. A certain sense of
      fairness is often to be found where least expected. They capsized the fat,
      protesting browsterwife over her own stool, and were pulling Jamie's coat
      from his back, when I began to suspect that a fight was not to the
      sniveller's liking. Indeed, the very look of him made me laugh out&mdash;'twas
      now as mild as a summer's morn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; says Jamie, &ldquo;ye maun fecht wi' a man o' yere ain size.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll lay a guinea that we weigh even,&rdquo; said I; and suddenly remembered
      that I had not so much as tuppence to bless me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily he did not accept the wager. In huge disgust they hustled him from
      the inn and put forward the blacksmith, who was standing at the door in
      his leather apron. Now I had not bargained with the smith, who seemed a
      well-natured enough man, and grinned broadly at the prospect. But they
      made a ring on the floor, I going over it at one end, and he at the other,
      when a cry came from the street, those about the entrance parted, and in
      walked John Paul himself. At sight of him my new adversary, who was
      preparing to deal me out a blow to fell an ox, dropped his arms in
      surprise, and held out his big hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haith! John Paul,&rdquo; he shouted heartily, forgetting me, &ldquo;'tis blythe I am
      to see yere bonnie face ance mair!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' wha are ye, Jamie Darrell,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;to be bangin' yere
      betters? Dinna ye ken gentry when ye see't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A puzzled look spread over the smith's grimy face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentry!&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;nae gentry that I ken, John Paul. Th' fecht be but a
      bit o' fun, an' nane o' my seekin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What quarrel is this, Richard?&rdquo; says John Paul to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth I have no quarrel with this honest man,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I desired
      but the pleasure of beating a certain evil-tongued Davie, who seems to
      have no stomach for blows, and hath taken his lies elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So quiet was the place that the tinkle of the guidwife's needle, which she
      had dropped to the flags, sounded clear to all. John Paul stood in the
      middle of the ring, erect, like a man inspired, and the same strange sense
      of prophecy that had stirred my blood crept over him and awed the rest, as
      tho' 'twere suddenly given to see him, not as he was, but as he would be.
      Then he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, who are my countrymen, who should be my oldest and best friends, are
      become my enemies. You who were companions of my childhood are revilers of
      my manhood; you have robbed me of my good name and my honour, of my ship,
      of my very means of livelihood, and you are not content; you would rob me
      of my country, which I hold dearer than all. And I have never done you
      evil, nor spoken aught against you. As for the man Maxwell, whose part you
      take, his child is starving in your very midst, and you have not lifted
      your hands. 'Twas for her sake I shipped him, and none other. May God
      forgive you! He alone sees the bitterness in my heart this day. He alone
      knows my love for Scotland, and what it costs me to renounce her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had said so much with an infinite sadness, and I read a response in the
      eyes of more than one of his listeners, the guidwife weeping aloud. But
      now his voice rose, and he ended with a fiery vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Renounce her I do,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;now and forevermore! Henceforth I am no
      countryman of yours. And if a day of repentance should come for this evil,
      remember well what I have said to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood for a moment when he had finished, shifting uneasily, their
      tongues gone, like lads caught in a lie. I think they felt his greatness
      then, and had any one of them possessed the nobility to come forward with
      an honest word, John Paul might yet have been saved to Scotland. As it
      was, they slunk away in twos and threes, leaving at last only the good
      smith with us. He was not a man of talk, and the tears had washed the soot
      from his face in two white furrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye'll hae a waught wi' me afore ye gang, John,&rdquo; he said clumsily, &ldquo;for
      th' morns we've paddl' 't thegither i' th' Nith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ale was brought by the guidwife, who paused, as she put it down, to
      wipe her eyes with her apron. She gave John Paul one furtive glance and
      betook herself again to her knitting with a sigh, speech having failed her
      likewise. The captain grasped up his mug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God bless you, Jamie,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye'll be gaen noo to see the mither,&rdquo; said Jamie, after a long space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, for the last time. An', Jamie, ye'll see that nae harm cams to her
      when I'm far awa'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smith promised, and also agreed to have John Paul's chests sent by
      wagon, that very day, to Dumfries. And we left him at his forge, his
      honest breast torn with emotion, looking after us.

      CHAPTER XXI. THE GARDENER'S COTTAGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      So we walked out of the village, with many a head craned after us and many
      an eye peeping from behind a shutter, and on into the open highway. The
      day was heavenly bright, the wind humming around us and playing mad pranks
      with the white cotton clouds, and I forgot awhile the pity within me to
      wonder at the orderly look of the country, the hedges with never a stone
      out of place, and the bars always up. The ground was parcelled off in such
      bits as to make me smile when I remembered our own wide tracts in the New
      World. Here waste was sin: with us part and parcel of a creed. I
      marvelled, too, at the primness and solidity of the houses along the road,
      and remarked how their lines belonged rather to the landscape than to
      themselves. But I was conscious ever of a strange wish to expand, for I
      felt as tho' I were in the land of the Liliputians, and the thought of a
      gallop of forty miles or so over these honeycombed fields brought me to a
      laugh. But I was yet to see some estates of the gentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had it on my tongue's tip to ask the captain whither he was taking me,
      yet dared not intrude on the sorrow that still gripped him. Time and time
      we met people plodding along, some of them nodding uncertainly, others
      abruptly taking the far side of the pike, and every encounter drove the
      poison deeper into his soul. But after we had travelled some way, up hill
      and down dale, he vouchsafed the intelligence that we were making for
      Arbigland, Mr. Craik's seat near Dumfries, which lies on the Nith twenty
      miles or so up the Solway from Kirkcudbright. On that estate stood the
      cottage where John Paul was born, and where his mother and sisters still
      dwelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll juist be saying guidbye, Richard,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and leave them a bit
      siller I hae saved, an' syne we'll be aff to London thegither, for
      Scotland's no but a cauld kintra.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to London with me?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; answered he; &ldquo;this is hame nae mair for John Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made bold to ask how the John's owners had treated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have naught to complain of, laddie,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;both Mr. Beck and
      Mr. Currie bore the matter of the admiralty court and the delay like the
      gentlemen they are. They well know that I am hard driven when I resort to
      the lash. They were both sore at losing me, and says Mr. Beck: I We'll not
      soon get another to keep the brigantine like a man-o'-war, as did you,
      John Paul.' I thanked him, and told him I had sworn never to take another
      merchantman out of the Solway. And I will keep that oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, and added that he never hoped for better owners. In token of
      which he drew a certificate of service from his pocket, signed by Messrs.
      Currie and Beck, proclaiming him the best master and supercargo they had
      ever had in their service. I perceived that talk lightened him, and led
      him on. I inquired how he had got the 'John'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took passage on her from Kingston, laddie. On the trip both Captain
      Macadam and the chief mate died of the fever. And it was I, the passenger,
      who sailed her into Kirkcudbright, tho' I had never been more than a chief
      mate before. That is scarce three years gone, when I was just turned one
      and twenty. And old Mr. Currie, who had known my father, was so pleased
      that he gave me the ship. I had been chief mate of the 'Two Friends', a
      slaver out of Kingston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you were in that trade!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and sorry I am to say it. But a man must live. It was
      no place for a gentleman, and I left of my own accord. Before that, I was
      on a slaver out of Whitehaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know Whitehaven, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said it only to keep the talk going, but I remembered the remark long
      after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;'Tis a fair sample of an English coast town. And I have
      often thought, in the event of war with France, how easy 'twould be for
      Louis's cruisers to harry the place, and an hundred like it, and raise
      such a terror as to keep the British navy at home.&rdquo;

    <p>
      I did not know at the time that this was the inspiration of an admiral and
      of a genius. The subject waned. And as familiar scenes jogged his memory,
      he launched into Scotch and reminiscence. Every barn he knew, and cairn
      and croft and steeple recalled stories of his boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had long been in sight of Criffel, towering ahead of us, whose summit
      had beckoned for cycles to Helvellyn and Saddleback looming up to the
      southward, marking the wonderland of the English lakes. And at length,
      after some five hours of stiff walking, we saw the brown Nith below us
      going down to meet the Solway, and so came to the entrance of Mr. Craik's
      place. The old porter recognized Paul by a mere shake of the head and the
      words, &ldquo;Yere back, are ye?&rdquo; and a lowering of his bushy white eyebrows. We
      took a by-way to avoid the manor-house, which stood on the rising ground
      twixt us and the mountain, I walking close to John Paul's shoulder and
      feeling for him at every step. Presently, at a turn of the path, we were
      brought face to face with an elderly gentleman in black, and John Paul
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Craik!&rdquo; he said, removing his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the gentleman only whistled to his dogs and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, even he!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain, bitterly; &ldquo;even he, who thought
      so highly of my father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hundred yards more and we came to the little cottage nigh hid among the
      trees. John Paul paused a moment, his hand upon the latch of the gate, his
      eyes drinking in the familiar picture. The light of day was dying behind
      Criffel, and the tiny panes of the cottage windows pulsed with the rosy
      flame on the hearth within, now flaring, and again deepening. He sighed.
      He walked with unsteady step to the door and pushed it open. I followed,
      scarce knowing what I did, halted at the threshold and drew back, for I
      had been upon holy ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Paul was kneeling upon the flags by the ingleside, his face buried on
      the open Bible in his mother's lap. Her snowy-white head was bent upon
      his, her tears running fast, and her lips moving in silent prayer to Him
      who giveth and taketh away. Verily, here in this humble place dwelt a love
      that defied the hard usage of a hard world!
    </p>
    <p>
      After a space he came to the door and called, and took me by the hand, and
      I went in with him. Though his eyes were wet, he bore himself like a
      cavalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, this is Mr. Richard Carvell heir to Carvel Hall in Maryland,&mdash;a
      young gentleman whom I have had the honour to rescue from a slaver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed low, such was my respect for Dame Paul, and she rose and
      curtseyed. She wore a widow's cap and a black gown, and I saw in her
      deep-lined face a resemblance to her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; I said, the title coming naturally, &ldquo;I owe Captain Paul a debt I
      can never repay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' him but a laddie!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I'm thankful, John, I'm thankful for
      his mither that ye saved him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no mother, Madam Paul,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and my father was killed in the
      French war. But I have a grandfather who loves me dearly as I love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some impulse brought her forward, and she took both my hands in her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye'll forgive an auld woman, sir,&rdquo; she said, with a dignity that matched
      her son's, &ldquo;but ye're sae young, an' ye hae sic a leuk in yere bonny gray
      e'e that I ken yell aye be a true friend o' John's. He's been a guid sin
      to me, an' ye maunna reek what they say o' him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When now I think of the triumph John Paul has achieved, of the scoffing
      world he has brought to his feet, I cannot but recall that sorrowful
      evening in the gardener's cottage, when a son was restored but to be torn
      away. The sisters came in from their day's work,&mdash;both well-favoured
      lasses, with John's eyes and hair,&mdash;and cooked the simple meal of
      broth and porridge, and the fowl they had kept so long against the
      captain's home-coming. He carved with many a light word that cost him
      dear. Did Janet reca' the simmer nights they had supped here, wi' the
      bumclocks bizzin' ower the candles? And was Nancy, the cow, still i' the
      byre? And did the bees still give the same bonnie hiney, and were the red
      apples still in the far orchard? Ay, Meg had thocht o' him that autumn,
      and ran to fetch them with her apron to her face, to come back smiling
      through her tears. So it went; and often a lump would rise in my throat
      that I could not eat, famished as I was, and the mother and sisters scarce
      touched a morsel of the feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one never failing test of a son, my dears, lies in his treatment of
      his mother, and from that hour forth I had not a doubt of John Paul. He
      was a man who had seen the world and become, in more than one meaning of
      the word, a gentleman. Whatever foibles he may have had, he brought no
      conscious airs and graces to this lowly place, but was again the humble
      gardener's boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But time pressed, as it ever does. The hour came for us to leave, John
      Paul firmly refusing to remain the night in a house that belonged to Mr.
      Craik. Of the tenderness, nay, of the pity and cruelty of that parting, I
      have no power to write. We knelt with bowed heads while the mother prayed
      for the son, expatriated, whom she never hoped to see again on this earth.
      She gave us bannocks of her own baking, and her last words were to implore
      me always to be a friend to John Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we went out into the night and walked all the way to Dumfries in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We lay that night at the sign of the &ldquo;Twa Naigs,&rdquo; where Bonnie Prince
      Charlie had rested in the Mars year(1715). Before I went to bed I called
      for pen and paper, and by the light of a tallow dip sat down to compose a
      letter to my grandfather, telling him that I was alive and well, and
      recounting as much of my adventures as I could. I said that I was going to
      London, where I would see Mr. Dix, and would take passage thence for
      America. I prayed that he had been able to bear up against the ordeal of
      my disappearance. I dwelt upon the obligations I was under to John Paul,
      relating the misfortunes of that worthy seaman (which he so little
      deserved!). And said that it was my purpose to bring him to Maryland with
      me, where I knew Mr. Carvel would reward him with one of his ships,
      explaining that he would accept no money. But when it came to accusing
      Grafton and the rector, I thought twice, and bit the end of the feather.
      The chances were so great that my grandfather would be in bed and under
      the guardianship of my uncle that I forbore, and resolved instead to write
      it to Captain Daniel at my first opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I arose early to discover a morning gray and drear, with a mist falling to
      chill the bones. News travels apace the world over, and that of John
      Paul's home-coming and of his public renunciation of Scotland at the
      &ldquo;Hurcheon&rdquo; had reached Dumfries in good time, substantiated by the arrival
      of the teamster with the chests the night before. I descended into the
      courtyard in time to catch the captain in his watchet-blue frock haggling
      with the landlord for a chaise, the two of them surrounded by a muttering
      crowd anxious for a glimpse of Mr. Craik's gardener's son, for he had
      become a nine-day sensation to the country round about. But John Paul
      minded them not so much as a swarm of flies, and the teamster's account of
      the happenings at Kirkcudbright had given them so wholesome a fear of his
      speech and presence as to cause them to misdoubt their own wit, which is
      saying a deal of Scotchmen. But when the bargain had been struck and John
      Paul gone with the 'ostler to see to his chests, mine host thought it a
      pity not to have a fall out of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So ye be the Buckskin laud,&rdquo; he said, with a wink at a leering group of
      farmers; &ldquo;ye hae braw gentles in America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of sixty or thereabout, with a shrewd but not unkindly face
      that had something familiar in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have discernment indeed to recognize a gentleman in Scotch clothes,&rdquo;
       I replied, turning the laugh on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinna raise ae Buckskin, Mr. Rawlinson,&rdquo; said a man in corduroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rawlinson!&rdquo; I exclaimed at random, &ldquo;there is one of your name in the
      colonies who knows his station better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trowkt!&rdquo; cried mine host, &ldquo;ye ken Ivie o' Maryland, Ivie my brither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my grandfather's miller at Carvel Hall,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Syne ye maun be nane ither than Mr. Richard Carvel. Yere servan', Mr.
      Carvel,&rdquo; and he made me a low bow, to the great dropping of jaws round
      about, and led me into the inn. With trembling hands he took a packet from
      his cabinet and showed me the letters, twenty-three in all, which Ivie had
      written home since he had gone out as the King's passenger in '45. The
      sight of them brought tears to my eyes and carried me out of the Scotch
      mist back to dear old Maryland. I had no trouble in convincing mine host
      that I was the lad eulogized in the scrawls, and he put hand on the very
      sheet which announced my birth, nineteen years since,&mdash;the fourth
      generation of Carvels Ivie had known.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it came that the captain and I got the best chaise and pair in place of
      the worst, and sat down to a breakfast such as was prepared only for my
      Lord Selkirk when he passed that way, while I told the landlord of his
      brother; and as I talked I remembered the day I had caught the arm of the
      mill and gone the round, to find that Ivie had written of that, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      After that our landlord would not hear of a reckoning. I might stay a
      month, a year, at the &ldquo;Twa Naigs&rdquo; if I wished. As for John Paul, who
      seemed my friend, he would say nothing, only to advise me privately that
      the man was queer company, shaking his head when I defended him. He came
      to me with ten guineas, which he pressed me to take for Ivies sake, and
      repay when occasion offered. I thanked him, but was of no mind to accept
      money from one who thought ill of my benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The refusal of these recalled the chaise, and I took the trouble to
      expostulate with the captain on that score, pointing out as delicately as
      I might that, as he had brought me to Scotland, I held it within my right
      to incur the expense of the trip to London, and that I intended to
      reimburse him when I saw Mr. Dix. For I knew that his wallet was not over
      full, since he had left the half of his savings with his mother. Much to
      my secret delight, he agreed to this as within the compass of a
      gentleman's acceptance. Had he not, I had the full intention of leaving
      him to post it alone, and of offering myself to the master of the first
      schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the rain, and the painful scenes gone through but yesterday, and
      the sour-looking ring of men and women gathered to see the start, I was in
      high spirits as we went spinning down the Carlisle road, with my heart
      leaping to the crack of the postilion's whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was going to London and to Dorothy!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. ON THE ROAD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many were the ludicrous incidents we encountered on our journey to London.
      As long as I live, I shall never forget John Paul's alighting upon the
      bridge of the Sark to rid himself of a mighty farewell address to Scotland
      he had been composing upon the road. And this he delivered with such
      appalling voice and gesture as to frighten to a standstill a chaise on the
      English side of the stream, containing a young gentleman in a scarlet coat
      and a laced hat, and a young lady who sobbed as we passed them. They were,
      no doubt, running to Gretna Green to be married.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul, as I have said, was a man of moods, and strangely affected
      by ridicule. And this we had in plenty upon the road. Landlords, grooms,
      and'ostlers, and even our own post-boys, laughed and jested coarsely at
      his sky-blue frock, and their sallies angered him beyond all reason, while
      they afforded me so great an amusement that more than once I was on the
      edge of a serious falling-out with him as a consequence of my merriment.
      Usually, when we alighted from our vehicle, the expression of mine host
      would sour, and his sir would shift to a master; while his servants would
      go trooping in again, with many a coarse fling that they would get no
      vails from such as we. And once we were invited into the kitchen. He would
      be soar for half a day at a spell after a piece of insolence out of the
      common, and then deliver me a solemn lecture upon the advantages of birth
      in a manor. Then his natural buoyancy would lift him again, and he would
      be in childish ecstasies at the prospect of getting to London, and seeing
      the great world; and I began to think that he secretly cherished the hope
      of meeting some of its votaries. For I had told him, casually as possible,
      that I had friends in Arlington Street, where I remembered the Manners
      were established.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arlington Street!&rdquo; he repeated, rolling the words over his tongue; &ldquo;it
      has a fine sound, laddie, a fine sound. That street must be the very acme
      of fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, and replied that I did not know. And at the ordinary of the
      next inn we came to, he took occasion to mention to me, in a louder voice
      than was necessary, that I would do well to call in Arlington Street as we
      went into town. So far as I could see, the remark did not compel any
      increase of respect from our fellow-diners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon more than one point I was worried. Often and often I reflected that
      some hitch might occur to prevent my getting money promptly from Mr. Dix.
      Days would perchance elapse before I could find the man in such a great
      city as London; he might be out of town at this season, Easter being less
      than a se'nnight away. For I had heard my grandfather say that the elder
      Mr. Dix had a house in some merchant's suburb, and loved to play at being
      a squire before he died. Again (my heart stood at the thought), the
      Manners might be gone back to America. I cursed the stubborn pride which
      had led the captain to hire a post-chaise, when the wagon had served us so
      much better, and besides relieved him of the fusillade of ridicule he got
      travelling as a gentleman. But such reflections always ended in my
      upbraiding myself for blaming him whose generosity had rescued me from
      perhaps a life-long misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, on the whole, we rolled southward happily, between high walls and
      hedges, past trim gardens and fields and meadows, and I marvelled at the
      regular, park-like look of the country, as though stamped from one design
      continually recurring, like our butter at Carvel Hall. The roads were
      sometimes good, and sometimes as execrable as a colonial byway in winter,
      with mud up to the axles. And yet, my heart went out to this country, the
      home of my ancestors. Spring was at hand; the ploughboys whistled between
      the furrows, the larks circled overhead, and the lilacs were cautiously
      pushing forth their noses. The air was heavy with the perfume of living
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The welcome we got at our various stopping-places was often scanty indeed,
      and more than once we were told to go farther down the street, that the
      inn was full. And I may as well confess that my mind was troubled about
      John Paul. Despite all I could say, he would go to the best hotels in the
      larger towns, declaring that there we should meet the people of fashion.
      Nor was his eagerness damped when he discovered that such people never
      came to the ordinary, but were served in their own rooms by their own
      servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall know them yet,&rdquo; he would vow, as we started off of a morning,
      after having seen no more of my Lord than his liveries below stairs. &ldquo;Am I
      not a gentleman in all but birth, Richard? And that is a difficulty many
      before me have overcome. I have the classics, and the history, and the
      poets. And the French language, though I have never made the grand tour. I
      flatter myself that my tone might be worse. By the help of your friends, I
      shall have a title or two for acquaintances before I leave London; and
      when my money is gone, there is a shipowner I know of who will give me
      employment, if I have not obtained preferment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The desire to meet persons of birth was near to a mania with him. And I
      had not the courage to dampen his hopes. But, inexperienced as I was, I
      knew the kind better than he, and understood that it was easier for a
      camel to enter the eye of a needle, than for John Paul to cross the
      thresholds of the great houses of London. The way of adventurers is hard,
      and he could scarce lay claim then to a better name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall go to Maryland together, Captain Paul,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and waste no
      time upon London save to see Vauxhall, and the opera, and St. James's and
      the Queen's House and the Tower, and Parliament, and perchance his Majesty
      himself,&rdquo; I added, attempting merriment, for the notion of seeing Dolly
      only to leave her gave me a pang. And the captain knew nothing of Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Richard, you fear I shall disgrace you,&rdquo; he said reproachfully.
      &ldquo;Know, sir, that I have pride enough and to spare. That I can make friends
      without going to Arlington Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was ready to cry with vexation at this childish speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a time will come when they shall know me,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;If they
      insult me now they shall pay dearly for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear captain,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;nobody will insult you, and least of all my
      friends, the Manners.&rdquo; I had my misgivings about little Mr. Marmaduke.
      &ldquo;But we are, neither of us, equipped for a London season. I am but an
      unknown provincial, and you&mdash;&rdquo; I paused for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a sudden realization had come upon me that our positions were now
      reversed. It seemed strange that I should be interpreting the world to
      this man of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I?&rdquo; he repeated bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have first to become an admiral,&rdquo; I replied, with inspiration; &ldquo;Drake
      was once a common seaman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer. But that evening as we came into Windsor, I perceived
      that he had not abandoned his intentions. The long light flashed on the
      peaceful Thames, and the great, grim castle was gilded all over its
      western side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain leaned out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Postilion,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;which inn here is most favoured by gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Castle,&rdquo; said the boy, turning in his saddle to grin at me. &ldquo;But if I
      might be so bold as to advise your honour, the 'Swan' is a comfortable
      house, and well attended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know your place, sirrah,&rdquo; shouted the captain, angrily, &ldquo;and drive us to
      the 'Castle.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy snapped his whip disdainfully, and presently pulled us up at the
      inn, our chaise covered with the mud of three particular showers we had
      run through that day. And, as usual, the landlord, thinking he was about
      to receive quality, came scraping to the chaise door, only to turn with a
      gesture of disgust when he perceived John Paul's sea-boxes tied on behind,
      and the costume of that hero, as well as my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain demanded a room. But mine host had turned his back, when
      suddenly a thought must have struck him, for he wheeled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he cried, glancing suspiciously at the sky-blue frock; &ldquo;if you are
      Mr. Dyson's courier, I have reserved a suite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This same John Paul, who was like iron with mob and mutiny, was pitiably
      helpless before such a prop of the aristocracy. He flew into a rage, and
      rated the landlord in Scotch and English, and I was fain to put my tongue
      in my cheek and turn my back that my laughter might not anger him the
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I came face to face with another smile, behind a spying-glass,&mdash;a
      smile so cynical and unpleasant withal that my own was smothered. A tall
      and thin gentleman, who had come out of the inn without a hat, was
      surveying the dispute with a keen delight. He was past the middle age. His
      clothes bore that mark which distinguishes his world from the other, but
      his features were so striking as to hold my attention unwittingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while he withdrew his glass, cast one look at me which might have
      meant anything, and spoke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, my good Goble, why all this fol-de-rol about admitting a gentleman
      to your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I scarce know which was the more astonished, the landlord, John Paul, or
      I. Goble bowed at the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman, your honour!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Your honour is joking again.
      Surely this trumpery Scotchman in Jews' finery is no gentleman, nor the
      longshore lout he has got with him. They may go to the 'Swan.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jews' finery!&rdquo; shouted the captain, with his fingers on his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the stranger held up a hand deprecatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Pon my oath, Goble, I gave you credit for more penetration,&rdquo; he drawled;
      &ldquo;you may be right about the Scotchman, but your longshore lout has had
      both birth and breeding, or I know nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Paul, who was in the act of bowing to the speaker, remained petrified
      with his hand upon his heart, entirely discomfited. The landlord forsook
      him instantly for me, then stole a glance at his guest to test his
      seriousness, and looked at my face to see how greatly it were at variance
      with my clothes. The temptation to lay hands on the cringing little
      toadeater grew too strong for me, and I picked him up by the scruff of the
      collar,&mdash;he was all skin and bones,&mdash;and spun him round like a
      corpse upon a gibbet, while he cried mercy in a voice to wake the dead.
      The slim gentleman under the sign laughed until he held his sides, with a
      heartiness that jarred upon me. It did not seem to fit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Hercules and Vulcan,&rdquo; he cried, when at last I had set the landlord
      down, &ldquo;what an arm and back the lad has! He must have the best in the
      house, Goble, and sup with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goble pulled himself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is your honour's friend,&rdquo; he began, with a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, he is my friend, I tell you,&rdquo; retorted the important personage,
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The innkeeper, sulky, half-satisfied, yet fearing to offend, welcomed us
      with what grace he could muster, and we were shown to &ldquo;The Fox and the
      Grapes,&rdquo; a large room in the rear of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Paul had not spoken since the slim gentleman had drawn the
      distinction between us, and I knew that the affront was rankling in his
      breast. He cast himself into a chair with such an air of dejection as made
      me pity him from my heart. But I had no consolation to offer. His first
      words, far from being the torrent of protest I looked for, almost startled
      me into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can be nothing less than a duke,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Ah, Richard, see
      what it is to be a gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddlesticks! I had rather own your powers than the best title in
      England,&rdquo; I retorted sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head sorrowfully, which made me wonder the more that a man of
      his ability should be unhappy without this one bauble attainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall begin to believe the philosophers have the right of it,&rdquo; he
      remarked presently. &ldquo;Have you ever read anything of Monsieur Rousseau's,
      Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were scarce out of his mouth when we heard a loud rap on the
      door, which I opened to discover a Swiss fellow in a private livery, come
      to say that his master begged the young gentleman would sup with him. The
      man stood immovable while he delivered this message, and put an impudent
      emphasis upon the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say to your master, whoever he may be,&rdquo; I replied, in some heat at the
      man's sneer, &ldquo;that I am travelling with Captain Paul. That any invitation
      to me must include him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lackey stood astounded at my answer, as though he had not heard
      aright. Then he retired with less assurance than he had come, and John
      Paul sprang to his feet and laid his hands upon my shoulders, as was his
      wont when affected. He reproached himself for having misjudged me, and
      added a deal more that I have forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that you have forgone supping with a nobleman
      on my account!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish, captain, 'tis no great denial. His Lordship&mdash;if Lordship he is&mdash;is
      stranded in an inn, overcome with ennui, and must be amused. That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless I think the good captain was distinctly disappointed, not
      alone because I gave up what in his opinion was a great advantage, but
      likewise because I could have regaled him on my return with an account of
      the meal. For it must be borne in mind, my dears, that those days are not
      these, nor that country this one. And in judging Captain Paul it must be
      remembered that rank inspired a vast respect when King George came to the
      throne. It can never be said of John Paul that he lacked either
      independence or spirit. But a nobleman was a nobleman then.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when presently the gentleman himself appeared smiling at our door,
      which his servant had left open, we both of us rose up in astonishment and
      bowed very respectfully, and my face burned at the thought of the message
      I had sent him. For, after all, the captain was but twenty-one and I
      nineteen, and the distinguished unknown at least fifty. He took a pinch of
      snuff and brushed his waistcoat before he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad,&rdquo; said he, with good nature, looking up at me, &ldquo;Mohammed was a
      philosopher, and so am I, and come to the mountain. 'Tis worth crossing an
      inn in these times to see a young man whose strength has not been wasted
      upon foppery. May I ask your name, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Carvel,&rdquo; I answered, much put aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Carvel,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;I know three or four of that name. Perhaps you
      are Robert Carvel's son, of Yorkshire. But what the devil do you do in
      such clothes? I was resolved to have you though I am forced to take a
      dozen watchet-blue mountebanks in the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I warn you not to insult my friend,&rdquo; I cried, in a temper again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, not so loud, I beg you,&rdquo; said he, with a gesture. &ldquo;Hot as
      pounded pepper,&mdash;but all things are the better for a touch of it. I
      had no intention of insulting the worthy man, I give my word. I must have
      my joke, sir. No harm meant.&rdquo; And he nodded at John Paul, who looked as if
      he would sink through the floor. &ldquo;Robert Carvel is as testy as the devil
      with the gout, and you are not unlike him in feature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is no relation of mine,&rdquo; I replied, undecided whether to laugh or be
      angry. And then I added, for I was very young, &ldquo;I am an American, and heir
      to Carvel Hall in Maryland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, lord, I might have known,&rdquo; exclaimed he. &ldquo;Once I had the honour of
      dining with your Dr. Franklin, from Pennsylvania. He dresses for all the
      world like you, only worse, and wears a hat I would not be caught under at
      Bagnigge Wells, were I so imprudent as to go there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Franklin has weightier matters than hats to occupy him, sir,&rdquo; I
      retorted. For I was determined to hold my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a French gesture, a shrug of his thin shoulders, which caused me
      to suspect he was not always so good-natured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Franklin would better have stuck to his newspaper, my young friend,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;But I like your appearance too well to quarrel with you, and
      we'll have no politics before eating. Come, gentlemen, come! Let us see
      what Goble has left after his shaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck off with something of a painful gait, which he explained was
      from the gout. And presently we arrived at his parlour, where supper was
      set out for us. I had not tasted its equal since I left Maryland. We sat
      down to a capon stuffed with eggs, and dainty sausages, and hot rolls,
      such as we had at home; and a wine which had cobwebbed and mellowed under
      the Castle Inn for better than twenty years. The personage did not drink
      wine. He sent his servant to quarrel with Goble because he had not been
      given iced water. While he was tapping on the table I took occasion to
      observe him. His was a physiognomy to strike the stranger, not by reason
      of its nobility, but because of its oddity. He had a prodigious length of
      face, the nose long in proportion, but not prominent. The eyes were dark,
      very bright, and wide apart, with little eyebrows dabbed over them at a
      slanting angle. The thin-lipped mouth rather pursed up, which made his
      smile the contradiction it was. In short, my dears, while I do not lay
      claim to the reading of character, it required no great astuteness to
      perceive the scholar, the man of the world, and the ascetic&mdash;and all
      affected. His conversation bore out the summary. It astonished us. It
      encircled the earth, embraced history and letters since the world began.
      And added to all this, he had a thousand anecdotes on his tongue's tip.
      His words he chose with too great a nicety; his sentences were of a
      foreign formation, twisted around; and his stories were illustrated with
      French gesticulations. He threw in quotations galore, in Latin, and
      French, and English, until the captain began casting me odd, uncomfortable
      looks, as though he wished himself well out of the entertainment. Indeed,
      poor John Paul's perturbation amused me more than the gentleman's
      anecdotes. To be ill at ease is discouraging to any one, but it was
      peculiarly fatal with the captain. This arch-aristocrat dazzled him. When
      he attempted to follow in the same vein he would get lost. And his really
      considerable learning counted for nothing. He reached the height of his
      mortification when the slim gentleman dropped his eyelids and began to
      yawn. I was wickedly delighted. He could not have been better met. Another
      such encounter, and I would warrant the captain's illusions concerning the
      gentry to go up in smoke. Then he might come to some notion of his own
      true powers. As for me, I enjoyed the supper which our host had insisted
      upon our partaking, drank his wine, and paid him very little attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I make so bold as to ask, sir, whether you are a patron of
      literature?&rdquo; said the captain, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very poor patron, my dear man,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Merely a humble
      worshipper at the shrine. And I might say that I partake of its benefits
      as much as a gentleman may. And yet,&rdquo; he added, with a laugh and a cough,
      &ldquo;those silly newspapers and magazines insist on calling me a literary
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that you have indulged in a question, and the claret is coming
      on,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;perhaps you will tell me something of yourself, Mr. Carvel,
      and of your friend, Captain Paul. And how you come to be so far from
      home.&rdquo; And he settled himself comfortably to listen, as a man who has
      bought his right to an opera box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was my chance. And I resolved that if I did not further enlighten
      John Paul, it would be no fault of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; I replied, in as dry a monotone as I could assume, &ldquo;I was kidnapped
      by the connivance of some unscrupulous persons in my colony, who had
      designs upon my grandfather's fortune. I was taken abroad in a slaver and
      carried down to the Caribbean seas, when I soon discovered that the
      captain and his crew were nothing less than pirates. For one day all hands
      got into a beastly state of drunkenness, and the captain raised the skull
      and cross-bones, which he had handy in his chest. I was forced to climb
      the main rigging in order to escape being hacked to pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat bolt upright, those little eyebrows of his gone up full half an
      inch, and he raised his thin hands with an air of incredulity. John Paul
      was no less astonished at my little ruse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Saint Clement!&rdquo; exclaimed our host; &ldquo;pirates! This begins to have a
      flavour indeed. And yet you do not seem to be a lad with an imagination.
      Egad, Mr. Carvel, I had put you down for one who might say, with Alceste:
      'Etre franc et sincere est mon plus grand talent.' But pray go on, sir.
      You have but to call for pen and ink to rival Mr. Fielding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that I pushed back my chair, got up from the table, and made him a
      bow. And the captain, at last seeing my drift, did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not used at home to have my word doubted, sir,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Sir, your
      humble servant. I wish you a very good evening.&rdquo; He rose precipitately,
      crying out from his gout, and laid a hand upon my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Mr. Carvel, pray, sir, be seated,&rdquo; he said, in some agitation.
      &ldquo;Remember that the story is unusual, and that I have never clapped eyes on
      you until to-night. Are all young gentlemen from Maryland so fiery? But I
      should have known from your face that you are incapable of deceit. Pray be
      seated, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was persuaded to go on, not a little delighted that I had scored my
      point, and broken down his mask of affectation and careless cynicism. I
      told my story, leaving out the family history involved, and he listened
      with every mark of attention and interest. Indeed, to my surprise, he
      began to show some enthusiasm, of which sensation I had not believed him
      capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a find! what a find!&rdquo; he continued to exclaim, when I had finished.
      &ldquo;And true. You say it is true, Mr. Carvel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I thought we had thrashed that out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, to be sure. I beg pardon,&rdquo; said he. And then to his servant:
      &ldquo;Colomb, is my writing-tablet unpacked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was more mystified than ever as to his identity. Was he going to put the
      story in a magazine?
    </p>
    <p>
      After that he seemed plainly anxious to be rid of us. I bade him good
      night, and he grasped my hand warmly enough. Then he turned to the captain
      in his most condescending manner. But a great change had come over John
      Paul. He was ever quick to see and to learn, and I rejoiced to remark that
      he did not bow over the hand, as he might have done two hours since. He
      was again Captain Paul, the man, who fought his way on his own merits. He
      held himself as tho' he was once more pacing the deck of the John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slim gentleman poured the width of a finger of claret in his glass,
      soused it with water, and held it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's to your future, my good captain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and to Mr. Carvel's
      safe arrival home again. When you get to town, Mr. Carvel, don't fail to
      go to Davenport, who makes clothes for most of us at Almack's, and let him
      remodel you. I wish to God he might get hold of your doctor. And put up at
      the Star and Garter in Pall Mall: I take it that you have friends in
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied that I had. But he did not push the inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should write out this history for your grandchildren, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he
      added, as he bade his Swiss light us to our room. &ldquo;A strange yarn indeed,
      captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore,&rdquo; said the captain, coolly, &ldquo;as a stranger give it welcome.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;'There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
     Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Had a meteor struck at the gentleman's feet, he could not have been more
      taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! What's this?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You quote Hamlet! And who the devil are
      you, sir, that you know my name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name, sir!&rdquo; exclaims the captain, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said, stepping back and eying us closely, &ldquo;'tis no
      matter. Good night, gentlemen, good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And we went to bed with many a laugh over the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name must be Horatio. We'll discover it in the morning,&rdquo; said John
      Paul.

      CHAPTER XXIII. LONDON TOWN
    </h2>
    <p>
      But he had not risen when we set out, nor would the illnatured landlord
      reveal his name. It mattered little to me, since I desired to forget him
      as quickly as possible. For here was one of my own people of quality, a
      gentleman who professed to believe what I told him, and yet would do no
      more for me than recommend me an inn and a tailor; while a poor
      sea-captain, driven from his employment and his home, with no better
      reason to put faith in my story, was sharing with me his last penny.
      Goble, in truth, had made us pay dearly for our fun with him, and the hum
      of the vast unknown fell upon our ears with the question of lodging still
      unsettled. The captain was for going to the Star and Garter, the inn the
      gentleman had mentioned. I was in favour of seeking a more modest and less
      fashionable hostelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember that you must keep up your condition, Richard,&rdquo; said John Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if all English gentlemen are like our late friend,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I would
      rather stay in a city coffee-house. Remember that you have only two
      guineas left after paying for the chaise, and that Mr. Dix may be out of
      town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your friends in Arlington Street?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May be back in Maryland,&rdquo; said I; and added inwardly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have twice the chance at the Star and Garter. They will want a
      show of gold at a humbler place, and at the Star we may carry matters with
      a high hand. Pick out the biggest frigate,&rdquo; he cried, for the tenth time,
      at least, &ldquo;or the most beautiful lady, and it will surprise you, my lad,
      to find out how many times you will win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I know of no feeling of awe to equal that of a stranger approaching for
      the first time a huge city. The thought of a human multitude is ever
      appalling as that of infinity itself, a human multitude with its infinity
      of despairs and joys, disgraces and honours, each small unit with all the
      world in its own brain, and all the world out of it! Each intent upon his
      own business or pleasure, and striving the while by hook or crook to keep
      the ground from slipping beneath his feet. For, if he falls, God help him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, here was London, great and pitiless, and the fear of it was upon our
      souls as we rode into it that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holland House with its shaded gardens, Kensington Palace with the broad
      green acres of parks in front of it stitched by the silver Serpentine, and
      Buckingham House, which lay to the south over the hill,&mdash;all were one
      to us in wonder as they loomed through the glittering mist that softened
      all. We met with a stream of countless wagons that spoke of a trade beyond
      knowledge, sprinkled with the equipages of the gentry floating upon it;
      coach and chaise, cabriolet and chariot, gorgeously bedecked with heraldry
      and wreaths; their numbers astonished me, for to my mind the best of them
      were no better than we could boast in Annapolis. One matter, which brings
      a laugh as I recall it, was the oddity to me of seeing white coachmen and
      footmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      We clattered down St. James's Street, of which I had often heard my
      grandfather speak, and at length we drew up before the Star and Garter in
      Pall Mall, over against the palace. The servants came hurrying out, headed
      by a chamberlain clad in magnificent livery, a functionary we had not
      before encountered. John Paul alighted to face this personage, who, the
      moment he perceived us, shifted his welcoming look to one of such
      withering scorn as would have daunted a more timid man than the captain.
      Without the formality of a sir he demanded our business, which started the
      inn people and our own boy to snickering, and made the passers-by pause
      and stare. Dandies who were taking the air stopped to ogle us with their
      spying-glasses and to offer quips, and behind them gathered the flunkies
      and chairmen awaiting their masters at the clubs and coffee-houses near
      by. What was my astonishment, therefore, to see a change in the captain's
      demeanour. Truly for quick learning and the application of it I have never
      known his equal. His air became the one of careless ease habitual to the
      little gentleman we had met at Windsor, and he drew from his pocket one of
      his guineas, which he tossed in the man's palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, my man,&rdquo; said he, snapping his fingers; &ldquo;an apartment at once, or
      you shall pay for this nonsense, I promise you.&rdquo; And walked in with his
      chin in the air, so grandly as to dissolve ridicule into speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant the chamberlain wavered, and I trembled, for I dreaded a
      disgrace in Pall Mall, where the Manners might hear of it. Then fear, or
      hope of gain, or something else got the better of him, for he led us to a
      snug, well-furnished suite of a parlour and bedroom on the first floor,
      and stood bowing in the doorway for his honour's further commands. They
      were of a sort to bring the sweat to my forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a fellow run to bid Davenport, the tailor, come hither as fast as
      his legs will carry him. And you may make it known that this young
      gentleman desires a servant, a good man, mind you, with references, who
      knows a gentleman's wants. He will be well paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That name of Davenport was a charm,&mdash;the mention of a servant was its
      finishing touch. The chamberlain bent almost double, and retired, closing
      the door softly behind him. And so great had been my surprise over these
      last acquirements of the captain that until now I had had no breath to
      expostulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have my fling, Richard,&rdquo; he answered, laughing; &ldquo;I shall not be a
      gentleman long. I must know how it feels to take your ease, and stroke
      your velvet, and order lackeys about. And when my money is gone I shall be
      content to go to sea again, and think about it o' stormy nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This feeling was so far beyond my intelligence that I made no comment. And
      I could not for the life of me chide him, but prayed that all would come
      right in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than an hour Davenport himself arrived, bristling with importance,
      followed by his man carrying such a variety of silks and satins, flowered
      and plain, and broadcloths and velvets, to fill the furniture. And close
      behind the tailor came a tall haberdasher from Bond Street, who had got
      wind of a customer, with a bewildering lot of ruffles and handkerchiefs
      and neckerchiefs, and bows of lawn and lace which (so he informed us)
      gentlemen now wore in the place of solitaires. Then came a hosier and a
      bootmaker and a hatter; nay, I was forgetting a jeweller from Temple Bar.
      And so imposing a front did the captain wear as he picked this and
      recommended the other that he got credit for me for all he chose, and
      might have had more besides. For himself he ordered merely a modest street
      suit of purple, the sword to be thrust through the pocket, Davenport
      promising it with mine for the next afternoon. For so much discredit had
      been cast upon his taste on the road to London that he was resolved to
      remain indoors until he could appear with decency. He learned quickly, as
      I have said.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time we had done with these matters, which I wished to perdition,
      some score of applicants was in waiting for me. And out of them I hired
      one who had been valet to the young Lord Rereby, and whose recommendation
      was excellent. His name was Banks, his face open and ingenuous, his
      stature a little above the ordinary, and his manner respectful. I had
      Davenport measure him at once for a suit of the Carvel livery, and bade
      him report on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while, my dears, I was aching to be off to Arlington Street, but
      a foolish pride held me back. I had heard so much of the fashion in which
      the Manners moved that I feared to bring ridicule upon them in poor
      MacMuir's clothes. But presently the desire to see Dolly took such hold
      upon me that I set out before dinner, fought my way past the chairmen and
      chaisemen at the door, and asked my way of the first civil person I
      encountered. 'Twas only a little rise up the steps of St. James's Street,
      Arlington Street being but a small pocket of Piccadilly, but it seemed a
      dull English mile; and my heart thumped when I reached the corner, and the
      houses danced before my eyes. I steadied myself by a post and looked
      again. At last, after a thousand leagues of wandering, I was near her! But
      how to choose between fifty severe and imposing mansions? I walked on
      toward that endless race of affairs and fashion, Piccadilly, scanning
      every door, nay, every window, in the hope that I might behold my lady's
      face framed therein. Here a chair was set down, there a chariot or a coach
      pulled up, and a clocked flunky bowing a lady in. But no Dorothy. Finally,
      when I had near made the round of each side, I summoned courage and asked
      a butcher's lad, whistling as he passed me, whether he could point out the
      residence of Mr. Manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he replied, looking me over out of the corner of his eye, &ldquo;that I
      can. But y'ell not get a glimpse o' the beauty this day, for she's but
      just off to Kensington with a coachful o' quality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he led me, all in a tremble over his answer, to a large stone dwelling
      with arched windows, and pillared portico with lanthorns and link
      extinguishers, an area and railing beside it. The flavour of generations
      of aristocracy hung about the place, and the big knocker on the carved
      door seemed to regard with such a forbidding frown my shabby clothes that
      I took but the one glance (enough to fix it forever in my memory), and
      hurried on. Alas, what hope had I of Dorothy now!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cheer, Richard?&rdquo; cried the captain when I returned; &ldquo;have you seen
      your friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him that I had feared to disgrace them, and so refrained from
      knocking&mdash;a decision which he commended as the very essence of
      wisdom. Though a desire to meet and talk with quality pushed him hard, he
      would not go a step to the ordinary, and gave orders to be served in our
      room, thus fostering the mystery which had enveloped us since our arrival.
      Dinner at the Star and Garter being at the fashionable hour of half after
      four, I was forced to give over for that day the task of finding Mr. Dix.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening&mdash;shall I confess it?&mdash;I spent between the Green
      Park and Arlington Street, hoping for a glimpse of Miss Dolly returning
      from Kensington.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning I proclaimed my intention of going to Mr. Dix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send for him,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Gentlemen never seek their men of
      affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;I can contain myself in this place no longer. I must be
      moving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will, Richard,&rdquo; he replied, and giving me a queer, puzzled look he
      settled himself between the Morning Post and the Chronicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I passed the servants in the lower hall, I could not but remark an
      altered treatment. My friend the chamberlain, more pompous than ever,
      stood erect in the door with a stony stare, which melted the moment he
      perceived a young gentleman who descended behind me. I heard him cry out
      &ldquo;A chaise for his Lordship!&rdquo; at which command two of his assistants ran
      out together. Suspicion had plainly gripped his soul overnight, and this,
      added to mortified vanity at having been duped, was sufficient for him to
      allow me to leave the inn unattended. Nor could I greatly blame him, for
      you must know, my dears, that at that time London was filled with
      adventurers of all types.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt a deal like an impostor, in truth, as I stepped into the street,
      disdaining to inquire of any of the people of the Star and Garter where an
      American agent might be found. The day was gray and cheerless, the colour
      of my own spirits as I walked toward the east, knowing that the city lay
      that way. But I soon found plenty to distract me.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a lad such as I, bred in a quiet tho' prosperous colonial town, a walk
      through London was a revelation. Here in the Pall Mall the day was not yet
      begun, tho' for some scarce ended. I had not gone fifty paces from the
      hotel before I came upon a stout gentleman with twelve hours of claret
      inside him, brought out of a coffee-house and put with vast difficulty
      into his chair; and I stopped to watch the men stagger off with their load
      to St. James's Street. Next I met a squad of redcoated guards going to the
      palace, and after them a grand coach and six rattled over the Scotch
      granite, swaying to a degree that threatened to shake off the footmen
      clinging behind. Within, a man with an eagle nose sat impassive, and I set
      him down for one of the king's ministers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I came out into a wide space, which I knew to be Charing Cross
      by the statue of Charles the First which stood in the centre of it, and
      the throat of a street which was just in front of me must be the Strand.
      Here all was life and bustle. On one hand was Golden's Hotel, and a
      crowded mail-coach was dashing out from the arch beneath it, the horn
      blowing merrily; on the other hand, so I was told by a friendly man in
      brown, was Northumberland House, the gloomy grandeur whereof held my eyes
      for a time. And I made bold to ask in what district were those who had
      dealings with the colonies. He scanned me with a puzzling look of
      commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye're not a-going to sell yereself for seven year, my lad?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
      was near that myself when I was young, and I thank God' to this day that I
      talked first to an honest man, even as you are doing. They'll give ye a
      pretty tale,&mdash;the factors,&mdash;of a land of milk and honey, when
      it's naught but stripes and curses yell get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he was about to rebuke me hotly, when I told him I had come from
      Maryland, where I was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ye speak like a gentleman!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I was informed that all
      talk like naygurs over there. And is it not so of your redemptioners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said that depended upon the master they got.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I take it ye are looking for the lawyers, who mostly represent the
      planters. And y e'll find them at the Temple or Lincoln's Inn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied that he I sought was not an attorney, but a man of business.
      Whereupon he said that I should find all those in a batch about the North
      and South American Coffee House, in Threadneedle Street. And he pointed me
      into the Strand, adding that I had but to follow my nose to St. Paul's,
      and there inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would I might give you some notion of the great artery of London in
      those days, for it has changed much since I went down it that heavy
      morning in April, 1770, fighting my way. Ay, truly, fighting my way, for
      the street then was no place for the weak and timid, when bullocks ran
      through it in droves on the way to market, when it was often jammed from
      wall to wall with wagons, and carmen and truckmen and coachmen swung their
      whips and cursed one another to the extent of their lungs. Near St.
      Clement Danes I was packed in a crowd for ten minutes while two of these
      fellows formed a ring and fought for the right of way, stopping the
      traffic as far as I could see. Dustmen, and sweeps, and even beggars,
      jostled you on the corners, bullies tried to push you against the posts or
      into the kennels; and once, in Butchers' Row, I was stopped by a flashy,
      soft-tongued fellow who would have lured me into a tavern near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noises were bedlam ten times over. Shopmen stood at their doors and
      cried, &ldquo;Rally up, rally up, buy, buy, buy!&rdquo; venders shouted saloop and
      barley, furmity, Shrewsbury cakes and hot peascods, rosemary and lavender,
      small coal and sealing-wax, and others bawled &ldquo;Pots to solder!&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Knives to grind!&rdquo; Then there was the incessant roar of the heavy wheels
      over the rough stones, and the rasp and shriek of the brewers' sledges as
      they moved clumsily along. As for the odours, from that of the roasted
      coffee and food of the taverns, to the stale fish on the stalls, and
      worse, I can say nothing. They surpassed imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, upon emerging from Butchers' Row, I came upon some stocks
      standing in the street, and beheld ahead of me a great gateway stretching
      across the Strand from house to house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its stone was stained with age, and the stern front of it seemed to mock
      the unseemly and impetuous haste of the tide rushing through its arches. I
      stood and gazed, nor needed one to tell me that those two grinning skulls
      above it, swinging to the wind on the pikes, were rebel heads. Bare and
      bleached now, and exposed to a cruel view, but once caressed by loving
      hands, was the last of those whose devotion to the house of Stuart had
      brought from their homes to Temple Bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      I halted by the Fleet Market, nor could I resist the desire to go into St.
      Paul's, to feel like a pebble in a bell under its mighty dome; and it
      lacked but half an hour of noon when I had come out at the Poultry and
      finished gaping at the Mansion House. I missed Threadneedle Street and
      went down Cornhill, in my ignorance mistaking the Royal Exchange, with its
      long piazza and high tower, for the coffeehouse I sought: in the great
      hall I begged a gentleman to direct me to Mr. Dix, if he knew such a
      person. He shrugged his shoulders, which mystified me somewhat, but
      answered with a ready good-nature that he was likely to be found at that
      time at Tom's Coffee House, in Birchin Lane near by, whither I went with
      him. He climbed the stairs ahead of me and directed me, puffing, to the
      news room, which I found filled with men, some writing, some talking
      eagerly, and others turning over newspapers. The servant there looked me
      over with no great favour, but on telling him my business he went off, and
      returned with a young man of a pink and white complexion, in a green
      riding-frock, leather breeches, and top boots, who said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my man, I am Mr. Dix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a look about him, added to his tone and manner, set me strong
      against him. I knew his father had not been of this stamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am Mr. Richard Carvel, grandson to Mr. Lionel Carvel, of Carvel
      Hall, in Maryland,&rdquo; I replied, much in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust his hands into his breeches and stared very hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; he said finally, with something very near a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, a gentleman's word usually suffices!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He changed his tone a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but we men of business have need to
      be careful. Let us sit, and I will examine your letters. Your
      determination must have been suddenly taken,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;for I have
      nothing from Mr. Carvel on the subject of your coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letters! You have heard nothing!&rdquo; I gasped, and there stopped short and
      clinched the table. &ldquo;Has not my grandfather written of my disappearance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately his expression went back to the one he had met me with.
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I composed myself as best I could in the face of his incredulity,
      swallowing with an effort the aversion I felt to giving him my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it strange he has not informed you,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I was kidnapped
      near Annapolis last Christmas-time, and put on board of a slaver, from
      which I was rescued by great good fortune, and brought to Scotland. And I
      have but just made my way to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing is not likely, Mr.&mdash;, Mr.&mdash;,&rdquo; he said, drumming
      impatiently on the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I lost control of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as I am heir to Carvel Hall, Mr. Dix,&rdquo; I cried, rising, &ldquo;you
      shall pay for your insolence by forfeiting your agency!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the roan was a natural coward, with a sneer for some and a smirk for
      others. He went to the smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am but looking to Mr. Carvel's interests the best I know how,&rdquo; he
      replied; &ldquo;and if indeed you be Mr. Richard Carvel, then you must applaud
      my caution, sir, in seeking proofs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proofs I have none,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;the very clothes on my back are borrowed
      from a Scotch seaman. My God, Mr. Dix, do I look like a rogue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were I to advance money upon appearances, sir, I should be insolvent in a
      fortnight. But stay,&rdquo; he cried uneasily, as I flung back my chair, &ldquo;stay,
      sir. Is there no one of your province in the town to attest your
      identity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that there is,&rdquo; I said bitterly; &ldquo;you shall hear from Mr. Manners
      soon, I promise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he said, overtaking me on the stairs, &ldquo;you will surely
      allow the situation to be&mdash;extraordinary, you will surely commend my
      discretion. Permit me, sir, to go with you to Arlington Street.&rdquo; And he
      sent a lad in haste to the Exchange for a hackney-chaise, which was soon
      brought around.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got in, somewhat mollified, and ashamed of my heat: still disliking the
      man, but acknowledging he had the better right on his side. True to his
      kind he gave me every mark of politeness now, asked particularly after Mr.
      Carvel's health, and encouraged me to give him as much of my adventure as
      I thought proper. But what with the rattle of the carriage and the street
      noises and my disgust, I did not care to talk, and presently told him as
      much very curtly. He persisted, how: ever, in pointing out the sights, the
      Fleet prison, and where the Ludgate stood six years gone; and the Devil's
      Tavern, of old Ben Jonson's time, and the Mitre and the Cheshire Cheese
      and the Cock, where Dr. Johnson might be found near the end of the week at
      his dinner. He showed me the King's Mews above Charing Cross, and the
      famous theatre in the Haymarket, and we had but turned the corner into
      Piccadilly when he cried excitedly at a passing chariot:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Mr. Carvel, there go my Lord North and Mr. Rigby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take them, Mr. Dix!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent after that, glancing at me covertly from while to while
      until we swung into Arlington Street. Before I knew we were stopped in
      front of the house, but as I set foot on the step I found myself
      confronted by a footman in the Manners livery, who cried out angrily to
      our man: &ldquo;Make way, make way for his Grace of Chartersea!&rdquo; Turning, I saw
      a coach behind, the horses dancing at the rear wheels of the chaise. We
      alighted hastily, and I stood motionless, my heart jumping quick and hard
      in the hope and fear that Dorothy was within, my eye fixed on the coach
      door. But when the footman pulled it open and lowered the step, out lolled
      a very broad man with a bloated face and little, beady eyes without a
      spark of meaning, and something very like a hump was on the top of his
      back. He wore a yellow top-coat, and red-heeled shoes of the latest
      fashion, and I settled at once he was the Duke of Chartersea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came little Mr. Manners, stepping daintily as ever; and then, as the
      door closed with a bang, I remembered my errand. They had got halfway to
      the portico.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Manners!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He faced about, and his Grace also, and both stared in wellbred surprise.
      As I live, Mr. Manners looked into my face, into my very eyes, and gave no
      sign of recognition. And what between astonishment and anger, and a
      contempt that arose within me, I could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the man a shilling, Manners,&rdquo; said his Grace; &ldquo;we can't stay here
      forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, give the man a shilling,&rdquo; lisped Mr. Manners to the footman. And they
      passed into the house, and the door eras shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I heard Mr. Dix at my elbow, saying in a soft voice: &ldquo;Now, my fine
      gentleman, is there any good reason why you should not ride to Bow Street
      with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As there is a God in heaven. Mr. Dix,&rdquo; I answered, very low, &ldquo;if you
      attempt to lay hands on me, you shall answer for it! And you shall hear
      from me yet, at the Star and Garter hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I spun on my heel and left him, nor did he follow; and a great lump was in
      my throat and tears welling in my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would John Paul say?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. CASTLE YARD
    </h2>
    <p>
      But I did not go direct to the Star and Garter. No, I lacked the courage
      to say to John Paul: &ldquo;You have trusted me, and this is how I have rewarded
      your faith.&rdquo; And the thought that Dorothy's father, of all men, had served
      me thus, after what I had gone through, filled me with a bitterness I had
      never before conceived. And when my brain became clearer I reflected that
      Mr. Manners had had ample time to learn of my disappearance from Maryland,
      and that his action had been one of design, and of cold blood. But I gave
      to Dorothy or her mother no part in it. Mr. Manners never had had cause to
      hate me, and the only reason I could assign was connected with his Grace
      of Chartersea, which I dismissed as absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few drops of rain warned me to seek shelter. I knew not where I was, nor
      how long I had been walking the streets at a furious pace. But a huckster
      told me I was in Chelsea; and kindly directed me back to Pall Mall. The
      usual bunch of chairmen was around the hotel entrance, but I noticed a
      couple of men at the door, of sharp features and unkempt dress, and heard
      a laugh as I went in. My head swam as I stumbled up the stairs and fumbled
      at the knob, when I heard voices raised inside, and the door was suddenly
      and violently thrown open. Across the sill stood a big, rough-looking man
      with his hands on his hips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! Here be the other fine bird a-homing, I'll warrant,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was full. I caught sight of Davenport, the tailor, with a wry
      face, talking against the noise; of Banks, the man I had hired,
      resplendent in my livery. One of the hotel servants was in the corner
      perspiring over John Paul's chests, and beside him stood a man
      disdainfully turning over with his foot the contents, as they were thrown
      on the floor. I saw him kick the precious vellum-hole waistcoat across the
      room in wrath and disgust, and heard him shout above the rest: &ldquo;The lot of
      them would not bring a guinea from any Jew in St. Martin's Lane!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the other corner, by the writing-desk, stood the hatter and the
      haberdasher with their heads together. And in the very centre of the
      confusion was the captain himself. He was drest in his new clothes
      Davenport had brought, and surprised me by his changed appearance, and
      looked as fine a gentleman as any I have ever seen. His face lighted with
      relief at sight of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now may I tell these rogues begone, Richard?&rdquo; he cried. And turning to
      the man confronting me, he added, &ldquo;This gentleman will settle their
      beggarly accounts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I knew we had to do with bailiffs, and my heart failed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likely,&rdquo; laughed the big man; &ldquo;I'll stake my oath he has not a groat to
      pay their beggarly accounts, as year honour is pleased to call them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They ceased jabbering and straightened to attention, awaiting my reply.
      But I forgot them all, and thought only of the captain, and of the trouble
      I had brought him. He began to show some consternation as I went up to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; I said, vainly trying to steady my voice, &ldquo;I beg, I pray
      that you will not lose faith in me,&mdash;that you will not think any
      deceit of mine has brought you to these straits. Mr. Dix did not know me,
      and has had no word from my grandfather of my disappearance. And Mr.
      Manners, whom I thought my friend, spurned me in the street before the
      Duke of Chartersea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And no longer master of myself, I sat down at the table and hid my face,
      shaken by great sobs, to think that this was my return for his kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; I heard him cry, &ldquo;Mr. Manners spurned you, Richard! By all the law
      in Coke and Littleton, he shall answer for it to me. Your fairweather fowl
      shall have the chance to run me through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat up in bewilderment, doubting my senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe me, captain,&rdquo; I said, overcome by the man's faith; &ldquo;you
      believe me when I tell you that one I have known from childhood refused to
      recognize me to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised me in his arms as tenderly as a woman might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the whole world denied you, lad, I would not. I believe you&mdash;&rdquo;
       and he repeated it again and again, unable to get farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if his words brought tears to my eyes, my strength came with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I care not,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I only to live to reward you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Manners shall answer for it to me!&rdquo; cried John Paul again, and made a
      pace toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so fast, not so fast, captain, or admiral, or whatever you are,&rdquo; said
      the bailiff, stepping in his way, for he was used to such scenes; &ldquo;as God
      reigns, the owners of all these fierce titles be fire-eaters, who would
      spit you if you spilt snuff upon 'em. Come, come, gentlemen, your swords,
      and we shall see the sights o' London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the signal for another uproar, the tailor shrieking that John
      Paul must take off the suit, and Banks the livery; asking the man in the
      corner by the sea-chests (who proved to be the landlord) who was to pay
      him for his work and his lost cloth. And the landlord shook his fist at us
      and shouted back, who was to pay him his four pounds odd, which included
      two ten-shilling dinners and a flask of his best wine? The other tradesmen
      seized what was theirs and made off with remarks appropriate to the
      occasion. And when John Paul and my man were divested of their plumes, we
      were marched downstairs and out through a jeering line of people to a
      hackney coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sirs, whereaway?&rdquo; said the bailiff when we were got in beside one of
      his men, and burning with the shame of it; &ldquo;to the prison? Or I has a very
      pleasant hotel for gentlemen in Castle Yard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The frightful stories my dear grandfather had told me of the Fleet came
      flooding into my head, and I shuddered and turned sick. I glanced at John
      Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A guinea will not go far in a sponging-house,&rdquo; said he, and the bailiff's
      man laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bailiff gave a direction we did not hear, and we drove off. He proved
      a bluff fellow with a bloat yet not unkindly humour, and despite his
      calling seemed to have something that was human in him. He passed many a
      joke on that pitiful journey in an attempt to break our despondency,
      urging us not to be downcast, and reminding us that the last gentleman he
      had taken from Pall Mall was in over a thousand pounds, and that our
      amount was a bagatelle. And when we had gone through Temple Bar, instead
      of keeping on down Fleet Street, we jolted into Chancery Lane. This roused
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend has warned you that he has no money,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and no more have
      I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bailiff regarded me shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I know. But I has seen many stripes o' men in my time,
      my masters, and I know them to trust, and them whose silver I must feel or
      send to the Fleet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him unreservedly my case, and that he must take his chance of being
      paid; that I could not hear from America for three months at least. He
      listened without much show of attention, shaking his head from side to
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ever cheated a man, or the admiral here either, then I begin over
      again,&rdquo; he broke in with decision; &ldquo;it is the fine sparks from the clubs I
      has to watch. You'll not worry, sir, about me. Take my oath I'll get
      interest out of you on my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unwilling as we both were to be beholden to a bailiff, the alternative of
      the Fleet was too terrible to be thought of. And so we alighted after him
      with a shiver at the sight of the ugly, grimy face of the house, and the
      dirty windows all barred with double iron. In answer to a knock we were
      presently admitted by a turnkey to a vestibule as black as a tomb, and the
      heavy outer door was locked behind us. Then, as the man cursed and groped
      for the keyhole of the inner door, despair laid hold of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once inside, in the half light of a narrow hallway, a variety of noises
      greeted our ears,&mdash;laughter from above and below, interspersed with
      oaths; the click of billiard balls, and the occasional hammering of a pack
      of cards on a bare table before the shuffle. The air was close almost to
      suffocation, and out of the coffee room, into which I glanced, came a
      heavy cloud of tobacco smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my masters, why so glum?&rdquo; said the bailiff; &ldquo;my inn is not such a
      bad place, and you'll find ample good company here, I promise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he led us into a dingy antechamber littered with papers, on every one
      of which, I daresay, was written a tragedy. Then he inscribed our names,
      ages, descriptions, and the like in a great book, when we followed him up
      three flights to a low room under the eaves, having but one small window,
      and bare of furniture save two narrow cots for beds, a broken chair, and a
      cracked mirror. He explained that cash boarders got better, and added that
      we might be happy we were not in the Fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We dine at two here, gentlemen, and sup at eight. This is not the Star
      and Garter,&rdquo; said he as he left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the captain who spoke first, though he swallowed twice before the
      words came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Richard, come, laddie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;'tis no so bad it micht-na be
      waur. We'll mak the maist o' it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not for myself, Captain Paul,&rdquo; I replied, marvelling the more at
      him, &ldquo;but to think that I have landed you here, that this is my return for
      your sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoots! How was ye to foresee Mr. Manners was a blellum?&rdquo; And he broke
      into threats which, if Mr. Marmaduke had heard and comprehended, would
      have driven him into the seventh state of fear. &ldquo;Have you no other friends
      in London?&rdquo; he asked, regaining his English.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head. Then came&mdash;a question I dreaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Manners's family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather remain here for life,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;than to them now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For pride is often selfish, my dears, and I did not reflect that if I
      remained, the captain would remain likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they all like Mr. Manners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That they are not,&rdquo; I returned with more heat than was necessary; &ldquo;his
      wife is goodness itself, and his daughter&mdash;&rdquo; Words failed me, and I
      reddened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, he has a daughter, you say,&rdquo; said the captain, casting a significant
      look at me and beginning to pace the little room. He was keener than I
      thought, this John Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were not so painful a task, my dears, I would give you here some
      notion of what a London sponging-house was in the last century. Comyn has
      heard me tell of it, and I have seen Bess cry over the story. Gaming was
      the king-vice of that age, and it filled these places to overflowing.
      Heaven help a man who came into the world with that propensity in the
      early days of King George the Third. Many, alas, acquired it before they
      were come to years of discretion. Next me, at the long table where we were
      all thrown in together,&mdash;all who could not pay for private meals,&mdash;sat
      a poor fellow who had flung away a patrimony of three thousand a year.
      Another had even mortgaged to a Jew his prospects on the death of his
      mother, and had been seized by the bailiffs outside of St. James's palace,
      coming to Castle Yard direct from his Majesty's levee. Yet another, with
      such a look of dead hope in his eyes as haunts me yet, would talk to us by
      the hour of the Devonshire house where he was born, of the green valley
      and the peaceful stream, and of the old tower-room, caressed by trees,
      where Queen Bess had once lain under the carved oak rafters. Here he had
      taken his young wife, and they used to sit together, so he said, in the
      sunny oriel over the water, and he had sworn to give up the cards. That
      was but three years since, and then all had gone across the green cloth in
      one mad night in St. James's Street. Their friends had deserted them, and
      the poor little woman was lodged in Holborn near by, and came every
      morning with some little dainty to the bailiff's, for her liege lord who
      had so used her. He pressed me to share a fowl with him one day, but it
      would have choked me. God knows where she got the money to buy it. I saw
      her once hanging on his neck in the hall, he trying to shield her from the
      impudent gaze of his fellow-lodgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But some of them lived like lords in luxury, with never a seeming regret;
      and had apartments on the first floor, and had their tea and paper in bed,
      and lounged out the morning in a flowered nightgown, and the rest of the
      day in a laced coat. These drank the bailiff's best port and champagne,
      and had nothing better than a frown or haughty look for us, when we passed
      them at the landing. Whence the piper was paid I knew not, and the bailiff
      cared not. But the bulk of the poor gentlemen were a merry crew withal,
      and had their wit and their wine at table, and knew each other's histories
      (and soon enough ours) by heart. They betted away the week at billiards or
      whist or picquet or loo, and sometimes measured swords for diversion, tho'
      this pastime the bailiff was greatly set against; as calculated to deprive
      him of a lodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although we had no money for gaming, and little for wine or tobacco, the
      captain and I were received very heartily into the fraternity. After one
      afternoon of despondency we both voted it the worst of bad policy to
      remain aloof and nurse our misfortune, and spent our first evening in
      making acquaintances over a deal of very thin &ldquo;debtor's claret.&rdquo; I tossed
      long that night on the hard cot, listening to the scurrying rats among the
      roof-timbers. They ran like the thoughts in my brain. And before I slept I
      prayed again and again that God would put it in my power to reward him
      whom charity for a friendless foundling had brought to a debtor's prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so much as a single complaint or reproach had passed his lips!

      CHAPTER XXV. THE RESCUE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Perchance, my dears, if John Paul and I had not been cast by accident in a
      debtor's prison, this great man might never have bestowed upon our country
      those glorious services which contributed so largely to its liberty. And I
      might never have comprehended that the American Revolution was brought on
      and fought by a headstrong king, backed by unscrupulous followers who held
      wealth above patriotism. It is often difficult to lay finger upon the
      causes which change the drift of a man's opinions, and so I never wholly
      knew why John Paul abandoned his deep-rooted purpose to obtain advancement
      in London by grace of the accomplishments he had laboured so hard to
      attain. But I believe the beginning was at the meeting at Windsor with the
      slim and cynical gentleman who had treated him to something between
      patronage and contempt. Then my experience with Mr. Manners had so
      embedded itself in his mind that he could never speak of it but with
      impatience and disgust. And, lastly, the bailiff's hotel contained many
      born gentlemen who had been left here to rot out the rest of their dreary
      lives by friends who were still in power and opulence. More than once when
      I climbed to our garret I found the captain seated on the three-legged
      chair, with his head between his hands, sunk in reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right, Richard,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;your great world is a hard world for
      those in the shadow of it. I see now that it must not be entered from
      below, but from the cabin window. A man may climb around it, lad, and when
      he is above may scourge it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will scourge it, captain!&rdquo; I had no doubt of his ability one day
      to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and snap my fingers at it. 'Tis a pretty organization, this society,
      which kicks the man who falls to the dogs. None of your fine gentlemen for
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he would descend to talk politics with our fellow-guests. We should
      have been unhappy indeed had it not been for this pastime. It seems to me
      strange that these debtors took such a keen interest in outside affairs,
      even tho' it was a time of great agitation. We read with eagerness the
      cast-off newspapers of the first-floor gentlemen. One poor devil who had
      waddled (failed) in Change Alley had collected under his mattress the
      letters of Junius, then selling the Public Advertiser as few publications
      had ever sold before. John Paul devoured these attacks upon his Majesty
      and his ministry in a single afternoon, and ere long he had on the tip of
      his tongue the name and value of every man in Parliament and out of it. He
      learned, almost by heart, the history of the astonishing fight made by Mr.
      Wilkes for the liberties of England, and speedily was as good a Whig and a
      better than the member from Middlesex himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most of our companions were Tories, for, odd as it may appear, they
      retained their principles even in Castle Yard. And in those days to be a
      Tory was to be the friend of the King, and to be the friend of the King
      was to have some hope of advancement and reward at his hand. They had
      none. The captain joined forces with the speculator from the Alley, who
      had hitherto contended against mighty odds, and together they bore down
      upon the enemy&mdash;ay, and rooted him, too. For John Paul had an air
      about him and a natural gift of oratory to command attention, and shortly
      the dining room after dinner became the scene of such contests as to call
      up in the minds of the old stagers a field night in the good days of Mr.
      Pitt and the second George. The bailiff often sat by the door, an
      interested spectator, and the macaroni lodgers condescended to come
      downstairs and listen. The captain attained to fame in our little world
      from his maiden address, in which he very shrewdly separated the political
      character of Mr. Wilkes from his character as a private gentleman, and so
      refuted a charge of profligacy against the people's champion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altho' I never had sufficient confidence in my powers to join in these
      discussions, I followed them zealously, especially when they touched
      American questions, as they frequently did. This subject of the wrongs of
      the colonies was the only one I could ever be got to study at King
      William's School, and I believe that my intimate knowledge of it gave the
      captain a surprise. He fell into the habit of seating himself on the edge
      of my bed after we had retired for the night, and would hold me talking
      until the small hours upon the injustice of taxing a people without their
      consent, and upon the multitude of measures of coercion which the King had
      pressed upon us to punish our resistance. He declaimed so loudly against
      the tyranny of quartering troops upon a peaceable state that our exhausted
      neighbours were driven to pounding their walls and ceilings for peace. The
      news of the Boston massacre had not then reached England.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not, therefore, wholly taken by surprise when he said to me one
      night:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am resolved to try my fortune in America, lad. That is the land for
      such as I, where a man may stand upon his own merits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, we shall go together, captain,&rdquo; I answered heartily, &ldquo;if we are
      ever free of this cursed house. And you shall taste of our hospitality at
      Carvel Hall, and choose that career which pleases you. Faith, I could
      point you a dozen examples in Annapolis of men who have made their way
      without influence. But you shall have influence,&rdquo; I cried, glowing at the
      notion of rewarding him; &ldquo;you shall experience Mr. Carvel's gratitude and
      mine. You shall have the best of our ships, and you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a man to take fire easily, and embraced me. And, strange to say,
      neither he nor I saw the humour, nor the pity, of the situation. How many
      another would long before have become sceptical of my promises! And
      justly. For I had led him to London, spent all his savings, and then got
      him into a miserable prison, and yet he had faith remaining, and to spare!
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me to notify Mr. Dix of my residence in Castle Yard, not
      from any hope that he would turn his hand to my rescue, but that he might
      know where to find me if he heard from Maryland. And I penned another
      letter to Mr. Carvel, but a feeling I took no pains to define compelled me
      to withhold an account of Mr. Manners's conduct. And I refrained from
      telling him that I was in a debtor's prison. For I believe the thought of
      a Carvel in a debtor's prison would have killed him. I said only that we
      were comfortably lodged in a modest part of London; that the Manners were
      inaccessible (for I could not bring myself to write that they were out of
      town). Just then a thought struck me with such force that I got up with a
      cheer and hit the astonished captain between the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How now!&rdquo; he cried, ruefully rubbing himself. &ldquo;If these are thy
      amenities, Richard, Heaven spare me thy blows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I have been a fool, and worse,&rdquo; I shouted. &ldquo;My grandfather's ship,
      the Sprightly Bess, is overhauling this winter in the Severn. And unless
      she has sailed, which I think unlikely, I have but to despatch a line to
      Bristol to summon Captain Bell, the master, to London. I think he will
      bring the worthy Mr. Dix to terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether he will or no,&rdquo; said John Paul, hope lighting his face, &ldquo;Bell
      must have command of the twenty pounds to free us, and will take us back
      to America. For I must own, Richard, that I have no great love for
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No more had I. I composed this letter to Bell in such haste that my hand
      shook, and sent it off with a shilling to the bailiff's servant, that it
      might catch the post. And that afternoon we had a two-shilling bottle of
      port for dinner, which we shared with a broken-down parson who had been
      chaplain in ordinary to my Lord Wortley, and who had preached us an Easter
      sermon the day before. For it was Easter Monday. Our talk was broken into
      by the bailiff, who informed me that a man awaited me in the passage, and
      my heart leaped into my, throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Banks. Thinking he had come to reproach me; I asked him rather
      sharply what he wanted. He shifted his hat from one hand to the other and
      looked sheepish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but your honour must be very ill-served
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than I should be, Banks, for I have no money,&rdquo; I said, wondering
      if he thought me a first-floor lodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no immediate reply to that, either, but seemed more uneasy still.
      And I took occasion to note his appearance. He was exceeding neat in a
      livery of his old master, which he had stripped of the trimmings. Then,
      before I had guessed at his drift, he thrust his hand inside his coat and
      drew forth a pile of carefully folded bank notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I be a single man, sir, and has small need of this. And and I knows your
      honour will pay me when your letter comes from America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he handed me five Bank of England notes of ten pounds apiece. I took
      them mechanically, without knowing what I did. The generosity of the act
      benumbed my senses, and for the instant I was inclined to accept the offer
      upon the impulse of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know you would get your money again, Banks?&rdquo; I asked
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear, sir,&rdquo; he replied promptly, actually brightening at the prospect.
      &ldquo;I knows gentlemen, sir, them that are such, sir. And I will go to America
      with you, and you say the word, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was more touched than I cared to show over his offer, which I scarce
      knew how to refuse. In truth it was a difficult task, for he pressed me
      again and again, and when he saw me firm, turned away to wipe his eyes
      upon his sleeve. Then he begged me to let him remain and serve me in the
      sponginghouse, saying that he would pay his own way. The very thought of a
      servant in the bailiff's garret made me laugh, and so I put him off, first
      getting his address, and promising him employment on the day of my
      release.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Wednesday we looked for a reply from Bristol, if not for the appearance
      of Bell himself, and when neither came apprehension seized us lest he had
      already sailed for Maryland. The slender bag of Thursday's letters
      contained none for me. Nevertheless, we both did our best to keep in
      humour, forbearing to mention to one another the hope that had gone.
      Friday seemed the beginning of eternity; the day dragged through I know
      not how, and toward evening we climbed back to our little room, not daring
      to speak of what we knew in our hearts to be so,&mdash;that the Sprightly
      Bess had sailed. We sat silently looking out over the dreary stretch of
      roofs and down into a dingy court of Bernard's Inn below, when suddenly
      there arose a commotion on the stairs, as of a man mounting hastily. The
      door was almost flung from its hinges, some one caught me by the
      shoulders, gazed eagerly into my face, and drew back. For a space I
      thought myself dreaming. I searched my memory, and the name came. Had it
      been Dorothy, or Mr. Carvel himself, I could not have been more
      astonished, and my knees weakened under me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;Lord Comyn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized my hand. &ldquo;Yes; Jack, whose life you saved, and no other,&rdquo; he
      cried, with a sailor's impetuosity. &ldquo;My God, Richard! it was true, then;
      and you have been in this place for three weeks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For three weeks,&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me, at John Paul, who was standing by in bewilderment, and
      then about the grimy, cobwebbed walls of the dark garret, and then turned
      his back to hide his emotion, and so met the bailiff, who was coming in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how much are these gentlemen in your books?&rdquo; he demanded hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A small matter, your Lordship,&mdash;a mere trifle,&rdquo; said the man,
      bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much, I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-two guineas, five shillings, and eight pence, my Lord, counting
      debts, and board,&mdash;and interest,&rdquo; the bailiff glibly replied; for he
      had no doubt taken off the account when he spied his Lordship's coach.
      &ldquo;And I was very good to Mr. Carvel and the captain, as your Lordship will
      discover&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n your goodness!&rdquo; said my Lord, cutting him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he pulled out a wallet and threw some pieces at the bailiff, bidding
      him get change with all haste. &ldquo;And now, Richard,&rdquo; he added, with a glance
      of disgust about him, &ldquo;pack up, and we'll out of this cursed hole!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to pack, my Lord,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord! Jack, I have told you, or I leave you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Jack, and you will,&rdquo; said I, overflowing with thankfulness to
      God for the friends He had bestowed upon me. &ldquo;But before we go a step,
      Jack, you must know the man but for whose bravery I should long ago have
      been dead of fever and ill-treatment in the Indies, and whose generosity
      has brought him hither. My Lord Comyn, this is Captain John Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain, who had been quite overwhelmed by this sudden arrival of a
      real lord to our rescue at the very moment when we had sunk to despair,
      and no less astonished by the intimacy that seemed to exist between the
      newcomer and myself, had the presence of mind to bend his head, and that
      was all. Comyn shook his hand heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not lack reward for this, captain, I promise you,&rdquo; cried he.
      &ldquo;What you have done for Mr. Carvel, you have done for me. Captain, I thank
      you. You shall have my interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I flushed, seeing John Paul draw his lips together. But how was his
      Lordship to know that he was dealing with no common sea-captain?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sought no reward, my Lord,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What I have done was out of
      friendship for Mr. Carvel, solely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Comyn was completely taken by surprise by these words, and by the haughty
      tone in which they were spoken. He had not looked for a gentleman, and no
      wonder. He took a quizzical sizing of the sky-blue coat. Such a man in
      such a station was out of his experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, I believe you, captain,&rdquo; he answered, in a voice which said plainly
      that he did not. &ldquo;But he shall be rewarded nevertheless, eh, Richard? I'll
      see Charles Fox in this matter to-morrow. Come, come,&rdquo; he added
      impatiently, &ldquo;the bailiff must have his change by now. Come, Richard!&rdquo; and
      he led the way down the winding stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not take offence at his ways,&rdquo; I whispered to the captain. For I
      well knew that a year before I should have taken the same tone with one
      not of my class. &ldquo;His Lordship is all kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have learned a bit since I came into England, Richard,&rdquo; was his sober
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twas a pitiful sight to see gathered on the landings the poor fellows we
      had come to know in Castle Yard, whose horizons were then as gray as ours
      was bright. But they each had a cheery word of congratulation for us as we
      passed, and the unhappy gentleman from Devonshire pressed my hand and
      begged that I would sometime think of him when I was out under the sky. I
      promised even more, and am happy to be able to say, my dears, that I saw
      both him and his wife off for America before I left London. Our eyes were
      wet when we reached the lower hall, and I was making for the door in an
      agony to leave the place, when the bailiff came out of his little office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, sir,&rdquo; he said, getting in front of me; &ldquo;there is a little
      form yet to be gone through. The haste of gentlemen to leave us is not
      flattering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced slyly at Comyn, and his Lordship laughed a little. I stepped
      unsuspectingly into the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped across the threshold as tho' I had been struck. The late
      sunlight filtering through the dirt of the window fell upon the tall
      figure of a girl and lighted an upturned face, and I saw tears glistening
      on the long lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Dorothy. Her hands were stretched out in welcome, and then I had
      them pressed in my own. And I could only look and look again, for I was
      dumb with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God you are alive!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;alive and well, when we feared you
      dead. Oh, Richard, we have been miserable indeed since we had news of your
      disappearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is worth it all, Dolly,&rdquo; I said, only brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her eyes, which had searched me through in wonder and pity,&mdash;those
      eyes I had so often likened to the deep blue of the sea,&mdash;and her
      breast rose and fell quickly with I knew not what emotions. How the mind
      runs, and the heart runs, at such a time! Here was the same Dorothy I had
      known in Maryland, and yet not the same. For she was a woman now, who had
      seen the great world, who had refused both titles and estates,&mdash;and
      perchance accepted them. She drew her hands from mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how came you in such a place?&rdquo; she asked, turning with a shudder.
      &ldquo;Did you not know you had friends in London, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not for so much again would I have told her of Mr. Manners's conduct. So I
      stood confused, casting about for a reply with truth in it, when Comyn
      broke in upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll warrant you did not look for her here, Richard. Faith, but you are a
      lucky dog,&rdquo; said my Lord, shaking his head in mock dolefulness; &ldquo;for there
      is no man in London, in the world, for whom she would descend a flight of
      steps, save you. And now she has driven the length of the town when she
      heard you were in a sponging-house, nor all the dowagers in Mayfair could
      stop her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, Comyn,&rdquo; said my lady, blushing and gathering up her skirts; &ldquo;that
      tongue of yours had hung you long since had it not been for your peer's
      privilege. Richard and I were brought up as brother and sister, and you
      know you were full as keen for his rescue as I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship pinched me playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I vow I would pass a year in the Fleet to have her do as much for me,&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where is the gallant seaman who saved you, Richard?&rdquo; asked Dolly,
      stamping her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;you know the story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;bring him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My conscience smote me, for I had not so much as thought of John Paul
      since I came into that room. I found him waiting in the passage, and took
      him by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady wishes to know you, captain,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Here? Impossible!&rdquo; And he looked at his clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who cares more for your heart than your appearance,&rdquo; I answered gayly,
      and led him into the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of Dorothy he stopped abruptly, confounded, as a man who sees a
      diamond in a dust-heap. And a glow came over me as I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Manners, here is Captain Paul, to whose courage and unselfishness I
      owe everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Dorothy, graciously extending her hand, &ldquo;Richard has many
      friends. You have put us all in your debt, and none deeper than his old
      playmate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain fairly devoured her with his eyes as she made him a curtsey.
      But he was never lacking in gallantry, and was as brave on such occasions
      as when all the dangers of the deep threatened him. With an elaborate
      movement he took Miss Manners's fingers and kissed them, and then swept
      the floor with a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To have such a divinity in my debt, madam, is too much happiness for one
      man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have done nothing to merit it. A lifetime were all too
      short to pay for such a favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had almost forgotten Miss Dolly the wayward, the mischievous. But she
      was before me now, her eyes sparkling, and biting her lips to keep down
      her laughter. Comyn turned to fleck the window with his handkerchief,
      while I was not a little put out at their mirth. But if John Paul observed
      it, he gave no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain, I vow your manners are worthy of a Frenchman,&rdquo; said my Lord;
      &ldquo;and yet I am given to understand you are a Scotchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shadow crossed the captain's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was, sir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were!&rdquo; exclaimed Comyn, astonished; &ldquo;and pray, what are you now,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henceforth, my Lord,&rdquo; John Paul replied with vast ceremony: &ldquo;I am an
      American, the compatriot of the beautiful Miss Manners!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing I'll warrant, captain,&rdquo; said his Lordship, &ldquo;that you are a
      wit.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVI. THE PART HORATIO PLAYED
    </h2>
    <p>
      The bailiff's business was quickly settled. I heard the heavy doors close
      at our backs, and drew a deep draught of the air God has made for all His
      creatures alike. Both the captain and I turned to the windows to wave a
      farewell to the sad ones we were leaving behind, who gathered about the
      bars for a last view of us, for strange as it may seem, the mere sight of
      happiness is often a pleasure for those who are sad. A coach in private
      arms and livery was in waiting, surrounded by a crowd. They made a lane
      for us to pass, and stared at the young lady of queenly beauty coming out
      of the sponging-house until the coachman snapped his whip in their faces
      and the footman jostled them back. When we were got in, Dolly and I on the
      back seat, Comyn told the man to go to Mr. Manners's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; I cried, scarce knowing what I said; &ldquo;no, not there!&rdquo; For the
      thought of entering the house in Arlington Street was unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Comyn and Dorothy gazed at me in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, Richard, why not'?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Have not your old friends the
      right to receive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was my Lord who saved me, for I was in agony what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is still proud, and won't go to Arlington Street dressed like a
      bargeman. He must needs plume, Miss Manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I glanced anxiously at Dorothy, and saw that she was neither satisfied nor
      appeased. Well I remembered every turn of her head, and every curve of her
      lip! In the meantime we were off through Cursitor Street at a gallop,
      nearly causing the death of a ragged urchin at the corner of Chancery
      Lane. I had forgotten my eagerness to know whence they had heard of my
      plight, when some words from Comyn aroused me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage is Mr. Horace Walpole's, Richard. He has taken a great fancy
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have never so much as clapped eyes upon him!&rdquo; I exclaimed in
      perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about his honour with whom you supped at Windsor? how about the
      landlord you spun by the neck? You should have heard the company laugh
      when Horry told us that! And Miss Dolly cried out that she was sure it
      must be Richard, and none other. Is it not so, Miss Manners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, my Lord, I can't remember,&rdquo; replied Dolly, looking out of the
      coach window. &ldquo;Who put those frightful skulls upon Temple Bar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the mystery of their coming was clear to me, and the superior
      gentleman at the Castle Inn had been the fashionable dabbler in arts and
      letters and architecture of Strawberry Hill, of whom I remembered having
      heard Dr. Courtenay speak, Horace Walpole. But I was then far too
      concerned about Dorothy to listen to more. Her face was still turned away
      from me, and she was silent. I could have cut out my tongue for my
      blunder. Presently, when we were nearly out of the Strand, she turned upon
      me abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have not yet heard, Richard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how you got into such a
      predicament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I don't know myself, Dolly. Some scoundrel bribed the captain of
      the slaver. For I take it Mr. Walpole has told you I was carried off on a
      slaver, if he recalled that much of the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean that,&rdquo; answered Dolly, impatiently. &ldquo;There is something
      strange about all this. How is it that you were in prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dix, my grandfather's agent, took me for an impostor and would
      advance me no money,&rdquo; I answered, hard pushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dorothy had a woman's instinct, which is often the best of
      understanding. And I was beginning to think that a suspicion was at the
      bottom of her questions. She gave her head an impatient fling, and, as I
      feared, appealed to John Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you can tell me, captain, why he did not come to his friends in
      his trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And despite my signals to him he replied: &ldquo;In truth, my dear lady, he
      haunted the place for a sight of you, from the moment he set foot in
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Comyn laughed, and I felt the blood rise to my face, and kicked John Paul
      viciously. Dolly retained her self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pho!&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;for a sight of me! You seamen are all alike. For a sight
      of me! And had you not strength enough to lift a knocker, sir,&mdash;you
      who can raise a man from the ground with one hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twas before his tailor had prepared him, madam, and he feared to
      disgrace you,&rdquo; the captain gravely continued, and I perceived how futile
      it were to attempt to stop him. &ldquo;And afterward&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And afterward?&rdquo; repeated Dorothy, leaning forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And afterward he went to Arlington Street with Mr. Dix to seek Mr.
      Manners, that he might be identified before that gentleman. He encountered
      Mr. Manners and his Grace of Something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chartersea,&rdquo; put in Comyn, who had been listening eagerly. &ldquo;Getting out
      of a coach,&rdquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was this?&rdquo; demanded Dorothy of me, interrupting him. Her voice was
      steady, but the colour had left her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About three weeks ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please be exact, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you must,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the day was Tuesday, and the time about half
      an hour after two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing for a while, trying to put down an agitation which was
      beginning to show itself in spite of her effort. As for me, I was almost
      wishing myself back in the sponginghouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure my father saw you?&rdquo; she asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As clearly as you do now, Dolly,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your clothes? He might have gone by you in such.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray that he did, Dorothy,&rdquo; I replied. But I was wholly convinced that
      Mr. Manners had recognized me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and what did he say?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      For she had the rare courage that never shrinks from the truth. I think I
      have never admired and pitied her as at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said to the footman,&rdquo; I answered, resolved to go through with it now,
      &ldquo;'Give the man a shilling.' That was his Grace's suggestion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lord uttered something very near an oath. And she spoke not a word more
      until I handed her out in Arlington Street. The rest of us were silent,
      too, Comyn now and again giving me eloquent glances expressive of what he
      would say if she were not present; the captain watching her with a furtive
      praise, and he vowed to me afterward she was never so beautiful as when
      angry, that he loved her as an avenging Diana. But I was uneasy, and when
      I stood alone with her before the house I begged her not to speak to her
      father of the episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, he must be cleared of such an imputation, Richard,&rdquo; she answered
      proudly. &ldquo;He may have made mistakes, but I feel sure he would never turn
      you away when you came to him in trouble&mdash;you, the grandson of his
      old friend, Lionel Carvel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why bother over matters that are past and gone? I would have borne an
      hundred such trials to have you come to me as you came to-day, Dorothy.
      And I shall surely see you again,&rdquo; I said, trying to speak lightly; &ldquo;and
      your mother, to whom you will present my respects, before I sail for
      America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at me, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you sail for America!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in a tone that made me
      thrill at once with joy and sadness. &ldquo;And are you not, then, to see London
      now you are here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you never coming back, Dolly?&rdquo; I whispered; for I feared Mr.
      Marmaduke might appear at any moment; &ldquo;or do you wish to remain in England
      always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant I felt her pressure on my hand, and then she had fled into
      the house, leaving me standing by the steps looking after her. Comyn's
      voice aroused me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Star and Garter!&rdquo; I heard him command, and on the way to Pall Mall
      he ceased not to rate Mr. Manners with more vigour than propriety. &ldquo;I
      never liked the little cur, d&mdash;n him! No one likes him, Richard,&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;All the town knows how Chartersea threw a bottle at him, and
      were it not for his daughter he had long since been put out of White's.
      Were it not for Miss Dolly I would call him out for this cowardly trick,
      and then publish him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, my Lord, I had held that as my privilege,&rdquo; interrupted the captain,
      &ldquo;were it not, as you say, for Miss Manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship shot a glance at John Paul somewhat divided between surprise,
      resentment, and amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you have seen the daughter, captain, you perceive it is impossible,&rdquo;
       I hastened to interpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in the name of lineage did she come to have such a father?&rdquo; Comyn
      went on. &ldquo;I thank Heaven he's not mine. He's not fit to be her lackey. I
      would sooner twenty times have a profligate like my Lord Sandwich for a
      parent than a milk and water sop like Manners, who will risk nothing over
      a crown piece at play or a guinea at Newmarket. By G&mdash;, Richard,&rdquo;
       said his Lordship, bringing his fist against the glass with near force
      enough to break the pane, &ldquo;I have a notion why he did not choose to see
      you that day. Why, he has no more blood than a louse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had come to the guess as soon as he, but I dared not give it voice, nor
      anything but ridicule. And so we came to the hotel, the red of departing
      day fading in the sky above the ragged house-line in St. James's Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very different reception we got than when we had first come
      there. You, my dears, who live in this Republic can have no notion of the
      stir and bustle caused by the arrival of Horace Walpole's carriage at a
      fashionable hotel, at a time when every innkeeper was versed in the arms
      of every family of note in the three kingdoms. Our friend the chamberlain
      was now humility itself, and fairly ran in his eagerness to anticipate
      Comyn's demands. It was &ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; and &ldquo;To be sure, your Lordship,&rdquo;
       every other second, and he seized the first occasion to make me an
      elaborate apology for his former cold conduct, assuring me that had our
      honours been pleased to divulge the fact that we had friends in London,
      such friends as my Lord Comyn and Mr. Walpole, whose great father he had
      once had the distinction to serve as linkman, all would have been well.
      And he was desiring me particularly to comprehend that he had been acting
      under most disagreeable orders when he sent for the bailiff, before I cut
      him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were soon comfortably installed in our old rooms; Comyn had sent
      post-haste for Davenport, who chanced to be his own tailor, and for the
      whole army of auxiliaries indispensable to a gentleman's make-up; and Mr.
      Dix was notified that his Lordship would receive him at eleven on the
      following morning, in my rooms. I remembered the faithful Banks with a
      twinge of gratitude, and sent for him. And John Paul and I, having been
      duly installed in the clothes made for us, all three of us sat down
      merrily to such a supper as only the cook of the Star and Garter, who had
      been chef to the Comte de Maurepas, could prepare. Then I begged Comyn to
      relate the story of our rescue, which I burned to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Richard,&rdquo; said he, filling his glass, &ldquo;had you run afoul any other
      man in London, save perchance Selwyn, you'd have been drinking the
      bailiff's triple-diluted for a month to come. I never knew such a brace of
      fools as he and Horry for getting hold of strange yarns and making them
      stranger; the wonder was that Horry told this as straight as he did. He
      has written it to all his friends on the Continent, and had he not been in
      dock with the gout ever since he reached town, he would have told it at
      the opera, and at a dozen routs and suppers. Beg pardon, captain,&rdquo; said
      he, turning to John Paul, &ldquo;but I think 'twas your peacock coat that saved
      you both, for it caught Horry's eye through the window, as you got out of
      the chaise, and down he came as fast as he could hobble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horry had a little dinner to-day in Arlington Street, where he lives, and
      Miss Dorothy was there. I have told you, Richard, there has been no
      sensation in town equal to that of your Maryland beauty, since Lady Sarah
      Lennox. You may have some notion of the old beau Horry can be when he
      tries, and he is over-fond of Miss Dolly&mdash;she puts him in mind of
      some canvas or other of Sir Peter's. He vowed he had been saving this
      piece de resistance, as he was pleased to call it, expressly for her,
      since it had to do somewhat with Maryland. 'What d'ye think I met at
      Windsor, Miss Manners?' he cries, before we had begun the second course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Perhaps a repulse from his Majesty,' says Dolly, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Nay,' says Mr. Walpole, making a face, for he hates a laugh at his cost;
      nothing less than a young American giant, with the attire of Dr. Benjamin
      Franklin and the manner of the Fauxbourg Saint Germain. But he had a whiff
      of deer leather about him, and shoulders and back and legs to make his
      fortune at Hockley in the Hole, had he lived two generations since. And he
      had with him a strange, Scotch sea-captain, who had rescued him from
      pirates, bless you, no less. That is, he said he was a sea-captain; but he
      talked French like a Parisian, and quoted Shakespeare like Mr. Burke or
      Dr. Johnson. He may have been M. Caron de Beaumarchais, for I never saw
      him, or a soothsayer, or Cagliostro the magician, for he guessed my name.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Guessed your name!' we cried, for the story was out of the ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Just that,' answered he, and repeated some damned verse I never heard,
      with Horatio in it, and made them all laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Paul and I looked at each other in astonishment, and we, too, laughed
      heartily. It was indeed an odd coincidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship continued: &ldquo;'Well, be that as it may,' said Horry, 'he was an
      able man of sagacity, this sea-captain, and, like many another, had a
      penchant for being a gentleman. But he was more of an oddity than
      Hertford's beast of Gevaudan, and was dressed like Salvinio, the monkey my
      Lord Holland brought back from his last Italian tour.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have laughed over this description since, my dears, and so has John
      Paul. But at that time I saw nothing funny in it, and winced with him when
      Comyn repeated it with such brutal unconsciousness. However, young
      Englishmen of birth and wealth of that day were not apt to consider the
      feelings of those they deemed below them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to your story. Comyn,&rdquo; I cut in testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his Lordship missed entirely the cause of my displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to him!&rdquo; he exclaimed good-naturedly. &ldquo;He will hear of nothing but
      Miss Dolly. Well, Richard, my lad, you should have seen her as Horry went
      on to tell that you had been taken from Maryland, with her head forward
      and her lips parted, and a light in those eyes of hers to make a man fall
      down and worship. For Mr. Lloyd, or some one in your Colony, had written
      of your disappearance, and I vow bliss Dorothy has not been the same
      since. Nor have I been the only one to remark it,&rdquo; said he, waving off my
      natural protest at such extravagance. &ldquo;We have talked of you more than
      once, she and I, and mourned you for dead. But I am off my course again,
      as we sailors say, captain. Horry was describing how Richard lifted little
      Goble by one hand and spun all the dignity out of him, when Miss Manners
      broke in, being able to contain herself no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'An American, Mr. Walpole, and from Maryland?' she demanded. And the way
      she said it made them all look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Assurement, mademoiselle,' replied Horry, in his cursed French; and
      perhaps you know him. He would gladden the heart of Frederick of Prussia,
      for he stands six and three if an inch. I took such a fancy to the lad
      that I invited him to sup with me, and he gave me back a message fit for
      Mr. Wilkes to send to his Majesty, as haughty as you choose, that if I
      desired him I must have his friend in the bargain. You Americans are the
      very devil for independence, Miss Manners! 'Ods fish, I liked his spirit
      so much I had his friend, Captain something or other&mdash;'and there he
      stopped, caught by Miss Manners's appearance, for she was very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The name is Richard Carvel!' she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'll lay a thousand it was!' I shouted, rising in my chair. And the
      company stared, and Lady Pembroke vowed I had gone mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Bless me, bless me, here's a romance for certain!' cried Horry; 'it
      throws my &ldquo;Castle of Otranto&rdquo; in the shade' (&ldquo;that's some damned book he
      has written,&rdquo; Comyn interjected).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may not believe me, Richard, when I say that Miss Dolly ate but
      little after that, and her colour came and went like the red of a stormy
      sunset at sea. 'Here's this dog Richard come to spill all our chances,' I
      swore to myself. The company had been prodigiously entertained by the
      tale, and clamoured for more, and when Horry had done I told how you had
      fought me at Annapolis, and had saved my life. But Miss Manners sat very
      still, biting her lip, and I knew she was sadly vexed that you had not
      gone to her in Arlington Street. For a woman will reason thus,&rdquo; said his
      Lordship, winking wisely. &ldquo;But I more than suspected something to have
      happened, so I asked Horry to send his fellow Favre over to the Star and
      Garter to see if you were there, tho' I was of three minds to let you go
      to the devil. You should have seen her face when he came back to say that
      you had been for three weeks in a Castle Yard sponging-house! Then Horry
      said he would lend me his coach, and when it was brought around Miss
      Manners took our breaths by walking downstairs and into it, nor would she
      listen to a word of the objections cried by my Lady Pembroke and the rest.
      You must know there is no stopping the beauty when she has made her mind.
      And while they were all chattering on the steps I jumped in, and off we
      drove, and you will be the most talked-of man in London to-morrow. I give
      you Miss Manners!&rdquo; cried his Lordship, as he ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all stood to the toast, I with my blood a-tingle and my brain awhirl,
      so that I scarce knew what I did.

      CHAPTER XXVII. IN WHICH I AM SORE TEMPTED
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the devil is this John Paul, and what is to become of him?&rdquo; asked
      Comyn, as I escorted him downstairs to a chair. &ldquo;You must give him two
      hundred pounds, or a thousand, if you like, and let him get out. He can't
      be coming to the clubs with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he pulled me into the coffee room after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't understand the man, Comyn,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;he isn't that kind, I tell
      you. What he has done for me is out of friendship, as he says, and he
      wouldn't touch a farthing save what I owe him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cursed if he isn't a rum sea-captain,&rdquo; he answered, shrugging his
      shoulders; &ldquo;cursed if I ever ran foul of one yet who would refuse a couple
      of hundred and call quits. What's he to do? Is he to live like a Lord of
      the Treasury upon a master's savings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said I, soberly, resolved not to be angry, &ldquo;I would willingly be
      cast back in Castle Yard to-night rather than desert him, who might have
      deserted me twenty times to his advantage. Mr. Carvel has not wealth
      enough, nor I gratitude enough, to reward him. But if our family can make
      his fortune, it shall be made. And I am determined to go with him to
      America by the first packet I can secure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He clutched my arm with an earnestness to startle me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not leave England now,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she will marry Chartersea if you do. And take my oath upon it,
      you alone can save her from that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I exclaimed, but my breath caught sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Richard. Mr. Manners's manoeuvres are the talk of the town, and
      the beast of a duke is forever wining and dining in Arlington Street. At
      first people ridiculed, now they are giving credit. It is said,&rdquo; he
      whispered fearfully, &ldquo;it is said that his Grace has got Mr. Manners in his
      power,&mdash;some question of honour, you understand, which will ruin him,&mdash;and
      that even now the duke is in a position to force the marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned forward and searched me with his keen gray eyes, as tho'
      watching the effect of the intelligence upon me. I was, indeed, stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, had she refused me fifty times instead of only twice,&rdquo; my Lord
      continued, &ldquo;I could not wish her such a fate as that vicious scoundrel.
      And since she will not have me, I would rather it were you than any man
      alive. For she loves you, Richard, as surely as the world is turning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; I replied passionately; &ldquo;you are deceived by the old liking she
      has always had for me since we were children together.&rdquo; I was deeply
      touched by his friendship. &ldquo;But tell me how that could affect this
      marriage with Chartersea. I believe her pride capable of any sacrifice for
      the family honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a gesture of impatience that knocked over a candlestick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, curse you, there you are again!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;showing how little you
      know of women and of their pride. If she were sure that you loved her, she
      would never marry Chartersea or any one else. She has had near the whole
      of London at her feet, and toyed with it. Now she has been amusing herself
      with Charles Fox, but I vow she cares for none of them. Titles, fame,
      estates, will not move her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she were sure that I loved her!&rdquo; I repeated, dazed by what he was
      saying. &ldquo;How you are talking, Comyn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just that. Ah, how I know her, Richard! She can be reckless beyond
      notion. And if it were proved to her that you were in love with Miss
      Swain, the barrister's daughter, over whom we were said to have fought,
      she would as soon marry Chartersea, or March, or the devil, to show you
      how little she cared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Patty Swain!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she knew you did not care a rope's end for Patty, Mr. Marmaduke
      and his reputation might go into exile together,&rdquo; he continued, without
      heeding. &ldquo;So much for a woman's pride, I say. The day the news of your
      disappearance arrived, Richard, she was starting out with a party to visit
      Lord Carlisle's seat, Castle Howard. Not a step would she stir, though Mr.
      Marmaduke whined and coaxed and threatened. And I swear to you she has
      never been the same since, though few but I know why. I might tell you
      more, my lad, were it not a breach of confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't,&rdquo; I said; for I would not let my feelings run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, then, I will!&rdquo; he cried impetuously, &ldquo;for the end justifies it. You
      must know that after the letter came from Mr. Lloyd, we thought you dead.
      I could never get her to speak of you until a fortnight ago. We both had
      gone with a party to see Wanstead and dine at the Spread Eagle upon the
      Forest, and I stole her away from the company and led her out under the
      trees. My God, Richard, how beautiful she was in the wood with the red in
      her cheeks and the wind blowing her black hair! For the second time I
      begged her to be Lady Comyn. Fool that I was, I thought she wavered, and
      my heart beat as it never will again. Then, as she turned away, from her
      hand slipped a little gold-bound purse, and as I picked it up a clipping
      from a newspaper fluttered out. 'Pon my soul, it was that very scandalous
      squib of the Maryland Gazette about our duel! I handed it back with a bow.
      I dared not look up at her face, but stood with my eyes on the ground,
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Lord Comyn,' says she, presently, with a quiver in her voice, 'before I
      give you a reply you must first answer, on your word as a gentleman, what
      I ask you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Is it true that Richard Carvel was in love with Miss Swain?' she asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you said, Comyn,&rdquo; I broke in, unable longer to contain myself, &ldquo;you
      said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said: 'Dorothy, if I were to die to-morrow, I would swear Richard
      Carvel loved you, and you only.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship had spoken with that lightness which hides only the deepest
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she refused you?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Oh, surely not for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she did well,&rdquo; said my Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed my head on my arms, for I had gone through a great deal that day,
      and this final example of Comyn's generosity overwhelmed me. Then I felt
      his hand laid kindly on my shoulder, and I rose up and seized it. His eyes
      were dim, as were mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, will you go to Maryland and be a fool?&rdquo; asked his Lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated, sadly torn between duty and inclination. John Paul could,
      indeed, go to America without me. Next the thought came over me in a flash
      that my grandfather might be ill, or even dead, and there would be no one
      to receive the captain. I knew he would never consent to spend the season
      at the Star and Garter at my expense. And then the image of the man rose
      before me, of him who had given me all he owned, and gone with me so
      cheerfully to prison, though he knew me not from the veriest adventurer
      and impostor. I was undecided no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go, Jack,&rdquo; I said sadly; &ldquo;as God judges, I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me queerly, as if I were beyond his comprehension, picked up
      his hat, called out that he would see me in the morning, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went slowly upstairs, threw off my clothes mechanically, and tumbled
      into bed. The captain had long been asleep. By the exertion of all the
      will power I could command, I was able gradually to think more and more
      soberly, and the more I thought, the more absurd, impossible, it seemed
      that I, a rough provincial not yet of age, should possess the heart of a
      beauty who had but to choose from the best of all England. An hundred
      times I went over the scene of poor Comyn's proposal, nay, saw it vividly,
      as though the whole of it had been acted before me: and as I became
      calmer, the plainer I perceived that Dorothy, thinking me dead, was
      willing to let Comyn believe that she had loved me, and had so eased the
      soreness of her refusal. Perhaps, in truth, a sentiment had sprung up in
      her breast when she heard of my disappearance, which she mistook for love.
      But surely the impulse that sent her to Castle Yard was not the same as
      that Comyn had depicted: it was merely the survival of the fancy of a
      little girl in a grass-stained frock, who had romped on the lawn at Carvel
      Hall. I sighed as I remembered the sun and the flowers and the blue
      Chesapeake, and recalled the very toss of her head when she had said she
      would marry nothing less than a duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, Dolly, perchance it was to be nothing more than a duke! The bloated
      face and beady eyes and the broad crooked back I had seen that day in
      Arlington Street rose before me,&mdash;I should know his Grace of
      Chartersea again were I to meet him in purgatory. Was it, indeed, possible
      that I could prevent her marriage with this man? I fell asleep, repeating
      the query, as the dawn was sifting through the blinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I awakened late. Banks was already there to dress me, to congratulate me
      as discreetly as a well-trained servant should; nor did he remind me of
      the fact that he had offered to lend me money, for which omission I liked
      him the better. In the parlour I found the captain sipping his chocolate
      and reading his morning Chronicle, as though all his life he had done
      nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, captain.&rdquo; And fetching him a lick on the back that nearly
      upset his bowl, I cried as heartily as I could:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, if our luck holds, we'll be sailing before the week is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he looked troubled. He hemmed and hawed, and finally broke out into
      Scotch:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, laddie, y'ell no be leaving Miss Dorothy for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense has Comyn put into your head?&rdquo; I demanded, with a stitch in
      my side; I am no more to Miss Manners than&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than John Paul! Faith, y'ell not make me believe that. Ah, Richard,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;ye're a sly dog. You and I have been as thick these twa months as men
      can well live, and never a word out of you of the most sublime creature
      that walks. I have seen women in many countries, lad, beauties to set
      thoughts afire and swords a-play,&mdash;and 'tis not her beauty alone. She
      hath a spirit for a queen to covet, and air and carriage, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This eloquent harangue left me purple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant it all, captain. She has but to choose her title and estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and I have a notion which she'll be choosing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The knowledge is worth a thousand pounds at the least,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I
      will lend you the sum, and warrant no lack of takers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the devil fly off with such temperament! And I had half the
      encouragement she has given you, I would cast anchor on the spot, and they
      might hang and quarter me to move me. But I know you well,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      his manner changing, &ldquo;you are making this great sacrifice on my account.
      And I will not be a drag on your pleasures, Richard, or stand in the way
      of your prospects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Paul,&rdquo; I said, sitting down beside him, &ldquo;have I deserved this
      from you? Have I shown a desire to desert you now that my fortunes have
      changed? I have said that you shall taste of our cheer at Carvel Hall, and
      have looked forward this long while to the time when I shall take you to
      my grandfather and say: 'Mr. Carvel, this is he whose courage and charity
      have restored you to me, and me to you.' And he will have changed mightily
      if you do not have the best in Maryland. Should you wish to continue on
      the sea, you shall have the Belle of the Wye, launched last year. 'Tis
      time Captain Elliott took to his pension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain sighed, and a gleam I did not understand came into his dark
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would that God had given me your character and your heart, Richard,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;in place of this striving thing I have within me. But 'tis written
      that a leopard cannot change his spots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The passage shall be booked this day,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning was an eventful one. Comyn arrived first, dressed in a suit
      of mauve French cloth that set off his fine figure to great advantage. He
      regarded me keenly as he entered, as if to discover whether I had changed
      my mind over night. And I saw he was not in the best of tempers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when do you sail?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I have no doubt you have sent out
      already to get passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been trying to persuade Mr. Carvel to remain in London, my Lord,&rdquo;
       said the captain. &ldquo;I tell him he is leaving his best interests behind
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that for once you have undertaken a task beyond your ability,
      Captain Paul,&rdquo; was the rather tart reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain has a ridiculous idea that he is the cause of my going,&rdquo; I
      said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Paul rose somewhat abruptly, seized his hat and bowed to his
      Lordship, and in the face of a rain sallied out, remarking that he had as
      yet seen nothing of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack, you must do me the favour not to talk of this in John Paul's
      presence,&rdquo; I said, when the door had closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he doesn't suspect why you are going, he has more stupidity than I
      gave him credit for,&rdquo; Comyn answered gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear he does suspect,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship went to the table and began to write, leaving me to the
      Chronicle, the pages of which I did not see. Then came Mr. Dix, and such a
      change I had never beheld in mortal man. In place of the would-be squire I
      had encountered in Threadneedle Street, here was an unctuous person of
      business in sober gray; but he still wore the hypocritical smirk with no
      joy in it. His bow was now all respectful obedience. Comyn acknowledged it
      with a curt nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dix began smoothly, where a man of more honesty would have found the
      going difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his hands, &ldquo;I wish first to express my
      profound regrets for what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse your regrets,&rdquo; said Comyn, bluntly. &ldquo;You come here on business. Mr.
      Carvel does not stand in need of regrets at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was but on the safe side of Mr. Carvel's money, my Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I'll warrant you are always on the safe side of money,&rdquo; replied
      Comyn, with a laugh. &ldquo;What I wish to know, Mr. Dix,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is
      whether you are willing to take my word that this is Mr. Richard Carvel,
      the grandson and heir of Lionel Carvel, Esquire, of Carvel Hall in
      Maryland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your Lordship's most obedient servant,&rdquo; said Mr. Dix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound you, sir! Can you or can you not answer a simple question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dix straightened. He may have spoken elsewhere of asserting his
      dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not presume to doubt your Lordship's word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if I were to be personally responsible for such sums as Mr. Carvel
      may need, I suppose you would be willing to advance them to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly, willingly, my Lord,&rdquo; said Mr. Dix, and added immediately:
      &ldquo;Your Lordship will not object to putting that in writing? Merely a matter
      of form, as your Lordship knows, but we men of affairs are held to a
      strict accountability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Comyn made a movement of disgust, took up a pen and wrote out the
      indorsement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You men of affairs will at least never die of
      starvation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dix took the paper with a low bow, began to shower me with
      protestations of his fidelity to my grandfather's interests, which were
      one day to be my own,&mdash;he hoped, with me, not soon,&mdash;drew from
      his pocket more than sufficient for my immediate wants, said that I should
      have more by a trusty messenger, and was going on to clear himself of his
      former neglect and indifference, when Banks announced:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His honour, Mr. Manners!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Comyn and I exchanged glances, and his Lordship gave a low whistle. Nor
      was the circumstance without its effect upon Mr. Dix. With my knowledge of
      the character of Dorothy's father I might have foreseen this visit, which
      came, nevertheless, as a complete surprise. For a moment I hesitated, and
      then made a motion to show him up. Comyn voiced my decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why let the little cur stand in the way?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he counts for
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marmaduke was not long in ascending, and tripped into the room as Mr.
      Dix backed out of it, as gayly as tho' he had never sent me about my
      business in the street. His clothes, of a cherry cut velvet, were as ever
      a little beyond the fashion, and he carried something I had never before
      seen, then used by the extreme dandies in London,&mdash;an umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Richard Carvel! Is it possible?&rdquo; he screamed in his piping voice.
      &ldquo;We mourned you for dead, and here you turn up in London alive and well,
      and bigger and stronger than ever. Oons! one need not go to Scripture for
      miracles. I shall write my congratulations to Mr. Carvel this day, sir.&rdquo;
       And he pushed his fingers into my waistcoat, so that Comyn and I were near
      to laughing in his face. For it was impossible to be angry with a little
      coxcomb of such pitiful intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, good morning, my Lord. I see your Lordship has risen early in the
      same good cause, I myself am up two hours before my time. You will pardon
      the fuss I am making over the lad, Comyn, but his grandfather is my very
      dear friend, and Richard was brought up with my daughter Dorothy. They
      were like brother and sister. What, Richard, you will not take my hand!
      Surely you are not so unreasonable as to hold against me that unfortunate
      circumstance in Arlington Street! Yes, Dorothy has shocked me. She has
      told me of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Comyn winked at me as I replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shan't mention it, Mr. Manners. I have had my three weeks in prison,
      and perhaps know the world all the better for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up his umbrella in mock dismay, and stumbled abruptly into a
      chair. There he sat looking at me, a whimsical uneasiness on his face. &ldquo;We
      shall indeed mention it, sir. Three weeks in prison, to think of it! And
      you would not so much as send me a line. Ah, Richard, pride is a good
      thing, but I sometimes think we from Maryland have too much of it. We
      shall indeed speak of the matter. Out of justice to me you must understand
      how it occurred. You must know that I am deucedly absentminded, and
      positively lost without my glass. And I had somebody with me, so Dorothy
      said. Chartersea, I believe. And his Grace made me think you were a cursed
      beggar. I make a point never to have to do with 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Mr. Manners,&rdquo; Comyn cut in dryly; &ldquo;for I have known them
      to be so persistently troublesome, when once encouraged, as to interfere
      seriously with our arrangements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; Mr. Manners ejaculated, and then came to an abrupt pause, while I
      wondered whether the shot had told. To relieve him I inquired after Mrs.
      Manners's health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, to be sure,&rdquo; he replied, beginning to fumble in his skirts; &ldquo;London
      agrees with her remarkably, and she is better than she has been for years.
      And she is overjoyed at your most wonderful escape, Richard, as are we
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he gave me a note. I concealed my eagerness as I took it and broke the
      seal, to discover that it was not from Dorothy, but from Mrs. Manners
      herself.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;My dear Richard&rdquo; (so it ran), &ldquo;I thank God with your dear
   Grandfather over y'r Deliverance, &amp; you must bring y'r Deliverer,
   whom Dorothy describes as Courtly and Gentlemanly despite his
   Calling, to dine with us this very Day, that we may express to him
   our Gratitude. I know you are far too Sensible not to come to
   Arlington Street. I subscribe myself, Richard, y'r sincere Friend,

                    &ldquo;MARGARET MANNERS.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There was not so much as a postscript from Dolly, as I had hoped. But the
      letter was whole-souled, like Mrs. Manners, and breathed the affection she
      had always had for me. I honoured her the more that she had not attempted
      to excuse Mr. Manners's conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come, Richard?&rdquo; cried Mr. Marmaduke, with an attempt at
      heartiness. &ldquo;You must come, and the captain, too. For I hear, with regret,
      that you are not to be long with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I caught another significant look from Comyn from between the window
      curtains. But I accepted for myself, and conditionally for John Paul. Mr.
      Manners rose to take his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy will be glad to see you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I often think, Richard, that
      she tires of these generals and King's ministers, and longs for a romp at
      Wilmot House again. Alas,&rdquo; he sighed, offering us a pinch of snuff (which
      he said was the famous Number 37), &ldquo;alas, she has had a deal too much of
      attention, with his Grace of Chartersea and a dozen others would to marry
      her. I fear she will go soon,&rdquo; and he sighed again. &ldquo;Upon my soul I cannot
      make her out. I'll lay something handsome, my Lord, that the madcap
      adventure with you after Richard sets the gossips going. One day she is
      like a schoolgirl, and I blame myself for not taking her mother's advice
      to send her to Mrs. Terry, at Campden House; and the next, egad, she is as
      difficult to approach as a crowned head. Well, gentlemen, I give you good
      day, I have an appointment at White's. I am happy to see you have fallen
      in good hands, Richard. My Lord, your most obedient!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll lay something handsome!&rdquo; said my Lord, when the door had closed
      behind him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. ARLINGTON STREET
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sun having come out, and John Paul not returning by two,&mdash;being
      ogling, I supposed, the ladies in Hyde Park,&mdash;I left him a message
      and betook myself with as great trepidation as ever to Dorothy's house.
      The door was opened by the identical footman who had so insolently offered
      me money, and I think he recognized me, for he backed away as he told me
      the ladies were not at home. But I had not gone a dozen paces in my
      disappointment when I heard him running after me, asking if my honour were
      Mr. Richard Carvel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ladies will see your honour,&rdquo; he said, and conducted me back into the
      house and up the wide stairs. I had heard that Arlington Street was known
      as the street of the King's ministers, and I surmised that Mr. Manners had
      rented this house, and its furniture, from some great man who had gone out
      of office, plainly a person of means and taste. The hall, like that of
      many of the great town-houses, was in semi-darkness, but I remarked that
      the stair railing was of costly iron-work and polished brass; and, as I
      went up, that the stone niches in the wall were filled with the busts of
      statesmen, and I recognized among these, that of the great Walpole. A
      great copper gilt chandelier hung above. But the picture of the
      drawing-room I was led into, with all its colours, remains in the eye of
      my mind to this day. It was a large room, the like of which I had never
      seen in any private residence of the New World, situated in the back of
      the house. Its balcony overlooked the fresh expanse of the Green Park.
      Upon its high ceiling floated Venus and the graces, by Zucchi; and the
      mantel, upon which ticked an antique and curious French clock, was carved
      marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the gilt panels of the walls were wreaths of red roses. At least a
      half-dozen tall mirrors, framed in rococos, were placed about, the largest
      taking the space between the two high windows on the park side. And
      underneath it stood a gold cabinet, lacquered by Martin's inimitable hand,
      in the centre of which was set a medallion of porcelain, with the head in
      dark blue of his Majesty, Charles the First. The chairs and lounges were
      marquetry,&mdash;satin-wood and mahogany,&mdash;with seats and backs of
      blue brocade. The floor was polished to the degree of danger, and on the
      walls hung a portrait by Van Dycke, another, of a young girl, by
      Richardson, a landscape by the Dutch artist Ruysdael, and a water-colour
      by Zaccarelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had lived for four months the roughest of lives, and the room brought
      before me so sharply the contrast between my estate and the grandeur and
      elegance in which Dorothy lived, that my spirits fell as I looked about
      me. In front of me was a vase of flowers, and beside them on the table lay
      a note &ldquo;To Miss Manners, in Arlington Street,&rdquo; and sealed with a ducal
      crest. I was unconsciously turning it over, when something impelled me to
      look around. There, erect in the doorway, stood Dolly, her eyes so
      earnestly fixed upon me that I dropped the letter with a start. A faint
      colour mounted to her crown of black hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you have come, Richard,&rdquo; she said. Her voice was low, and tho'
      there was no anger in it, the tone seemed that of reproach. I wondered
      whether she thought the less of me for coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you blame me for wishing to see you before I leave, Dolly?&rdquo; I cried,
      and crossed quickly over to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she drew a step backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is true that you are going,&rdquo; said she, this time with a plain
      note of coldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must, Dorothy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I can get passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed me and seated herself on the lounge, leaving me to stand like a
      lout before her, ashamed of my youth and of the clumsiness of my great
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Richard,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;confess to your old play mate! I should like
      to know how many young men of wealth and family would give up the
      pleasures of a London season were there not a strong attraction in
      Maryland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How I longed to tell her that I would give ten years of my life to remain
      in England: that duty to John Paul took me home. But I was dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should make a macaroni of you to amaze our colony,&rdquo; said Dolly,
      lightly, as I sat down a great distance away; &ldquo;to accept my schooling were
      to double your chances when you return, Richard. You should have cards to
      everything, and my Lord Comyn or Mr. Fox or some one would introduce you
      at the clubs. I vow you would be a sensation, with your height and figure.
      You should meet all the beauties of England, and perchance,&rdquo; she added
      mischievously, &ldquo;perchance you might be taking one home with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Dolly,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;I am not your match in jesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jesting!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I was never more sober. But where is your
      captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said that I hoped that John Paul would be there shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fanciful he is! And his conversation,&mdash;one might think he had
      acquired the art at Marly or in the Fauxbourg. In truth, he should have
      been born on the far side of the Channel. And he has the air of the great
      man,&rdquo; said she, glancing up at ms, covertly. &ldquo;For my part, I prefer a
      little more bluntness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was nettled at the speech. Dorothy had ever been quick to seize upon and
      ridicule the vulnerable oddities of a character, and she had all the
      contempt of the great lady for those who tried to scale by pleasing arts.
      I perceived with regret that she had taken a prejudice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Dorothy,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;not even you shall talk so of the captain. For
      you have seen him at his worst. There are not many, I warrant you, born
      like him a poor gardener's son who rise by character and ability to be a
      captain at three and twenty. And he will be higher yet. He has never
      attended any but a parish school, and still has learning to astonish Mr.
      Walpole, learning which he got under vast difficulties. He is a gentleman,
      I say, far above many I have known, and he is a man. If you would know a
      master, you should see him on his own ship. If you would know a gentleman,
      you have been with me in his mother's cottage.&rdquo; And, warming as I talked,
      I told her of that saddest of all homecomings to the little cabin under
      Criffel's height.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small wonder that I adored Dorothy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Would that I could paint her moods, that I might describe the strange
      light in her eyes when I had finished, that I might tell how in an instant
      she was another woman. She rose impulsively and took a chair at my side,
      and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis so I love to hear you speak, Richard, when you uphold the absent.
      For I feel it is so you must champion me when I am far away. My dear old
      playmate is ever the same, strong to resent, and seeing ever the best in
      his friends. Forgive me, Richard, I have been worse than silly. And will
      you tell me that story of your adventures which I long to learn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ay, that I would. I told it her, and she listened silently, save only now
      and then a cry of wonder or of sympathy that sounded sweet to my ears,&mdash;just
      as I had dreamed of her listening when I used to pace the deck of the
      brigantine John, at sea. And when at length I had finished, she sat
      looking out over the Green Park, as tho' she had forgot my presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Mrs. Manners came in and found us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had ever pleased me to imagine that Dorothy's mother had been in her
      youth like Dorothy. She had the same tall figure, grace in its every
      motion, and the same eyes of deep blue, and the generous but well-formed
      mouth. A man may pity, but cannot conceive the heroism that a woman of
      such a mould must have gone through who has been married since early
      girlhood to a man like Mr. Manners. Some women would have been driven
      quickly to frivolity, and worse, but this one had struggled year after
      year to maintain an outward serenity to a critical world, and had
      succeeded, tho' success had cost her dear. Each trial had deepened a line
      of that face, had done its share to subdue the voice which had once rung
      like Dorothy's; and in the depths of her eyes lingered a sadness
      indefinable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed upon me with that kindness and tenderness I had always received
      since the days when, younger and more beautiful than now, she was the
      companion of my mother. And the unbidden shadow of a thought came to me
      that these two sweet women had had some sadness in common. Many a summer's
      day I remembered them sewing together in the spring-house, talking in
      subdued voices which were hushed when I came running in. And lo! the same
      memory was on Dorothy's mother then, half expressed as she laid her hands
      upon my shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Elizabeth!&rdquo; she said,&mdash;not to me, nor yet to Dorothy; &ldquo;I wish
      that she might have lived to see you now. It is Captain Jack again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed, and kissed me. And I felt at last that I had come home after
      many wanderings. We sat down, mother and daughter on the sofa with their
      fingers locked. She did not speak of Mr. Manners's conduct, or of my stay
      in the sponging-house. And for this I was thankful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had a letter from Mr. Lloyd, Richard,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my grandfather?&rdquo; I faltered, a thickness in my throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Manners, gently, &ldquo;he thinks you dead. But you
      have written him?&rdquo; she added hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. &ldquo;From Dumfries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will have the letter soon,&rdquo; she said cheerfully. &ldquo;I thank Heaven I am
      able to tell you that his health is remarkable under the circumstances.
      But he will not quit the house, and sees no one except your uncle, who is
      with him constantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was what I expected. But the confirmation of it brought me to my feet
      in a torrent of indignation, exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The villain! You tell me he will allow Mr. Carvel to see no one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started forward, laying her hand on my arm, and Dorothy gave a little
      cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you saying, Richard? What are you saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Manners,&rdquo; I answered, collecting myself, &ldquo;I must tell you that I
      believe it is Grafton Carvel himself that is responsible for my abduction.
      He meant that I should be murdered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Dorothy rose, her eyes flashing and her head high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would have murdered you&mdash;you, Richard?&rdquo; she cried, in such a
      storm of anger as I had never seen her. &ldquo;Oh, he should hang for the
      thought of it! I have always suspected Grafton Carvel capable of any
      crime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Dorothy,&rdquo; said her mother; &ldquo;it is not seemly for a young girl to
      talk so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seemly!&rdquo; said Dorothy. &ldquo;If I were a man I would bring him to justice, and
      it took me a lifetime. Nay, if I were a man and could use a sword&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy! Dorothy!&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy sat down, the light lingering in her eyes. She had revealed more
      of herself in that instant than in all her life before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a grave charge, Richard,&rdquo; said Mrs. Manners, at length. &ldquo;And your
      uncle is a man of the best standing in Annapolis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must remember his behaviour before my mother's marriage, Mrs.
      Manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, I do, Richard,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;And I have never trusted him
      since. I suppose you are not making your accusation without cause?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have cause enough,&rdquo; I answered bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And proof?&rdquo; she added. She should have been the man in her family.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her how Harvey had overheard the bits of the plot at Carvel Hall
      near two years gone; and now that I had begun, I was going through with
      Mr. Allen's part in the conspiracy, when Dorothy startled us both by
      crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is so much wickedness in the world, I wish I had never been
      born!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung herself from the room in a passion of tears to shock me. As if
      in answer to my troubled look, Mrs. Manners said, with a sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has not been at all well, lately, Richard. I fear the gayety of this
      place is too much for her. Indeed, I am sorry we ever left Maryland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was greatly disturbed, and thought involuntarily of Comyn's words. Could
      it be that Mr. Manners was forcing her to marry Chartersea?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has Mr. Lloyd said nothing of my uncle?&rdquo; I asked after a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not deny that ugly rumours are afloat,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Grafton, as
      you know, is not liked in Annapolis, especially by the Patriot party. But
      there is not the slightest ground for suspicion. The messenger&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle denies all knowledge of. He was taken to be the tool of the
      captain of the slaver, and he disappeared so completely that it was
      supposed he had escaped to the ship. The story goes that you were seized
      for a ransom, and killed in the struggle. Your black ran all the way to
      town, crying the news to those he met on the Circle and in West Street,
      but by the mercy of God he was stopped by Mr. Swain and some others before
      he had reached your grandfather. In ten minutes a score of men were
      galloping out of the Town Gate, Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Singleton ahead. They
      found your horse dead, and the road through the woods all trampled down,
      and they spurred after the tracks down to the water's edge. Singleton
      recalled a slaver, the crew of which had been brawling at the Ship tavern
      a few nights before. But the storm was so thick they could not see the
      ship's length out into the river. They started two fast sloops from the
      town wharves in chase, and your uncle has been moving heaven and earth to
      obtain some clew of you. He has put notices in the newspapers of
      Charlestown, Philadelphia, New York, and even Boston, and offered a
      thousand pounds reward.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIX. I MEET A VERY GREAT YOUNG MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The French clock had struck four, and I was beginning to fear that,
      despite my note, the captain's pride forbade his coming to Mr. Manners's
      house, when in he walked, as tho' 'twere no novelty to have his name
      announced. And so straight and handsome was he, his dark eye flashing with
      the self-confidence born in the man, that the look of uneasiness I had
      detected upon Mrs. Manners's face quickly changed to one of surprise and
      pleasure. Of course the good lady had anticipated a sea-captain of a far
      different mould. He kissed her hand with a respectful grace, and then her
      daughter's, for Dorothy had come back to us, calmer. And I was filled with
      joy over his fine appearance. Even Dorothy was struck by the change the
      clothes had made in him. Mrs. Manners thanked him very tactfully for
      restoring me to them, as she was pleased to put it, to which John Paul
      modestly replied that he had done no more than another would under the
      same circumstances. And he soon had them both charmed by his address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Richard,&rdquo; said Dorothy's mother aside to me, &ldquo;surely this cannot be
      your sea-captain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded merrily. But John Paul's greatest triumph was yet to come. For
      presently Mr. Marmaduke arrived from White's, and when he had greeted me
      with effusion he levelled his glass at the corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Pray, my dear, whom have you invited to-day?&rdquo; And
      without awaiting her reply, as was frequently his habit, he turned to me
      and said: &ldquo;I had hoped we were to have the pleasure of Captain Paul's
      company, Richard. For I must have the chance before you go of clasping the
      hand of your benefactor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have the chance, at least, sir,&rdquo; I replied, a fiery exultation
      in my breast. &ldquo;Mr. Manners, this is my friend, Captain Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain stood up and bowed gravely at the little gentleman's blankly
      amazed countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;dear me, is it possible!&rdquo; and advanced a step, but the
      captain remained immovable. Mr. Marmaduke fumbled for his snuff-box,
      failed to find it, halted, and began again, for he never was known to lack
      words for long: &ldquo;Captain, as one of the oldest friends of Mr. Lionel
      Carvel, I claim the right to thank you in his name for your gallant
      conduct. I hear that you are soon to see him, and to receive his
      obligations from him in person. You will not find him lacking, sir, I'll
      warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was Mr. Marmaduke's feline ingenuity! I had a retort ready, and I saw
      that Mrs. Manners, long tried in such occasions, was about to pour oil on
      the waters. But it was Dorothy who exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What captain! are you, too, going to Maryland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Paul reddened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that he is, Dolly,&rdquo; I cut in hurriedly. &ldquo;Did you imagine I would let
      him escape so easily? Henceforth as he has said, he is to be an American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flashed at me such a look as might have had a dozen different
      meanings, and in a trice it was gone again under her dark lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was got through I know not how. Mr. Manners led the talk, and spoke
      more than was needful concerning our approaching voyage. He was at great
      pains to recommend the Virginia packet, which had made the fastest passage
      from the Capes; and she sailed, as was no doubt most convenient, the
      Saturday following. I should find her a comfortable vessel, and he would
      oblige me with a letter to Captain Alsop. Did Captain Paul know him? But
      the captain was describing West Indian life to Mrs. Manners. Dorothy had
      little to say; and as for me, I was in no very pleasant humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave a deaf ear to Mr. Marmaduke's sallies, to speculate on the nature
      of the disgrace which Chartersea was said to hold over his head. And
      twenty times, as I looked upon Dolly's beauty, I ground my teeth at the
      notion of returning home. I have ever been slow of suspicion, but suddenly
      it struck me sharply that Mr. Manners's tactics must have a deeper
      significance than I had thought. Why was it that he feared my presence in
      London?
    </p>
    <p>
      As we made our way back to the drawing-room, I was hoping for a talk with
      Dolly (alas! I should not have many more), when I heard a voice which
      sounded strangely familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Comyn,&rdquo; it was saying, &ldquo;you know I should be at the Princess's
      were I not so completely worn out. I was up near all of last night with
      Rosette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marmaduke, entering before us, cried:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear creature! I trust you have had medical attendance, Mr. Walpole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; quoth Horry (for it was he), &ldquo;I sent Favre to Hampstead to fetch
      Dr. Pratt, where he was attending some mercer's wife. It seems that
      Rosette had got into the street and eaten something horrible out of the
      kennel. I discharged the footman, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A plague on your dog, Horry,&rdquo; said my Lord, yawning, and was about to add
      something worse, when he caught sight of Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Walpole bowed over her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you forgotten so soon your Windsor acquaintances, Mr. Walpole?&rdquo;
       she asked, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; said Horry, looking very hard at me, &ldquo;so it is, so it is. Your
      hand, Mr. Carvel. You have only to remain in London, sir, to discover that
      your reputation is ready-made. I contributed my mite. For you must know
      that I am a sort of circulating library of odd news which those devils,
      the printers, contrive to get sooner or later&mdash;Heaven knows how! And
      Miss Manners herself has completed your fame. Yes, the story of your
      gallant rescue is in all the clubs to-day. Egad, sir, you come down heads
      up, like a loaded coin. You will soon be a factor in Change Alley.&rdquo; And
      glancing slyly at the blushing Dolly, he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been many things, Miss Manners, but never before an instrument of
      Providence. And so you discovered your rough diamond yesterday, and have
      polished him in a day. O that Dr. Franklin had profited as well by our
      London tailors! The rogue never told me, when he was ordering me about in
      his swan-skin, that he had a friend in Arlington Street, and a reigning
      beauty. But I like him the better for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I the worse,&rdquo; said Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive that he still retains his body-guard,&rdquo; said Mr. Walpole;
      &ldquo;Captain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; said Dolly, seeing that we would not help him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes. These young princes from the New World must have their suites.
      You must bring them both some day to my little castle at Strawberry Hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, Mr. Walpole, Mr. Carvel finds that he must return to
      America,&rdquo; Mr. Marmaduke interjected. He had been waiting to get in this
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comyn nudged me. And I took the opportunity, in the awkward silence that
      followed, to thank Mr. Walpole for sending his coach after us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray where did you get your learning?&rdquo; he demanded abruptly of the
      captain, in his most patronizing way. &ldquo;Your talents are wasted at sea,
      sir. You should try your fortune in London, where you shall be under my
      protection, sir. They shall not accuse me again of stifling young genius.
      Stay,&rdquo; he cried, warming with generous enthusiasm, &ldquo;stay, I have an
      opening. 'Twas but yesterday Lady Cretherton told me that she stood in
      need of a tutor for her youngest son, and you shall have the position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sir, but I shall not have the position,&rdquo; said John Paul,
      coolly. And Horry might have heeded the danger signal. I had seen it more
      than once on board the brigantine John, and knew what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, and why not, sir? If I recommend you, why not, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I shall not take it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have my profession, Mr.
      Walpole, and it is an honourable one. And I would not exchange it, sir,
      were it in your power to make me a Gibbon or a Hume, or tutor to his Royal
      Highness, which it is not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, for the second time, the weapon of the renowned master of Strawberry
      was knocked from his hand at a single stroke of his strange adversary. I
      should like to describe John Paul as he made that speech,&mdash;for 'twas
      not so much the speech as the atmosphere of it. Those who heard and saw
      were stirred with wonder, for Destiny lay bare that instant, just as the
      powers above are sometimes revealed at a single lightning-bolt. Mr.
      Walpole made a reply that strove hard to be indifferent; Mr. Marmaduke
      stuttered, for he was frightened, as little souls are apt to be at such
      times. But my Lord Comyn, forever natural, forever generous, cried out
      heartily:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, captain, there you are a true sailor! Which would you rather have
      been, I say, William Shakespeare or Sir Francis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which would you rather be, Richard,&rdquo; said Dolly to me, under her breath,
      &ldquo;Horace Walpole or Captain John Paul? I begin to like your captain
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy nilly, Mr. Walpole was forever doing me a service. Now, in order to
      ignore the captain more completely, he sat him down to engage Mr. and Mrs.
      Manners. Comyn was soon hot in an argument with John Paul concerning the
      seagoing qualities of a certain frigate, every rope and spar of which they
      seemed to know. And so I stole a few moments with Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to take the captain to Maryland, Richard?&rdquo; she asked,
      playing with her fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to get him the Belle of the Tye. 'Tis the least I can do. For I
      am at my wits' end how to reward him, Dolly. And when are you coming
      back?&rdquo; I whispered earnestly, seeing her silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would that I knew, Richard,&rdquo; she replied, with a certain sadness that
      went to my heart, as tho' the choice lay beyond her. Then she changed.
      &ldquo;Richard, there was more in Mr. Lloyd's letter than mamma told you of.
      There was ill news of one of your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me fixedly, and then continued, her voice so low that I was
      forced to bend over:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You were not told that Patty Swain fell in a faint when she heard of
      your disappearance. You were not told that the girl was ill for a week
      afterwards. Ah, Richard, I fear you are a sad flirt. Nay, you may benefit
      by the doubt,&mdash;perchance you are going home to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You may be sure that this intelligence, from Dorothy's lips, only
      increased my trouble and perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that Patty has been ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very ill,&rdquo; says she, with her lips tight closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I grieve to hear of it,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;but I cannot think that my
      accident had anything to do with the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young ladies do not send their fathers to coffee-houses to prevent duels
      unless their feelings are engaged,&rdquo; she flung back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard the story of that affair, Dorothy. At least enough of it
      to do me justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was plainly agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Lord Comyn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Comyn has told you the truth,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;so much I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas for the exits and entrances of life! Here comes the footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fox,&rdquo; said he, rolling the name, for it was a great one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confound Mr. Fox! He might have waited five short minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, in truth, none other than that precocious marvel of England who
      but a year before had taken the breath from the House of Commons, and had
      sent his fame flying over the Channel and across the wide Atlantic; the
      talk of London, who set the fashions, cringed not before white hairs, or
      royalty, or customs, or institutions, and was now, at one and twenty,
      Junior Lord of the Admiralty&mdash;Charles James Fox. His face was dark,
      forbidding, even harsh&mdash;until he smiled. His eyebrows were heavy and
      shaggy, and his features of a rounded, almost Jewish mould. He put me in
      mind of the Stuarts, and I was soon to learn that he was descended from
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the room I recall remarking that he was possessed of the
      supremest confidence of any man I had ever met. Mrs. Manners he greeted in
      one way, Mr. Marmaduke in another, and Mr. Walpole in still another. To
      Comyn it was &ldquo;Hello, Jack,&rdquo; as he walked by him. Each, as it were, had
      been tagged with a particular value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chagrined as I was at the interruption, I was struck with admiration. For
      the smallest actions of these rare men of master passions so compel us. He
      came to Dorothy, whom he seemed not to have perceived at first, and there
      passed between them such a look of complete understanding that I suddenly
      remembered Comyn's speech of the night before, &ldquo;Now it is Charles Fox.&rdquo;
       Here, indeed, was the man who might have won her. And yet I did not hate
      him. Nay, I loved him from the first time he addressed me. It was Dorothy
      who introduced us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have heard of you, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he said, making a barely
      perceptible wink at Comyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I think I have heard of you, Mr. Fox,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce you have, Mr. Carvel!&rdquo; said he, and laughed. And Comyn laughed,
      and Dorothy laughed, and I laughed. We were friends from that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard has appeared amongst us like a comet,&rdquo; put in the ubiquitous Mr.
      Manners, &ldquo;and, I fear, intends to disappear in like manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is the tail of this comet?&rdquo; demanded Fox, instantly; &ldquo;for I
      understood there was a tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Paul was brought up, and the Junior Lord of the Admiralty looked him
      over from head to toe. And what, my dears, do you think he said to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever acted, Captain Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain started back in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Acted!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;really, sir, I do not know. I have never been upon
      the boards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fox vowed that he could act: that he was sure of it, from the
      captain's appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, too, am sure of it, Mr. Fox,&rdquo; cried Dorothy; clapping her hands.
      &ldquo;Persuade him to stay awhile in London, that you may have him at your next
      theatricals at Holland House. Why, he knows Shakespeare and Pope and&mdash;and
      Chaucer by heart, and Ovid and Horace,&mdash;is it not so, Mr. Walpole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not what so, my dear young lady?&rdquo; asked Mr. Walpole, pretending not to
      have heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Dolly, pouting, when the laughter had subsided; &ldquo;you
      make believe to care something about me, and yet will not listen to what I
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had seen at her feet our own Maryland gallants, the longest of whose
      reputations stretched barely from the James to the Schuylkill; but here in
      London men were hanging on her words whose names were familiarly spoken in
      Paris, and Rome, and Geneva. Not a topic was broached by Mr. Walpole or
      Mr. Fox, from the remonstrance of the Archbishop against masquerades and
      the coming marriage of my Lord Albemarle to the rights and wrongs of Mr.
      Wilkes, but my lady had her say. Mrs. Manners seemed more than content
      that she should play the hostess, which she did to perfection. She
      contrived to throw poisoned darts at the owner of Strawberry that started
      little Mr. Marmaduke to fidgeting in his seat, and he came to the rescue
      with all the town-talk at his command. He knew little else. Could Mr.
      Walpole tell him of this club of both sexes just started at Almack's? Mr.
      Walpole could tell a deal, tho' he took the pains first to explain that he
      was becoming too old for such frivolous and fashionable society. He could
      not, for the life of him, say why he was included. But, in spite of Mr.
      Walpole, John Paul was led out in the paces that best suited him, and
      finally, to the undisguised delight of Mr. Fox, managed to trip Horry upon
      an obscure point in Athenian literature. And this broke up the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we took our leave Dorothy and Mr. Fox were talking together with
      lowered voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see you before I go,&rdquo; I said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and glanced at Mr. Fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going, Richard Carvel,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you are not, Richard Carvel,&rdquo; said Mr. Fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      I smiled, rather lamely, I fear, and said good night.

      CHAPTER XXX. A CONSPIRACY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banks, where is the captain?&rdquo; I asked, as I entered the parlour the next
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone, sir, since seven o'clock,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; I exclaimed;
      &ldquo;gone where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I did not ask his honour, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought it strange, but reflected that John Paul was given to whims.
      Having so little time before him, he had probably gone to see the sights
      he had missed yesterday: the Pantheon, which was building, an account of
      which had appeared in all the colonial papers; or the new Blackfriars
      Bridge; or the Tower; or perhaps to see his Majesty ride out. The wonders
      of London might go hang, for all I cared. Who would gaze at the King when
      he might look upon Dorothy! I sighed. I bade Banks dress me in the new
      suit Davenport had brought that morning, and then sent him off to seek the
      shipping agent of the Virginia packet to get us a cabin. I would go to
      Arlington Street as soon as propriety admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I had scarce finished my chocolate and begun to smoke in a pleasant
      revery, when I was startled by the arrival of two gentlemen. One was
      Comyn, and the other none less than Mr. Charles Fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now where the devil has your captain flown to?&rdquo; said my Lord, tossing his
      whip on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he must be sight-seeing,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I dare swear he has taken a
      hackney coach to the Tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see the liberation of the idol of the people, I'll lay ten guineas.
      But they say the great Mr. Wilkes is to come out quietly, and wishes no
      demonstration,&rdquo; said Mr. Fox. &ldquo;I believe the beggar has some sense, if the&mdash;Greek&mdash;would
      only let him have his way. So your captain is a Wilkite, Mr. Carvel?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear you run very fast to conclusions, Mr. Fox,&rdquo; I answered, laughing,
      tho' I thought his guess was not far from wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll lay you the ten guineas he has been to the Tower,&rdquo; said Mr. Fox,
      promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done, sir,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark ye, Richard,&rdquo; said Comyn, stretching himself in an arm-chair; &ldquo;we
      are come to take the wind out of your sails, and leave you without an
      excuse for going home. And we want your captain, alive or dead. Charles,
      here, is to give him a commission in his Majesty's Navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I knew why Dorothy had laughed when I had spoken of seeing her again.
      Comyn&mdash;bless him!&mdash;had told her of his little scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, Charles!&rdquo; cried his Lordship, &ldquo;to look at his glum face, one might
      think we were a couple of Jews who had cornered him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas for the perversity of the heart! Instead of leaping for joy, as no
      doubt they had both confidently expected, I was both troubled and
      perplexed by this unlooked-for news. Oak, when bent, is even harder to
      bend back again. And so it has ever been with me. I had determined, after
      a bitter struggle, to go to Maryland, and had now become used to that
      prospect. I was anxious to see my grandfather, and to confront Grafton
      Carvel with his villany. And there was John Paul. What would he think?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails you, Richard?&rdquo; Comyn demanded somewhat testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Jack,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I thank you from my heart, and you, Mr. Fox.
      I know that commissions are not to be had for the asking, and I rejoice
      with the captain over his good fortune. But, gentlemen,&rdquo; I said soberly,
      &ldquo;I had most selfishly hoped that I might be able to do a service to John
      Paul in return for his charity to me. You offer him something nearer his
      deserts, something beyond my power to give him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fox's eyes kindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak like a man, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you are too modest. Damn
      it, sir, don't you see that it is you, and no one else, who has procured
      this commission? Had I not been taken with you, sir, I should scarce have
      promised it to your friend Comyn, through whose interest you obtain it for
      your protege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remembered what Mr. Fox's enemies said of him, and smiled at the
      plausible twist he had given the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;no, Mr. Fox; never that. The captain must not think that I
      wish to be rid of him. I will not stand in the way, though if it is to be
      offered him, he must comprehend that I had naught to do with the matter.
      But, sir,&rdquo; I continued curiously, &ldquo;what do you know of John Paul's
      abilities as an officer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fox and Comyn laughed so immoderately as to bring the blood to my
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damme!&rdquo; cried the Junior Lord, &ldquo;but you Americans have odd consciences!
      Do you suppose Rigby was appointed Paymaster of the Forces because of his
      fitness? Why was North himself made Prime Minister? For his abilities?&rdquo;
       And he broke down again. &ldquo;Ask Jack, here, how he got into the service, and
      how much seamanship he knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; answered Jack, unblushingly, &ldquo;Admiral Lord Comyn, my father,
      wished me to serve awhile. And so I have taken two cruises, delivered some
      score of commands, and scarce know a supple jack from a can of flip.
      Cursed if I see the fun of it in these piping times o' peace, so I have
      given it up, Richard. For Charles says this Falkland business with Spain
      will blow out of the touch-hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could see little to laugh over. For the very rottenness of the service
      was due to the miserable and servile Ministry and Parliament of his
      Majesty, by means of which instruments he was forcing the colonies to the
      wall. Verily, that was a time when the greatness of England hung in the
      balance! How little I suspected that the young man then seated beside me,
      who had cast so unthinkingly his mighty powers on the side of corruption,
      was to be one of the chief instruments of her salvation! We were to fight
      George the Third across the seas. He was to wage no less courageous a
      battle at home, in the King's own capital. And the cause? Yes, the cause
      was to be the same as that of the Mr. Wilkes he reviled, who obtained his
      liberty that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length John Paul came in, calling my name. He broke off abruptly at
      sight of the visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we shall decide,&rdquo; said Mr. Fox. &ldquo;Captain, I have bet Mr. Carvel ten
      guineas you have been to the Tower to see Squinting Jack (John Wilkes) get
      his liberty at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain looked astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anan, then, you have lost, Richard,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;For I have been just
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And helped, no doubt, to carry off the champion on your shoulders,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Fox, sarcastically, as I paid the debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wilkes knows full well the value of moderation, sir,&rdquo; replied the
      captain, in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, damn the odds!&rdquo; exclaimed the Junior Lord, laughing. &ldquo;You may have
      the magic number tattooed all over your back, for all I care. You shall
      have the commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The commission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fox, carelessly; &ldquo;I intend making you a lieutenant, sir, in
      the Royal Navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment the words were out I was a-tremble as to how he would take the
      offer. For he had a certain puzzling pride, which flew hither and thither.
      But there was surely no comparison between the situations of the master of
      the Belle of the Wye and an officer in the Royal Navy. There, his talents
      would make him an admiral, and doubtless give him the social position he
      secretly coveted. He confounded us all by his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Mr. Fox. But I cannot accept your kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slife!&rdquo; said Fox, &ldquo;you refuse? And you know what you are doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know usually, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Comyn swore. My exclamation had something of relief in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I felt that I could not stand in the way of this. It
      has been my hope that you will come with me, and I have sent this morning
      after a cabin on the Virginia. You must know that Mr. Fox's offer is his
      own, and Lord Comyn's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it well, Richard. I have not lived these three months with you for
      nothing.&rdquo; His voice seemed to fail him. He drew near me and took my hand.
      &ldquo;But did you think I would require of you the sacrifice of leaving London
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my pleasure as well as my duty, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not like that. Yesterday I went to the city to see a
      shipowner whose acquaintance I made when he was a master in the West India
      trade. He has had some reason to know that I can handle a ship. Never mind
      what. And he has given me the bark 'Betsy', whose former master is lately
      dead of the small-pox. Richard, I sail to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Dorothy's coach to Whitehall Stairs, by the grim old palace out of
      whose window Charles the Martyr had walked to his death. For Dorothy had
      vowed it was her pleasure to see John Paul off, and who could stand in her
      way? Surely not Mr. Marmaduke! and Mrs. Manners laughingly acquiesced. Our
      spirits were such that we might have been some honest mercer's apprentice
      and his sweetheart away for an outing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we should take a wherry, Richard,&rdquo; said Dolly, &ldquo;who would know of it?
      I have longed to be in a wherry ever since I came to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The river was smiling as she tripped gayly down to the water, and the
      red-coated watermen were smiling, too, and nudging one another. But little
      cared we! Dolly in holiday humour stopped for naught. &ldquo;Boat, your honour!
      Boat, boat! To Rotherhithe&mdash;Redriff? Two and six apiece, sir.&rdquo; For
      that intricate puzzle called human nature was solved out of hand by the
      Thames watermen. Here was a young gentleman who never heard of the Lord
      Mayor's scale of charges. And what was a shilling to such as he! Intricate
      puzzle, indeed! Any booby might have read upon the young man's face that
      secret which is written for all,&mdash;high and low, rich and poor alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      My new lace handkerchief was down upon the seat, lest Dolly soil her
      bright pink lutestring. She should have worn nothing else but the hue of
      roses. How the bargemen stared, and the passengers craned their necks, and
      the longshoremen stopped their work as we shot past them! On her account a
      barrister on the Temple Stairs was near to letting fall his bag in the
      water. A lady in a wherry! Where were the whims of the quality to lead
      them next? Past the tall water-tower and York Stairs, the idlers under the
      straight row of trees leaning over the high river wall; past Adelphi
      Terrace, where the great Garrick lived; past the white columns of Somerset
      House, with its courts and fountains and alleys and architecture of all
      ages, and its river gate where many a gilded royal barge had lain, and
      many a fine ambassador had arrived in state over the great highway of
      England; past the ancient trees in the Temple Gardens. And then under the
      new Blackfriars Bridge to Southwark, dingy with its docks and breweries
      and huddled houses, but forever famous,&mdash;the Southwark of Shakespeare
      and Jonson and Beaumont and Fletcher. And the shelf upon which they stood
      in the library at Carvel Hall was before my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dolly; &ldquo;and I recall your mother's name written in faded ink
      upon the fly-leaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, London Town, by what subtleties are you tied to the hearts of those
      born across the sea? That is one of the mysteries of race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the pointed arches of old London Bridge, with its hooded shelters
      for the weary, to where the massive Tower had frowned for ages upon the
      foolish river. And then the forest of ships, and the officious throng of
      little wherries and lighters that pressed around them, seeming to say,
      &ldquo;You clumsy giants, how helpless would you be without us!&rdquo; Soon our own
      wherry was dodging among them, ships brought hither by the four winds of
      the seas; many discharging in the stream, some in the docks then beginning
      to be built, and hugging the huge warehouses. Hides from frozen Russia
      were piled high beside barrels of sugar and rum from the moist island
      cane-fields of the Indies, and pipes of wine from the sunny hillsides of
      France, and big boxes of tea bearing the hall-mark of the mysterious East.
      Dolly gazed in wonder. And I was commanded to show her a schooner like the
      Black Moll, and a brigantine like the John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Captain Paul told me you climbed the masts, Richard, and worked like
      a common seaman. Tell me,&rdquo; says she, pointing at the royal yard of a tall
      East Indiaman, &ldquo;did you go as high as that when it was rough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, hugely to the boatman's delight, the minx must needs put her fingers
      on the hard welts on my hands, and vow she would be a sailor and she were
      a man. But at length we came to a trim-built bark lying off Redriff
      Stairs, with the words &ldquo;Betsy, of London,&rdquo; painted across her stern. In no
      time at all, Captain Paul was down the gangway ladder and at the
      water-side, too hand Dorothy out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This honour overwhelms me, Miss Manners,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I know whom to
      thank for it.&rdquo; And he glanced slyly at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy stepped aboard with the air of Queen Elizabeth come to inspect
      Lord Howard's flagship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will thank me,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Why, I could eat my dinner off your
      deck, captain! Are all merchantmen so clean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Paul smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all, Miss Manners,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are still sailing at the ebb?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour, Richard, if the wind holds good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With what pride he showed us over his ship, the sailors gaping at the fine
      young lady. It had taken him just a day to institute his navy discipline.
      And Dolly went about exclaiming, and asking an hundred questions, and
      merrily catechising me upon the run of the ropes. All was order and
      readiness for dropping down the stream when he led us into his cabin,
      where he had a bottle of wine and some refreshments laid out against my
      coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I presumed to anticipate your visit, Miss Manners, I should have had
      something more suitable for a lady,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What, you will not eat,
      either, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not, so downcast had I become at the thought of parting. I had sat
      up half the night before with him in restless argument and indecision, and
      even when he had left for Rotherhithe, early that morning, my mind had not
      been made. My conscience had insisted that I should sail with John Paul;
      that I might never see my deaf grandfather on earth again. I had gone to
      Arlington Street that morning resolved to say farewell to Dorothy. I will
      not recount the history of that defeat, my dears. Nay, to this day I know
      not how she accomplished the matter. Not once had she asked me to remain,
      or referred to my going. Nor had I spoken of it, weakling that I was. She
      had come down in the pink lutestring, smiling but pale; and traces of
      tears in her eyes, I thought. From that moment I knew that I was defeated.
      It was she herself who had proposed going with me to see the Betsy sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will drink some Madeira to wish you Godspeed, captain,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with you, Richard?&rdquo; Dolly cried; &ldquo;you are as sour as
      my Lord Sandwich after a bad Newmarket. Why, captain,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I really
      believe he wants to go, too. The swain pines for his provincial beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor John Paul! He had not yet learned that good society is seldom
      literal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul, Miss Manners, there you do him wrong,&rdquo; he retorted, with
      ludicrous heat; &ldquo;you, above all, should know for whom he pines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has misled you by praising me. This Richard, despite his frank
      exterior, is most secretive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you have hit him, Miss Manners,&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;there you have hit
      him! We were together night and day, on the sea and on the road, and,
      while I poured out my life to him, the rogue never once let fall a hint of
      the divine Miss Dorothy. 'Twas not till I got to London that I knew of her
      existence, and then only by a chance. You astonish me. You speak of a
      young lady in Maryland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy swept aside my protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; says she, gravely, &ldquo;I leave you to judge. What is your
      inference, when he fights a duel about a Miss with my Lord Comyn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A duel!&rdquo; cried the captain, astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Manners persists in her view of the affair, despite my word to the
      contrary,&rdquo; I put in rather coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a duel!&rdquo; cried the captain again; &ldquo;and with Lord Comyn! Miss Manners,
      I fondly thought I had discovered a constant man, but you make me fear he
      has had as many flames as I. And yet, Richard,&rdquo; he added meaningly, &ldquo;I
      should think shame on my conduct and I had had such a subject for
      constancy as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy's armour was pierced, and my ill-humour broken down, by this
      characteristic speech. We both laughed, greatly to his discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had best go home with him, Richard,&rdquo; said Dolly. &ldquo;I can find my way
      back to Arlington Street alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay; gallantry forbids his going with me now,&rdquo; answered John Paul; &ldquo;and I
      have my sailing orders. But had I known of this, I should never have
      wasted my breath in persuading him to remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did he stand in need of much persuasion, captain?&rdquo; asked Dolly,
      archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time was pressing, and the owner came aboard, puffing,&mdash;a
      round-faced, vociferous, jolly merchant, who had no sooner got his breath
      than he lost it again upon catching sight of Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the captain was giving the mate his final orders, Mr. Orchardson,
      for such was his name, regaled us with a part of his life's history. He
      had been a master himself, and mangled and clipped King George's English
      as only a true master might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like your own captain better than ever, Richard,&rdquo; whispered Dolly,
      while Mr. Orchardson relieved himself of his quid over the other side;
      &ldquo;how commanding he is! Were I to take passage in the Betsy, I know I
      should be in love with him long before we got to Norfolk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took it upon myself to tell Mr. Orchardson, briefly and clearly as I
      could, the lamentable story of John Paul's last cruise. For I feared it
      might sooner or later reach his ears from prejudiced mouths. And I ended
      by relating how the captain had refused a commission in the navy because
      he had promised to take the Betsy. This appeared vastly to impress him,
      and he forgot Dorothy's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passion o' my 'eart, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; cried he, excitedly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Paul's too big a man, an' too good a seaman, to go into the navy
      without hinflooence. If flag horfocers I roots of is booted haside to
      rankle like a lump o' salt butter in a gallipot, 'ow will a poor Scotch
      lieutenant win hadvancement an' he be not o' the King's friends? 'Wilkes
      an' Liberty,' say I; 'forever,' say I. An' w'en I see 'im goin' to the
      Tower to be'old the Champion, 'Captain Paul,' says I, 'yere a man arfter
      my hown 'eart.' My heye, sir, didn't I see 'im, w'n a mere lad, take the
      John into Kingston 'arbour in the face o' the worst gale I hever seed
      blowed in the Caribbees? An' I says, 'Bill Horchardson, an' ye Never 'ave
      ships o' yere own, w'ich I 'ope will be, y'ell know were to look for a
      marster.' An' I tells 'im that same, Mr. Carvel. I means no disrespect to
      the dead, sir, but an' John Paul 'ad discharged the Betsy, I'd not 'a'
      been out twenty barrels or more this day by Thames mudlarks an' scuffle
      hunters. 'Eave me flat, if 'e'll be two blocks wi' liquor an' dischargin'
      cargo. An' ye may rest heasy, Mr. Carvel, I'll not do wrong by 'im,
      neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told me that if I would honour him in Maid Lane, Southwark, I should
      have as many pounds as I liked of the best tobacco ever cured in Cuba. And
      so he left me to see that the mate had signed all his lighter bills,
      shouting to the captain not to forget his cockets at Gravesend. Dolly and
      I stood silent while the men hove short, singing a jolly song to the step.
      With a friendly wave the round figure of Mr. Orchardson disappeared over
      the side, and I knew that the time had come to say farewell. I fumbled in
      my waistcoat for the repeater I had bought that morning over against
      Temple Bar, in Fleet Street, and I thrust it into John Paul's hand as he
      came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this in remembrance of what you have suffered so unselfishly for my
      sake, Captain Paul,&rdquo; I said, my voice breaking. &ldquo;And whatever befalls you,
      do not forget that Carvel Hall is your home as well as mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed as greatly affected as was I. Tears forced themselves to his
      eyes as he held the watch, which he opened absently to read the simple
      inscription I had put there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dickie lad!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I'll be missing ye sair three hours hence,
      and thinking of ye for months to come in the night watches. But something
      tells me I'll see ye again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he took me in his arms, embracing me with such fervour that there was
      no doubting the sincerity of his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dorothy,&rdquo; said he, when he was calmer, &ldquo;I give ye Richard for a leal
      and a true heart. Few men are born with the gift of keeping the affections
      warm despite absence, and years, and interest. But have no fear of Richard
      Carvel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy stood a little apart, watching us, her eyes that faraway blue of
      the deepening skies at twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I have no fear of him, captain,&rdquo; she said gently. Then, with a
      quick movement, impulsive and womanly, she unpinned a little gold brooch
      at her throat, and gave it to him, saying: &ldquo;In token of my gratitude for
      bringing him back to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Paul raised it to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall treasure it, Miss Manners, as a memento of the greatest joy of my
      life. And that has been,&rdquo; gracefully taking her hand and mine, &ldquo;the
      bringing you two together again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy grew scarlet as she curtseyed. As for me, I could speak never a
      word. He stepped over the side to hand her into the wherry, and embraced
      me once again. And as we rowed away he waved his hat in a last good-by
      from the taffrail. Then the Betsy floated down the Thames.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. &ldquo;UPSTAIRS INTO THE WORLD&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      It will be difficult, my dears, without bulging this history out of all
      proportion, to give you a just notion of the society into which I fell
      after John Paul left London. It was, above all, a gaming society. From
      that prying and all-powerful God of Chance none, great or small, escaped.
      Guineas were staked and won upon frugal King George and his beef and
      barley-water; Charles Fox and his debts; the intrigues of Choiseul and the
      Du Barry and the sensational marriage of the Due d'Orleans with Madame de
      Montesson (for your macaroni knew his Paris as well as his London); Lord
      March and his opera singer; and even the doings of Betty, the apple-woman
      of St. James's Street, and the beautiful barmaid of Nando's in whom my
      Lord Thurlow was said to be interested. All these, and much more not to be
      repeated, were duly set down in the betting-books at White's and Brooks's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the luxury of the life was something to startle a provincial, even
      tho' he came, as did I, from one of the two most luxurious colonies of the
      thirteen. Annapolis might be said to be London on a small scale,&mdash;but
      on a very small scale. The historian of the future need look no farther
      than our houses (if any remain), to be satisfied that we had more than the
      necessities of existence. The Maryland aristocrat with his town place and
      his country place was indeed a parallel of the patrician at home. He wore
      his English clothes, drove and rode his English horses, and his coaches
      were built in Long Acre. His heavy silver service came from Fleet Street,
      and his claret and Champagne and Lisbon and Madeira were the best that
      could be bought or smuggled. His sons were often educated at home, at Eton
      or Westminster and Oxford or Cambridge. So would I have been if
      circumstances had permitted. So was James Fotheringay, the eldest of the
      family, and later the Dulany boys, and half a dozen others I might
      mention. And then our ladies! 'Tis but necessary to cite my Aunt Caroline
      as an extreme dame of fashion, who had her French hairdresser, Piton.
    </p>
    <p>
      As was my aunt to the Duchess of Kingston, so was Annapolis to London. To
      depict the life of Mayfair and of St. James's Street during a season about
      the year of grace 1770 demands a mightier pen than wields the writer of
      these simple memoirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And who was responsible for all this luxury and laxity? Who but the great
      Mr. Pitt, then the Earl of Chatham, whose wise policy had made Britain the
      ruler of the world, and rich beyond compare. From all corners of the earth
      her wealth poured in upon her. Nabob and Caribbee came from East and West
      to spend their money in the capital. And fortunes near as great were
      acquired by the City merchants themselves. One by one these were admitted
      within that charmed circle, whose motto for ages had been &ldquo;No Trade,&rdquo; to
      leaven it with their gold. And to keep the pace,&mdash;nay, to set it, the
      nobility and landed gentry were sore pressed. As far back as good Queen
      Anne, and farther, their ancestors had gamed and tippled away the acres;
      and now that John and William, whose forebears had been good tenants for
      centuries, were setting their faces to Liverpool and Birmingham and Leeds,
      their cottages were empty. So Lord and Squire went to London to
      recuperate, and to get their share of the game running. St. James's Street
      and St. Stephen's became their preserves. My Lord wormed himself into a
      berth in the Treasury, robbed the country systematically for a dozen of
      years, and sold the places and reversions under him to the highest bidder.
      Boroughs were to be had somewhat dearer than a pair of colours. And my
      Lord spent his spare time&mdash;he had plenty of it&mdash;in fleecing the
      pigeons at White's and Almack's. Here there was no honour, even amongst
      thieves. And young gentlemen were hurried through Eton and Oxford, where
      they learned to drink and swear and to call a main as well as to play
      tennis and billiards and to write Latin, and were thrust into Brooks's
      before they knew the difference in value between a farthing and a
      banknote: at nineteen they were hardened rake, or accomplished men of the
      world, or both. Dissipated noblemen of middle age like March and Sandwich,
      wits and beaus and fine gentlemen like Selwyn and Chesterfield and
      Walpole, were familiarly called by their first names by youngsters like
      Fox and Carlisle and Comyn. Difference of age was no difference. Young
      Lord Carlisle was the intimate of Mr. Selwyn, born thirty years before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And whilst I am speaking of intimacies, that short one which sprang up
      between me and the renowned Charles Fox has always seemed the most
      unaccountable: not on my part, for I fell a victim to him at once. Pen and
      paper, brush and canvas, are wholly inadequate to describe the charm of
      the man. When he desired to please, his conversation and the expression of
      his face must have moved a temperament of stone itself. None ever had more
      devoted friends or more ardent admirers. They saw his faults, which he
      laid bare before them, but they settled his debts again and again, vast
      sums which he lost at Newmarket and at Brooks's. And not many years after
      the time of which I now write Lord Carlisle was paying fifteen hundred a
      year on the sum he had loaned him, cheerfully denying himself the
      pleasures of London as a consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Fox who discovered for me my lodgings in Dover Street, vowing
      that I could not be so out of fashion as to live at an inn. The brief
      history of these rooms, as given by him, was this: &ldquo;A young cub had owned
      them, whose mamma had come up from Berkshire on Thursday, beat him soundly
      on Friday, paid his debts on Saturday, and had taken him back on Sunday to
      hunt with Sir Henry the rest of his life.&rdquo; Dorothy came one day with her
      mother and swept through my apartments, commanded all the furniture to be
      moved about, ordered me to get pictures for the walls, and by one fell
      decree abolished all the ornaments before the landlady, used as she was to
      the ways of quality, had time to gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Richard,&rdquo; says my lady, &ldquo;you will be wanting no end of pretty things
      to take back to Maryland when you go. You shall come with me to-morrow to
      Mr. Josiah Wedgwood's, to choose some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy!&rdquo; says her mother, reprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he must have the Chippendale table I saw yesterday at the exhibition,
      and chairs to match. And every bachelor should have a punch bowl&mdash;Josiah
      has such a beauty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I am running far ahead. Among the notes with which my table was laden,
      Banks had found a scrawl. This I made out with difficulty to convey that
      Mr. Fox was not attending Parliament that day. If Mr. Carvel would do him
      the honour of calling at his lodging, over Mackie's Italian Warehouse in
      Piccadilly, at four o'clock, he would take great pleasure in introducing
      him at Brooks's Club. In those days 'twas far better for a young gentleman
      of any pretensions to remain at home than go to London and be denied that
      inner sanctuary,&mdash;the younger club at Almack's. Many the rich
      brewer's son has embittered his life because it was not given him to see
      more than the front of the house from the far side of Pall Mall. But to be
      taken there by Charles Fox was an honour falling to few. I made sure that
      Dolly was at the bottom of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Promptly at four I climbed the stairs and knocked at Mr. Fox's door. The
      Swiss who opened it shook his head dubiously when I asked for his master,
      and said he had not been at home that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I had an appointment to meet him,&rdquo; I said, thinking it very strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man's expression changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An appointment, sir! Ah, sir, then you are to step in here.&rdquo; And to my
      vast astonishment he admitted me into a small room at one side of the
      entrance. It was bare as poverty, and furnished with benches, and nothing
      more. On one of these was seated a person with an unmistakable nose and an
      odour of St. Giles's, who sprang to his feet and then sat down again
      dejectedly. I also sat down, wondering what it could mean, and debating
      whether to go or stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exguse me, your honour,&rdquo; said the person, &ldquo;but haf you seen Mister Fox?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said that I, too, was waiting for him, whereat he cast at me a cunning
      look beyond my comprehension. Surely, I thought, a man of Fox's inherited
      wealth and position could not be living in such a place! Before the truth
      and humour of the situation had dawned upon me, I heard a ringing voice
      without, swearing in most forcible English, and the door was thrown open,
      admitting a tall young gentleman, as striking as I have ever seen. He paid
      not the smallest attention to the Jew, who was bowing and muttering behind
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Richard Carvel?&rdquo; said he, with a merry twinkle in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad's life, Mr. Carvel, I'm deuced sorry this should have happened. Will
      you come with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exguse me, your honour!&rdquo; cried the other visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what the plague, Aaron!&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;you wear out the stairs. Come
      to-morrow, or the day after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, 'tis always 'to-morrow' with you fine gentlemen. But I vill bring the
      bailiffs, so help me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn 'em!&rdquo; says the tall young gentleman, as he slammed the door and so
      shut off the wail. &ldquo;Damn 'em, they worry Charles to death. If he would
      only stick to quinze and picquet, and keep clear of the hounds*, he need
      never go near a broker.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [* The &ldquo;hounds,&rdquo; it appears, were the gentlemen of sharp practices at
   White's and Almack's.&mdash;D. C. C.]
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you have Jews in America, Mr. Carvel?&rdquo; Without waiting for an answer,
      he led me through a parlour, hung with pictures, and bewilderingly
      furnished with French and Italian things, and Japan and China ware and
      bronzes, and cups and trophies. &ldquo;My name is Fitzpatrick, Mr. Carvel,&mdash;yours
      to command, and Charles's. I am his ally for offence and defence. We went
      to school together,&rdquo; he explained simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner was so free, and yet so dignified, as to charm me completely.
      For I heartily despised all that fustian trumpery of the age. Then came a
      voice from beyond, calling:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you, Carvel? Damn that fellow Eiffel, and did he thrust you into the
      Jerusalem Chamber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Jerusalem Chamber!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where I keep my Israelites,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but, by Gad's life! I think they
      are one and all descended from Job, and not father Abraham at all. He must
      have thought me cursed ascetic, eh, Fitz? Did you find the benches hard? I
      had 'em made hard as the devil. But if they were of stone, I vow the flock
      could find their own straw to sit on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse it, Charles,&rdquo; cut in Mr. Fitzpatrick, in some temper, &ldquo;can't you be
      serious for once! He would behave this way, Mr. Carvel, if he were being
      shriven by the Newgate ordinary before a last carting to Tyburn. Charles,
      Charles, it was Aaron again, and the dog is like to snap at last. He is
      talking of bailiffs. Take my advice and settle with him. Hold Cavendish
      off another fortnight and settle with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fox's reply was partly a laugh, and the rest of it is not to be
      printed. He did not seem in the least to mind this wholesale disclosure of
      his somewhat awkward affairs. And he continued to dress, or to be dressed,
      alternately swearing at his valet and talking to Fitzpatrick and to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are both of a name,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Let a man but be called Richard, and I
      seem to take to him. I' faith, I like the hunchback king, and believe our
      friend Horry Walpole is right in defending him, despite Davie Hume. I vow
      I shall like you, Mr. Carvel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied that I certainly hoped so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, you come well enough recommended,&rdquo; he said, pulling on his
      breeches. &ldquo;No, Eiffel, cursed if I go en petit maitre to-day. How does
      that strike you for a demi saison, Mr. Buckskin? I wore three of 'em
      through the customs last year, and March's worked olive nightgown tucked
      under my greatcoat, and near a dozen pairs of shirts and stockings. And
      each of my servants had on near as much. O Lud, we were amazing-like
      beef-eaters or blower pigeons. Sorry you won't meet my brother,&mdash;he
      that will have the title. He's out of town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Going on in this discursory haphazard way while he dressed, he made me
      feel much at home. For the young dictator&mdash;so Mr. Fitzpatrick
      informed me afterward&mdash;either took to you or else he did not, and
      stood upon no ceremony. After he had chosen a coat with a small pattern
      and his feet had been thrust into the little red shoes with the high
      heels, imported by him from France, he sent for a hackney-chaise. And the
      three of us drove together to Pall Mall. Mr. Brooks was at the door, and
      bowed from his hips as we entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dozen vin de Graves, Brooks!&rdquo; cries Mr. Fox, and ushers me into a
      dining room, with high curtained windows and painted ceiling, and
      chandeliers throwing a glitter of light. There, at a long table,
      surrounded by powdered lackeys, sat a bevy of wits, mostly in blue and
      silver, with point ruffles, to match Mr. Fox's costume. They greeted my
      companions uproariously. It was &ldquo;Here's Charles at last!&rdquo; &ldquo;Howdy,
      Charles!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hello, Richard!&rdquo; and &ldquo;What have you there? a new Caribbee?&rdquo;
       They made way for Mr. Fox at the head of the table, and he took the seat
      as though it were his right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Richard Carvel, gentlemen, of Carvel Hall, in Maryland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stirred with interest when my name was called, and most of them
      turned in their chairs to look at me. I knew well the reason, and felt my
      face grow hot. Although you may read much of the courtesy of that age,
      there was a deal of brutal frankness among young men of fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, Charles, is this he the Beauty rescued from Castle Yard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A familiar voice relieved my embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the devil his due, Bully. You forget that I had a hand in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, Jack Comyn,&rdquo; retorted the gentleman addressed, &ldquo;you're already
      famous for clinging to her skirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But cling to mine, Bully, and we'll all enter the temple together. But I
      bid you welcome, Richard,&rdquo; said his Lordship; &ldquo;you come with two of the
      most delightful vagabonds in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fox introduced me in succession to Colonel St. John, known in St.
      James's Street as the Baptist; to my Lord Bolingbroke, Colonel St. John's
      brother, who was more familiarly called Bully; to Mr. Fitzpatrick's
      brother, the Earl of Upper Ossory, who had come up to London, so he said,
      to see a little Italian dance at the Garden; to Gilly Williams; to Sir
      Charles Bunbury, who had married Lady Sarah Lennox, Fox's cousin, the
      beauty who had come so near to being queen of all England; to Mr. Storer,
      who was at once a Caribbee and a Crichton; to Mr. Uvedale Price. These I
      remember, but there are more that escape me. Most good-naturedly they
      drank my health in Charles's vin de grave, at four shillings the bottle;
      and soon I was astonished to find myself launched upon the story of my
      adventures, which they had besought me to tell them. When I had done, they
      pledged me again, and, beginning to feel at home, I pledged them
      handsomely in return. Then the conversation began. The like of it I have
      never heard anywhere else in the world. There was a deal that might not be
      written here, and a deal more that might, to make these pages sparkle.
      They went through the meetings, of course, and thrashed over the list of
      horses entered at Ipswich, and York, and Newmarket, and how many were
      thought to be pulled. Then followed the recent gains and losses of each
      and every individual of the company. After that there was a roar of
      merriment over Mr. Storer cracking mottoes with a certain Lady Jane; and
      how young Lord Stavordale, on a wager, tilted the candles and set fire to
      the drawing-room at Lady Julia's drum, the day before. Mr. Price told of
      the rage Topham Beauclerk had got Dr. Johnson into, by setting down a mark
      for each oyster the sage had eaten, and showing him the count. But Mr.
      Fox, who was the soul of the club, had the best array of any. He related
      how he had gone post from Paris to Lyons, to order, among other things, an
      embroidered canary waistcoat for George Selwyn from Jabot. &ldquo;' Et quel
      dessin, monsieur?' 'Beetles and frogs, in green.' 'Escargots!
      grenouilles!' he cries, with a shriek; 'Et pour Monsieur Selwyn! Monsieur
      Fox badine!' It came yesterday, by Crawford, and I sent it to Chesterfield
      Street in time for George to wear to the Duchess's. He has been twice to
      Piccadilly after me, and twice here, and swears he will have my heart. And
      I believe he is now gone to Matson in a funk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that they fell upon politics. I knew that Mr. Fox was already near
      the head of the King's party, and that he had just received a substantial
      reward at his Majesty's hands; and I went not far to guess that every one
      of these easy-going, devil-may-care macaronies was a follower or
      sympathizer with Lord North's policy. But what I heard was a revelation
      indeed. I have dignified it by calling it politics. All was frankness here
      amongst friends. There was no attempt made to gloss over ugly transactions
      with a veneer of morality. For this much I honoured them. But irresistibly
      there came into my mind the grand and simple characters of our own public
      men in America, and it made me shudder to think that, while they strove
      honestly for our rights, this was the type which opposed them. Motives of
      personal spite and of personal gain were laid bare, and even the barter
      and sale of offices of trust took place before my very eyes. I was silent,
      though my tongue burned me, until one of the gentlemen, thinking me
      neglected, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a-deuce is to be done with those unruly countrymen of yours, Mr.
      Carvel? Are they likely to be pacified now that we have taken off all
      except the tea? You who are of our party must lead a sorry life among
      them. Tell me, do they really mean to go as far as rebellion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood rushed to my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a question of tea, sir,&rdquo; I answered hotly; &ldquo;nor yet of
      tuppence. It is a question of principle, which means more to Englishmen
      than life itself. And we are Englishmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I believe I spoke louder than I intended, for a silence followed my words.
      Fox glanced at Comyn, who of all of them at the table was not smiling, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you came of a loyalist family, Mr. Carvel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King George has no more loyal servants than the Americans, Mr. Fox, be
      they Tory or Whig. And he has but to read our petitions to discover it,&rdquo; I
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke calmly, but my heart was thumping with excitement and resentment.
      The apprehension of the untried is apt to be sharp at such moments, and I
      looked for them to turn their backs upon me for an impertinent provincial.
      Indeed, I think they would have, all save Comyn, had it not been for Fox
      himself. He lighted a pipe, smiled, and began easily, quite
      dispassionately, to address me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would favour us with your point of view, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; said he;
      &ldquo;for, upon my soul, I know little about the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know little about the subject, and you in Parliament!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      This started them all to laughing. Why, I did not then understand. But I
      was angry enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let's have it!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drew their chairs closer, some wearing that smile of superiority
      which to us is the Englishman's most maddening trait. I did not stop to
      think twice, or to remember that I was pitted against the greatest debater
      in all England. I was to speak that of which I was full, and the heart's
      argument needs no logic to defend it. If it were my last word, I would
      pronounce it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began by telling them that the Americans had paid their share of the
      French war, in blood and money, twice over. And I had the figures in my
      memory. Mr. Fox interrupted. For ten minutes at a space he spoke, and in
      all my life I have never talked to a man who had the English of King
      James's Bible, of Shakespeare, and Milton so wholly at his command. And
      his knowledge of history, his classical citations, confounded me. I forgot
      myself in wondering how one who had lived so fast had acquired such
      learning. Afterward, when I tried to recall what he said, I laughed at his
      surprising ignorance of the question at issue, and wondered where my wits
      could have gone that I allowed myself to be dazzled and turned aside at
      every corner. As his speech came faster he twisted fact into fiction and
      fiction into fact, until I must needs close my mind and bolt the shutters
      of it, or he had betrayed me into confessing the right of Parliament to
      quarter troops among us. Though my head swam, I clung doggedly to my text.
      And that was my salvation. He grew more excited, and they applauded him.
      In truth, I myself felt near to clapping. And then, as I stared him in the
      eye, marvelling how a man of such vast power and ability could stand for
      such rotten practices, the thought came to me (I know not whence) of Saint
      Paul the Apostle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fox,&rdquo; I said, when he had paused, &ldquo;before God, do you believe what
      you are saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw them smiling at my earnestness and simplicity. Fox seemed surprised,
      and laughed evasively,&mdash;not heartily as was his wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he said, glancing around the circle, political
      principles are not to be swallowed like religion, but taken rather like
      medicine, experimentally. If they agree with you, very good. If not, drop
      them and try others. We are always ready to listen to remedies, here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, if they agree with you!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;But food for one is poison for
      another. Do you know what you are doing? You are pushing home injustice
      and tyranny to the millions, for the benefit of the thousands. For is it
      not true, gentlemen, that the great masses of England are against the
      measures you impose upon us? Their fight is our fight. They are no longer
      represented in Parliament; we have never been. Taxation without
      representation is true of your rotten boroughs as well as of your vast
      colonies. You are helping the King to crush freedom abroad in order that
      he may the more easily break it at home. You are committing a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you we would give up all we own were the glory or honour of
      England at stake. And yet you call us rebels, and accuse us of meanness
      and of parsimony. If you wish money, leave the matter to our colonial
      assemblies, and see how readily you will get it. But if you wish war,
      persist in trying to grind the spirit from a people who have in them the
      pride of your own ancestors. Yes, you are estranging the colonies,
      gentlemen. A greater man than I has warned you&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that I rose, believing that I had given them all mortal offence.
      To my astonishment several got to their feet in front of me, huzzaing, and
      Comyn and Lord Ossory grasped my hands. And Charles Fox reached out over
      the corner of the table and pulled me back into my chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Richard Carvel!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Cursed if I don't love a man who will
      put up a fight against odds. Who will stand bluff to what he believes, and
      won't be talked out of his boots. We won't quarrel with any such here, my
      buckskin, I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that is the simple story, my dears, of the beginning of my friendship
      with one who may rightly be called the Saint Paul of English politics. He
      had yet some distance to go, alas, ere he was to begin that sturdy battle
      for the right for which his countrymen and ours will always bless him. I
      gave him my hand with a better will than I had ever done anything, and we
      pressed our fingers numb. And his was not the only hand I clasped. And
      honest Jack Comyn ordered more wine, that they might drink to a speedy
      reconciliation with America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pint bumper to Richard Carvel!&rdquo; said Mr. Fitzpatrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pledged Brooks's Club in another pint. Upon which they swore that I was
      a good fellow, and that if all American Whigs were like me, all cause of
      quarrel was at an end. Of this I was not so sure, nor could I see that the
      question had been settled one way or another. And that night I had reason
      to thank the Reverend Mr. Allen, for the first and last time in my life,
      that I could stand a deal of liquor, and yet not roll bottom upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was settled on the Baptist, who paid for it without a murmur.
      And then we adjourned to the business of the evening. The great
      drawing-room, lighted by an hundred candles, was filled with gayly dressed
      macaronies, and the sound of their laughter and voices in contention
      mingled with the pounding of the packs on the mahogany and the rattle of
      the dice and the ring of the gold pieces. The sight was dazzling, and the
      noise distracting. Fox had me under his especial care, and I was presented
      to young gentlemen who bore names that had been the boast of England
      through the centuries. Lands their forebears had won by lance and sword,
      they were squandering away as fast as ever they could. I, too, was known.
      All had heard the romance of the Beauty and Castle Yard, and some had
      listened to Horry Walpole tell that foolish story of Goble at Windsor, on
      which he seemed to set such store. They guessed at my weight. They betted
      upon it. And they wished to know if I could spin Mr. Brooks, who was
      scraping his way from table to table. They gave me choice of whist, or
      picquet, or quinze, or hazard. I was carried away. Nay, I make no excuse.
      Tho' the times were drinking and gaming ones, I had been brought up that a
      gentleman should do both in moderation. We mounted, some dozen of us, to
      the floor above, and passed along to a room of which Fox had the key; and
      he swung me in on his arm, the others pressing after. And the door was
      scarce closed and locked again, before they began stripping off their
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my astonishment, Fox handed me a great frieze coat, which he bade me
      don, as the others were doing. Some were turning their coats inside out;
      for luck, said they; and putting on footman's leather guards to save their
      ruffles. And they gave me a hat with a high crown, and a broad brim to
      save my eyes from the candle glare. We were as grotesque a set as ever I
      laid my eyes upon. But I hasten over the scene; which has long become
      distasteful to me. I mention it only to show to what heights of folly the
      young men had gone. I recall a gasp when they told me they played for
      rouleaux of ten pounds each, but I took out my pocket-book as boldly as
      tho' I had never played for less, and laid my stake upon the board. Fox
      lost, again and again; but he treated his ill-luck with such a raillery of
      contemptuous wit, that we must needs laugh with him. Comyn, too, lost, and
      at supper excused himself, saying that he had promised his mother, the
      dowager countess, not to lose more than a quarter's income at a sitting.
      But I won and won, until the fever of it got into my blood, and as the
      first faint light of that morning crept into the empty streets, we were
      still at it, Fox vowing that he never waked up until daylight. That the
      best things he said in the House came to him at dawn.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. LADY TANKERVILLE'S DRUM-MAJOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rising sun, as he came through the little panes of the windows, etched
      a picture of that room into my brain. I can see the twisted candles with
      their wax smearing the sticks, the chairs awry, the tables littered with
      blackened pipes, and bottles, and spilled wine and tobacco among the dice;
      and the few that were left of my companions, some with dark lines under
      their eyes, all pale, but all gay, unconcerned, witty, and cynical;
      smoothing their ruffles, and brushing the ashes and snuff from the pattern
      of their waistcoats. As we went downstairs, singing a song Mr. Foote had
      put upon the stage that week, they were good enough to declare that I
      should never be permitted to go back to Maryland. That my grandfather
      should buy me a certain borough, which might be had for six thousand
      pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawing-room made a dismal scene, too, after the riot and disorder of
      the night. Sleepy servants were cleaning up, but Fox vowed that they
      should bring us yet another bottle before going home. So down we sat about
      the famous old round table, Fox fingering the dents the gold had made in
      the board, and philosophizing; and reciting Orlando Furioso in the
      Italian, and Herodotus in the original Greek. Suddenly casting his eyes
      about, they fell upon an ungainly form stretched on a lounge, that made us
      all start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I'll lay you fifty guineas that Mr. Carvel gets the
      Beauty, against Chartersea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This roused me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Mr. Fox, I beg of you,&rdquo; I protested, with all the vehemence I could
      muster. &ldquo;Miss Manners must not be writ down in such a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer he snapped his fingers at the drowsy Brooks, who brought the
      betting book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and there, and there,&rdquo; turning over the pages; &ldquo;her
      name adorns a dozen leaves, my fine buckskin. And it will be well to have
      some truth about her. Enter the wager, Brooks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; shouts Bolingbroke; &ldquo;I haven't accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You may be sure I was in an agony over this desecration, which I was so
      powerless to prevent. But as I was thanking my stars that the matter had
      blown over with Bolingbroke's rejection, there occurred a most singular
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure on the lounge, with vast difficulty, sat up. To our amazement
      we beheld the bloated face of the Duke of Chartersea staring stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damme, Bully, you refushe bet like tha'!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll take doshen of
      'em-doshen, egad. Gimme the book, Brooksh. Cursh Fox&mdash;lay thousand d&mdash;d
      provinshial never getsh 'er&mdash;I know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat very still, seized with a loathing beyond my power to describe to
      thick that this was the man Mr. Manners was forcing her to marry. Fox
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help his Grace to his coach,&rdquo; he said to two of the footmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill fellow firsht!&rdquo; cried his Grace, with his hand on his sword, and
      instantly fell over, and went sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Grace has sent his coach home, your honour,&rdquo; said one of the men,
      respectfully. &ldquo;The duke is very quarrelsome, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put him in a chair, then,&rdquo; said Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they fearfully lifted his Grace, who was too far gone to resist, and
      carried him to a chair. And Mr. Fox bribed the chairmen with two guineas
      apiece, which he borrowed from me, to set his Grace down amongst the
      marketwomen at Covent Garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Banks found in my pockets something over seven hundred
      pounds more than I had had the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose late, my head swimming with mains and nicks, and combinations of
      all the numbers under the dozen; debated whether or no I would go to
      Arlington Street, and decided that I had not the courage. Comyn settled it
      by coming in his cabriolet, proposed that we should get the air in the
      park, dine at the Cocoa Tree, and go afterwards to Lady Tankerville's
      drum-major, where Dolly would undoubtedly be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are here, Richard,&rdquo; said his Lordship, with his accustomed
      bluntness, &ldquo;and your sea-captain has relieved your Quixotic conscience,
      what the deuce do you intend to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Win a thousand pounds every night at Brooks's, or improve your time and
      do your duty, and get Miss Manners out of his Grace's clutches? I'll
      warrant something will come of that matter this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; I said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comyn looked at me sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you fight him?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he gave me the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship whistled. &ldquo;Egad, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall want to be there to
      see. In spite of his pudding-bag shape he handles the sword as well as any
      man in England. I have crossed with him at Angelo's. And he has a devilish
      tricky record, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope you do&mdash;kill him,&rdquo; Comyn continued. &ldquo;He deserves it richly. But
      that will be a cursed unpleasant way of settling the business,&mdash;unpleasant
      for you, unpleasant for her, and cursed unpleasant for him, too, I
      suppose. Can't you think of any other way of getting her? Ask Charles to
      give you a plan of campaign. You haven't any sense, and neither have I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang you, Jack, I have no hopes of getting her,&rdquo; I replied, for I was out
      of humour with myself that day. &ldquo;In spite of what you say, I know she
      doesn't care a brass farthing to marry me. So let's drop that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Comyn made a comic gesture of deprecation. I went on: &ldquo;But I am going to
      stay here and find out the truth, though it may be a foolish undertaking.
      And if he is intimidating Mr. Manners&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may count on me, and on Charles,&rdquo; said my Lord, generously; &ldquo;and
      there are some others I know of. Gad! You made a dozen of friends and
      admirers by what you said last night, Richard. And his Grace has a few
      enemies. You will not lack support.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We dined very comfortably at the Cocoa Tree, where Comyn had made an
      appointment for me with two as diverting gentlemen as had ever been my lot
      to meet. My Lord Carlisle was the poet and scholar of the little clique
      which had been to Eton with Charles Fox, any member of which (so 'twas
      said) would have died for him. His Lordship, be it remarked in passing,
      was as lively a poet and scholar as can well be imagined. He had been
      recently sobered, so Comyn confided; which I afterwards discovered meant
      married. Charles Fox's word for the same was fallen. And I remembered that
      Jack had told me it was to visit Lady Carlisle at Castle Howard that
      Dorothy was going when she heard of my disappearance. Comyn's other guest
      was Mr. Topham Beauclerk, the macaroni friend of Dr. Johnson. He, too, had
      been recently married, but appeared no more sobered than his Lordship. Mr.
      Beauclerk's wife, by the way, was the beautiful Lady Diana Spencer, who
      had been divorced from Lord Bolingbroke, the Bully I had met the night
      before. These gentlemen seemed both well acquainted with Miss Manners, and
      vowed that none but American beauties would ever be the fashion in London
      more. Then we all drove to Lady Tankerville's drum-major near Chesterfield
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be wanting a word with her when she comes in,&rdquo; said Comyn, slyly
      divining. Poor fellow! I fear that I scarcely appreciated his feelings as
      to Dorothy, or the noble unselfishness of his friendship for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat aside in a recess of the lower hall, watching the throng as they
      passed: haughty dowagers, distorted in lead and disfigured in silk and
      feathers nodding at the ceiling; accomplished beaus of threescore or more,
      carefully mended for the night by their Frenchmen at home; young ladies in
      gay brocades with round skirts and stiff, pear-shaped bodices; and
      youngsters just learning to ogle and to handle their snuff-boxes. One by
      one their names were sent up and solemnly mouthed by the footman on the
      landing. At length, when we had all but given her up, Dorothy arrived. A
      hood of lavender silk heightened the oval of her face, and out from under
      it crept rebellious wisps of her dark hair. But she was very pale, and I
      noticed for the first time a worn expression that gave me a twinge of
      uneasiness. 'Twas then I caught sight of the duke, a surly stamp on his
      leaden features. And after him danced Mr. Manners. Dolly gave a little cry
      when she saw me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Richard, I am so glad you are here. I was wondering what had become
      of you. And Comyn, too.&rdquo; Whispering to me, &ldquo;Mamma has had a letter from
      Mrs. Brice; your grandfather has been to walk in the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Grafton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said nothing of your uncle,&rdquo; she replied, with a little shudder at
      the name; &ldquo;but wrote that Mr. Carvel was said to be better. So there! your
      conscience need not trouble you for remaining. I am sure he would wish you
      to pay a visit home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have to scold you, sir. You have not been to Arlington Street for
      three whole days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It struck me suddenly that her gayety was the same as that she had worn to
      my birthday party, scarce a year agone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolly, you are not well!&rdquo; I said anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung her head saucily for answer. In the meantime his Grace, talking
      coldly to Comyn, had been looking unutterable thunders at me. I thought of
      him awaking in the dew at Covent Garden, and could scarce keep from
      laughing in his face. Mr. Marmaduke squirmed to the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning, Richard,&rdquo; he said, with a marked cordiality. &ldquo;Have you met the
      Duke of Chartersea? No! Your Grace, this is Mr. Richard Carvel. His family
      are dear friends of ours in the colonies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To my great surprise, the duke saluted me quite civilly. But I had the
      feeling of facing a treacherous bull which would gore me as soon as ever
      my back was turned. He was always putting me in mind of a bull, with his
      short neck and heavy, hunched shoulders,&mdash;and with the ugly tinge of
      red in the whites of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Manners tells me you are to remain awhile in London, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he
      said, in his thick voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took his meaning instantly, and replied in kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your Grace, I have some business to attend to here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;then I shall see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably, sir,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship watched this thrust and parry with an ill-concealed delight.
      Dorothy's face was impassive, expressionless. As the duke turned to mount
      the stairs, he stumbled clumsily across a young man coming to pay his
      respects to Miss Manners, and his Grace went sprawling against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound you, sir!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the ducal temper was no respecter of presences. Then a title was a
      title to those born lower, and the young man plainly had a vast honour for
      a coronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your Grace's pardon,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the deuce is he?&rdquo; demanded the duke petulantly of Mr. Manners,
      thereby setting the poor little man all a-tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why,&mdash;&rdquo; he replied, searching for his spyglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Dolly's eyes shot scorn. Chartersea had clearly seen and
      heeded that signal before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman is a friend of mine,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tho' I were put out of the Garden of Eden as a consequence, I itched to
      have it out with his Grace then and there. I knew that I was bound to come
      into collision with him sooner or later. Such, indeed, was my mission in
      London. But Dorothy led the way upstairs, a spot of colour burning each of
      her cheeks. The stream of guests had been arrested until the hall was
      packed, and the curious were peering over the rail above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, wasn't she superb!&rdquo; exclaimed Comyn, exultingly, as we followed. In
      the drawing-room the buzzing about the card tables was hushed a moment as
      she went in. But I soon lost sight of her, thanks to Comyn. He drew me on
      from group to group, and I was duly presented to a score of Lady
      So-and-sos and honourable misses, most of whom had titles, but little
      else. Mammas searched their memories, and suddenly discovered that they
      had heard their parents speak of my grandfather. But, as it was a fair
      presumption that most colonial gentlemen made a visit home at least once
      in their lives, I did not allow the dust to get into my eyes. I was
      invited to dinners, and fairly showered with invitations to balls and
      drums and garden parties. I was twitted about the Beauty, most often with
      only a thin coating of amiability covering the spite of the remark. In
      short, if my head had not been so heavily laden with other matters, it
      might well have become light under the strain. Had I been ambitious to
      enter the arena I should have had but little trouble, since eligibility
      then might be reduced to guineas and another element not moral. I was the
      only heir of one of the richest men in the colony, vouched for by the
      Manners and taken up by Mr. Fox and my Lord Comyn. Inquiries are not
      pushed farther. I could not help seeing the hardness of it all, or refrain
      from contrasting my situation with that of the penniless outcast I had
      been but a little time before. The gilded rooms, the hundred yellow
      candles multiplied by the mirrors, the powder, the perfume, the jewels,&mdash;all
      put me in mind of the poor devils I had left wasting away their lives in
      Castle Yard. They, too, had had their times of prosperity, their friends
      who had faded with the first waning of fortune. Some of them had known
      what it was to be fawned over. And how many of these careless, flitting
      men of fashion I looked upon could feel the ground firm beneath their
      feet; or could say with certainty what a change of ministers, or one wild
      night at White's or Almack's, would bring forth? Verily, one must have
      seen the under side of life to know the upper!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I was sought out by Mr. Topham Beauclerk, who had heard of the
      episode below and wished to hear more. He swore at the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be run through some day, and serve him jolly right,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;Bet you twenty pounds Charles Fox does it! His Grace knows he has the
      courage to fight him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The courage!&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Angelo says the duke has diabolical skill. And then he won't fight
      fair. He killed young Atwater on a foul, you know. Slipped on the wet
      grass, and Chartersea had him pinned before he caught his guard. But there
      is Lady Di a-calling, a-calling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do all the women cheat in America too?&rdquo; asked Topham, as we approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of my Aunt Caroline, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will game, d&mdash;n 'em,&rdquo; said Topham, as tho' he had never gamed
      in his life. &ldquo;And they will cheat, till a man has to close his eyes to
      keep from seeing their pretty hands. And they will cry, egad, oh so
      touchingly, if the luck goes against them in spite of it all. Only last
      week I had to forgive Mrs Farnham an hundred guineas. She said she'd lost
      her pin-money twice over, and was like to have wept her eyes out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus primed in Topham's frank terms, I knew what to expect. And I found to
      my amusement he had not overrun the truth. I lost like a stoic, saw
      nothing, and discovered the straight road to popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear things expect us to make it up at the clubs,&rdquo; whispered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I discovered how he had fallen in love with his wife, Lady Diana, and
      pitied poor Bolingbroke heartily for having lost her. She was then in her
      prime,&mdash;a beauty, a wit, and a great lady, with a dash of the
      humanities about her that brought both men and women to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come to see me, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I wish to talk to you of
      Dorothy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Ladyship believes me versed in no other subject?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None other worth the mention,&rdquo; she replied instantly; &ldquo;Topham tells me
      you can talk horses, and that mystery of mysteries, American politics. But
      look at Miss Manners Dow. I'll warrant she is making Sir Charles see to
      his laurels, and young Stavordale is struck dumb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked up quickly and beheld Dolly surrounded by a circle of admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark the shot strike!&rdquo; Lady Di continued, between the deals; &ldquo;that time
      Chartersea went down. I fancy he is bowled over rather often,&rdquo; she said
      slyly. &ldquo;What a brute it is. And they say that that little woman she has
      for a father imagines a union with the duke will redound to his glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Meynel, sitting next me, &ldquo;that the duke has
      thumbscrews of some kind on Mr. Manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Manners is able to take care of herself,&rdquo; said Topham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'On dit', that she has already refused as many dukes as did her Grace of
      Argyle,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meynel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had lost track of the cards, and knew I was losing prodigiously. But my
      eyes went back again and again to the group by the doorway, where Dolly
      was holding court and dispensing justice, and perchance injustice. The
      circle increased. Ribands, generals whose chests were covered with medals
      of valour, French noblemen, and foreign ambassadors stopped for a word
      with the Beauty and passed on their way, some smiling, some reflecting, to
      make room for others. I overheard from the neighbouring tables a spiteful
      protest that a young upstart from the colonies should turn Lady
      Tankerville's drum into a levee. My ears tingled as I listened. But not a
      feathered parrot in the carping lot of them could deny that Miss Manners
      had beauty and wit enough to keep them all at bay. Hers was not an English
      beauty: every line of her face and pose of her body proclaimed her of that
      noble type of Maryland women, distinctly American, over which many
      Englishmen before and since have lost their heads and hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Storer, who was looking on; &ldquo;she's already defeated
      some of the Treasury Bench, and bless me if she isn't rating North
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half the heads in the room were turned toward Miss Manners, who was
      exchanging jokes with the Prime Minister of Great Britain. I saw a
      corpulent man, ludicrously like the King's pictures, with bulging gray
      eyes that seemed to take in nothing. And this was North, upon whose
      conduct with the King depended the fate of our America. Good-natured he
      was, and his laziness was painfully apparent. He had the reputation of
      going to sleep standing, like a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Beauty contrives to keep him awake,&rdquo; said Storer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you stay among us, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; said Topham, &ldquo;she will get you a
      commissionership for the asking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; cried Lady Di, &ldquo;there comes Mr. Fox, the precocious, the
      irresistible. Were he in the Bible, we should read of him passing the time
      of day with King Solomon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or instructing Daniel in the art of lion-taming,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Meynel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Mr. Fox in truth, and the Beauty's face lighted up at sight of
      him. And presently, when Lord North had made his bow and passed on, he was
      seen to lead her out of the room, leaving her circle to go to pieces, like
      an empire without a head.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. DRURY LANE
    </h2>
    <p>
      After a night spent in making resolutions, I set out for Arlington Street,
      my heart beating a march, as it had when I went thither on my arrival in
      London. Such was my excitement that I was near to being run over in
      Piccadilly like many another country gentleman, and roundly cursed by a
      wagoner for my stupidity. I had a hollow bigness within me, half of joy,
      half of pain, that sent me onward with ever increasing steps and a
      whirling storm of contradictions in my head. Now it was: Dolly loved me in
      spite of all the great men in England. Why, otherwise, had she come to the
      sponging-house? Berating myself: had her affection been other than that of
      a life-long friendship she would not have come an inch. But why had she
      made me stay in London? Why had she spoken so to Comyn? What
      interpretation might be put upon a score of little acts of hers that came
      a-flooding to mind, each a sacred treasure of memory? A lover's
      interpretation, forsooth. Fie, Richard! what presumption to think that
      you, a raw lad, should have a chance in such a field! You have yet, by
      dint of hard knocks and buffets, to learn the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this I had come in sight of her house, and suddenly I trembled like a
      green horse before a cannon. My courage ran out so fast that I was soon
      left without any, and my legs had carried me as far as St. James's Church
      before I could bring them up. Then I was sure, for the first time, that
      she did not love me. In front of the church I halted, reflecting that I
      had not remained in England with any hope of it, but rather to discover
      the truth about Chartersea's actions, and to save her, if it were
      possible. I turned back once more, and now got as far as the knocker, and
      lifted it as a belfry was striking the hour of noon. I think I would have
      fled again had not the door been immediately opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more I found myself in the room looking out over the Park, the French
      windows open to the balcony, the sunlight flowing in with the
      spring-scented air. On the table was lying a little leather book, stamped
      with gold,&mdash;her prayerbook. Well I remembered it! I opened it, to
      read: &ldquo;Dorothy, from her Mother. Annapolis, Christmas, 1768.&rdquo; The sweet
      vista of the past stretched before my eyes. I saw her, on such a, Mayday
      as this, walking to St. Anne's under the grand old trees, their budding
      leaves casting a delicate tracery at her feet. I followed her up the aisle
      until she disappeared in the high pew, and then I sat beside my
      grandfather and thought of her, nor listened to a word of Mr. Allen's
      sermon. Why had they ever taken her to London?
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came in I sought her face anxiously. She was still pale; and I
      thought, despite her smile, that a trace of sadness lingered in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, sir, you have come,&rdquo; she said severely. &ldquo;Sit down and give an
      account of yourself at once. You have been behaving very badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don't 'Dorothy' me, sir. But explain where you have been for this
      week past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Dolly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pretend to have some affection for your old playmate, but you do not
      trouble yourself to come to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, you do me wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wrong! You prefer to gallivant about town with Comyn and Charles
      Fox, and with all those wild gentlemen who go to Brooks's. Nay, I have
      heard of your goings-on. I shall write to Mr. Carvel to-day, and advise
      him to send for you. And tell him that you won a thousand pounds in one
      night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only seven hundred,&rdquo; I interrupted sheepishly. I thought she
      smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And will probably lose twenty thousand before you have done. And I shall
      say to him that you have dared to make bold rebel speeches to a Lord of
      the Admiralty and to some of the King's supporters. I shall tell your
      grandfather you are disgracing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebel speeches!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, rebel speeches at Almack's. Who ever heard of such a thing! No doubt
      I shall hear next of your going to a drawing-room and instructing his
      Majesty how to subdue the colonies. And then, sir, you will be sent to the
      Tower, and I shan't move a finger to get you out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you of this, Dolly?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fox, himself, for one. He thought it so good,&mdash;or so bad,&mdash;that
      he took me aside last night at Lady Tankerville's, asked me why I had let
      you out of Castle Yard, and told me I must manage to curb your tongue. I
      replied that I had about as much influence with you as I have with Dr.
      Franklin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Fox lead you off,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you did, did you!&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;But you never once came near me
      yourself, save when I chanced to meet you in the hall, tho' I was there a
      full three hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;You were surrounded by prime ministers and
      ambassadors, and Heaven knows how many other great people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you wish to do anything, Richard, you usually find a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; I answered, despairing, &ldquo;I can never explain anything to you,
      Dolly. Your tongue is too quick for mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you go home with your captain?&rdquo; she asked mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why I stayed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose because you want to be a gay spark and taste of the pleasures
      of London. That is, what you men are pleased to call pleasures. I can
      think of no other season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another,&rdquo; I said desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Dolly. And in her old aggravating way she got up and stood in
      the window, looking out over the park. I rose and stood beside her, my
      very temples throbbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no such springs at home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But oh, I wish I were at
      Wilmot House to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another reason,&rdquo; I repeated. My voice sounded far away, like
      that of another. I saw the colour come into her cheeks again, slowly. The
      southwest wind, with a whiff of the channel salt in it, blew the curtains
      at our backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a conscience, Richard,&rdquo; she said gently, without turning. &ldquo;So
      few of us have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised. Nor did I know what to make of that there were so many
      meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wild,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and impulsive, as they say your father
      was. But he was a man I should have honoured. He stood firm beside his
      friends. He made his enemies fear him. All strong men must have enemies, I
      suppose. They must make them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her, troubled, puzzled, but burning at her praise of Captain
      Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolly,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;you are not well. Why won't you come back to Maryland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply to that. Then she faced me suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, I know now why you insisted upon going back. It was because you
      would not desert your sea-captain. Comyn and Mr. Fox have told me, and
      they admire you for it as much as I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What language is worthy to describe her as she was then in that pose, with
      her head high, as she was wont to ride over the field after the hounds.
      Hers was in truth no beauty of stone, but the beauty of force,&mdash;of
      life itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;Dorothy, I stayed because I love you. There, I have
      said it again, what has not passed my lips since we were children. What
      has been in my heart ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped, awed. For she had stepped back, out on the balcony. She hid her
      head in her hands, and I saw her breast shaken as with sobs. I waited what
      seemed a day,&mdash;a year. Then she raised her face and looked at me
      through the tears shining in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; she said sadly, &ldquo;why, why did you ever tell me? Why can we not
      always be playmates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words I tried to say choked me. I could not speak for sorrow, for very
      bitterness. And yet I might have known! I dared not look at her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Richard,&rdquo; I heard her say, &ldquo;God alone understands how it hurts me to
      give you pain. Had I only foreseen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you only foreseen,&rdquo; I said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never have let you speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her words came steadily, but painfully. And when I raised my eyes she met
      them bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have seen,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;These years I have loved you, nor could I
      have hidden it if I had wished. But I have little&mdash;to offer you,&rdquo; I
      went on cruelly, for I knew not what I said; &ldquo;you who may have English
      lands and titles for the consenting. I was a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tears started again. And at sight of them I was seized with such
      remorse that I could have bitten my tongue in two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Dorothy, if you can,&rdquo; I implored. &ldquo;I did not mean it. Nor did
      I presume to think you loved me. I have adored,&mdash;I shall be content
      to adore from far below. And I stayed,&mdash;I stayed that I might save
      you if a danger threatened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Danger!&rdquo; she exclaimed, catching her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come to the point,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I stayed to save you from the Duke of
      Chartersea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She grasped the balcony rail, and I think would have fallen but for my
      arm. Then she straightened, and only the quiver of her lip marked the
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save me from the Duke of Chartersea?&rdquo; she said, so coldly that my
      conviction was shaken. &ldquo;Explain yourself, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot love him!&rdquo; I cried, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flashed upon me a glance I shall never forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Carvel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have gone too far. Though you have been
      my friend all my life, there are some things which even you cannot say to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she left me abruptly and went into the house, her head flung back. And
      I followed in a tumult of mortification and wounded pride, in such a state
      of dejection that I wished I had never been born. But hers was a nature of
      surprises, and impulsive, like my own. Beside the cabinet she turned, calm
      again, all trace of anger vanished from her face. Drawing a hawthorn sprig
      from a porcelain vase I had given her, she put it in my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us forget this, Richard,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;we have both been very foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forget, indeed! Unless Heaven had robbed me of reason, had torn the past
      from me at a single stroke. I could not have forgotten. When I reached my
      lodgings I sent the anxious Banks about his business and threw myself in a
      great chair before the window, the chair she had chosen. Strange to say, I
      had no sensation save numbness. The time must have been about two of the
      clock: I took no account of it. I recall Banks coming timidly back with
      the news that two gentlemen had called. I bade him send them away. Would
      my honour not have Mrs. Marble cook my dinner, and be dressed for Lady
      Pembroke's ball? I sent him off again, harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long while the slamming of a coach door roused me, and I was
      straightway seized with such an agony of mind that I could have cried
      aloud. 'Twas like the pain of blood flowing back into a frozen limb.
      Darkness was fast gathering as I reached the street and began to walk
      madly. Word by word I rehearsed the scene in the drawing-room over the
      Park, but I could not think calmly, for the pain of it. Little by little I
      probed, writhing, until far back in my boyhood I was tearing at the dead
      roots of that cherished plant, which was the Hope of Her Love. It had
      grown with my own life, and now with its death to-day I felt that I had
      lost all that was dear to me. Then, in the midst of this abject self-pity,
      I was stricken with shame. I thought of Comyn, who had borne the same
      misfortune as a man should. Had his pain been the less because he had not
      loved her from childhood? Like Comyn, I resolved to labour for her
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      What hour of the night it was I know not when a man touched me on the
      shoulder, and I came to myself with a start. I was in a narrow street
      lined by hideous houses, their windows glaring with light. Each seemed a
      skull, with rays darting from its grinning eye-holes. Within I caught
      glimpses of debauchery that turned me sick. Ten paces away three women and
      a man were brawling, the low angry tones of his voice mingling with the
      screeches of their Billingsgate. Muffled figures were passing and
      repassing unconcernedly, some entering the houses, others coming out, and
      a handsome coach, without arms and with a footman in plain livery,
      lumbered along and stopped farther on. All this I remarked before I took
      notice of him who had intercepted me, and demanded what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Bill!&rdquo; he cried with an oath to a man who stood on the steps
      opposite; &ldquo;'ere's a soft un as has put 'is gill in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man responded, and behind him came two more of the same feather, and
      suddenly I found myself surrounded by an ill-smelling crowd of flashy men
      and tawdry women. They jostled me, and I reached for my sword, to make the
      discovery that I had forgotten it. Regaining my full senses, I struck the
      man nearest me a blow that sent him sprawling in the dirt. A blade gleamed
      under the sickly light of the fish-oil lamp overhead, but a man crashed
      through from behind and caught the ruffian's sword-arm and flung him back
      in the kennel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The watch!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the watch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They vanished like rats into their holes at the shout, leaving me standing
      alone with him. The affair had come and gone so quickly that I scarce
      caught my breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, sir,&rdquo; he said, knuckling, &ldquo;but I followed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Banks. For a second time he had given me an affecting example of
      his faithfulness. I forgot that he was my servant, and I caught his hand
      and pressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have saved my life at the risk of your own,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I shall not
      forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Banks had been too well trained to lose sight of his position. He
      merely tipped his hat again and said imperturbably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Best get out of here, your honour. They'll be coming again directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drury Lane, sir,&rdquo; he replied, giving me just the corner of a glance;
      &ldquo;shall I fetch a coach, sir?&rdquo; No, I preferred to walk. Before we had
      turned into Long Acre I had seen all of this Sodom of London that it
      should be given a man to see, if indeed we must behold some of the
      bestiality of this world. Here alone, in the great city, high and low were
      met equal. Sin levels rank. The devil makes no choice between my lord and
      his kitchen wench who has gone astray. Here, in Sodom, painted vice had
      lain for an hundred years and bred half the crime of a century. How many
      souls had gone hence in that time to meet their Maker! Some of these
      brazen creatures who leered at me had known how long ago!&mdash;a peaceful
      home and a mother's love; had been lured in their innocence to this place
      of horrors, never to leave it until death mercifully overtakes them.
      Others, having fallen, had been driven hither by a cruel world that
      shelters all save the helpless, that forgives all save the truly penitent.
      I shuddered as I thought of Mr. Hogarth's prints, which, in the library in
      Marlboro' Street at home, had had so little meaning for me. Verily he had
      painted no worse than the reality. As I strode homeward, my own sorrow
      subdued by the greater sorrow I had looked upon, the craving I had had to
      be alone was gone, and I would have locked arms with a turnspit. I called
      to Banks, who was behind at a respectful distance, and bade him come talk
      to me. His presence of mind in calling on the watch had made even a
      greater impression upon me than his bravery. I told him that he should
      have ten pounds, and an increase of wages. And I asked him where I had
      gone after leaving Dover Street, and why he had followed me. He answered
      this latter question first. He had seen gentlemen in the same state, or
      something like it, before: his Lordship, his late master, after he had
      fought with Mr. Onslow, of the Guards, and Sir Edward Minturn, when he had
      lost an inheritance and a reversion at Brooks's, and was forced to give
      over his engagement to marry the Honourable Miss Swift. &ldquo;Lord, sir,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;but that was a sad case, as set all London agog. And Sir Edward
      shot hisself at Portsmouth not a se'nnight after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he relapsed into silence, no doubt longing to ask the cause of my own
      affliction. Presently he surprised me by saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I might make so bold, Mr. Carvel, I would like to tell your honour
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. And he hawed awhile and then burst out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honour must know then that I belongs to the footman's club in
      Berkeley Square, where I meets all the servants o' quality&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, wondering what footman's tale he had to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Whipple, he's a hintimate o' mine, sir.&rdquo; He stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who may Whipple be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With submission, sir. Whipple's his Grace o' Chartersea's man&mdash;and,
      you'll forgive me, sir&mdash;Whipple owns his Grace is prodigious ugly,
      an' killed young Mr. Atwater unfair, some think. Whipple says he would
      give notice had he not promised the old duke&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drat Whipple!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. To be sure, sir. His Grace was in a bloody rage when he found
      hisself in a fruit bin at Covent Carding. An' two redbreasts had carried
      him to the round house, sir, afore they discovered his title. An' since
      his Grace ha' said time an' time afore Whipple, that he'll ha' Mr.
      Carvel's heart for that, and has called you most disgustin' bad names,
      sir. An' Whipple he says to me: 'Banks, drop your marster a word, an' you
      get the chance. His Grace'll speak him fair to's face, but let him look
      behind him.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you again, Banks. I shall bear in mind your devotion,&rdquo; I replied.
      &ldquo;But I had nothing to do with sending the duke to Covent Garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sir, so I tells Whipple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, how did you know?&rdquo; I demanded curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, sir! All the servants at Almack's is friends o' mine,&rdquo; says he.
      &ldquo;But Whipple declares his Grace will be sworn you did it, sir, tho' the
      Lord Mayor hisself made deposition 'twas not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then mark me, Banks, you are not to talk of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord, no, your honour,&rdquo; he said, as he fell back. But I was not so
      sure of his discretion as of his loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I was led to perceive that I was not to be the only aggressor in
      the struggle that was to come. That his Grace did me the honour to look
      upon me as an obstacle. And that he intended to seize the first
      opportunity to make way with me, by fair means or foul.

      CHAPTER XXXIV. HIS GRACE MAKES ADVANCES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning I began casting about as to what I should do next. There
      was no longer any chance of getting at the secret from Dorothy, if secret
      there were. Whilst I am ruminating comes a great battling at the street
      door, and Jack Comyn blew in like a gust of wind, rating me soundly for
      being a lout and a blockhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zooks!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I danced the soles off my shoes trying to get in here
      yesterday, and I hear you were moping all the time, and paid me no more
      attention than I had been a dog scratching at the door. What! and have you
      fallen out with my lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I confessed the whole matter to him. He was not to be resisted. He called
      to Banks for a cogue of Nantsey, and swore amazingly at what he was
      pleased to term the inscrutability of woman, offering up consolation by
      the wholesale. The incident, he said, but strengthened his conviction that
      Mr. Manners had appealed to Dorothy to save him. &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; added his
      Lordship, facing me with absolute fierceness, &ldquo;and then, Richard, why the
      devil did she weep? There were no tears when I made my avowal. I tell you,
      man, that the whole thing points but the one way. She loves you. I swear
      it by the rood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not help laughing, and he stood looking at me with such a
      whimsical expression that I rose and flung my arms around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack, Jack!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;what a fraud you are! Do you remember the argument
      you used when you had got me out of the sponging-house? Quoting you, all I
      had to do was to put Dorothy to the proof, and she would toss Mr.
      Marmaduke and his honour broadcast. Now I have confessed myself, and what
      is the result? Nay, your theory is gone up in vapour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; cried his Lordship, hotly, &ldquo;why before refusing me did she
      demand to know whether you had been in love with Patty Swain? 'Sdeath! you
      put me in mind of a woman upon stilts&mdash;a man has always to be walking
      alongside her with encouragement handy. And when a proud creature such as
      our young lady breaks down as she hath done, 'tis clear as skylight there
      is something wrong. And as for Mr. Manners, Hare overheard a part of a
      pow-wow 'twixt him and the duke at the Bedford Arms,&mdash;and Chartersea
      has all but owned in some of his drunken fits that our little fop is in
      his power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she is in love with some one else,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you she is not,&rdquo; said Comyn, still more emphatically; &ldquo;and you can
      write that down in red in your table book. Gossip has never been able to
      connect her name with that of any man save yours, when she went for you in
      Castle Yard. And, gemini, gossip is like water, and will get in if a crack
      shows. When the Marquis of Wells was going to Arlington Street once every
      day, she sent him about his business in a fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Despite Comyn's most unselfish optimism, I could see no light. And in the
      recklessness that so often besets youngsters of my temper, on like
      occasions, I went off to Newmarket next day with Mr. Fox and Lord Ossory,
      in his Lordship's travelling-chaise and four. I spent a very gay week
      trying to forget Miss Dolly. I was the loser by some three hundred pounds,
      in addition to what I expended and loaned to Mr. Fox. This young gentleman
      was then beginning to accumulate at Newmarket a most execrable stud. He
      lost prodigiously, but seemed in no wise disturbed thereby. I have never
      known a man who took his ill-luck with such a stoical nonchalance. Not so
      while the heat was on. As I write, a most ridiculous recollection rises of
      Charles dragging his Lordship and me and all who were with him to that
      part of the course where the race was highest, where he would act like a
      madman; blowing and perspiring, and whipping and swearing all at a time,
      and rising up and down as if the horse was throwing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Newmarket I had the good&mdash;or ill-fortune to meet that incorrigible
      rake and profligate, my Lord of March and Ruglen. For him the goddess of
      Chance had smiled, and he was in the most complaisant humour. I was
      presented to his Grace, the Duke of Grafton, whose name I had no reason to
      love, and invited to Wakefield Lodge. We went instead, Mr. Fox and I, to
      Ampthill, Lord Ossory's seat, with a merry troop. And then we had more
      racing; and whist and quinze and pharaoh and hazard, until I was obliged
      to write another draft upon Mr. Dix to settle the wails: and picquet in
      the travelling-chaise all the way to London. Dining at Brooks's, we
      encountered Fitzpatrick and Comyn and my Lord Carlisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now how much has Charles borrowed of you, Mr. Carvel?&rdquo; demanded
      Fitzpatrick, as we took our seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll lay ten guineas that Charles has him mortgaged this day month,
      though he owns as much land as William Penn, and is as rich as Fordyce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Comyn demanded where the devil I had been, though he knew perfectly. He
      was uncommonly silent during dinner, and then asked me if I had heard the
      news. I told him I had heard none. He took me by the sleeve, to the quiet
      amusement of the company, and led me aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse you, Richard,&rdquo; says be; &ldquo;you have put me in such a temper that I
      vow I'll fling you over. You profess to love her, and yet you go betting
      to Newmarket and carousing to Ampthill when she is ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill!&rdquo; I said, catching my breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! That hurts, does it? Yes, ill, I say. She was missed at Lady
      Pembroke's that Friday you had the scene with her, and at Lady Ailesbury's
      on Saturday. On Monday morning, when I come to you for tidings, you are
      off watching Charles make an ass of himself at Newmarket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is she now, Comyn?&rdquo; I asked, catching him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may go yourself and see, and be cursed, Richard Carvel. She is in
      trouble, and you are pleasure-seeking in the country. Damme! you deserve
      richly to lose her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calling for my greatcoat, and paying no heed to the jeers of the company
      for leaving before the toasts and the play, I fairly ran to Arlington
      Street. I was in a passion of remorse. Comyn had been but just. Granting,
      indeed, that she had refused to marry me, was that any reason why I should
      desert my life-long friend and playmate? A hundred little tokens of her
      affection for me rose to mind, and last of all that rescue from Castle
      Yard in the face of all Mayfair. And in that hour of darkness the
      conviction that something was wrong came back upon me with redoubled
      force. Her lack of colour, her feverish actions, and the growing
      slightness of her figure, all gave me a pang, as I connected them with
      that scene on the balcony over the Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was darkened, and a coach was in front of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessir,&rdquo; said the footman, &ldquo;Miss Manners has been quite ill. She is now
      some better, and Dr. James is with her. Mrs. Manners begs company will
      excuse her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Marmaduke? The man said, with as near a grin as he ever got, that
      the marster was gone to Mrs. Cornelys's assembly. As I turned away, sick
      at heart, the physician, in his tie-wig and scarlet cloak, came out, and I
      stopped him. He was a testy man, and struck the stone an impatient blow
      with his staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Od's life, sir. I am besieged day and night by you young gentlemen. I
      begin to think of sending a daily card to Almack's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I am an old friend of Miss Manners,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;having grown up
      with her in Maryland&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Mr. Carvel?&rdquo; he demanded abruptly, taking his hat from his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, surprised. In the gleam of the portico lanthorn he
      scrutinized me for several seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some troubles of the mind which are beyond the power of physic
      to remedy, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;She has mentioned your name, sir, and
      you are to judge of my meaning. Your most obedient, sir. Good night, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he got into his coach, leaving me standing where I was, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same fear of being alone, which has driven many a man to his cups,
      sent me back to Brooks's for company. I found Fox and Comyn seated at a
      table in the corner of the drawing-room, for once not playing, but talking
      earnestly. Their expressions when they saw me betrayed what my own face
      must have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried Comyn, half rising; &ldquo;is she&mdash;is she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she is better,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have frightened him badly, Jack,&rdquo; said Fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      I flung myself into a chair, and Fox proposed whist, something unusual for
      him. Comyn called for cards, and was about to go in search of a fourth,
      when we all three caught sight of the Duke of Chartersea in the door,
      surveying the room with a cold leisure. His eye paused when in line with
      us, and we were seized with astonishment to behold him making in our
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squints!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Fox, &ldquo;now what the devil can the hound want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To pull your nose for sending him to market,&rdquo; my Lord suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fox laughed coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay you twenty he doesn't, Jack,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Grace plainly had some business with us, and I hoped he was coming to
      force the fighting. The pieces had ceased to rattle on the round mahogany
      table, and every head in the room seemed turned our way, for the Covent
      Garden story was well known. Chartersea laid his hand on the back of our
      fourth chair, greeted us with some ceremony, and said something which,
      under the circumstances, was almost unheard of in that day: &ldquo;If you stand
      in need of one, gentlemen, I should deem it an honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The situation had in it enough spice for all of us. We welcomed him with
      alacrity. The cards were cut, and it fell to his Grace to deal, which he
      did very prettily, despite his heavy hands. He drew Charles Fox, and they
      won steadily. The conversation between deals was anywhere; on the virtue
      of Morello cherries for the gout, to which his Grace was already subject;
      on Mr. Fox's Ariel, and why he had not carried Sandwich's cup at
      Newmarket; on the advisability of putting three-year-olds on the track; in
      short, on a dozen small topics of the kind. At length, when Comyn and I
      had lost some fifty pounds between us, Chartersea threw down the cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My coach waits to-night, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, with some sort of an accent
      that did not escape us. &ldquo;It would give me the greatest pleasure and you
      will sup with me in Hanover Square.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. IN WHICH MY LORD BALTIMORE APPEARS
    </h2>
    <p>
      His Grace's offer was accepted with a readiness he could scarce have
      expected, and we all left the room in the midst of a buzz of comment. We
      knew well that the matter was not so haphazard as it appeared, and on the
      way to Hanover Square Comyn more than once stepped on my toe, and I
      answered the pressure. Our coats and canes were taken by the duke's
      lackeys when we arrived. We were shown over the house. Until now&mdash;so
      his Grace informed us&mdash;it had not been changed since the time of the
      fourth duke, who, as we doubtless knew, had been an ardent supporter of
      the Hanoverian succession. The rooms were high-panelled and furnished in
      the German style, as was the fashion when the Square was built. But some
      were stripped and littered with scaffolding and plaster, new and costly
      marble mantels were replacing the wood, and an Italian of some renown was
      decorating the ceilings. His Grace appeared to be at some pains that the
      significance of these improvements should not be lost upon us; was
      constantly appealing to Mr. Fox's taste on this or that feature. But those
      fishy eyes of his were so alert that we had not even opportunity to wink.
      It was wholly patent, in brief, that the Duke of Chartersea meant to be
      married, and had brought Charles and Comyn hither with a purpose. For me
      he would have put himself out not an inch had he not understood that my
      support came from those quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tempered off this exhibition by showing us a collection of pottery
      famous in England, that had belonged to the fifth duke, his father. Every
      piece of it, by the way, afterwards brought an enormous sum at auction.
      Supper was served in a warm little room of oak. The game was from
      Derresley Manor, the duke's Nottinghamshire seat, and the wine, so he told
      us, was some of fifty bottles of rare Chinon he had inherited. Melted
      rubies it was indeed, of the sort which had quickened the blood of many a
      royal gathering at Blois and Amboise and Chenonceaux,&mdash;the distilled
      peasant song of the Loire valley. In it many a careworn clown had tasted
      the purer happiness of the lowly. Our restraint gave way under its
      influence. His Grace lost for the moment his deformities, and Mr. Fox made
      us laugh until our sides ached again. His Lordship told many a capital
      yarn, and my own wit was afterwards said to be astonishing, though I can
      recall none of it to support the affirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word or even a hint of Dorothy had been uttered, nor did Chartersea
      so much as refer to his Covent Garden experience. At length, when some
      half dozen of the wine was gone, and the big oak clock had struck two, the
      talk lapsed. It was Charles Fox, of course, who threw the spark into the
      powder box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were speaking of hunting, Chartersea,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you ever know
      George Wrottlesey, of the Suffolk branch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his Grace, very innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! 'Od's whips and spurs, I'll be sworn I never saw a man to beat him
      for reckless riding. He would take five bars any time, egad, and sit any
      colt that was ever foaled. The Wrottleseys were poor as weavers then, with
      the Jews coming down in the wagon from London and hanging round the hall
      gates. But the old squire had plenty of good hunters in the stables, and
      haunches on the board, and a cellar that was like the widow's cruse of
      oil, or barrel of meal&mdash;or whatever she had. All the old man had to
      do to lose a guinea was to lay it on a card. He never nicked in his life,
      so they say. Well, young George got after a rich tea-merchant's daughter
      who had come into the country near by. 'Slife! she was a saucy jade, and
      devilish pretty. Such a face! so Stavordale vowed, and such a neck! and
      such eyes! so innocent, so ravishingly innocent. But she knew cursed well
      George was after the bank deposit, and kept him galloping. And when he got
      a view, halloa, egad! she was stole away again, and no scent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One morning George was out after the hounds with Stavordale, who told me
      the story, and a lot of fellows who had come over from Newmarket. He was
      upon Aftermath, the horse that Foley bought for five hundred pounds and
      was a colt then. Of course he left the field out of sight behind. He made
      for a gap in the park wall (faith! there was no lack of 'em), but the colt
      refused, and over went George and plumped into a cart of winter apples
      some farmer's sot was taking to Bury Saint Edmunds to market. The fall
      knocked the sense out of George, for he hasn't much, and Stavordale thinks
      he must have struck a stake as he went in. Anyway, the apples rolled over
      on top of him, and the drunkard on the seat never woke up, i' faith. And
      so they came to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It so chanced, egad, that the devil sent Miss Tea Merchant to Bury to buy
      apples. She amused herself at playing country gentlewoman while papa
      worked all week in the city. She saw the cart in the market, and ate three
      (for she had the health of a barmaid), and bid in the load, and George
      with it. 'Pon my soul! she did. They found his boots first. And the lady
      said, before all the grinning Johns and Willums, that since she had bought
      him she supposed she would have to keep him. And, by Gads life! she has
      got him yet, which is a deal stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even the duke laughed. For, as Fox told it, the story was irresistible.
      But it came as near to being a wanton insult as a reference to his Grace's
      own episode might. The red came slowly back into his eye. Fox stared
      vacantly, as was his habit when he had done or said something especially
      daring. And Comyn and I waited, straining and expectant, like boys who
      have prodded a wild beast and stand ready for the spring. There was a
      metallic ring in the duke's voice as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard, Mr. Carvel, that you can ride any mount offered you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Od's, and so he can!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;I'll take oath on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will lay you an hundred guineas, my Lord,&rdquo; says his Grace, very
      off-hand, &ldquo;that Mr. Carvel does not sit Baltimore's Pollux above twenty
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; says Jack, before I could draw breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take your Grace for another hundred,&rdquo; calmly added Mr. Fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, your Grace,&rdquo; I cried, angry all at once, &ldquo;it seems to me
      that I am the one to whom you should address your wagers. I am not a
      jockey, to be put up at your whim, and to give you the chance to lose
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chartersea swung around my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; said he, very coolly, very politely; &ldquo;yours is
      the choice of the wager. And you reject it, the others must be called
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slife! I double it!&rdquo; I said hotly, &ldquo;provided the horse is alive, and will
      stand up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devilish well put, Richard!&rdquo; Mr. Fox exclaimed, casting off his
      restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my word the horse is alive, sir,&rdquo; he answered, with a mock
      bow; &ldquo;'twas only yesterday that he killed his groom, at Hampstead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few moments of silence followed this revelation. It was Charles Fox who
      spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make no doubt that your Grace, as a man of honour,&rdquo;&mdash;he emphasized
      the word forcibly,&mdash;&ldquo;will not refuse to ride the horse for another
      twenty minutes, provided Mr. Carvel is successful. And I will lay your
      Grace another hundred that you are thrown, or run away with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Truly, to cope with a wit like Mr. Fox's, the duke had need for a longer
      head. He grew livid as he perceived how neatly he had been snared in his
      own trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; he cried loudly; &ldquo;done, gentlemen. It only remains to hit upon
      time and place for the contest. I go to York to-morrow, to be back this
      day fortnight. And if you will do me the favour of arranging with
      Baltimore for the horse, I shall be obliged. I believe he intends selling
      it to Astley, the showman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are we to keep it?&rdquo; asks Mr. Fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am dealing with men of honour,&rdquo; says the duke, with a bow: &ldquo;I need have
      no better assurance that the horse will not be ridden in the interval.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Od so!&rdquo; said Comyn, when we were out; &ldquo;very handsome of him. But I would
      not say as much for his Grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Fox declared that the duke was no coward, but all other epithets
      known might be called him. &ldquo;A very diverting evening, Richard,&rdquo; said he;
      &ldquo;let's to your apartments and have a bowl, and talk it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thither we went.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not sleep much that night, but 'twas of Dolly I thought rather than
      of Chartersea. I was abroad early, and over to inquire in Arlington
      Street, where I found she had passed a good night. And I sent Banks
      a-hooting for some violets to send her, for I knew she loved that flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between ten and eleven Mr. Fox and Comyn and I set out for Baltimore
      House. When you go to London, my dears, you will find a vast difference in
      the neighbourhood of Bloomsbury from what it was that May morning in 1770.
      Great Russell Street was all a sweet fragrance of gardens, mingling with
      the smell of the fields from the open country to the north. We drove past
      red Montagu House with its stone facings and dome, like a French hotel,
      and the cluster of buildings at its great gate. It had been then for over
      a decade the British Museum. The ground behind it was a great resort for
      Londoners of that day. Many a sad affair was fought there, but on that
      morning we saw a merry party on their way to play prisoner's base.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we came to the gardens in front of Bedford House, which are now
      Bloomsbury Square. For my part I preferred this latter mansion to the
      French creation by its side, and admired its long and graceful lines. Its
      windows commanded a sweep from Holborn on the south to Highgate on the
      north. To the east of it, along Southampton Row, a few great houses had
      gone up or were building; and at the far end of that was Baltimore house,
      overlooking her Grace of Bedford's gardens. Beyond Lamb's Conduit Fields
      stretched away to the countryside.
    </p>
    <p>
      I own I had a lively curiosity to see that lordly ruler, the proprietor of
      our province, whose birthday we celebrated after his Majesty's. Had I not
      been in a great measure prepared, I should have had a revulsion indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he heard that Mr. Fox and my Lord Comyn were below stairs he gave
      orders to show them up to his bedroom, where he received us in a
      night-gown embroidered with oranges. My Lord Baltimore, alas! was not much
      to see. He did not make the figure a ruler should as he sat in his easy
      chair, and whined and cursed his Swiss. He was scarce a year over forty,
      and he had all but run his race. Dissipation and corrosion had set their
      seal upon him, had stamped his yellow face with crows' feet and blotted it
      with pimples. But then the glimpse of a fine gentleman just out of bed of
      a morning, before he is made for the day, is unfair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning, Charles! Howdy, Jack!&rdquo; said his Lordship, apathetically. &ldquo;Glad
      to know you, Mr. Carvel. Heard of your family. 'Slife! Wish there were
      more like 'em in the province.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sentiment not sitting very well upon his Lordship, I bowed, and said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye,&rdquo; he continued, pouring out his chocolate into the dish, &ldquo;I
      sent a damned rake of a parson out there some years gone. Handsome devil,
      too. Never seen his match with the women, egad. 'Od's fish&mdash;&rdquo; he
      leered. And then added with an oath and a nod and a vile remark: &ldquo;Married
      three times to my knowledge. Carried off dozen or so more. Some of 'em for
      me. Many a good night I've had with him. Drank between us one evening at
      Essex's gallon and half Champagne and Burgundy apiece. He got to know too
      much, y' know,&rdquo; he concluded, with a wicked wink. &ldquo;Had to buy him up pack
      him off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name, Fred?&rdquo; said Comyn, with a smile at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sdeath! That's it. Trouble to remember. Damned if I can think.&rdquo; And he
      repeated this remark over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allen?&rdquo; said Comyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Baltimore; &ldquo;Allen. And egad I think he'll find hell a hotter
      place than me. You know him, Mr. Carvel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied. I said no more. I make no reservations when I avow I was
      never so disgusted in my life. But as I looked upon him, haggard and worn,
      with retribution so neat at hand, I had no words to protest or condemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baltimore gave a hollow mirthless laugh, stopped short, and looked at
      Charles Fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse you, Charles! I suppose you are after that little matter I owe you
      for quinze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the little matter!&rdquo; said Fox. &ldquo;Come, get you perfumed and dressed,
      and order up some of your Tokay while we wait. I have to go to St.
      Stephens. Mr. Carvel has come to buy your horse Pollux. He has bet
      Chartersea two hundred guineas he rides him for twenty minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil he has!&rdquo; cried his Lordship, jaded no longer. &ldquo;Why, you must
      know, Mr. Carvel, there was no groom in my stables who would sit him until
      Foley made me a present of his man, Miller, who started to ride him to
      Hyde Park. As he came out of Great Russell Street, by gads life! the horse
      broke and ran out the Tottenham Court Road all the way to Hampstead. And
      the fiend picked out a big stone water trough and tossed Miller against
      it. Then they gathered up the fragments. Damme if I like to see suicide,
      Mr. Carvel. If Chartersea wants to kill you, let him try it in the fields
      behind Montagu House here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told his Lordship that I had made the wager, and could not in honour
      withdraw, though the horse had killed a dozen grooms. But already he
      seemed to have lost interest. He gave a languid pull at the velvet tassel
      on his bell-rope, ordered the wine; and, being informed that his anteroom
      below was full of people, had them all dismissed with the message that he
      was engaged upon important affairs. He told Mr. Fox he had heard of the
      Jerusalem Chamber, and vowed he would have a like institution. He told me
      he wished the colony of Maryland in hell; that he was worn out with the
      quarrels of Governor Eden and his Assembly, and offered to lay a guinea
      that the Governor's agent would get to him that day,&mdash;will-he,
      nill-he. I did not think it worth while to argue with such a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lord took three-quarters of an hour to dress, and swore he had not
      accomplished the feat so quickly in a year. He washed his hands and face
      in a silver basin, and the scent of the soap filled the room. He rated his
      Swiss for putting cinnamon upon his ruffles in place of attar of roses,
      and attempted to regale us the while with some of his choicest adventures.
      In more than one of these, by the way, his Grace of Chartersea figured. It
      was Fox who brought him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Baltimore,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'm not squeamish. But I'm cursed if I
      like to hear a man who may die any time between bottles talk so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship took the rebuke with an oath, and presently hobbled down the
      stairs of the great and silent house to the stable court, where two grooms
      were in waiting with the horse. He was an animal of amazing power, about
      sixteen hands, and dapple gray in colour. And it required no special
      knowledge to see that he had a devil inside him. It gleamed wickedly out
      of his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Od's life, Richard!&rdquo; cried Charles, &ldquo;he has a Jew nose; by all the seven
      tribes I bid you 'ware of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have but to ride him with a gold bit, Richard,&rdquo; said Comyn, &ldquo;and he
      is a kitten, I'll warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Pollux began to rear and kick, so that it took both the
      'ostlers to hold him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him a sovereign,&rdquo; suggested Fox. &ldquo;How do you feel, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never feared a horse yet,&rdquo; I said with perfect truth, &ldquo;nor do I fear
      this one, though I know he may kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll lay you twenty pounds you have at least one bone broken, and ten
      that you are killed,&rdquo; Baltimore puts in querulously, from the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do this, my Lord,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;If I ride him, he is mine. If he
      throws me, I give you twenty pounds for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen laughed, and Baltimore vowed he could sell the horse to
      Astley for fifty; that Pollux was the son of Renown, of the Duke of
      Kingston's stud, and much more. But Charles rallied him out by a reference
      to the debt at quinze, and an appeal to his honour as a sportsman. And
      swore he was discouraging one of the prettiest encounters that would take
      place in England for many a long day. And so the horse was sent to the
      stables of the White Horse Cellar, in Piccadilly, and left there at my
      order.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. A GLIMPSE OF MR. GARRICK
    </h2>
    <p>
      Day after day I went to Arlington Street, each time to be turned away with
      the same answer: that Miss Manners was a shade better, but still confined
      to her bed. You will scarce believe me, my dears, when I say that Mr.
      Marmaduke had gone at this crisis with his Grace to the York races. On the
      fourth morning, I think, I saw Mrs. Manners. She was much worn with the
      vigil she had kept, and received me with an apathy to frighten me. Her way
      with me had hitherto always been one of kindness and warmth. In answer to
      the dozen questions I showered upon her, she replied that Dorothy's malady
      was in no wise dangerous, so Dr. James had said, and undoubtedly arose out
      of the excitement of a London season. As I knew, Dorothy was of the kind
      that must run and run until she dropped. She had no notion of the measure
      of her own strength. Mrs. Manners hoped that, in a fortnight, she would be
      recovered sufficiently to be removed to one of the baths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wishes me to thank you for the flowers, Richard. She has them
      constantly by her. And bids me tell you how sorry she is that she is
      compelled to miss so much of your visit to England. Are you enjoying
      London, Richard? I hear that you are well liked by the best of company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left, prodigiously cast down, and went directly to Mr. Wedgwood's, to
      choose the prettiest set of tea-cups and dishes I could find there. I
      pitied Mrs. Manners from my heart, and made every allowance for her talk
      with me, knowing the sorrow of her life. Here was yet another link in the
      chain of the Chartersea evidence. And I made no doubt that Mr. Manner's
      brutal desertion at such a time must be hard to bear. I continued my
      visits of inquiry, nearly always meeting some person of consequence, or
      the footman of such, come on the same errand as myself. And once I
      encountered the young man she had championed against his Grace at Lady
      Tankerville's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than face the array of anxieties that beset me, I plunged
      recklessly into the gayeties&mdash;nay, the excesses&mdash;of Mr. Charles
      Fox and his associates. I paid, in truth, a very high price for my
      friendship with Mr. Fox. But, since it did not quite ruin me, I look back
      upon it as cheaply bought. To know the man well, to be the subject of his
      regard, was to feel an infatuation in common with the little band of
      worshippers which had come with him from Eton. They remained faithful to
      him all his days, nor adversity nor change of opinion could shake their
      attachment. They knew his faults, deplored them, and paid for them. And
      this was not beyond my comprehension, tho' many have wondered at it. Did
      he ask me for five hundred pounds,&mdash;which he did,&mdash;I gave it
      freely, and would gladly have given more, tho' I saw it all wasted in a
      night when the dice rolled against him. For those honoured few of whom I
      speak likewise knew his virtues, which were quite as large as the faults,
      albeit so mingled with them that all might not distinguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      I attended some of the routs and parties, to all of which, as a young
      colonial gentleman of wealth and family, I was made welcome. I went to a
      ball at Lord Stanley's, a mixture of French horns and clarionets and
      coloured glass lanthorns and candles in gilt vases, and young ladies
      pouring tea in white, and musicians in red, and draperies and flowers ad
      libitum. There I met Mr. Walpole, looking on very critically. He was the
      essence of friendliness, asked after my equerry, and said I had done well
      to ship him to America. At the opera, with Lord Ossory and Mr.
      Fitzpatrick, I talked through the round of the boxes, from Lady Pembroke's
      on the right to Lady Hervey's on the left, where Dolly's illness and Lady
      Harrington's snuffing gabble were the topics rather than Giardini's
      fiddling. Mr. Storer took me to Foote's dressing-room at the Haymarket,
      where we found the Duke of Cumberland lounging. I was presented, and
      thought his Royal Highness had far less dignity than the monkey-comedian
      we had come to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must not forget the visit I made to Drury Lane Playhouse with my Lords
      Carlisle and Grantham and Comyn. The great actor received me graciously in
      such a company, you may be sure. He appeared much smaller off the boards
      than on, and his actions and speech were quick and nervous. Gast, his
      hairdresser, was making him up for the character of Richard III.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ods!&rdquo; said Mr. Garrick, &ldquo;your Lordships come five minutes too late.
      Goldsmith is but just gone hence, fresh from his tailor, Filby, of Water
      Lane. The most gorgeous creature in London, gentlemen, I'll be sworn. He
      is even now, so he would have me know, gone by invitation to my Lord
      Denbigh's box, to ogle the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you seen your latest lampoon, Mr. Garrick?&rdquo; asks Comyn, winking
      at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up leaps Mr. Garrick, so suddenly as to knock the paint-pot from Gast's
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, your Lordship jests, surely!&rdquo; he cried, his voice shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jests!&rdquo; says my Lord, very serious; &ldquo;do I jest, Carlisle?&rdquo; And turning to
      Mr. Cross, the prompter, who stood by, &ldquo;Fetch me the St. James's Evening
      Post,&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ods my life!&rdquo; continues poor Garrick, almost in tears; &ldquo;I have loaned
      Foote upwards of two thousand pounds. And last year, as your Lordship
      remembers, took charge of his theatre when his leg was cut off. 'Pon my
      soul, I cannot account for his ingratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis not Foote,&rdquo; says Carlisle, biting his lip; &ldquo;I know Foote's mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Johnson,&rdquo; says the actor, &ldquo;because I would not let him have my fine
      books in his dirty den to be kicked about the floor, but put my library at
      his disposal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nor Johnson. Nor yet Macklin nor Murphy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely not&mdash;&rdquo; cries Mr. Garrick, turning white under the rouge. The
      name remained unpronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, Junius, in the Evening Post. He has fastened upon you at last,&rdquo;
       answers Comyn, taking the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sdeath! Garrick,&rdquo; Carlisle puts in, very solemn, &ldquo;what have you done to
      offend the Terrible Unknown? Talebearing to his Majesty, I'll warrant! I
      gave you credit for more discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words Mr. Garrick seized the chair for support, and swung heavily
      into it. Whereat the young lords burst into such a tempest of laughter
      that I could not refrain from joining them. As for Mr. Garrick, he was so
      pleased to have escaped that he laughed too, though with a palpable
      nervousness.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [Note by the editor. It was not long after this that Mr. Garrick's
   punishment came, and for the self-same offence.]
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye, Garrick,&rdquo; Carlisle remarked slyly, when he had recovered,
      &ldquo;Mrs. Crewe was vastly taken with the last 'vers' you left on her
      dressing-table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she, now, my Lord?&rdquo; said the great actor, delighted, but scarce over
      his fright. &ldquo;You must know that I have writ one to my Lady Carlisle, on
      the occasion of her dropping her fan in Piccadilly.&rdquo; Whereupon he
      proceeded to recite it, and my Lord Carlisle, being something of a poet
      himself, pronounced it excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Garrick asked me many questions concerning American life and manners,
      having a play in his repertory the scene of which was laid in New York. In
      the midst of this we were interrupted by a dirty fellow who ran in, crying
      excitedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, the Archbishop of York is getting drunk at the Bear, and swears
      he'll be d&mdash;d if he'll act to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The archbishop may go to the devil!&rdquo; snapped Mr. Garrick. &ldquo;I do not know
      a greater rascal, except yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was little short of thunderstruck. But presently Mr. Garrick added
      complainingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I paid a guinea for the archbishop, but the fellow got me three murderers
      to-day and the best alderman I ever clapped eyes upon. So we are square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the play we supped with him at his new house in Adelphi Terrace,
      next Topham Beauclerk's. 'Twas handsomely built in the Italian style, and
      newly furnished throughout, for Mr. Garrick travelled now with a coach and
      six and four menservants, forsooth. And amongst other things he took pride
      in showing us that night was a handsome snuffbox which the King of Denmark
      had given him the year before, his Majesty's portrait set in jewels
      thereon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the news of the trial of Lord Baltimore's horse began to be
      noised about, and was followed by a deluge of wagers at Brooks's and
      White's and elsewhere. Comyn and Fox, my chief supporters, laid large sums
      upon me, despite all my persuasion. But the most unpleasant part of the
      publicity was the rumour that the match was connected with the struggle
      for Miss Manners's hand. I was pressed with invitations to go into the
      country to ride this or that horse. His Grace the Duke of Grafton had a
      mount he would have me try at Wakefield Lodge, and was far from pleasant
      over my refusal of his invitation. I was besieged by young noblemen like
      Lord Derby and Lord Foley, until I was heartily sick of notoriety, and
      cursed the indiscretion of the person who let out the news, and my own
      likewise. My Lord March, who did me the honour to lay one hundred pounds
      upon my skill, insisted that I should make one of a party to the famous
      amphitheatre near Lambeth. Mr. Astley, the showman, being informed of his
      Lordship's intention, met us on Westminster Bridge dressed in his uniform
      as sergeant major of the Royal Light Dragoons and mounted on a white
      charger. He escorted us to one of the large boxes under the pent-house
      reserved for the gentry. And when the show was over and the place cleared,
      begged, that I would ride his Indian Chief. I refused; but March pressed
      me, and Comyn declared he had staked his reputation upon my horsemanship.
      Astley was a large man, about my build, and I donned a pair of his leather
      breeches and boots, and put Indian Chief to his paces around the ring. I
      found him no more restive, nor as much so, as Firefly. The gentlemen were
      good enough to clap me roundly, and Astley vowed (no doubt because of the
      noble patrons present) that he had never seen a better seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all repaired afterwards for supper to Don Saltero's Coffee House and
      Museum in Chelsea. And I remembered having heard my grandfather speak of
      the place, and tell how he had seen Sir Richard Steele there, listening to
      the Don scraping away at the &ldquo;Merry Christ Church Bells&rdquo; on his fiddle.
      The Don was since dead, but King James's coronation sword and King Henry
      VIII.'s coat of mail still hung on the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remembrance of that fortnight has ever been an appalling one. Mr.
      Carvel had never attempted to teach me the value of money. My grandfather,
      indeed, held but four things essential to the conduct of life; namely, to
      fear God, love the King, pay your debts, and pursue your enemies. There
      was no one in London to advise me, Comyn being but a wild lad like myself.
      But my Lord Carlisle gave me a friendly warning:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care, Carvel,&rdquo; said he, kindly, &ldquo;or you will run your grandfather
      through, and all your relations beside. I little realized the danger of it
      when I first came up.&rdquo; (He was not above two and twenty then.) &ldquo;And now I
      have a wife, am more crippled than I care to be, thanks to this devilish
      high play. Will you dine with Lady Carlisle in St. James's Place next
      Friday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart went out to this young nobleman. Handsome he was, as a picture.
      And he knew better than most of your fine gentlemen how to put a check on
      his inclinations. As a friend he had few equals, his purse being ever at
      the command of those he loved. And his privations on Fox's account were
      already greater than many knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a call, too, from Mr. Dix. I found him in my parlour one morning,
      cringing and smiling, and, as usual, half an hour away from his point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warrant you, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;there are few young gentlemen not
      born among the elect that make the great friends you are blessed with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been fortunate, Mr. Dix,&rdquo; I replied dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunate!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;good Lord, sir! I hear of you everywhere with Mr.
      Fox, and you have been to Astley's with my Lord March. And I have a draft
      from you at Ampthill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vastly well manoeuvred, Mr. Dix,&rdquo; I said, laughing at the guilty change
      in his pink complexion. &ldquo;And hence you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fidgeted, and seeing that I paid him no attention, but went on with my
      chocolate, he drew a paper from his pocket and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have spent a prodigious sum, sir, for so short a time,&rdquo; said he,
      unsteadily. &ldquo;'Tis very well for you, Mr. Carvel, but I have to remember
      that you are heir only. I am advancing you money without advices from his
      Worship, your grandfather. A most irregular proceeding, sir, and one
      likely to lead me to trouble. I know not what your allowance may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, Mr. Dix,&rdquo; I replied, unreasonably enough. &ldquo;To speak truth, I have
      never had one. You have my Lord Comyn's signature to protect you,&rdquo; I went
      on ill-naturedly, for I had not had enough sleep. &ldquo;And in case Mr. Carvel
      protests, which is unlikely and preposterous, you shall have ten percentum
      on your money until I can pay you. That should be no poor investment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He apologized. But he smoothed out the paper on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only right to tell you, Mr. Carvel, that you have spent one
      thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven odd pounds, in home money, which
      is worth more than your colonial. Your grandfather's balance with me was
      something less than one thousand five hundred, as I made him a remittance
      in December last. I have advanced the rest. And yesterday,&rdquo; he went on,
      resolutely for him, &ldquo;yesterday I got an order for five hundred more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he handed me the paper. I must own that the figures startled me. I
      laid it down with a fine show of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you wish me to stop drawing? Very good, Mr. Dix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He must have seen some threat implied, though I meant none. He was my very
      humble servant at once, and declared he had called only to let me know
      where I stood. Then he bowed himself out, wishing me luck with the horse
      he had heard of, and I lighted my pipe with his accompt.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. THE SERPENTINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whether it was Mr. Dix. that started me reflecting, or my Lord Carlisle's
      warning, or a few discreet words from young Lady Carlisle herself, I know
      not. At all events, I made a resolution to stop high play, and confine
      myself to whist and quinze and picquet. For I conceived a notion, enlarged
      by Mr. Fox, that I had more than once fallen into the tender clutches of
      the hounds. I was so reflecting the morning following Lord Carlisle's
      dinner, when Banks announced a footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Manners's man, sir,&rdquo; he added significantly, and handed me a little
      note. I seized it, and, to hide my emotion, told him to give the man his
      beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writing was Dorothy's, and some time passed after I had torn off the
      wrapper before I could compose myself to read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Sir, the Moment I am too ill to watch you you must needs lapse into
      Wilde &amp; Flity Doings, for thus y'rs are call'd even in London. Never
      Mind how y'r Extravigancies are come to my Ears Sir. One Matter I have
      herd that I am Most Concerned about, &amp; I pray you, my Dear Richard do
      not allow y'r Recklessness &amp; Contemt for Danger to betray you into a
      Stil more Amazing Follie or I shall be very Miserable Indeed. I have Hopes
      that the Report is at Best a Rumour &amp; you must sit down &amp; write me
      that it is Sir that my Minde may be set at Rest. I fear for you Vastly
      &amp; I beg you not Riske y'r Life Foolishly &amp; this for the Sake of
      one who subscribes herself y'r Old Playmate &amp; Well-Wisher Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S. I have writ Sir Jon Fielding to put you in the Marshallsee or New
      Gate until Mr. Carvel can be tolde. I am Better &amp; hope soon to see you
      agen &amp; have been informed of y'r Dayly Visitts &amp; y'r Flowers are
      beside me. D. M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In about an hour and a half, Mr. Marmaduke's footman was on his way back
      to Arlington Street in a condition not to be lightly spoken of. During
      that period I had committed an hundred silly acts, and incidentally
      learned the letter by heart. I was much distressed to think that she had
      heard of the affair of the horse, and more so to surmise that the gossip
      which clung to it must also have reached her. But I fear I thought most of
      her anxiety concerning me, which reflection caused my hand to shake from
      very happiness. &ldquo;Y'r Flowers are beside me,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;I beg you not Riske y'r
      Life Foolishly,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I shall be very Miserable Indeed&rdquo; But then: &ldquo;Y'r Old
      Plamate &amp; Well Wisher&rdquo;! Nay, she was inscrutable as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      And my reply,&mdash;what was that to be? How I composed it in the state of
      mind I was in, I have no conception to this day. The chimney was clogged
      with papers ere (in a spelling to vie with Dolly's) I had set down my
      devotion, my undying devotion, to her interests. I asked forgiveness for
      my cruelty on that memorable morning I had last seen her. But even to
      allude to the bet with Chartersea was beyond my powers; and as for
      renouncing it, though for her sake,&mdash;that was not to be thought of.
      The high play I readily promised to avoid in the future, and I signed
      myself,&mdash;well, it matters not after seventy years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day, Tuesday, I received a letter from his Grace of Chartersea
      saying that he looked to reach London that night, but very late. He begged
      that Mr. Fox and Lord Comyn and I would sup with him at the Star and
      Garter at eleven, to fix matters for the trial on the morrow. Mr. Fox
      could not go, but Comyn and I went to the inn, having first attended &ldquo;The
      Tempest&rdquo; at Drury Lane with Lady Di and Mr. Beauclerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found his Grace awaiting us in a private room, with Captain Lewis, of
      the 60th Foot, who had figured as a second in the duel with young Atwater.
      The captain was a rake and a bully and a toadeater, of course, with a loud
      and profane tongue, and he had had a bottle too many in the duke's
      travelling-coach. There was likewise a Sir John Brooke, a country
      neighbour of his Grace in Nottinghamshire. Sir John apparently had no
      business in such company. He was a hearty, fox-hunting squire who had seen
      little of London; a three-bottle man who told a foul story and went asleep
      immediately afterwards. Much to my disappointment, Mr. Manners had gone to
      Arlington Street direct. I had longed for a chance to speak a little of my
      mind to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This meeting, which I shall not take the time to recount, was near to
      ending in an open breach of negotiations. His Grace had lost money at
      York, and more to Lewis on the way to London. He was in one of his vicious
      humours. He insisted that Hyde Park should be the place of the contest. In
      vain did Comyn and I plead for some less public spot on account of the
      disagreeable advertisement the matter had received. His Grace would be
      damned before he would yield; and Lewis, adding a more forcible
      contingency, hinted that our side feared a public trial. Comyn presently
      shut him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ride the horse after his Grace is thrown,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and I agree
      to get on after and he does not kill you. 'Sdeath! I am not of the army,&rdquo;
       adds my Lord, cuttingly; &ldquo;I am a seaman, and not supposed to know a
      stirrup from a snaffle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Od's blood!&rdquo; yelled the captain, &ldquo;you question my horsemanship, my Lord?
      Do I understand your Lordship to question my courage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After I am thrown!&rdquo; cries his Grace, very ugly, and fingering the jewels
      on his hilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John was awakened by the noise, and turning heavily spilled the whole
      of a pint of port on the duke's satin waist coat and breeches. Whereat
      Chartersea in a rage flung the bottle at his head with a curse, which it
      seems was a habit with his Grace. But the servants coming in, headed by my
      old friend the chamberlain, they quieted down. And it was presently agreed
      that the horse was to be at noon in the King's Old Road, or Rotten Row (as
      it was then beginning to be called), in Hyde Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall carry to the grave the memory of the next day. I was up betimes,
      and over to the White Horse Cellar to see Pollux groomed, where I found a
      crowd about the opening into the stable court. &ldquo;The young American!&rdquo;
       called some one, and to my astonishment and no small annoyance I was
      greeted with a &ldquo;Huzzay for you, sir!&rdquo; &ldquo;My groat's on your honour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This good-will was owing wholly to the duke's unpopularity with all
      classes. Inside, sporting gentlemen in hunting-frocks of red and green,
      and velvet visored caps, were shouldering favoured 'ostlers from the
      different noblemen's stables; and there was a liberal sprinkling of the
      characters who attended the cock mains in Drury Lane and at Newmarket. At
      the moment of my arrival the head 'ostler was rubbing down the stallion's
      flank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's ten pounds to ride him, Saunders!&rdquo; called one of the
      hunting-frocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; sniffed the 'ostler; &ldquo;ride 'im is it, yere honour? Two hunner
      beast eno', an' a Portugal crown i' th' boot. Sooner take me chaunces o'
      Tyburn on 'Ounslow 'Eath. An' Miller waurna able to sit 'im, 'tis no for
      th' likes o' me to try. Th' bloody devil took th' shirt off Teddy's back
      this morn. I adwises th' young Buckskin t' order 's coffin.&rdquo; Just then he
      perceived me, and touched his cap, something abashed. &ldquo;With submission,
      sir, y'r honour'll take an old man's adwise an' not go near 'im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pollux's appearance, indeed, was not calculated to reassure me. He looked
      ugly to exaggeration, his ears laid back and his nostrils as big as
      crowns, and his teeth bared time and time. Now and anon an impatient fling
      of his hoof would make the grooms start away from him. Since coming to the
      inn he had been walked a couple of miles each day, with two men with
      loaded whips to control him. I was being offered a deal of counsel, when
      big Mr. Astley came in from Lambeth, and silenced them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These grooms, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he said to me, as we took a bottle in private
      inside, &ldquo;these grooms are the very devil for superstition. And once a
      horse gets a bad name with them, good-by to him. Miller knew how to ride,
      of course, but like many another of them, was too damned over-confident. I
      warned him more than once for getting young horses into a fret, and I'm
      willing to lay a ten-pound note that he angered Pollux. 'Od's life! He is
      a vicious beast. So was his father, Culloden, before him. But here's luck
      to you, sir!&rdquo; says Mr. Astley, tipping his glass; &ldquo;having seen you ride,
      egad! I have put all the money I can afford in your favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I left him he had given me several valuable hints as to the manner
      of managing that kind of a horse: not to auger him with the spurs unless
      it became plain that he meant to kill me; to try persuasion first and
      force afterwards; and secondly, he taught me a little trick of twisting
      the bit which I have since found very useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the White Horse, I was followed into Piccadilly by the crowd,
      until I was forced to take refuge in a hackney chaise. The noise of the
      affair had got around town, and I was heartily sorry I had not taken the
      other and better method of trying conclusions with the duke, and slapped
      his face. I found Jack Comyn in Dover Street, and presently Mr. Fox came
      for us with his chestnuts in his chaise, Fitzpatrick with him. At Hyde
      Park Corner there was quite a jam of coaches, chaises, and cabriolets and
      beribboned phaetons, which made way for us, but kept us busy bowing as we
      passed among them. It seemed as if everybody of consequence that I had met
      in London was gathered there. One face I missed, and rejoiced that she was
      absent, for I had a degraded feeling like that of being the favourite in a
      cudgel-bout. And the thought that her name was connected with all this
      made my face twitch. I heard the people clapping and saw them waving in
      the carriages as we passed, and some stood forward before the rest in a
      haphazard way, without rhyme or reason. Mr. Walpole with Lady Di
      Beauclerk, and Mr. Storer and Mr. Price and Colonel St. John, and Lord and
      Lady Carlisle and Lady Ossory. These I recognized. Inside, the railing
      along the row was lined with people. And there stood Pollux, bridled, with
      a blanket thrown over his great back and chest, surrounded still by the
      hunting-frocks, who had followed him from the White Horse. Mixed in with
      these, swearing, conjecturing, and betting, were some to surprise me,
      whose names were connected with every track in England: the Duke of
      Grafton and my Lords Sandwich and March and Bolingbroke, and Sir Charles
      Bunbury, and young Lords Derby and Foley, who, after establishing separate
      names for folly on the tracks, went into partnership. My Lord Baltimore
      descended listlessly from his cabriolet to join the group. They all sang
      out when they caught sight of our party, and greeted me with a zeal to
      carry me off my feet. And my Lord Sandwich, having done me the honour to
      lay something very handsome upon me, had his chief jockey on hand to give
      me some final advice. I believe I was the coolest of any of them. And at
      that time of all others the fact came up to me with irresistible humour
      that I, a young colonial Whig, who had grown up to detest these people,
      should be rubbing noses with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke put in an appearance five minutes before the hour, upon a bay
      gelding, and attended by Lewis and Sir John Brooke, both mounted. As a
      most particular evidence of the detestation in which Chartersea was held,
      he could find nothing in common with such notorious rakes as March and
      Sandwich. And it fell to me to champion these. After some discussion
      between Fox and Captain Lewis, March was chosen umpire. His Lordship took
      his post in the middle of the Row, drew forth an enamelled repeater from
      his waistcoat, and mouthed out the conditions of the match,&mdash;the
      terms, as he said, being private.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready, Mr. Carvel?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, my Lord,&rdquo; I answered. The bells were pealing noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then mount, sir,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voices of the people dropped to a hum that brought to mind the long
      forgotten sound of the bees swarming in the garden by the Chesapeake. My
      breath began to come quickly. Through the sunny haze I saw the cows and
      deer grazing by the Serpentine, and out of the back of my eye
      handkerchiefs floated from the carriages banked at the gate. They took the
      blanket off the stallion. Stall-fed, and excited by the crowd, he looked
      brutal indeed. The faithful Banks, in a new suit of the Carvel livery,
      held the stirrup, and whispered a husky &ldquo;God keep you, sir!&rdquo; Suddenly I
      was up. The murmur was hushed, and the Park became still as a peaceful
      farm in Devonshire. The grooms let go of the stallion's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood trembling like the throes of death. I gripped my knees as Captain
      Daniel had taught me, years ago, when some invisible force impelled me to
      look aside. From between the broad and hunching shoulders of Chartersea I
      met such a venomous stare as a cattle-fish might use to freeze his prey.
      Cattle&mdash;fish! The word kept running over my tongue. I thought of the
      snaky arms that had already caught Mr. Marmaduke, and were soon, perhaps,
      to entangle Dorothy. She had begged me not to ride, and I was risking a
      life which might save hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind rushing in my ears and beating against my face awoke me all at
      once. The trees ran madly past, and the water at my right was a silver
      blur. The beast beneath me snorted as he rose and fell. Fainter and
      fainter dropped the clamour behind me, which had risen as I started, and
      the leaps grew longer and longer. Then my head was cleared like a steamed
      window-pane in a cold blast. I saw the road curve in front of me, I put
      all my strength into the curb, and heeling at a fearful angle was swept
      into the busy Kensington Road. For the first time I knew what it was to
      fear a horse. The stallion's neck was stretched, his shoes rang on the
      cobbles, and my eyes were fixed on a narrow space between carriages coming
      together. In a flash I understood why the duke had insisted upon Hyde
      Park, and that nerved me some. I saw the frightened coachmen pulling their
      horses this way and that, I heard the cries of the foot-passengers, and
      then I was through, I know not how. Once more I summoned all my power,
      recalled the twist Astley had spoken of, and tried it. I bent his neck for
      an inch of rein. Next I got another inch, and then came a taste&mdash;the
      smallest taste&mdash;of mastery like elixir. The motion changed with it,
      became rougher, and the hoof-beats a fraction less frequent. He steered
      like a ship with sail reduced. In and out we dodged among the wagons, and
      I was beginning to think I had him, when suddenly, without a move of
      warning, he came down rigid with his feet planted together, and only a
      miracle and my tight grip restrained me from shooting over his head. There
      he stood shaking and snorting, nor any persuasion would move him. I
      resorted at last to the spurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was up in the air in an instant, and came down across the road. Again I
      dug in to the rowels, and clung the tighter, and this time he landed with
      his head to London. A little knot of people had collected to watch me, and
      out stepped a strapping fellow in the King's scarlet, from the Guard's
      Horse near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold him, sir!&rdquo; he said, tipping. &ldquo;Better dismount, sir. He means murder,
      y'r honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep clear, curse you!&rdquo; I cried, waving him off. &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped back, no doubt thinking me mad. Some one spoke up and said it
      was five minutes past noon. I had the grace to thank him, I believe. To my
      astonishment I had been gone but four minutes; they had seemed twenty.
      Looking about me, I found I was in the open space before old Kensington
      Church, over against the archway there. Once more I dug in the spurs, this
      time with success. Almost at a jump the beast took me into the angle of
      posts to the east of the churchyard gate and tore up the footpath of
      Church Lane, terrified men and women ahead of me taking to the kennel. He
      ran irregularly, now on the side of the posts, now against the bricks, and
      then I gave myself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven put a last expedient into my head, that I had once heard Mr. Dulany
      speak of. I braced myself for a pull that should have broken the
      stallion's jaw and released his mouth altogether. Incredible as it may
      seem, he jarred into a trot, and presently came down to a walk, tossing
      his head like fury, and sweating at every pore. I leaned over and patted
      him, speaking him fair, and (marvel of marvels!) when we had got to the
      dogs that guard the entrance of Camden House I had coaxed him around and
      into the street, and cantered back at easy speed to the church. Without
      pausing to speak to the bunch that stood at the throat of the lane, I
      started toward London, thankfulness and relief swelling within me. I
      understood the beast, and spoke to him when he danced aside at a wagon
      with bells or a rattling load of coals, and checked him with a word and a
      light hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I gained the Life Guard's House I met a dozen horsemen, amongst
      them Banks on a mount of Mr. Fox's. They shouted when they saw me, Colonel
      St. John calling out that he had won another hundred that I was not dead.
      Sir John Brooke puffed and swore he did not begrudge his losses to see me
      safe, despite Captain Lewis's sourness. Storey vowed he would give a
      dinner in my honour, and, riding up beside me, whispered that he was
      damned sorry the horse was now broken, and his Grace's chance of being
      killed taken away. And thus escorted, I came in by the King's New Road to
      avoid the people running in the Row, and so down to Hyde Park Corner, and
      in among the chaises and the phaetons, where there was enough cheering and
      waving of hats and handkerchiefs to please the most exacting of successful
      generals. I rode up to my Lord March, and finding there was a minute yet
      to run I went up the Row a distance and back again amidst more huzzaing,
      Pollux prancing and quivering, and frothing his bit, but never once
      attempting to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had got down, they pressed around me until I could scarce breathe,
      crying congratulations, Comyn embracing me openly. Mr. Fox vowed he had
      never seen so fine a sight, and said many impolitic things which the duke
      must have overheard.... Lady Carlisle sent me a red rose for my buttonhole
      by his Lordship. Mr. Warner, the lively parson with my Lord March, desired
      to press my hand, declaring that he had won a dozen of port upon me, which
      he had set his best cassock against. My Lord Sandwich offered me snuff,
      and invited me to Hichinbroke. Indeed, I should never be through were I to
      continue. But I must not forget my old acquaintance Mr. Walpole, who
      protested that he must get permission to present me to Princess Amelia:
      that her Royal Highness would not rest content now, until she had seen me.
      I did not then know her Highness's sporting propensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then my Lord March called upon the duke, who stood in the midst of an army
      of his toadeaters. I almost pitied him then, tho' I could not account for
      the feeling. I think it was because a nobleman with so great a title
      should be so cordially hated and despised. There were high words along the
      railing among the duke's supporters, Captain Lewis, in his anger, going
      above an inference that the stallion had been broken privately. Chartersea
      came forward with an indifferent swagger, as if to say as much: and, in
      truth, no one looked for more sport, and some were even turning away. He
      had scarce put foot to the stirrup, when the surprise came. Two minutes
      were up before he was got in the saddle, Pollux rearing and plunging and
      dancing in a circle, the grooms shouting and dodging, and his Grace
      cursing in a voice to wake the dead and Mr. Fox laughing, and making small
      wagers that he would never be mounted. But at last the duke was up and
      gripped, his face bloody red, giving vent to his fury with the spurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then something happened, and so quickly that it cannot be writ fast
      enough. Pollux bolted like a shot out of a sling, vaulted the railing as
      easily as you or I would hop over a stick, and galloping across the lawn
      and down the embankment flung his Grace into the Serpentine. Precisely, as
      Mr. Fox afterwards remarked, as the swine with the evil spirits ran down
      the slope into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      An indescribable bedlam of confusion followed, lords and gentlemen,
      tradesmen and grooms, hostlers and apprentices, all tumbling after, many
      crying with laughter. My Lord Sandwich's jockey pulled his Grace from the
      water in a most pitiable state of rage and humiliation. His side curls
      gone, the powder and pomatum washed from his hair, bedraggled and muddy
      and sputtering oaths, he made his way to Lord March, swearing by all
      divine that a trick was put on him, that he would ride the stallion to
      Land's End. His Lordship, pulling his face straight, gravely informed the
      duke that the match was over. With this his Grace fell flatly sullen, was
      pushed into a coach by Sir John and the captain, and drove rapidly off
      Kensington way, to avoid the people at the corner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. IN WHICH I AM ROUNDLY BROUGHT TO TASK
    </h2>
    <p>
      I would have gone to Arlington Street direct, but my friends had no notion
      of letting me escape. They carried me off to Brooks's Club, where a bowl
      of punch was brewed directly, and my health was drunk to three times
      three. Mr. Storer commanded a turtle dinner in my honour. We were not
      many, fortunately,&mdash;only Mr. Fox's little coterie. And it was none
      other than Mr. Fox who made the speech of the evening. &ldquo;May I be strung as
      high as Haman,&rdquo; said he, amid a tempest of laughter, &ldquo;if ever I saw half
      so edifying a sight as his Grace pitching into the Serpentine, unless it
      were his Grace dragged out again. Mr. Carvel's advent has been a Godsend
      to us narrow ignoramuses of this island, gentlemen. To the Englishmen of
      our colonies, sirs, and that we may never underrate or misunderstand them
      more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Charles,&rdquo; cried my Lord Comyn. &ldquo;Where is our gallantry? I give you
      first the Englishwomen of our colonies, and in particular the pride of
      Maryland, who has brought back to the old country all the graces of the
      new,&mdash;Miss Manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was drowned by a deafening shout, and we charged our glasses to
      drain them brimming. And then we all went to Drury Lane to see Mrs. Clive
      romp through 'The Wonder' in the spirit of the &ldquo;immortal Peg.&rdquo; She spoke
      an epilogue that Mr. Walpole had writ especial for her, and made some
      witty and sarcastic remarks directed at the gentlemen in our stagebox. We
      topped off a very full day by a supper at the Bedford Arms, where I must
      draw the certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning I was abed at an hour which the sobriety of old age makes
      me blush abed think of. Banks had just concluded a discreet discourse upon
      my accomplishment of the day before, and had left for my newspapers, when
      he came running back with the information that Miss Manners would see my
      honour that day. There was no note. Between us we made my toilet in a
      jiffy, and presently I was walking in at the Manners's door in an amazing
      hurry, and scarcely waited for a direction. But as I ran up the stairs, I
      heard the tinkle of the spinet, and the notes of an old, familiar tune
      fell upon my ears. The words rose in my head with the cadence.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Love me little, love me long,
          Is the burthen of my song,
          Love that is too hot and strong
          Runneth soon to waste.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      That simple air, already mellowed by an hundred years, had always been her
      favourite. She used to sing it softly to herself as we roamed the woods
      and fields of the Eastern Shore. Instinctively I paused at the
      dressing-room door. Nay, my dears, you need not cry out, such was the
      custom of the times. A dainty bower it was, filled with the perfume of
      flowers, and rosy cupids disporting on the ceiling; and china and silver
      and gold filigree strewn about, with my tea-cups on the table. The
      sunlight fell like a halo round Dorothy's head, her hands strayed over the
      keys, and her eyes were far away. She had not heard me. I remember her
      dress,&mdash;a silk with blue cornflowers on a light ground, and the
      flimsiest of lace caps resting on her hair. I thought her face paler; but
      beyond that she did not show her illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, and perceived me, I thought, with a start. &ldquo;So it is you!&rdquo;
       she said demurely enough; &ldquo;you are come at last to give an account of
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you better, Dorothy?&rdquo; I asked earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you think that I have been ill?&rdquo; she replied, her fingers
      going back to the spinet. &ldquo;It is a mistake, sir. Dr. James has given me
      near a gross of his infamous powders, and is now exploiting another cure.
      I have been resting from the fatigues of London, while you have been
      wearing yourself out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. James himself told me your condition was serious,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;the worse the disease, the more remarkable the
      cure, the more sought after the physician. When will you get over your
      provincial simplicity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw there was nothing to be got out of her while in this baffling
      humour. I wondered what devil impelled a woman to write one way and talk
      another. In her note to me she had confessed her illness. The words I had
      formed to say to her were tied on my tongue. But on the whole I
      congratulated myself. She knew how to step better than I, and there were
      many awkward things between us of late best not spoken of. But she kept me
      standing an unconscionable time without a word, which on the whole was
      cruelty, while she played over some of Dibdin's ballads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in a hurry, sir,&rdquo; she asked at length, turning on me with a
      smile, &ldquo;are you in a hurry to join my Lord March or his Grace of Grafton?
      And have you writ Captain Clapsaddle and your Whig friends at home of your
      new intimacies, of Mr. Fox and my Lord Sandwich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you must be wishing to get away,&rdquo; she continued cruelly, picking up
      the newspaper. &ldquo;I had forgotten this notice. When I saw it this morning I
      thought of you, and despaired of a glimpse of you to-day.&rdquo; (Reading.) &ldquo;At
      the Three Hats, Islington, this day, the 10th of May, will be played a
      grand match at that ancient and much renowned manly diversion called
      Double Stick by a sect of chosen young men at that exercise from different
      parts of the West Country, for two guineas given free; those who break the
      most heads to bear away the prize. Before the above-mentioned diversion
      begins, Mr. Sampson and his young German will display alternately on one,
      two, and three horses, various surprising and curious feats of famous
      horsemanship in like manner as at the Grand Jubilee at
      Stratford-upon-Avon. Admittance one shilling each person.' Before you
      leave, Mr. Richard,&rdquo; she continued, with her eyes still on the sheet, &ldquo;I
      should like to talk over one or two little matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolly&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sit, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat down uneasily, expecting the worst. She disappointed me, as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an unspeakable place must you keep in Dover Street! I cannot send
      even a footman there but what he comes back reeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had to laugh at this. But there was no smile out of my lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It took me near an hour and a half to answer your note,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And 'twas a masterpiece!&rdquo; exclaimed Dolly, with withering sarcasm; &ldquo;oh, a
      most amazing masterpiece, I'll be bound! His worship the French Ambassador
      is a kitten at diplomacy beside you, sir. An hour and a half, did you say,
      sir? Gemini, the Secretary of State and his whole corps could not have
      composed the like in a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith!&rdquo; I cried, with feeling enough; &ldquo;and if that is diplomacy, I would
      rather make leather breeches than be given an embassy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fixed her eyes upon me so disconcertingly that mine fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a time,&rdquo; she said, with a change of tone, &ldquo;there was a time
      when a request of mine, and it were not granted outright, would have
      received some attention. This is my first experience at being ignored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had made a wager,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and could not retract with honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you had made a wager! Now we are to have some news at last. How stupid
      of you, Richard, not to tell me before. I confess I wonder what these wits
      find in your company. Here am I who have seen naught but dull women for a
      fortnight, and you have failed to say anything amusing in a quarter of an
      hour. Let us hear about the wager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is little to tell,&rdquo; I answered shortly, considerably piqued. &ldquo;I bet
      your friend, the Duke of Chartersea, some hundreds of pounds I could ride
      Lord Baltimore's Pollux for twenty minutes, after which his Grace was to
      get on and ride twenty more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you see the duke?&rdquo; Dolly interrupted, without much show of
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I explained how we had met him at Brooks's, and had gone to his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went to his house?&rdquo; she repeated, raising her eyebrows a trifle; &ldquo;and
      Comyn and Mr. Fox? And pray, how did this pretty subject come up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I related, very badly, I fear, Fox's story of young Wrottlesey and the
      tea-merchant's daughter. And what does my lady do but get up and turn her
      back, arranging some pinks in the window. I could have sworn she was
      laughing, had I not known better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that was a reference to a little pleasantry Mr. Fox had put up on
      him some time before. His Grace flared, but tried not to show it. He said
      he had heard I could do something with a horse (I believe he made it up),
      and Comyn gave oath that I could; and then he offered to bet Comyn that I
      could not ride this Pollux, who had killed his groom. That made me angry,
      and I told the duke I was no jockey to be put up to decide wagers, and
      that he must make his offers to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La!&rdquo; said Dolly, &ldquo;you fell in head over heels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said she, biting her lip. &ldquo;Come, you are as ponderous as Dr.
      Johnson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Mr. Fox proposed that his Grace should ride after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Dolly laughed in her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be bound,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the duke went to York,&rdquo; I continued hurriedly; and when he came back
      we met him at the Star and Garter. He insisted that the match should come
      off in Hyde Park. I should have preferred the open roads north of Bedford
      House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where there is no Serpentine,&rdquo; she interrupted, with the faintest
      suspicion of a twinkle about her eyes. &ldquo;On, sir, on! You are as reluctant
      as our pump at Wilmot House in the dry season. I see you were not killed,
      as you richly deserved. Let us have the rest of your tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is very little more to it, save that I contrived to master the
      beast, and his Grace&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Was disgraced. A vastly fine achievement, surely. But where are
      you to stop? You will be shaming the King next by outwalking him. Pray,
      how did the duke appear as he was going into the Serpentine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard?&rdquo; I exclaimed, the trick she had played me dawning upon
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Richard, you are more of a simpleton than I thought you.
      Have you not seen your newspaper this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I explained how it was that I had not. She took up the Chronicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'This Mr. Carvel has made no inconsiderable noise since his arrival in
      town, and yesterday crowned his performances by defeating publicly a noble
      duke at a riding match in Hyde Park, before half the quality of the
      kingdom. His Lordship of March and Ruglen acted as umpire.' There, sir,
      was I not right to beg Sir John Fielding to put you in safe keeping until
      your grandfather can send for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made to seize the paper, but she held it from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If Mr. Carvel remains long enough in England, he bids fair to share the
      talk of Mayfair with a certain honourable young gentleman of Brooks's and
      the Admiralty, whose debts and doings now furnish most of the gossip for
      the clubs and the card tables. Their names are both connected with this
      contest. 'Tis whispered that the wager upon which the match was ridden
      arose&mdash;'&rdquo; here Dolly stopped shortly, her colour mounting, and cried
      out with a stamp of her foot. &ldquo;You are not content to bring publicity upon
      yourself, who deserve it, but must needs drag innocent names into the
      newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have they said?&rdquo; I demanded, ready to roll every printer in London
      in the kennel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, you may read for yourself,&rdquo; said she. And, flinging the paper in my
      lap, left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not said much more, Heaven be praised. But I was angry and
      mortified as I had never been before, realizing for the first time what a
      botch I had made of my stay in London. In great dejection, I was picking
      up my hat to leave the house, when Mrs. Manners came in upon me, and
      insisted that I should stay for dinner. She was very white, and seemed
      troubled and preoccupied, and said that Mr. Manners had come back from
      York with a cold on his chest, but would insist upon joining the party to
      Vauxhall on Monday. I asked her when she was going to the baths, and
      suggested that the change would do her good. Indeed, she looked badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not going, Richard,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;Dorothy will not hear of it. In
      spite of the doctor she says she is not ill, and must attend at Vauxhall,
      too. You are asked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said that Mr. Storer had included me. I am sure, from the way she looked
      at me, that she did not heed my answer. She appeared to hesitate on the
      verge of a speech, and glanced once or twice at the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, I suppose you are old enough to take care of yourself, tho' you
      seem still a child to me. I pray you will be careful, my boy,&rdquo; she said,
      with something of the affection she had always borne me, &ldquo;for your
      grandfather's sake, I pray you will run into no more danger. I&mdash;we
      are your old friends, and the only ones here to advise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, seemingly, to weigh the wisdom of what was to come next,
      while I leaned forward with an eagerness I could not hide. Was she to
      speak of the Duke of Chartersea? Alas, I was not to know. For at that
      moment Dorothy came back to inquire why I was not gone to the cudgelling
      at the Three Hats. I said I had been invited to stay to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I have writ a note asking Comyn,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Do you think the house
      will hold you both?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship came in as we were sitting down, bursting with some news, and
      he could hardly wait to congratulate Dolly on her recovery before he
      delivered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Richard,&rdquo; says the dog, &ldquo;what do you think some wag has done now?
      They believe at Brooks's 'twas that jackanapes of a parson, Dr. Warner,
      who was there yesterday with March.&rdquo; He drew a clipping from his pocket.
      &ldquo;Listen, Miss Dolly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;On Wednesday did a carter see
        His Grace, the Duke of Ch-rt&mdash;s-a,
        As plump and helpless as a bag,
        A-straddle of a big-boned nag.
        &ldquo;Lord, Sam!&rdquo; the carter loudly yelled,
        On by this wondrous sight impelled,
        &ldquo;We'll run and watch this noble gander
        Master a steed, like Alexander.&rdquo;
         But, when the carter reached the Row,
        His Grace had left it, long ago.
        Bucephalus had leaped the green,
        The duke was in the Serpentine.
        The fervent wish of all good men
        That he may ne'er come out again!'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Comyn's impudence took my breath, tho' the experiment interested me not a
      little. My lady was pleased to laugh at the doggerel, and even Mrs.
      Manners. Its effect upon Mr. Marmaduke was not so spontaneous. His smile
      was half-hearted. Indeed, the little gentleman seemed to have lost his
      spirits, and said so little (for him), that I was encouraged to corner him
      that very evening and force him to a confession. But I might have known he
      was not to be caught. It appeared almost as if he guessed my purpose, for
      as soon as ever the claret was come on, he excused himself, saying he was
      promised to Lady Harrington, who wanted one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comyn and I departed early on account of Dorothy. She had denied a dozen
      who had left cards upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, Richard,&rdquo; said my Lord, when we had got to my lodgings, &ldquo;I made him
      change colour, did I not? Do you know how the little fool looks to me?
      'Od's life, he looks hunted, and cursed near brought to earth. We must
      fetch this thing to a point, Richard. And I am wondering what Chartersea's
      next move will be,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. HOLLAND HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the morrow, as I was setting out to dine at Brooks's, I received the
      following on a torn slip of paper: &ldquo;Dear Richard, we shall have a good
      show to-day you may care to see.&rdquo; It was signed &ldquo;Fox,&rdquo; and dated at St.
      Stephen's. I lost no time in riding to Westminster, where I found a flock
      of excited people in Parliament Street and in the Palace Yard. And on
      climbing the wide stone steps outside and a narrower flight within I was
      admitted directly into the august presence of the representatives of the
      English people. They were in a most prodigious and unseemly state of
      uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a place is old St. Stephen's Chapel, over St. Mary's in the Vaults,
      for the great Commons of England to gather! It is scarce larger or more
      imposing than our own assembly room in the Stadt House in Annapolis. St.
      Stephen's measures but ten yards by thirty, with a narrow gallery running
      along each side for visitors. In one of these, by the rail, I sat down
      suffocated, bewildered, and deafened. And my first impression out of the
      confusion was of the bewigged speaker enthroned under the royal arms, sore
      put to restore order. On the table in front of him lay the great mace of
      the Restoration. Three chandeliers threw down their light upon the mob of
      honourable members, and I wondered what had put them into this state of
      uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, with the help of a kind stranger on my right, who was
      occasionally making shorthand notes, I got a few bearings. That was the
      Treasury Bench, where Lord North sat (he was wide awake, now). And there
      was the Government side. He pointed out Barrington and Weymouth and Jerry
      Dyson and Sandwich, and Rigby in the court suit of purple velvet with the
      sword thrust through the pocket. I took them all in, as some of the worst
      enemies my country had in Britain. Then my informant seemed to hesitate,
      and made bold to ask my persuasion. When I told him I was a Whig, and an
      American, he begged the favour of my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, sir,&rdquo; he cried excitedly, &ldquo;that stout young gentleman with the
      black face and eyebrows, and the blacker heart, I may say,&mdash;the one
      dressed in the fantastical costume called by a French name,&mdash;is Mr.
      Charles Fox. He has been sent by the devil himself, I believe, to ruin
      this country. 'Ods, sir, that devil Lord Holland begot him. He is but one
      and twenty, but his detestable arts have saved North's neck from Burke and
      Wedderburn on two occasions this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what has happened to-day?&rdquo; I asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger smiled, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; he answered, raising his voice above the noise; &ldquo;if you have
      been in London any length of time, you will have read the account, with
      comment, of the Duke of Grafton's speech in the Lords, signed Domitian.
      Their Lordships well know it should have been over a greater signature.
      This afternoon his Grace of Manchester was talking in the Upper House
      about the Spanish troubles, when Lord Gower arose and desired that the
      place might be cleared of strangers, lest some Castilian spy might lurk
      under the gallery. That was directed against us of the press, sir, and
      their Lordships knew it. 'Ad's heart, sir, there was a riot, the house
      servants tumbling everybody out, and Mr. Burke and Mr. Dunning in the
      boot, who were gone there on the business of this house to present a bill.
      Those gentlemen are but just back, calling upon the commons to revenge
      them and vindicate their honour. And my Lord North looks troubled, as you
      will mark, for the matter is like to go hard against his Majesty's
      friends. But hush, Mr. Burke is to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse fell quiet to listen, and my friend began to ply his shorthand
      industriously. I leaned forward with a sharp curiosity to see this great
      friend of America. He was dressed in a well-worn suit of brown, and I
      recall a decided Irish face, and a more decided Irish accent, which
      presently I forgot under the spell of his eloquence. I have heard it said
      he had many defects of delivery. He had none that day, or else I was too
      little experienced to note them. Afire with indignation, he told how the
      deputy black rod had hustled him like a vagabond or a thief, and he called
      the House of Lords a bear garden. He was followed by Dunning, in a still
      more inflammatory mood, until it seemed as if all the King's friends in
      the Lower House must desert their confederates in the Upper. No less
      important a retainer than Mr. Onslow moved a policy of retaliation, and
      those that were left began to act like the Egyptians when they felt the
      Red Sea under them. They nodded and whispered in their consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Mr. Fox got calmly up before the pack of frightened
      mercenaries and argued (God save the mark!) for moderation. He had the ear
      of the house in a second, and he spoke with all the confidence&mdash;this
      youngster who had just reached his majority&mdash;he had used with me
      before his intimates. I gaped with astonishment and admiration. The Lords,
      said he, had plainly meant no insult to this honourable house, nor yet to
      the honourable members. They had aimed at the common enemies of man, the
      printers. And for this their heat was more than pardonable. My friend at
      my side stopped his writing to swear under his breath. &ldquo;Look at 'em!&rdquo; he
      cried; &ldquo;they are turning already. He could argue Swedenborg into popery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deserters were coming back to the ranks, indeed, and North and Dyson
      and Weymouth had ceased to look haggard, and were wreathed in smiles. In
      vain did Mr. Burke harangue them in polished phrase. It was a language
      North and Company did not understand, and cared not to learn. Their young
      champion spoke the more worldly and cynical tongue of White's and
      Brooks's, with its shorter sentences and absence of formality. And even as
      the devil can quote Scripture to his purpose, Mr. Fox quoted history and
      the classics, with plenty more that was not above the heads of the booted
      and spurred country squires. And thus, for the third time, he earned the
      gratitude of his gracious Majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Richard,&rdquo; said he, slipping his arm through mine as we came out
      into Parliament Street, &ldquo;I promised you some sport. Have you enjoyed it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was forced to admit that I had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us to the 'Thatched House,' and have supper privately,&rdquo; he suggested.
      &ldquo;I do not feel like a company to-night.&rdquo; We walked on for some time in
      silence. Presently he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not leave us, Richard. You may go home to see your grandfather
      die, and when you come back I will see about getting you a little borough
      for what my father paid for mine. And you shall marry Dorothy, and
      perchance return in ten years as governor of a principality. That is,
      after we've ruined you at the club. How does that prospect sit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered at the mood he was in, that made him choose me rather than the
      adulation and applause he was sure to receive at Brooks's for the part he
      had played that night. After we had satisfied our hunger,&mdash;for
      neither of us had dined,&mdash;and poured out a bottle of claret, he
      looked up at me quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not heard you congratulate me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor will you,&rdquo; I replied, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you the better for it, Richard. 'Twas a damned poor performance,
      and that's truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the performance remarkable,&rdquo; I said honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it was not,&rdquo; he answered scornfully. &ldquo;The moment that
      dun-coloured Irishman gets up, the whole government pack begins to whine
      and shiver. There are men I went to school with I fear more than Burke.
      But you don't like to see the champion of America come off second best. Is
      that what you're thinking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But I was wondering why you have devoted your talents to the devil,&rdquo;
       I said, amazed at my boldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at me, and half laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are cursed frank,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;damned frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you invited it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;so I did. Give me a man who is honest. Fill up again,&rdquo;
       said he; &ldquo;and spit out all you would like to say, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;why do you waste your time and your breath in defending a
      crew of political brigands and placemen, and a king who knows not the
      meaning of the word gratitude, and who has no use for a man of ability?
      You have honoured me with your friendship, Charles Fox, and I may take the
      liberty to add that you seem to love power more than spoils. You have
      originality. You are honest enough to think and act upon your own
      impulses. And pardon me if I say you have very little chance on that side
      of the house where you have put yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have picked up a trifle since you came into England,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;A damned shrewd estimate, I'll be sworn. And for a colonial! But,
      as for power,&rdquo; he added a little doggedly, &ldquo;I have it in plenty, and the
      kind I like. The King and North hate and fear me already more than
      Wilkes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with more cause,&rdquo; I replied warmly. &ldquo;His Majesty perhaps knows that
      you understand him better, and foresees the time when a man of your
      character will give him cause to fear indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer that, but called for a reckoning; and taking my arm
      again, we walked out past the sleeping houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever thought much of the men we have in the colonies?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;Chatham stands for 'em, and I hate Chatham on my
      father's account. That is reason enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should come back to America with me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And when you had
      rested awhile at Carvel Hall, I would ride with you through the length of
      the provinces from Massachusetts to North Carolina. You will see little
      besides hard-working, self-respecting Englishmen, loyal to a king who
      deserves loyalty as little as Louis of France. But with their eyes open,
      and despite the course he has taken. They are men whose measure of
      resolution is not guessed at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent again until we had got into Piccadilly and opposite his
      lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they all like you?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said I. For I had forgotten my words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Americans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greater part feel as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are for bed,&rdquo; he remarked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night is not yet begun,&rdquo; I answered, repeating his favourite words,
      and pointing at the glint of the sun on the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to a drive behind those chestnuts of mine, for a breath
      of air? I have just got my new cabriolet Selwyn ordered in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon we were rattling over the stones in Piccadilly, wrapped in
      greatcoats, for the morning wind was cold. We saw the Earl of March and
      Ruglen getting out of a chair before his house, opposite the Green Park,
      and he stopped swearing at the chairmen to wave at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, March!&rdquo; Mr. Fox said affably, &ldquo;you're drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship smiled, bowed graciously if unsteadily to me, and did not
      appear to resent the pleasantry. Then he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pair of cubs it is,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I wish to God I was young again. I
      hear you astonished the world again last night, Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We left him being assisted into his residence by a sleepy footman, paid
      our toll at Hyde Park Corner, and rolled onward toward Kensington, Fox
      laughing as we passed the empty park at the thought of what had so lately
      occurred there. After the close night of St. Stephen's, nature seemed
      doubly beautiful. The sun slanted over the water in the gardens in bars of
      green and gold. The bright new leaves were on the trees, and the morning
      dew had brought with it the smell of the living earth. We passed the
      stream of market wagons lumbering along, pulled by sturdy, patient
      farm-horses, driven by smocked countrymen, who touched their caps to the
      fine gentlemen of the court end of town; who shook their heads and
      exchanged deep tones over the whims of quality, unaccountable as the
      weather. But one big-chested fellow arrested his salute, a scowl came over
      his face, and he shouted back to the wagoner whose horses were munching
      his hay:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, Jeems, keep down yere hands. Mr. Fox is noo friend of we.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brought a hard smile on Mr. Fox's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, Richard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have become more detested than any man
      in Parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And justly,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;for you have fought all that is good in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was mobbed once, in Parliament Street. I thought they would kill me.
      Have you ever been mobbed, Richard?&rdquo; he asked indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, I thank Heaven,&rdquo; I answered fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I would rather be mobbed than indulge in any amusement I know
      of,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Than confound Wedderburn, or drive a measure against
      Burke,&mdash;which is no bad sport, my word on't. I would rather be mobbed
      than have my horse win at Newmarket. There is a keen pleasure you wot not
      of, my lad, in listening to Billingsgate and Spitalfields howl
      maledictions upon you. And no sensation I know of is equal to that of the
      moment when the mud and sticks and oranges are coming through the windows
      of your coach, when the dirty weavers are clutching at your ruffles and
      shaking their filthy fists under your nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, at any rate, strictly an aristocratic pleasure,&rdquo; I assented,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we came to Holland House. Its wide fields of sprouting corn, its woods
      and pastures and orchards in blossom, were smiling that morning, as though
      Leviathan, the town, were not rolling onward to swallow them. Lord Holland
      had bought the place from the Warwicks, with all its associations and
      memories. The capped towers and quaint facades and projecting windows were
      plain to be seen from where we halted in the shaded park, and to the south
      was that Kensington Road we had left, over which all the glory and royalty
      of England at one time or another had rolled. Under these majestic oaks
      and cedars Cromwell and Ireton had stood while the beaten Royalists lashed
      their horses on to Brentford. Nor did I forget that the renowned Addison
      had lived here after his unhappy marriage with Lady Warwick, and had often
      ridden hence to Button's Coffee House in town, where my grandfather had
      had his dinner with Dean Swift.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat gazing at the building, which was bathed in the early sun, at the
      deer and sheep grazing in the park, at the changing colours of the young
      leaves as the breeze swayed them. The market wagons had almost ceased now,
      and there was little to break the stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love the place?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, as though I had awakened him out of a sleep. And he was no
      longer the Fox of the clubs, the cynical, the reckless. He was no longer
      the best-dressed man in St. James's Street, or the aggressive youngster of
      St. Stephen's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love it!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Ay, Richard, and few guess how well. You will not
      laugh when I tell you that my happiest days have been passed here, when I
      was but a chit, in the long room where Addison used to walk up and down
      composing his Spectators: or trotting after my father through these woods
      and gardens. A kinder parent does not breathe than he. Well I remember how
      he tossed me in his arms under that tree when I had thrashed another lad
      for speaking ill of him. He called me his knight. In all my life he has
      never broken faith with me. When they were blasting down a wall where
      those palings now stand, he promised me I should see it done, and had it
      rebuilt and blown down again because I had missed the sight. All he ever
      exacted of me was that I should treat him as an elder brother. He had his
      own notion of the world I was going into, and prepared me accordingly. He
      took me from Eton to Spa, where I learned gaming instead of Greek, and
      gave me so much a night to risk at play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him in astonishment. To say that I thought these relations
      strange would have been a waste of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; Charles continued, &ldquo;I was bound to learn, and could acquire
      no younger.&rdquo; He flicked the glossy red backs of his horses with his whip.
      &ldquo;You are thinking it an extraordinary education, I know,&rdquo; he added rather
      sadly. &ldquo;I hav a-told you this&mdash;God knows why! Yes, because I like you
      damnably, and you would have heard worse elsewhere, both of him and of me.
      I fear you have listened to the world's opinion of Lord Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, I had heard a deal of that nobleman's peculations of the public
      funds. But in this he was no worse than the bulk of his colleagues. His
      desertion of William Pitt I found hard to forgive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best father in the world, Richard!&rdquo; cried Charles. &ldquo;If his former
      friends could but look into his kind heart, and see him in his home, they
      would not have turned their backs upon him. I do not mean such scoundrels
      as Rigby. And now my father is in exile half the year in Nice, and the
      other half at King's Gate. The King and Jack Bute used him for a tool, and
      then cast him out. You wonder why I am of the King's party?&rdquo; said he, with
      something sinister in his smile; &ldquo;I will tell you. When I got my borough I
      cared not a fig for parties or principles. I had only the one definite
      ambition, to revenge Lord Holland. Nay,&rdquo; he exclaimed, stopping my
      protest, &ldquo;I was not too young to know rottenness as well as another. The
      times are rotten in England. You may have virtue in America, amongst a
      people which is fresh from a struggle with the earth and its savages. We
      have cursed little at home, in faith. The King, with his barley water and
      rising at six, and shivering in chapel, and his middle-class table, is
      rottener than the rest. The money he saves in his damned beggarly court
      goes to buy men's souls. His word is good with none. For my part I prefer
      a man who is drunk six days out of the seven to one who takes his pleasure
      so. And I am not so great a fool that I cannot distinguish justice from
      injustice. I know the wrongs of the colonies, which you yourself have put
      as clear as I wish to hear, despite Mr. Burke and his eloquence.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [My grandfather has made a note here, which in justice should be
   added, that he was not deceived by Mr. Fox's partiality.&mdash;D. C. C.]
</pre>
    <p>
      And perhaps, Richard,&rdquo; he concluded, with a last lingering look at the old
      pile as he turned his horses, &ldquo;perhaps some day, I shall remember what you
      told us at Brooks's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was thus, boyishly, that Mr. Fox chose to take me into his confidence,
      an honour which I shall remember with a thrill to my dying day. So did he
      reveal to me the impulses of his early life, hidden forever from his
      detractors. How little does the censure of this world count, which cannot
      see the heart behind the embroidered waistcoat! When Charles Fox began his
      career he was a thoughtless lad, but steadfast to such principles as he
      had formed for himself. They were not many, but, compared to those of the
      arena which he entered, they were noble. He strove to serve his friends,
      to lift the name of a father from whom he had received nothing but
      kindness, however misguided. And when he saw at length the error of his
      ways, what a mighty blow did he strike for the right!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a man,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson, many years afterwards, &ldquo;who has divided
      his kingdom with Caesar; so that it was a doubt whether the nation should
      be ruled by the sceptre of George the Third or the tongue of Fox.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. VAUXHALL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Matters had come to a pretty pickle indeed. I was openly warned at
      Brooks's and elsewhere to beware of the duke, who was said upon various
      authority to be sulking in Hanover Square, his rage all the more dangerous
      because it was smouldering. I saw Dolly only casually before the party to
      Vauxhall. Needless to say, she flew in the face of Dr. James's authority,
      and went everywhere. She was at Lady Bunbury's drum, whither I had gone in
      another fruitless chase after Mr. Marmaduke. Dr. Warner's verse was the
      laughter of the company. And, greatly to my annoyance,&mdash;in the
      circumstances,&mdash;I was made a hero of, and showered with three times
      as many invitations as I could accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole story got abroad, even to the awakening of the duke in Covent
      Garden. And that clownish Mr. Foote, of the Haymarket, had added some
      lines to a silly popular song entitled 'The Sights o' Lunnun', with which
      I was hailed at Mrs. Betty's fruit-stall in St. James's Street. Here is
      one of the verses:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;In Maryland, he hunts the Fox
        From dewy Morn till Day grows dim;
        At Home he finds a Paradox,
        From Noon till Dawn the Fox hunts him.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Charles Fox laughed when he heard it. But he was serious when he came to
      speak of Chartersea, and bade me look out for assassination. I had Banks
      follow me abroad at night with a brace of pistols under his coat, albeit I
      feared nothing save that I should not have an opportunity to meet the duke
      in a fair fight. And I resolved at all hazards to run Mr. Marmaduke down
      with despatch, if I had to waylay him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Storer, who was forever giving parties, was responsible for this one
      at Vauxhall. We went in three coaches, and besides Dorothy and Mr.
      Marmaduke, the company included Lord and Lady Carlisle, Sir Charles and
      Lady Sarah Bunbury, Lady Ossory and Lady Julia Howard, two Miss Stanleys
      and Miss Poole, and Comyn, and Hare, and Price, and Fitzpatrick, the
      latter feeling very glum over a sum he had dropped that afternoon to Lord
      Harrington. Fox had been called to St. Stephen's on more printer's
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly was in glowing pink, as I loved best to see her, and looked divine.
      Comyn and I were in Mr. Manners's coach. The evening was fine and warm,
      and my lady in very lively spirits. As we rattled over Westminster Bridge,
      the music of the Vauxhall band came &ldquo;throbbing through the still night,&rdquo;
       and the sky was bright with the reflection of the lights. It was the
      fashion with the quality to go late; and so eleven o'clock had struck
      before we had pulled up between Vauxhall stairs, crowded with watermen and
      rough mudlarks, and the very ordinary-looking house which forms the
      entrance of the great garden. Leaving the servants outside, single-file we
      trailed through the dark passage guarded by the wicketgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prepare to be ravished, Richard,&rdquo; said my lady, with fine sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were yourself born in the colonies, miss,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;I confess to
      a thrill, and will not pretend that I have seen such sights often enough
      to be sated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Sarah, who had overheard; &ldquo;I vow this is refreshing.
      Behold a new heaven and a new earth, Mr. Carvel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, much to the amusement of the company, I took no pains to hide my
      enthusiasm at the brilliancy of the scene which burst upon me. A great
      orchestra rose in the midst of a stately grove lined on all four sides
      with supper-boxes of brave colours, which ran in straight tiers or swept
      around in circles. These were filled with people of all sorts and
      conditions, supping and making merry. Other people were sauntering under
      the trees, keeping step with the music. Lamps of white and blue and red
      and green hung like luminous fruit from the branches, or clustered in
      stars and crescents upon the buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Richard, you are as bad as Farmer Colin.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         &ldquo;'O Patty! Soft in feature,
          I've been at dear Vauxhall;
          No paradise is sweeter,
          Not that they Eden call.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      whispered Dolly, paraphrasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant came hurrying Mr. Tom Tyers, who was one of the brothers,
      proprietors of the gardens. He was a very lively young fellow who seemed
      to know everybody, and he desired to know if we would walk about a little
      before being shown to the boxes reserved for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are on the right side, Mr. Tyers?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Storer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be sure, sir. Your man was most particular to stipulate the pink
      and blue flowered brocades, next the Prince of Wales's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have the band stop that piece, Mr. Tyers,&rdquo; cried Lady Sarah.
      &ldquo;I declare, it is too much for my nerves. Let them play Dibbin's Ephesian
      Matron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As your Ladyship wishes,&rdquo; responded the obliging Mr. Tyers, and sent off
      an uniformed warder to the band-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he led us into the Rotunda, my Lady Dolly, being in one of her
      whimsical humours, began to recite in the manner of the guide-book, to the
      vast diversion of our party and the honest citizens gaping at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen,&rdquo; says the minx, &ldquo;is that
      marvellous Rotunda commonly known as the 'umbrella,' where the music plays
      on wet nights, and where we have our masquerades and ridottos. Their Royal
      Highnesses are very commonly seen here on such occasions. As you see, it
      is decorated with mirrors and scenes and busts, and with gilded festoons.
      That picture was painted by the famous Hogarth. The organ in the orchestra
      cost&mdash;you must supply the figure, Mr. Tyers,&mdash;and the ceiling is
      at least two hundred feet high. Gentlemen from the colonies and the
      country take notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time we were surrounded. Mr. Marmaduke was scandalized and
      crushed, but Mr. Tyers, used to the vagaries of his fashionable patrons,
      was wholly convulsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, Miss Manners, and you would consent to do this two nights more, we
      should have to open another gate,&rdquo; he declared. Followed by the mob, which
      it seems was part of the excitement, he led us out of the building into
      the Grand Walk; and offered to turn on the waterfall and mill, which (so
      Lady Sarah explained to me) the farmers and merchants fell down and
      worshipped every night at nine, to the tinkling of bells. She told Mr.
      Tyers there was diversion enough without &ldquo;tin cascades.&rdquo; When we got to
      the Grand Cross Walk he pointed out the black &ldquo;Wilderness&rdquo; of tall elms
      and cedars looming ahead of us. And&mdash;so we came to the South Walk,
      with its three triumphal arches framing a noble view of architecture at
      the far end. Our gentlemen sauntered ahead, with their spy-glasses,
      staring the citizens' pretty daughters out of countenance, and making
      cynical remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, egad!&rdquo; I heard Sir Charles say, &ldquo;the wig-makers have no cause to
      petition his Majesty for work. I'll be sworn the false hair this good
      staymaker has on cost a guinea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A remark which caused the staymaker (if such he was) such huge discomfort
      that he made off with his wife in the opposite direction, to the time of
      jeers and cock-crows from the bevy of Vauxhall bucks walking abreast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must show us the famous 'dark walks,' Mr. Tyers,&rdquo; says Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you will not care to see those, Miss Manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O lud, of course you must,&rdquo; chimed in the Miss Stanleys; &ldquo;there is no
      spice in these flaps and flies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led us accordingly into Druid's Walk, overarched with elms, and dark as
      the shades, our gentlemen singing, &ldquo;'Ods! Lovers will contrive,'&rdquo; in
      chorus, the ladies exclaiming and drawing together. Then I felt a soft,
      restraining hold on my arm, and fell back instinctively, vibrating to the
      touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you not see that I have been trying to get a word with you for ever
      so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust you to find a way, Dolly, if you but wish,&rdquo; I replied, admiring
      her stratagem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am serious to-night.&rdquo; Indeed, her voice betrayed as much. How well I
      recall those rich and low tones! &ldquo;I said I wished you shut up in the
      Marshalsea, and I meant it. I have been worrying about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me very happy,&rdquo; said I; which was no lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, you are every bit as reckless and indifferent of danger as they
      say your father was. And I am afraid&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; I asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You once mentioned a name to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I was breathing deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have forgiven you,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;I never meant to have referred to
      that incident more. You will understand whom I mean. You must know that he
      is a dangerous man, and a treacherous. Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I have been in
      hourly terror ever since you rode against him in Hyde Park. There! I have
      said it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tense sweetness of that moment none will ever know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have more reason to fear him than I, Dorothy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she whispered, catching her breath; &ldquo;what are you saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he has more cause to fear me than I to dread him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came a little closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stayed in London for me, Richard. Why did you? There was no need,&rdquo;
       she exclaimed; &ldquo;there was no need, do you hear? Oh, I shall never forgive
      Comyn for his meddling! I am sure 'twas he who told you some ridiculous
      story. He had no foundation for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy,&rdquo; I demanded, my voice shaking with earnestness, &ldquo;will you tell
      me honestly there is no foundation for the report that the duke is
      intriguing to marry you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That question was not answered, and regret came the instant it had left my
      lips&mdash;regret and conviction both. Dorothy joined Lady Carlisle before
      our absence had been noted, and began to banter Fitzpatrick upon his
      losings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were in the lighted Grove again, and sitting down to a supper of
      Vauxhall fare: transparent slices of ham (which had been a Vauxhall joke
      for ages), and chickens and cheese cakes and champagne and claret, and
      arrack punch. Mr. Tyers extended the concert in our favour. Mrs. Weichsell
      and the beautiful Baddeley trilled sentimental ballads which our ladies
      chose; and Mr. Vernon, the celebrated tenor, sang Cupid's Recruiting
      Sergeant so happily that Storer sent him a bottle of champagne. After
      which we amused ourselves with catches until the space between our boxes
      and the orchestra was filled. In the midst of this Comyn came quietly in
      from the other box and took a seat beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chartersea is here to-night,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tyers told me he turned up half an hour since. Tom asked his Grace to
      join our party,&rdquo; his Lordship laughed. &ldquo;Duke said no&mdash;he was to be
      here only half an hour, and Tom did not push him. He told me as a joke,
      and thinks Chartersea came to meet some petite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one with him?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Tall, dark man, one eye cast,&mdash;that's Lewis. They have come on
      some dirty work, Richard. Watch little Marmaduke. He has been fidgety as a
      cat all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; said I. Looking up, I caught Dorothy's eyes upon us, her
      lips parted, uneasiness and apprehension plain upon her face. Comyn
      dropped his voice still lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she suspects something,&rdquo; he said, rising. &ldquo;Chartersea is gone
      off toward the Wilderness, so Tom says. You must not let little Marmaduke
      see him. If Manners gets up to go, I will tune up Black-eked Susan, and do
      you follow on some pretext. If you are not back in a reasonable time, I'll
      after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had been gone scant three minutes before I heard his clear voice
      singing, &ldquo;in the Downs&rdquo;, and up I got, with a precipitation far from
      politic, and stepped out of the box. Our company stared in surprise. But
      Dorothy rose clear from her chair. The terror I saw stamped upon her face
      haunts me yet, and I heard her call my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited for nothing. Gaining the Grand Walk, I saw Mr. Marmaduke's
      insignificant figure dodging fearfully among the roughs, whose hour it
      was. He traversed the Cross Walk, and twenty yards farther on dived into
      an opening in the high hedge bounding the Wilderness. Before he had made
      six paces I had him by the shoulder, and he let out a shriek of fright
      like a woman's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I, Richard Carvel, Mr. Manners,&rdquo; I said shortly. I could not keep
      out the contempt from my tone. &ldquo;I beg a word with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his condition then words were impossible. His teeth rattled again, and
      he trembled like a hare caught alive. I kept my hold of him, and employed
      the time until he should be more composed peering into the darkness. For
      all I knew Chartersea might be within ear-shot. But I could see nothing
      but black trunks of trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to meet Chartersea,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have seen the futility of a lie, or else was scared out of all
      contrivance. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have allowed it to become the talk of London that this filthy
      nobleman is blackmailing you for your daughter,&rdquo; I went on, without
      wasting words. &ldquo;Tell me, is it, or is it not, true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he did not answer, I retained a handful of the grained silk on his
      shoulder as a measure of precaution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this so?&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know, I suppose,&rdquo; he said, under his breath, and with a note of
      sullenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must,&rdquo; I said firmly. &ldquo;The knowledge is the weapon need, for I, too, am
      going to meet Chartersea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased quivering all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to meet him!&rdquo; he cried, in another voice. &ldquo;Yes, yes, it is
      so,&mdash;it is so. I will tell you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it to yourself, Mr. Manners,&rdquo; I replied, with repugnance, &ldquo;I have
      heard all I wish. Where is he?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold the path until you come to him. And God bless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that! Do you go back to the company and make some excuse for me.
      Do not alarm them. And if you get the chance, tell Lord Comyn where to
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited until I saw him under the lights of the Grand Walk, and fairly
      running. Then I swung on my heel. I was of two minds whether to wait for
      Comyn, by far the wiser course. The unthinking recklessness I had
      inherited drove me on.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. THE WILDERNESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      My eyes had become accustomed to the darkness, and presently I made out a
      bench ahead, with two black figures starting from it. One I should have
      known on the banks of the Styx. From each came a separate oath as I
      stopped abreast them, and called the duke by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carvel!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;what the devil do you here, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come to keep an appointment for Mr. Manners,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;May I speak
      to your Grace alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a peculiar sound by sucking in his breath, meant for a sneering
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;damned if you shall! I have nothing in common with you,
      sir. So love for Miss Manners has driven you mad, my young upstart. And he
      is not the first, Lewis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor the last, by G&mdash;,&rdquo; says the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a score to settle with you, d&mdash;n you!&rdquo; cried Chartersea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I am here, your Grace,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;only you have twisted the
      words. There has been foul play enough. I have come to tell you,&rdquo; I cried,
      boiling with anger, &ldquo;I have come to tell you there has been foul play
      enough with a weakling that cannot protect himself, and to put an end to
      your blackmail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the place of an oath, a hoarse laugh of derision came out of him. But I
      was too angry then to note its significance. I slapped his face&mdash;nay,
      boxed it so that my palm stung. I heard his sword scraping out of the
      scabbard, and drew mine, stepping back to distance at the same instant.
      Then, with something of a shudder, I remembered young Atwater, and a 380
      brace of other instances of his villany. I looked for the captain. He was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our blades, the duke's and mine, came together with a ring, and I felt the
      strength of his wrist behind his, and of his short, powerful arm. The
      steel sung with our quick changes from 'quarte' to 'tierce'. 'Twas all by
      the feeling, without light to go by, and hatred between us left little
      space for skill. Our lunges were furious. 'Twas not long before I felt his
      point at my chest, but his reach was scant. All at once the music swelled
      up voices and laughter were wafted faintly from the pleasure world of
      lights beyond. But my head was filled, to the exclusion of all else, with
      a hatred and fury. And (God forgive me!) from between my teeth came a
      prayer that if I might kill this monster, I would die willingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, as I pressed him, he shifted ground, and there was Lewis
      standing within range of my eye. His hands were nowhere&mdash;they were
      behind his back! God alone knows why he had not murdered me. To keep
      Chartersea between him and me I swung another quarter. The duke seemed to
      see my game, struggled against it, tried to rush in under my guard, made a
      vicious lunge that would have ended me then and there had he not slipped.
      We were both panting like wild beasts. When next I raised my eyes Lewis
      had faded into the darkness. Then I felt my head as wet as from a plunge,
      the water running on my brow, and my back twitching. Every second I
      thought the sting of his sword was between my ribs. But to forsake the
      duke would have been the maddest of follies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that moment of agony came footsteps beating on the path, and by tacit
      consent our swords were still. We listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard! Richard Carvel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the second time in my life I thanked Heaven for that brave and loyal
      English heart. I called back, but my throat was dry and choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they are at their d&mdash;d assassins' tricks again! You need have no
      fear of one murderer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that their steels rang out behind me, like broadswords, Lewis wasting
      his breath in curses and blasphemies. I began to push Chartersea with all
      my might, and the wonder of it was that we did not fight with our fingers
      on each other's necks. His attacks, too, redoubled. Twice I felt the
      stings of his point, once in the hand, and once in the body, but I minded
      them as little as pinpricks. I was sure I had touched him, too. I heard
      him blowing distressedly. The casks of wine he had drunk in his short life
      were telling now, and his thrusts grew weaker. That fiercest of all joys&mdash;of
      killing an enemy&mdash;was in me, when I heard a cry that rang in my ears
      for many a year afterward, and the thud of a body on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done for him, your Grace,&rdquo; says Lewis, with an oath; and added
      immediately, &ldquo;I think I hear people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I had reached my Lord the captain repeated this, and excitedly
      begged the duke, I believe, to fly. Chartersea hissed out that he would
      not move a step until he had finished me, and as I bent over the body his
      point popped through my coat, and the pain shot under my shoulder. I
      staggered, and fell. A second of silence ensued, when the duke said with a
      laugh that was a cackle:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't marry her, d&mdash;n him!&rdquo; (panting). &ldquo;He had me cursed near
      killed, Lewis. Best give him another for luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt his heavy hand on the sword, and it tearing out of me. Next came
      the single word &ldquo;Dover,&rdquo; and they were gone. I had not lost my senses, and
      was on my knees again immediately, ripping open Comyn's waistcoat with my
      left hand, and murmuring his name in an agony of sorrow. I was searching
      under his shirt, wet with blood, when I became aware of voices at my side.
      &ldquo;A duel! A murder! Call the warders! Warders, ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A surgeon!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;A surgeon first of all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some one had wrenched a lamp from the Grand Walk and held it, flickering
      in the wind, before his Lordship's face. Guided by its light, more people
      came running through the wood, then the warders with lanthorns, headed by
      Mr. Tyers, and on top of him Mr. Fitzpatrick and my Lord Carlisle. We
      carried poor Jack to the house at the gate, and closed the doors against
      the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the grace of Heaven Sir Charles Blicke was walking in the gardens that
      night, and, battering at the door, was admitted along with the constable
      and the watch. Assisted by a young apothecary, Sir Charles washed and
      dressed the wound, which was in the left groin, and to our anxious
      questions replied that there was a chance of recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, too, are hurt, sir,&rdquo; he said, turning his clear eyes upon me.
      Indeed, the blood had been dripping from my hand and arm during the whole
      of the operation, and I began to be weak from the loss of it. By great
      good fortune Chartersea's thrust, which he thought had ended my life,
      passed under my armpit from behind and, stitching the skin, lodged deep in
      my right nipple. This wound the surgeon bound carefully, and likewise two
      smaller ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constable was for carrying me to the Marshalsea. And so I was forced
      to tell that I had quarrelled with Chartersea; and the watch, going out to
      the scene of the fight, discovered the duke's sword which he had pulled
      out of me, and Lewis's laced hat; and also a trail of blood leading from
      the spot. Mr. Tyers testified that he had seen Chartersea that night, and
      Lord Carlisle and Fitzpatrick to the grudge the duke bore me. I was given
      my liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comyn was taken to his house in Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, in Sir
      Charles's coach, whither I insisted upon preceding him. 'Twas on the way
      there that Fitzpatrick told me Dorothy had fainted when she heard the
      alarm&mdash;a piece of news which added to my anxiety. We called up the
      dowager countess, Comyn's mother, and Carlisle broke the news to her,
      mercifully lightening me of a share of the blame. Her Ladyship received
      the tidings with great fortitude; and instead of the torrent of reproaches
      I looked for, and deserved, she implored me to go home and care for my
      injuries lest I get the fever. I believe that I burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship was carried up the stairs with never a word or a groan from
      his lips, and his heart beating out slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached my lodgings as the watchman was crying: &ldquo;Past two o'clock, and
      a windy morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fitzpatrick stayed with me that night. And the next morning, save for
      the soreness of the cuts I had got, I found myself well as ever. I was
      again to thank the robustness of my health. Despite the protests of Banks
      and Fitzpatrick, and of Mr. Fox (who arrived early, not having been to bed
      at all), I jumped into a chaise and drove to Brook Street. There I had the
      good fortune to get the greatest load from my mind. Comyn was resting so
      much easier that the surgeon had left, and her Ladyship retired two hours
      since.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was misting and dark, but so vast was my relief that I imagined
      the sun was out as I rattled toward Arlington Street. If only Dolly were
      not ill again from the shock, I should be happy indeed. She must have
      heard, ere then, that I was not killed; and I had still better news to
      tell her than that of Lord Comyn's condition. Mr. Fox, who got every
      rumour that ran, had shouted after me that the duke and Lewis were set out
      for France. How he knew I had not waited to inquire. But the report
      tallied with my own surmise, for they had used the word &ldquo;Dover&rdquo; when they
      left us for dead in the Wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dismissed my chaise at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Manners waits on you, sir, in the drawing-room,&rdquo; said the footman.
      &ldquo;Your honour is here sooner than he looked for,&rdquo; he added gratuitously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sooner than he looked for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. James is gone to you but quarter of an hour since with a
      message, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Miss Manners? Is she well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir, thank your honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To add to my surprise, Mr. Marmaduke was pacing the drawing-room in a
      yellow night-gown. He met me with an expression I failed to fathom, and
      then my eye was held by a letter in his hand. He cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Richard,&rdquo; said he, very serious,&mdash;very pompous, I
      thought. &ldquo;I am pleased to see that you are so well out of the deplorable
      affair of last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not looked for gratitude. In truth, I had done nothing for him, and
      Chartersea might have exposed him a highwayman for all I cared,&mdash;I
      had fought for Dolly. But this attitude astonished me. I was about to make
      a tart reply, and then thought better of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter, a decanter of wine for Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; says he to the footman. Then
      to me: &ldquo;I am rejoiced to hear that Lord Comyn is out of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I merely stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sit?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;To speak truth, the Annapolis packet came
      in last night with news for you. Knowing that you have not had time to
      hear from Maryland, I sent for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My brain was in such a state that for the moment I took no meaning from
      this introduction. I was conscious only of indignation against him for
      sending for me, when for all he knew I might have been unable to leave my
      bed. Suddenly I jumped from the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard from Maryland?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Is Mr. Carvel dead? Oh, tell me,
      is Mr. Carvel dead?&rdquo; And I clutched his arm to make him wince.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, and turned away. &ldquo;My dear old friend is no more,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Your grandfather passed away on the seventh of last month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sank into a chair and bowed my face, a flood of recollections
      overwhelming me, a thousand kindnesses of my grandfather coming to mind.
      One comfort alone stood forth, even had I gone home with John Paul, I had
      missed him. But that he should have died alone with Grafton brought the
      tears brimming to my eyes. I had thought to be there to receive his last
      words and blessing, to watch over him, and to Smooth his pillow. Who had
      he else in the world to bear him affection on his death-bed? The
      imagination of that scene drove me mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Manners aroused me by a touch, and I looked up quickly. So quickly
      that I surprised the trace of a smile about his weak mouth. Were I to die
      to-morrow, I would swear to this on the Evangels. Nor was it the smile
      which compels itself upon the weak in serious moments. Nay, there was in
      it something malicious. And Mr. Manners could not even act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is more, Richard,&rdquo; he was saying; &ldquo;there is worse to come. Can you
      bear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His words and look roused me from my sorrow. I have ever been short of
      temper with those I disliked, and (alas!) with my friends also. And now
      all my pent-up wrath against this little man broke forth. I divined his
      meaning, and forgot that he was Dorothy's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse?&rdquo; I shouted, while he gave back in his alarm. &ldquo;Do you mean that
      Grafton has got possession of the estate? Is that what you mean, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;yes. I pray you be calm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you call that worse than losing my dearest friend on earth?&rdquo; I cried.
      There must have been an infinite scorn in my voice. &ldquo;Then your standards
      and mine are different, Mr. Manners. Your ways and mine are different, and
      I thank God for it. You have played more than one double part with me. You
      looked me in the face and denied me, and left me to go to a prison. I
      shall not repeat my grandfather's kindnesses to you, sir. Though you may
      not recall them, I do. And if your treatment of me was known in Maryland,
      you would be drummed out of the colony even as Mr. Hood was, and hung in
      effigy&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As God hears me, Richard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not add perjury to it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And have no uneasiness that I shall
      publish you. Your wife and daughter have saved you before,&mdash;they will
      save you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paused, struck speechless by a suspicion that suddenly flashed into my
      head. A glance at the contemptible form cowering within the folds of the
      flowered gown clinched it to a conviction. In two strides I had seized him
      by the skin over his ribs, and he shrieked with pain and fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you snake!&rdquo; I cried, in uncontrollable anger. &ldquo;You well knew
      Dorothy's spirit, which she has not got from you, and you lied to her.
      Yes, lied, I say. To force her to marry Chartersea you made her believe
      that your precious honour was in danger. And you lied to me last night,
      and sent me in the dark to fight two of the most treacherous villains in
      England. You wish they had killed me. The plot was between you and his
      Grace. You, who have not a cat's courage, commit an indiscretion! You
      never made one in your life, Tell me,&rdquo; I cried, shaking him until his
      teeth smote together, &ldquo;was it not put up between you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go! Let me go, and I will tell!&rdquo; he wailed in the agony of my
      grip. I tightened it the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall confess it first,&rdquo; I said, from between my teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarce had his lips formed the word yes, when I had flung him half across
      the room. He tripped on his gown, and fell sprawling on his hands. So the
      servant found us when he came back with the tray. The lackey went out
      again hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; I exclaimed, in bitterness and disgust; &ldquo;you are a father, and
      would sell both your daughter and your honour for a title, and to the
      filthiest wretch in the kingdom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without bestowing upon him another look, I turned on my heel and left the
      room. I had set my foot on the stair, when I heard the rustle of a dress,
      and the low voice which I knew so well calling my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There at my side was Dorothy, even taller in her paleness, with sorrow and
      agitation in her blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, I have heard all.&mdash;I listened. Are you going away without a
      word for me?&rdquo; Her breath came fast, and mine, as she laid a hand upon my
      arm. &ldquo;Richard, I do not care whether you are poor. What am I saying?&rdquo; she
      cried wildly. &ldquo;Am I false to my own father? Richard, what have you done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, while I stood dazed, she tore open her gown, and drawing forth a
      little gold locket, pressed it in my palm. &ldquo;The flowers you gave me on
      your birthday,&mdash;the lilies of the valley, do you remember? They are
      here, Richard. I have worn them upon my heart ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I raised the locket to my lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall treasure it for your sake, Dorothy,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for the sake of the
      old days. God keep you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment I looked into the depths of her eyes. Then she was gone, and
      I went down the stairs alone. Outside, the rain fell unheeded on my new
      coat. My steps bent southward, past Whitehall, where the martyr Charles
      had met death so nobly: past the stairs to the river, where she had
      tripped with me so gayly not a month since. Death was in my soul that day,&mdash;death
      and love, which is the mystery of life. God guided me into the great Abbey
      near by, where I fell on my knees before Him and before England's dead. He
      had raised them and cast them down, even as He was casting me, that I
      might come to know the glory of His holy name.

      CHAPTER XLII. MY FRIENDS ARE PROVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the door of my lodgings I was confronted by Banks, red with indignation
      and fidgety from uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord, Mr. Carvel, what has happened, sir?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Your honour's
      agent 'as been here since noon. Must I take orders from the likes o' him,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dix was indeed in possession of my rooms, lounging in the chair Dolly
      had chosen, smoking my tobacco. I stared at him from the threshold.
      Something in my appearance, or force of habit, or both brought him to his
      feet, and wiped away the smirk from his face. He put down the pipe
      guiltily. I told him shortly that I had heard the news which he must have
      got by the packet: and that he should have his money, tho' it took the
      rest of my life: and the ten per cent I had promised him provided he would
      not press my Lord Comyn. He hesitated, and drummed on the table. He was
      the man of business again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What security am I to have, Mr. Carvel?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It has never yet been broken, I thank God, nor my
      father's before me. And hark ye, Mr. Dix, you shall not be able to say
      that of Grafton.&rdquo; Truly I thought the principal and agent were now well
      matched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;ten per cent. I shall call with the
      papers on Monday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not run away before that,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got out, with a poor attempt at a swagger, without his customary
      protestations of duty and humble offers of service. And I thanked Heaven
      he had not made a scene, which in my state of mind I could not have borne,
      but must have laid hands upon him. Perhaps he believed Grafton not yet
      secure in his title. I did not wonder then, in the heat of my youth, that
      he should have accepted my honour as security. But since I have marvelled
      not a little at this. The fine gentlemen at Brooks's with whom I had been
      associating were none too scrupulous, and regarded money-lenders as
      legitimate prey. Debts of honour they paid but tardily, if at all. A
      certain nobleman had been owing my Lord Carlisle thirteen thousand pounds
      for a couple of years, that his Lordship had won at hazard. And tho' I
      blush to write it, Mr. Fox himself was notorious in such matters, and was
      in debt to each of the coterie of fashionables of which he was the devoted
      chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faithful Banks vowed, with tears in his eyes, that he would never
      desert me. And in that moment of dejection the poor fellow's devotion
      brought me no little comfort. At such times the heart is bitter. We look
      askance at our friends, and make the task of comfort doubly hard for those
      that remain true. I had a great affection for the man, and had become so
      used to his ways and unwearying service that I had not the courage to
      refuse his prayers to go with me to America. I had not a farthing of my
      own&mdash;he would serve me for nothing&mdash;nay, work for me. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he
      said, taking off my coat and bringing me my gown,&mdash;&ldquo;Sure, your honour
      was not made to work.&rdquo; To cheer me he went on with some foolish footman's
      gossip that there lacked not ladies with jointures who would marry me, and
      be thankful. I smiled sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was when I was Mr. Carvel's heir, Banks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your face and figure, sir, and masterful ways! Faith, and what more
      would a lady want!&rdquo; Banks's notions of morality were vague enough, and he
      would have had me sink what I had left at hazard at Almack's. He had lived
      in this atmosphere. Alas! there was little chance of my ever regaining the
      position I had held but yesterday. I thought of the sponging-house, and my
      brow was moist. England was no place, in those days, for fallen gentlemen.
      With us in the Colonies the law offered itself. Mr. Swain, and other
      barristers of Annapolis, came to my mind, for God had given me courage. I
      would try the law. For I had small hopes of defeating my Uncle Grafton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sunday morning dawned brightly, and the church bells ringing brought
      me to my feet, and out into Piccadilly, in the forlorn hope that I might
      see my lady on her way to morning service,&mdash;see her for the last time
      in life, perhaps. Her locket I wore over my heart. It had lain upon hers.
      To see her was the most exquisite agony in the world. But not to see her,
      and to feel that she was scarce quarter of a mile away, was beyond
      endurance. I stood beside an area at the entrance to Arlington Street, and
      waited for an hour, quite in vain; watching every face that passed,
      townsmen in their ill-fitting Sunday clothes, and fine ladies with the
      footmen carrying velvet prayerbooks. And some that I knew only stared, and
      others gave me distant bows from their coach windows. For those that fall
      from fashion are dead to fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy did not go to church that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a pleasure, my dears, when writing of that hour of bitterness, to
      record the moments of sweetness which lightened it. As I climbed up to my
      rooms in Dover Street, I heard merry sounds above, and a cloud of smoke
      blew out of the door when I opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; cried Mr. Fox. &ldquo;You see, Richard, we have not deserted you
      when we can win no more of your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, egad! the man looks as if he had had a calamity,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Fitzpatrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is not a Jew here,&rdquo; Fox continued. &ldquo;Tho' it is Sunday, the air
      in my Jerusalem chamber is as bad as in any crimps den in St. Giles's.
      'Slife, and I live to be forty, I shall have as many underground avenues
      as his Majesty Louis the Eleventh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have a place,&rdquo; put in my Lord Carlisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must do something for him,&rdquo; said Fox, &ldquo;albeit he is an American and a
      Whig, and all the rest of the execrations. Thou wilt have to swallow thy
      golden opinions, my buckskin, when we put thee in office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was too overwhelmed even to protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not in such a cursed bad way, when all is said, Richard,&rdquo; said
      Fitzpatrick. &ldquo;Charles, when he loses a fortune, immediately borrows
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you stick to whist and quinze,&rdquo; said Charles, solemnly, giving me the
      advice they were forever thrusting upon him, &ldquo;and play with system, you
      may make as much as four thousand a year, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this was how I was treated by those heathen and cynical macaronies,
      Mr. Fox's friends. I may not say the same for the whole of Brooks's Club,
      tho' I never darkened its doors afterwards. But I encountered my Lord
      March that afternoon, and got only a blank stare in place of a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles had collected (Heaven knows how!) the thousand pounds which he
      stood in my debt, and Mr. Storer and Lord Carlisle offered to lend me as
      much as I chose. I had some difficulty in refusing, and more still in
      denying Charles when he pressed me to go with them to Richmond, where he
      had rooms for play over Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banks brought me the news that Lord Comyn was sitting up, and had been
      asking for me that day; that he was recovering beyond belief. But I was
      resolved not to go to Brook Street until the money affairs were settled on
      Monday with Mr. Dix, for I knew well that his Lordship would insist upon
      carrying out with the agent the contract he had so generously and hastily
      made, rather than let me pay an abnormal interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday I rose early, and went out for a bit of air before the scene
      with Mr. Dix. Returning, I saw a coach with his Lordship's arms on the
      panels, and there was Comyn himself in my great chair at the window, where
      he had been deposited by Banks and his footman. I stared as on one risen
      from the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jack, what are you doing here?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied very offhand, as was his manner at such times:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blicke vows that Chartersea and Lewis have qualified for the College of
      Surgeons,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;They are both born anatomists. Your job under the arm
      was the worst bungle of the two, egad, for Lewis put his sword, pat as you
      please, between two of my organs (cursed if I know their names), and not
      so much as scratched one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look you, Jack,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am not deceived. You have no right to be
      here, and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; answered his Lordship; &ldquo;I am as well as you.&rdquo; And he took snuff to
      prove the assertion. &ldquo;Why the devil was you not in Brook Street yesterday
      to tell me that your uncle had swindled you? I thought I was your friend,&rdquo;
       says he, &ldquo;and I learn of your misfortune through others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because you are my friend, and my best friend, that I would not
      worry you when you lay next door to death on my account,&rdquo; I said, with
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just then Banks announced Mr. Dix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him wait,&rdquo; said I, greatly disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him up!&rdquo; said my Lord, peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; I protested; &ldquo;he can wait. We shall have no business now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Banks was gone. And I found out, long afterward, that it was put up
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent swaggered in with that easy assurance he assumed whenever he got
      the upper hand. He was the would-be squire once again, in top-boots and a
      frock. I have rarely seen a man put out of countenance so easily as was
      Mr. Dix that morning when he met his Lordship's fixed gaze from the
      arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you are turned Jew?&rdquo; says he, tapping his snuffbox. &ldquo;Before you go
      ahead so fast again, you will please to remember, d&mdash;n you, that Mr.
      Carvel is the kind that does not lose his friends with his fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dix made a salaam, which was so ludicrous in a squire that my Lord
      roared with laughter, and I feared for his wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man must live, my Lord,&rdquo; sputtered the agent. His discomfiture was
      painful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the expense of another,&rdquo; says Comyn, dryly. &ldquo;That is your motto in
      Change Alley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will permit, Jack, I must have a few words in private with Mr.
      Dix,&rdquo; I cut in uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship would be damned first. &ldquo;I am not accustomed to be thwarted,
      Richard, I tell you. Ask the dowager if I have not always had my way. I am
      not going to stand by and see a man who saved my life fall into the
      clutches of an usurer. Yes, I said usurer, Mr. Dix. My attorney, Mr.
      Kennett, of Lincoln's Inn, has instructions to settle with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, despite all I could say, he would not budge an inch. At last I
      submitted under the threat that he would never after have a word to say to
      me. By good luck, when I had paid into Mr. Dix's hand the thousand pounds
      I had received from Charles Fox, and cleared my outstanding bills, the sum
      I remained in Comyn's debt was not greatly above seven hundred pounds. And
      that was the end of Mr. Dix for me; when he had backed himself out in
      chagrin at having lost his ten per centum, my feelings got the better of
      me. The water rushed to my eyes, and I turned my back upon his Lordship.
      To conceal his own emotions he fell to swearing like mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fox will get you something,&rdquo; he said at length, when he was a little
      calmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him, sadly, that my duty took me to America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Dorothy?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you will leave her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I related the whole miserable story (all save the part of the locket), for
      I felt that I owed it him. His excitement grew as he listened, until I had
      to threaten to stop to keep him quiet. But when I had done, he saw nothing
      but good to come of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Od's life! Richard, lad, come here!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Give me your hand. Why,
      you ass, you have won a thousand times over what you lost. She loves you!
      Did I not say so? And as for that intriguing little puppy, her father, you
      have pulled his teeth, egad. She heard what you said to him, you tell me.
      Then he will never deceive her again, my word on't. And Chartersea may
      come back to London, and be damned.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII. ANNAPOLIS ONCE MORE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three days after that I was at sea, in the Norfolk packet, with the
      farewells of my loyal English friends ringing in my ears. Captain Graham,
      the master of the packet, and his passengers found me but a poor
      companion. But they had heard of my misfortune, and vied with each other
      in heaping kindnesses upon me. Nor did they intrude on my walks in the
      night watches, to see me slipping a locket from under my waistcoat&mdash;ay,
      and raising it to my lips. 'Twas no doubt a blessing that I had lesser
      misfortunes to share my attention. God had put me in the way of looking
      forward rather than behind, and I was sure that my friends in Annapolis
      would help me to an honest living, and fight my cause against Grafton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banks was with me. The devoted soul did his best to cheer me, tho'
      downcast himself at leaving England. To know what to do with him gave me
      many an anxious moment. I doubted not that I could get him into a service,
      but when I spoke of such a thing he burst into tears, and demanded whether
      I meant to throw him off. Nor was any argument of mine of use.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a fair and uneventful voyage of six weeks, I beheld again my native
      shores in the low spits of the Virginia capes. The sand was very hot and
      white, and the waters of the Chesapeake rolled like oil under the July
      sun. We were all day getting over to Yorktown, the ship's destination. A
      schooner was sailing for Annapolis early the next morning, and I barely
      had time to get off my baggage and catch her. We went up the bay with a
      fresh wind astern, which died down at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat was terrific after England and the sea-voyage, and we slept on
      the deck. And Banks sat, most of the day, exclaiming at the vast scale on
      which this new country was laid out, and wondering at the myriad islands
      we passed, some of them fair with grain and tobacco; and at the low-lying
      shores clothed with forests, and broken by the salt marshes, with now and
      then the manor-house of some gentleman-planter visible on either side.
      Late on the second day I beheld again the cliffs that mark the mouth of
      the Severn, then the sail-dotted roads and the roofs of Annapolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      We landed, Banks and I, in a pinnace from the schooner, and so full was my
      heart at the sight of the old objects that I could only gulp now and then,
      and utter never a word. There was the dock where I had paced up and down
      near the whole night, when Dolly had sailed away; and Pryse the
      coachmaker's shop, and the little balcony upon which I had stood with my
      grandfather, and railed in a boyish tenor at Mr. Hood. The sun cast sharp,
      black shadows. And it being the middle of the dull season, when the
      quality were at their seats, and the dinner-hour besides, the town might
      have been a deserted one for its stillness, as tho' the inhabitants had
      walked out of it, and left it so. I made my way, Banks behind me, into
      Church Street, past the &ldquo;Ship&rdquo; tavern, which brought memories of the brawl
      there, and of Captain Clapsaddle forcing the mob, like chaff, before his
      sword. The bees were humming idly over the sweet-scented gardens, and
      Farris, the clock-maker, sat at his door, and nodded. He jerked his head
      as I went by with a cry of &ldquo;Lord, it is Mr. Richard back!&rdquo; and I must
      needs pause, to let him bow over my hand. Farther up the street I came to
      mine host of the Coffee House standing on his steps, with his hands behind
      his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Claude,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me as tho' I had risen from the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God save us!&rdquo; he shouted, in a voice that echoed through the narrow
      street. &ldquo;God save us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to go all to pieces. To my bated questions he replied at length,
      when he had got his breath, that Captain Clapsaddle had come to town but
      the day before, and was even then in the coffee-room at his dinner. Alone?
      Yes, alone. Almost tottering, I mounted the steps, and turned in at the
      coffee-room door, and stopped. There sat the captain at a table, the roast
      and wine untouched before him, his waistcoat thrown open. He was staring
      out of the open window into the inn garden beyond, with its shade of
      cherry trees. Mr. Claude's cry had not disturbed his reveries, nor our
      talk after it. I went forward. I touched him on the shoulder, and he
      sprang up, and looked once into my face, and by some trick of the mind
      uttered the very words Mr. Claude had used.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God save us! Richard!&rdquo; And he opened his arms and strained me to his
      great chest, calling my name again and again, while the tears coursed down
      the furrows of his cheeks. For I marked the furrows for the first time,
      and the wrinkles settling in his forehead and around his eyes. What he
      said when he released me, nor my replies, can I remember now, but at last
      he called, in his ringing voice, to mine host:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bottle from your choicest bin, Claude! Some of Mr. Bordley's. For he
      that was lost is found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hundred questions I had longed to ask were forgotten. A peace stole
      upon me that I had not felt since I had looked upon his face before. The
      wine was brought by Mr. Claude, and opened, and it was mine host who broke
      the silence, and the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your very good health, Mr. Richard,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and may you come to your
      own again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drink it with all my heart, Richard,&rdquo; replied Captain Daniel. But he
      glanced at me sadly, and his honest nature could put no hope into his
      tone. &ldquo;We have got him back again, Mr. Claude. And God has answered our
      prayers. So let us be thankful.&rdquo; And he sat down in silence, gazing at me
      in pity and tenderness, while Mr. Claude withdrew. &ldquo;I can give you but a
      sad welcome home, my lad,&rdquo; he said presently, with a hesitation strange to
      him. &ldquo;'Tis not the first bad news I have had to break in my life to your
      family, but I pray it may be the last.&rdquo; He paused. I knew he was thinking
      of the black tidings he had once brought my mother. &ldquo;Richard, your
      grandfather is dead,&rdquo; he ended abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;you have heard already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Manners told me, in London,&rdquo; I said, completely mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;London!&rdquo; he cried, starting forward. &ldquo;London and Mr. Manners! Have you
      been to London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had my letters to Mr. Carvel?&rdquo; I demanded, turning suddenly sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eye flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never a letter. We mourned you for dead, Richard. This is Grafton's
      work!&rdquo; he cried, springing to his feet and striking the table with his
      great fist, so that the dishes jumped. &ldquo;Grafton Carvel, the prettiest
      villain in these thirteen colonies! Oh, we shall hang him some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Mr. Carvel died without knowing that I was safe?&rdquo; I interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On that I'll lay all my worldly goods,&rdquo; replied Captain Daniel,
      emphatically. &ldquo;If any letters came to Marlboro' Street from you, Mr.
      Carvel never dropped eyes on 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fool was I not to have written you!&rdquo; I groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew his chair around the table, and close to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had the news that you escaped death been cried aloud in the streets, my
      lad, 'twould never have got to your grandfather's ear,&rdquo; he said, in lower
      tones. &ldquo;I will tell you what happened, tho' I have it at second hand,
      being in the North, as you may remember. Grafton came in from Kent and
      invested Marlboro' Street. He himself broke the news to Mr. Carvel, who
      took to his bed. Leiden was not in attendance, you may be sure, but that
      quack-doctor Drake. Swain sent me a message, and I killed a horse getting
      here from New York. But I could no more gain admittance to your
      grandfather, Richard, than to King George the Third. I was met in the hall
      by that crocodile, who told me with too many fair words that I could not
      see my old friend; that for the present Dr. Drake denied him everybody.
      Then I damned Dr. Drake, and Grafton too. And I let him know my
      suspicions. He ordered me off, Richard&mdash;from that house which has
      been my only home for these twenty years.&rdquo; His voice broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carvel thought me dead, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And most mercifully. Your black Hugo, when he was somewhat recovered,
      swore he had seen you killed and carried off. Sooth, they say there was
      blood enough on the place. But we spared no pains to obtain a clew of you.
      I went north to Boston, and Lloyd's factor south to Charleston. But no
      trace of the messenger who came to the Coffee House after you could we
      find. Hell had opened and swallowed him. And mark this for consummate
      villany: Grafton himself spent no less than five hundred pounds in
      advertising and the like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is not suspected?&rdquo; I asked. This was the same question I had put
      to Mrs. Manners. It caused the captain to flare up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis incredible how a rogue may impose upon men of worth and integrity if
      he but know how to smirk piously, and never miss a service. And then he is
      an exceeding rich man. Riches cover a multitude of sins in the most
      virtuous community in the world. Your Aunt Caroline brought him a pretty
      fortune, you know. We had ominous times this spring, with the associations
      forming, and the 'Good Intent' and the rest being sent back to England.
      His Excellency was at his wits' end for support. It was Grafton Carvel who
      helped him most, and spent money like tobacco for the King's cause, which,
      being interpreted, was for his own advancement. But I believe Colonel
      Lloyd suspects him, tho' he has never said as much to me. I have told Mr.
      Swain, under secrecy, what I think. He is one of the ablest lawyers that
      the colony owns, Richard, and a stanch friend of yours. He took your case
      of his own accord. But he says we have no foothold as yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I asked if there was a will the captain rapped out an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sdeath! yes,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;a will in favour of Grafton and his heirs,
      witnessed by Dr. Drake, they say, and another scoundrel. Your name does
      not occur throughout the length and breadth of it. You were dead. But you
      will have to ask Mr. Swain for those particulars. My dear old friend was
      sadly gone when he wrote it, I fear. For he never lacked shrewdness in his
      best days. Nor,&rdquo; added Captain Daniel, with force, &ldquo;nor did he want for a
      proper estimation of Grafton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never been the same since that first sickness,&rdquo; I answered sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the captain came to speak of Mr. Carvel's death, the son and daughter
      he loved, and the child of his old age in the grave before him, he
      proceeded brokenly, and the tears blinded him. Mr. Carvel's last words
      will never be known, my dears. They sounded in the unfeeling ears of the
      serpent Grafton. 'Twas said that he was seen coming out of his father's
      house an hour after the demise, a smile on his face which he strove to
      hide with a pucker of sorrow. But by God's grace Mr. Allen had not read
      the prayers. The rector was at last removed from Annapolis, and had
      obtained the fat living of Frederick which he coveted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I hope for salvation,&rdquo; the captain concluded, &ldquo;I will swear there is
      not such another villain in the world as Grafton. The imagination of a
      fiend alone could have conceived and brought to execution the crime he has
      committed. And the Borgias were children to him. 'Twas not only the love
      of money that urged him, but hatred of you and of your father. That was
      his strongest motive, I believe. However, the days are coming, lad, when
      he shall have his reward, unless all signs fail. And we have had enough of
      sober talk,&rdquo; said he, pressing me to eat. &ldquo;Faith, but just now, when you
      came in, I was thinking of you, Richard. And&mdash;God forgive me!
      complaining against the lot of my life. And thinking, now that you were
      taken out of it, and your father and mother and grandfather gone, how
      little I had to live for. Now you are home again,&rdquo; says he, his eyes
      lighting on me with affection, &ldquo;I count the gray hairs as nothing. Let us
      have your story, and be merry. Nay, I might have guessed you had been in
      London, with your fine clothes and your English servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      'Twas a long story, as you know, my dears. He lighted his pipe and laid
      his big hand over mine, and filled my glass, and I told him most of that
      which had happened to me. But I left out the whole of that concerning Mr.
      Manners and the Duke of Chartersea, nor did I speak of the sponging-house.
      I believe my only motive for this omittance was a reluctance to dwell upon
      Dorothy, and a desire to shield her father for her sake. He dropped many a
      vigorous exclamation into my pauses, but when I came to speak of my
      friendship with Mr. Fox, his brow clouded over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ad's heart!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;'Ad's heart! And so you are turned Tory, and
      have at last been perverted from those principles for which I loved you
      most. In the old days my conscience would not allow me to advise you,
      Richard, and now that I am free to speak, you are past advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what if I tell you that I made friends with his Grace of Grafton, and
      Lord Sandwich, and was invited to Hichinbroke, his Lordship's seat?&rdquo; said
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      His honest face was a picture of consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the good Lord deliver us!&rdquo; he exclaimed fervently. &ldquo;Sandwich!
      Grafton! The devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave myself over to the first real merriment I had had since I had heard
      of Mr. Carvel's death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when Mr. Fox learned that I had lost my fortune,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;he
      offered me a position under Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not friends enough at home to care for you, sir?&rdquo; he said, his
      face getting purple. &ldquo;Are you Jack Carvel's son, or are you an impostor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Jack Carvel's son, dear Captain Daniel, and that is why I am here,&rdquo;
       I replied. &ldquo;I am a stouter Whig than ever, and I believe I might have
      converted Mr. Fox himself had I remained at home sufficiently long,&rdquo; I
      added, with a solemn face. And, for my own edification, I related how I
      had bearded his Majesty's friends at Brooks's, whereat he gave a great,
      joyful laugh, and thumped me on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dog, Richard! You sly rogue!&rdquo; And he called to Mr. Claude for another
      bottle on the strength of that, and we pledged the Association. He
      peppered me with questions concerning Junius, and Mr. Wilkes, and Mr.
      Franklin of Philadelphia. Had I seen him in London? &ldquo;I would not doubt a
      Carvel's word,&rdquo; says the captain, &ldquo;(always excepting Grafton and his line,
      as usual), but you may duck me on the stool and I comprehend why Mr. Fox
      and his friends took up with such a young rebel rapscallion as you&mdash;and
      after the speech you made 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I astonished him vastly by pointing out that Mr. Fox and his friends cared
      a deal for place, and not a fig for principle; that my frankness had
      entertained rather than offended them; and that, having a taste for a bit
      of wild life and the money to gratify it, and being of a tolerant, easy
      nature withal, I had contrived to make many friends in that set, without
      aiming at influence. Whereat he gave me another lick between the
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so with Jack,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;thou art a replica. He would have made
      friends with the devil himself. In the French war, when all the rest of us
      Royal Americans were squabbling with his Majesty's officers out of
      England, and cursing them at mess, they could never be got to fight with
      Jack, tho' he gave them ample provocation. There was Tetherington, of the
      22d foot,&mdash;who jeered us for damned provincials, and swaggered
      through three duels in a week,&mdash;would enter no quarrel with him. I
      can hear him say: 'Damn you, Carvel, you may slap my face and you will, or
      walk in ahead of me at the general's dinner and you will, but I like you
      too well to draw at you. I would not miss your company at table for all
      the world.' And when he was killed,&rdquo; Captain Daniel continued, lowering
      his voice, &ldquo;some of them cried like women, Tetherington among 'em,&mdash;and
      swore they would rather have lost their commissions at high play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat talking until the summer's dusk grew on apace, and one thing this
      devoted lover of my family told me, which lightened my spirits of the
      greatest burden that had rested upon them since my calamity befell me. I
      had dwelt at length upon my Lord Comyn, and upon the weight of his
      services to me, and touched upon the sum which I stood in his debt. The
      captain interrupted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day, before your mother died, she sent for me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I came
      to Carvel Hall. You were too young to remember. It was in September, and
      she was sitting on the seat under the oak she loved so well,&mdash;by Dr.
      Hilliard's study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lace shawl your father had given her was around her shoulders, and
      upon her face was the smile that gave me a pang to see. For it had
      something of heaven in it, Richard. She called me 'Daniel' then for the
      second time in her life. She bade me be seated beside her. 'Daniel,' she
      said, 'when I am gone, and father is gone, it is you who will take care of
      Richard. I sometimes believe all may not be well then, and that he will
      need you.' I knew she was thinking of Grafton,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;'I have
      a little money of my own, Daniel, which I have saved lately with this in
      view. I give it into your charge, and if trouble comes to him, my old
      friend, you will use it as you see fit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a bit under a thousand pounds, Richard. And when she died I put it
      out under Mr. Carroll's direction at safe interest. So that you have
      enough to discharge your debt, and something saved against another
      emergency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell silent, sunk into one of those reveries which the memory of my
      mother awoke in him. My own thoughts drifted across the sea. I was again
      at the top of the stairs in Arlington Street, and feeling the dearest
      presence in the world. The pale oval of Dorothy's face rose before me and
      the troubled depths of her blue eyes. And I heard once more the tremble in
      her voice as she confessed, in words of which she took no heed, that love
      for which I had sought in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer dusk was gathering. Outside, under the cherry trees, I saw
      Banks holding forth to an admiring circle of negro 'ostlers. And presently
      Mr. Claude came in to say that Shaw, the town carpenter, and Sol Mogg, the
      ancient sexton of St. Anne's, and several more of my old acquaintances
      were without, and begged the honour of greeting me.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV. NOBLESSE OBLIGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      I lay that night in Captain Clapsaddle's lodgings opposite, and slept
      soundly. Banks was on hand in the morning to assist at my toilet, and was
      greatly downcast when I refused him this privilege, for the first time.
      Captain Daniel was highly pleased with the honest fellow's devotion in
      following me to America. To cheer him he began to question him as to my
      doings in London, and the first thing of which Banks must tell was of the
      riding-contest in Hyde Park, which I had omitted. It is easy to imagine
      how this should have tickled the captain, who always had my horsemanship
      at heart; and when it came to Chartersea's descent into the Serpentine, I
      thought he would go into apoplexy. For he had put on flesh with the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of my return had spread all over town, so that I had a deal more
      handshaking to do when we went to the Coffee House for breakfast. All the
      quality were in the country, of course, save only four gentlemen of the
      local Patriots' committee, of which Captain Daniel was a member, and with
      whom he had an appointment at ten. It was Mr. Swain who arrived first of
      the four.
    </p>
    <p>
      This old friend of my childhood was a quiet man (I may not have
      specified), thin, and a little under stature, with a receding but
      thoughtful forehead. But he could express as much of joy and welcome in
      his face and manner as could Captain Daniel with his heartier ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does me good to see you, lad,&rdquo; he said, pressing my hand. &ldquo;I heard you
      were home, and sent off an express to Patty and the mother last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are they not here?&rdquo; I asked, with disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Swain smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done a rash thing since I saw you, Richard, and bought a little
      plantation in Talbot, next to Singleton's. It will be my ruin,&rdquo; he added.
      &ldquo;A lawyer has no business with landed ambitions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little plantation!&rdquo; echoed the captain. &ldquo;'Od's life, he has bought one
      of his Lordship's own manors&mdash;as good an estate as there is in the
      province.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You overdo it, Daniel,&rdquo; said he, reprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there was a stir in the doorway, and in came Mr. Carroll,
      the barrister, and Mr. Bordley and Colonel Lloyd. These gentlemen gave me
      such a welcome as those warm-hearted planters and lawyers knew how to
      bestow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, he!&rdquo; cried Mr. Lloyd, &ldquo;I'm stamped and taxed if it isn't young
      Richard Carvel himself. Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I know one who will sleep easier
      o' nights now,&mdash;one Clapsaddle. The gray hairs are forgot, Daniel. We
      had more to-do over your disappearance than when Mr. Worthington lost his
      musical nigger. Where a deuce have you been, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall tell us when we come back,&rdquo; said Mr. Bordley. &ldquo;He has brought
      our worthy association to a standstill once, and now we must proceed about
      our business. Will you come, Richard? I believe you have proved yourself a
      sufficiently good patriot, and in this very house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went down Church Street, I walking behind with Colonel Lloyd, and so
      proud to be in such company that I cared not a groat whether Grafton had
      my acres or not. I remembered that the committee all wore plain and sober
      clothes, and carried no swords. Mr. Swain alone had a wig. I had been away
      but seven months, and yet here was a perceptible change. In these
      dignified and determined gentlemen England had more to fear than in all
      the mobs at Mr. Wilkes's back. How I wished that Charles Fox might have
      been with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun beat down upon the street. The shopkeepers were gathered at their
      doors, but their chattering was hushed as the dreaded committee passed.
      More than one, apparently, had tasted of its discipline. Colonel Lloyd
      whispered to me to keep my countenance, that they were not after very
      large game that morning,&mdash;only Chipchase, the butcher. And presently
      we came upon the rascal putting up his shutters in much precipitation,
      although it was noon. He had shed his blood-stained smock and breeches,
      and donned his Sunday best,&mdash;a white, thick-set coat, country cloth
      jacket, blue broadcloth breeches, and white shirt. A grizzled cut wig sat
      somewhat awry under his bearskin hat. When he perceived Mr. Carroll at his
      shoulder, he dropped his shutter against the wall, and began bowing
      frantically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You keep good hours, Master Chipchase,&rdquo; remarked Colonel Lloyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And lose good customers,&rdquo; Mr. Swain added laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butcher wriggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honours must know there be little selling when the gentry be out of
      town. And I was to take a holiday to-day, to see my daughter married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have a feast, my good man?&rdquo; Captain Daniel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, your honour, a feast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And any little ewe-lambs?&rdquo; says Mr. Bordley, very innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Chipchase turned the colour of his meat, and his wit failed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Fourthly,'&rdquo; recited Mr. Carroll, with an exceeding sober face,
      &ldquo;'Fourthly, that we will not kill, or suffer to be killed, or sell, or
      dispose to any person whom we have reason to believe intends to kill, any
      ewe-lamb that shall be weaned before the first day of May, in any year
      during the time aforesaid.' Have you ever heard anything of that sound,
      Mr. Chipchase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chipchase had. And if their honours pleased, he had a defence to make,
      if their honours would but listen. And if their honours but knew, he was
      as good a patriot as any in the province, and sold his wool to Peter
      Psalter, and he wore the homespun in winter. Then Mr. Carroll drew a paper
      from his pocket, and began to read: &ldquo;Mr. Thomas Hincks, personally known
      to me, deposeth and saith,&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Master Chipchase's knees gave from under him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your honours please,&rdquo; he cried piteously, &ldquo;I killed the lamb, but
      'twas at Mr. Grafton Carvel's order, who was in town with his Excellency.&rdquo;
       (Here Mr. Swain and the captain glanced significantly at me.) &ldquo;And I lose
      Mr. Carvel's custom, there is twelve pounds odd gone a year, your honours.
      And I am a poor man, sirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it owns your shop, my man?&rdquo; asks Mr. Bordley, very sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg your honours will not have me put out&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wailing of his voice had drawn a crowd of idlers and brother
      shopkeepers, who seemed vastly to enjoy the knave's discomfiture. Amongst
      them I recognized my old acquaintance, Weld, now a rival butcher. He
      pushed forward boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your honours please,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he has sold lamb to half the Tory
      gentry in Annapolis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lie!&rdquo; cried Chipchase; &ldquo;a lie, as God hears me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Captain Clapsaddle was one who carried his loves and his hatreds to
      the grave, and he had never liked Weld since the day, six years gone by,
      he had sent me into the Ship tavern. And when Weld heard the captain's
      voice he slunk away without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care, Master Weld,&rdquo; says he, in a quiet tone that boded no good;
      &ldquo;there is more evidence against you than you will like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Master Chipchase, after being frightened almost out of his senses, was
      pardoned this once by Captain Daniel's influence. We went thence to Mr.
      Hildreth's shop; he was suspected of having got tea out of a South River
      snow; then to Mr. Jackson's; and so on. 'Twas after two when we got back
      to the Coffee House, and sat down to as good a dinner as Mr. Claude could
      prepare. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; cried Colonel Lloyd, &ldquo;we shall have your adventures,
      Richard. I would that your uncle were here to listen to them,&rdquo; he added
      dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recited them very much as I had done the night before, and I warrant
      you, my dears, that they listened with more zest and eagerness than did
      Mr. Walpole. But they were all shrewd men, and kept their suspicions, if
      they had any, to themselves. Captain Daniel would have me omit nothing,&mdash;my
      intimacy with Mr. Fox, the speech at Brooks's Club, and the riding-match
      at Hyde Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What say you to that, gentlemen?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Egad, I'll be sworn he
      deserves credit,&mdash;an arrant young spark out of the Colonies, scarce
      turned nineteen, defeating a duke of the realm on horseback, and preaching
      the gospel of 'no taxation' at Brooks's Club! Nor the favour of Sandwich
      or March could turn him from his principles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Modesty, my dears, does not permit me to picture the enthusiasm of these
      good gentlemen, who bore the responsibility of the colony of Maryland upon
      their shoulders. They made more of me than I deserved. In vain did I seek
      to explain that if a young man was but well-born, and had a full purse and
      a turn for high play, his principles might go hang, for all Mr. Fox cared.
      Colonel Lloyd commanded that the famous rose punch-bowl be filled to the
      brim with Mr. Claude's best summer brew, and they drank my health and my
      grandfather's memory. It mattered little to them that I was poor. They
      vowed I should not lose by my choice. Mr. Bordley offered me a home, and
      added that I should have employment enough in the days to come. Mr.
      Carroll pressed me likewise. And big-hearted Colonel Lloyd desired to send
      me to King's College, as was my grandfather's wish, where Will Fotheringay
      and my cousin Philip had been for a term. I might make a barrister of
      myself. Mr. Swain alone was silent and thoughtful, but I did not for an
      instant doubt that he would have done as much for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we broke up for the evening the gentlemen plied me with questions
      concerning the state of affairs in England, and the temper of his Majesty
      and Parliament. I say without vanity that I was able to enlighten them not
      a little, for I had learned a deeper lesson from the set into which I had
      fallen in London than if I had become the confidant of Rockingham himself.
      America was a long way from England in those days. I regretted that I had
      not arrived in London in time to witness Lord Chatham's dramatic return to
      politics in January, when he had completed the work of Junius, and broken
      up the Grafton ministry. But I told them of the debate I had heard in St.
      Stephen's, and made them laugh over Mr. Fox's rescue of the King's
      friends, and the hustling of Mr. Burke from the Lords.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very curious, too, about Mr. Manners; and I was put to much
      ingenuity to answer their queries and not reveal my own connection with
      him. They wished to know if it were true that some nobleman had flung a
      bottle at his head in a rage because Dorothy would not marry him, as Dr.
      Courtenay's letter had stated. I replied that it was so. I did not add
      that it was the same nobleman who had been pitched into the Serpentine.
      Nor did I mention the fight at Vauxhall. I made no doubt these things
      would come to their ears, but I did not choose to be the one to tell them.
      Mr. Swain remained after the other gentlemen, and asked me if I would come
      with him to Gloucester Street; that he had something to say to me. We went
      the long way thither, and I was very grateful to him for avoiding
      Marlboro' Street, which must needs bring me painful recollections. He said
      little on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I almost expected to see Patty come tripping down from the vine-covered
      porch with her needlework in her hand, and the house seemed strangely
      empty without her. Mr. Swain had his negro, Romney, place chairs for us
      under the apple tree, and bring out pipes and sangaree. The air was still,
      and heavy with the flowers' scent, and the sun was dipping behind the low
      eaves of the house. It was so natural to be there that I scarce realized
      all that had happened since last I saw the back gate in the picket fence.
      Alas! little Patty would never more be smuggled through it and over the
      wall to Marlboro' Street. Mr. Swain recalled my thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Clapsaddle has asked me to look into this matter of the will,
      Richard,&rdquo; he began abruptly. &ldquo;Altho' we thought never to see you again, we
      have hoped against hope. I fear you have little chance for your property,
      my lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied that Captain Daniel had so led me to believe, and thanked him
      for his kindness and his trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twas no trouble,&rdquo; he replied quickly. &ldquo;Indeed, I wish it might have
      been. I shall always think of your grandfather with reverence and with
      sorrow. He was a noble man, and was a friend to me, in spite of my
      politics, when other gentlemen of position would not invite me to their
      houses. It would be the greatest happiness of my life if I could restore
      his property to you, where he would have had it go, and deprive that
      villain, your uncle, of the fruits of his crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is nothing to be got by contesting the will?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear not at present,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;nor can I with honesty hold out any
      hope to you, Richard. Your uncle, by reason of his wealth, is a man of
      undue influence with the powers of the colony. Even if he were not so, I
      doubt greatly whether we should be the gainers. The will is undoubtedly
      genuine. Mr. Carvel thought you dead, and we cannot prove undue influence
      by Grafton unless we also prove that it was he who caused your abduction.
      Do you think you can prove that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one witness,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;who overheard my uncle and Mr. Allen
      talking of South River and Griggs, the master of the slaver, in the
      stables at Carvel Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is that?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Swain, with more excitement than I
      believed him capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Harvey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Your grandfather's coachman? Alas, he died the day after Mr. Carvel, and
      was buried the same afternoon. Have you spoken of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to a soul,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I would not. You will have to be very careful and say nothing,
      Richard. Let me hear what other reasons you have for believing that your
      uncle tried to do away with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him, lucidly as possible, everything I have related in these pages,
      and the admission of Griggs. He listened intently, shaking his head now
      and then, but not a word out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;nothing is there which will be admitted, but
      enough to damn him if you yourself might be a witness. I will give you the
      law, briefly: descendible estates among us are of two kinds, estates in
      fee simple and estates in fee tail. Had your grandfather died without a
      will, his estate, which we suppose to be in fee simple, would have
      descended to you as the son of his eldest son, according to the fourth of
      the canons of descent in Blackstone. But with us fee simple estates are
      devisable, and Mr. Carvel was wholly within his right in cutting off the
      line of his eldest son. Do you follow me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one chance,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and that is a very slim one. I said
      that Mr. Carvel's estate was supposed to be in fee simple. Estates tail
      are not devisable. Our system of registration is far from infallible, and
      sometimes an old family settlement turns up to prove that a property which
      has been willed out of the direct line, as in fee simple, is in reality
      entailed. Is there a possibility of any such document?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied that I did not know. My grandfather had never brought up the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must bend our efforts in that direction,&rdquo; said the barrister. &ldquo;I shall
      have my clerks make a systematic search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased talking, and sat sipping his sangaree in the abstracted manner
      common to him. I took the opportunity to ask about his family, thinking
      about what Dolly had said of Patty's illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mother is as well as can be expected, Richard, and Patty very rosy
      with the country air. Your disappearance was a great shock to them both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went behind his reserve. &ldquo;Tom is a d&mdash;d rake,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with
      some vehemence. &ldquo;I have given him over. He has taken up with that macaroni
      Courtenay, who wins his money,&mdash;or rather my money,&mdash;and your
      cousin Philip, when he is home from King's College. How Tom can be son of
      mine is beyond me, in faith. I see him about once in two months, when he
      comes here with a bill for his satins and his ruffles, and along face of
      repentance, and a lot of gaming debts to involve my honour. And that
      reminds me, Richard,&rdquo; said he, looking straight at me with his clear, dark
      eyes: &ldquo;have you made any plans for your future?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ventured to ask his advice as to entering the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the only profession open to a gentleman,&rdquo; he replied, smiling a
      little. &ldquo;No, you were no more cut out for an attorney, or a barrister, or
      a judge, than was I for a macaroni doctor. The time is not far away, my
      lad,&rdquo; he went on, seeing my shame and confusion, &ldquo;when an American may
      amass money in any way he chooses, and still be a gentleman, behind a
      counter, if he will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not fear work, Mr. Swain,&rdquo; I remarked, with some pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I have been thinking,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;And I am not a man
      to make up my mind while you count three, Richard. I have the place in
      Talbot, and no one to look after it. And&mdash;and in short I think you
      are the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused to watch the effect of this upon me. But I was so taken aback by
      this new act of kindness that I could not say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom is fast going to the devil, as I told you,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;He cannot
      be trusted. If I die, that estate shall be Patty's, and he may never
      squander it. Captain Daniel tells me, and Mr. Bordley also, that you
      managed at Carvel Hall with sense and ability. I know you are very young,
      but I think I may rely upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he hesitated, eying me fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, with his quiet smile, &ldquo;it is the old noblesse oblige. How
      many careers has it ruined since the world began!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV. THE HOUSE OF MEMORIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was greatly touched, and made Mr. Swain many awkward acknowledgments,
      which he mercifully cut short. I asked him for a while to think over his
      offer. This seemed to please rather than displease him. And my first
      impulse on reaching the inn was to ask the captain's advice. I thought
      better of it however, and at length resolved to thrash out the matter for
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, as I sat reflecting, an overwhelming desire seized me to
      go to Marlboro' Street. Hitherto I could not have borne the sight of the
      old place. I gulped down my emotion as the gate creaked behind me, and
      made my way slowly to the white seat under the big chestnut behind the
      house, where my grandfather had been wont to sit reading his prints, in
      the warm weather. The flowers and the hedges had grown to a certain
      wildness; and the smell of the American roses carried me back-as odours
      will-to long-forgotten and trivial scenes. Here I had been caned many a
      day for Mr. Daaken's reports, and for earlier offences. And I recalled my
      mother as she once ran out at the sound of my cries to beg me off. So
      vivid was that picture that I could hear Mr. Carvel say: &ldquo;He is yours,
      madam, not mine. Take him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started up. The house was still, the sun blistering the green paint of
      the shutters. My eye was caught by those on the room that had been hers,
      and which, by my grandfather's decree, had lain closed since she left it.
      The image of it grew in my mind: the mahogany bed with its poppy
      counterpane and creamy curtains, and the steps at the side by which she
      was wont to enter it; and the 'prie-dieu', whence her soul had been lifted
      up to God. And the dresser with her china and silver upon it, covered by
      years of dust. For I had once stolen the key from Willis's bunch, crept
      in, and crept out again, awed. That chamber would be profaned, now, and
      those dear ornaments, which were mine, violated. The imagination choked
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have them. I must. Nothing easier than to pry open a door or
      window in the north wing, by the ball-room. When I saw Grafton I would
      tell him. Nay, I would write him that day. I was even casting about me for
      an implement, when I heard a step on the gravel beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I swung around, and came face to face with my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have perceived me. And after the first shock of my surprise had
      passed, I remarked a bearing on him that I had not seen before. He was
      master of the situation at last,&mdash;so it read. The realization gave
      him an easier speech than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I might find you here, Richard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since you were not
      at the Coffee House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not offer me his hand. I could only stare at him, for I had
      expected anything but this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came from Carvel Hall to get you,&rdquo; he proceeded smoothly enough. &ldquo;I
      heard but yesterday of your return, and some of your miraculous
      adventures. Your recklessness has caused us many a trying day, Richard,
      and I believe killed your grandfather. You have paid dearly, and have made
      us pay dearly, for your mad frolic of fighting cut-throats on the
      highroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wonder was that I did not kill him on the spot. I cannot think what
      possessed the man,&mdash;he must have known me better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My recklessness!&rdquo; I shouted, fairly hoarse with anger. I paid no heed to
      Mr. Swain's warning. &ldquo;You d&mdash;d scoundrel!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;it was you
      killed him, and you know it. When you had put me out of the way and he was
      in your power, you tortured him to death. You forced him to die alone with
      your sneering face, while your shrew of a wife counted cards downstairs.
      Grafton Carvel, God knows you better than I, who know you two well. And He
      will punish you as sure as the crack of doom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard me through, giving back as I came forward, his face blanching
      only a little, and wearing all the time that yellow smile which so fitted
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have finished?&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I have finished. And now you may order me from this ground you have
      robbed me of. But there are some things in that house you shall not steal,
      for they are mine despite you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name them, Richard,&rdquo; he said, very sorrowful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The articles in my mother's room, which were hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have them this day,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his way never to lose his temper, tho' he were called by the vilest
      name in the language. He must always assume this pious grief which made me
      long to throttle him. He had the best of me, even now, as he took the
      great key from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you look at them before you go?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first I was for refusing. Then I nodded. He led the way silently around
      by the front; and after he had turned the lock he stepped aside with a bow
      to let me pass in ahead of him. Once more I was in the familiar hall with
      the stairs dividing at the back. It was cool after the heat, and musty,
      and a touch of death hung in the prisoned air. We paused for a moment on
      the landing, beside the high, triple-arched window which the branches
      tapped on windy winter days, while Grafton took down the bunch of keys
      from beside the clock. I thought of my dear grandfather winding it every
      Sunday, and his ruddy face and large figure as he stood glancing sidewise
      down at me. Then the sound of Grafton's feet upon the bare steps recalled
      the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed Mr. Carvel's room and went down the little corridor over the
      ball-room, until we came to the full-storied wing. My uncle flung open the
      window and shutters opposite and gave me the key. A delicacy not foreign
      to him held him where he was. Time had sealed the door, and when at last
      it gave before my strength, a shower of dust quivered in the ray of
      sunlight from the window. I entered reverently. I took only the
      silverbound prayer-book, cast a lingering look at the old familiar objects
      dimly defined, and came out and locked the door again. I said very quietly
      that I would send for the things that afternoon, for my anger was hushed
      by what I had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      We halted together on the uncovered porch in front of the house, that had
      a seat set on each side of it. Marlboro' Street was still, the wide trees
      which flanked it spreading their shade over walk and roadway. Not a soul
      was abroad in the midday heat, and the windows of the long house opposite
      were sightless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; said my uncle, staring ahead of him, &ldquo;I came to offer you a
      home, and you insult me brutally, as you have done unreproved all your
      life. And yet no one shall say of me that I shirk my duty. But first I
      must ask you if there is aught else you desire of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The black boy, Hugo, is mine,&rdquo; I said. I had no great love for Hugo, save
      for association's sake, and I had one too many servants as it was; but to
      rescue one slave from Grafton's clutches was charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have him,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and your chaise, and your wardrobe, and
      your horses, and whatever else I have that belongs to you. As I was
      saying, I will not shirk my duty. The memory of my dear father, and of
      what he would have wished, will not permit me to let you go a-begging. You
      shall be provided for out of the estate, despite what you have said and
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was surely the quintessence of a rogue's imagination. Instinctively I
      shrank from him. With a show of piety that 'turned me sick he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let God witness that I carry out my father's will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop there, Grafton Carvel!&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;you shall not take His name in
      vain. Under this guise of holiness you and your accomplice have done the
      devil's own work, and the devil will reward you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This reference to Mr. Allen, I believe, frightened him. For a second only
      did he show it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My&mdash;my accomplice, sir!&rdquo; he stammered. And then righting himself:
      &ldquo;You will have to explain this, by Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In ample time your plot shall be laid bare, and you and his Reverence
      shall hang, or lie in chains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You threaten, Mr. Carvel?&rdquo; he shouted, nearly stepping off the porch in
      his excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I predict,&rdquo; I replied calmly. And I went down the steps and out of
      the gate, he looking after me. Before I had turned the corner of
      Freshwater Lane, he was in the seat, and fanning himself with his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went straight to Mr. Swain's chambers in the Circle, where I found the
      good barrister and Captain Daniel in their shirt-sleeves, seated between
      the windows in the back room. Mr. Swain was grave enough when he heard of
      my talk with Grafton, but the captain swore I was my father's son (for the
      fiftieth time since I had come back), and that a man could no more help
      flying at Grafton's face than Knipe could resist his legs; or Cynthia his
      back, if he went into her stall. I had scarce finished my recital, when
      Mr. Renwick, the barrister's clerk, announced Mr. Tucker, which caused Mr.
      Swain to let out a whistle of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the wind blows from that quarter, Daniel,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tucker proved to be the pettifogger into whose hands Grafton had put
      his affairs, taking them from Mr. Dulany at Mr. Carvel's death. The man
      was all in a sweat, and had hardly got in the door before he began to
      talk. He had no less astonishing a proposition to make than this, which he
      enunciated with much mouthing of the honour and sense of duty of Mr.
      Grafton Carvel. His client offered to Mr. Richard Carvel the estate lying
      in Kent County, embracing thirty-three hundred acres more or less of
      arable land and woodland, with a fine new house, together with the
      indented servants and negroes and other chattels thereon. Mr. Richard
      Carvel would observe that in making this generous offer for the welfare of
      his nephew, Mr. Tucker's client was far beyond the letter of his
      obligations; wherefore Mr. Grafton Carvel made it contingent upon the
      acceptance of the estate that his nephew should sign a paper renouncing
      forever any claims upon the properties of the late Mr. Lionel Carvel. This
      condition was so deftly rolled up in law-Latin that I did not understand a
      word of it until Mr. Swain stated it very briefly in English. His quiet
      laugh prodigiously disconcerted the pettifogger, who had before been
      sufficiently ill at ease in the presence of the great lawyer. Mr. Tucker
      blew his nose loudly to hide his confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what say you, Richard?&rdquo; said Mr. Swain, without a shade of accent in
      his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed my head. I knew that the honest barrister had read my heart when
      he spoke of noblesse oblige. That senseless pride of cast, so deep-rooted
      in those born in our province, had made itself felt. To be a factor (so I
      thought, for I was young) was to renounce my birth. Until that moment of
      travail the doctrine of equality had seemed very pretty to me. Your fine
      gentleman may talk as nobly as he pleases over his Madeira, and yet would
      patronize Monsieur Rousseau if he met him; and he takes never a thought of
      those who knuckle to him every day, and clean his boots and collect his
      rents. But when he is tried in the fire, and told suddenly to collect some
      one else's rents and curse another's negroes, he is fainthearted for the
      experiment. So it was with me when I had to meet the issue. I might take
      Grafton's offer, and the chance to marry Dorothy was come again. For by
      industry the owner of the Kent lands would become rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was hot, and still save for the buzzing of the flies. When I
      looked up I discovered the eyes of all three upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may tell your client, Mr. Tucker, that I refuse his offer,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got to his feet, and with the customary declaration of humble servitude
      bowed himself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was scarce closed on him when the captain had me by the hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What said I, Henry?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Did I not know the lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Swain did not stir from his seat. He was still gazing at me with a
      curious expression. And then I saw the world in truer colour. This good
      Samaritan was not only taking me into his home, but would fight for my
      rights with the strong brain that had lifted him out of poverty and
      obscurity. I stood, humbled before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would accept your kindness, Mr. Swain,&rdquo; I said, vainly trying to steady
      my voice, &ldquo;but I have the faithful fellow, Banks, who followed me here
      from England, dependant on me, and Hugo, whom I rescued from my uncle. I
      will make over the black to you and you will have him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, brushed his eyes with his shirt, and took me by the arm. &ldquo;You and
      the captain dine with me to-day,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;And as for Banks, I think that
      can be arranged. Now I have an estate, I shall need a trained butler,
      egad. I have some affairs to keep me in town to-day, Richard. But we'll be
      off for Cordon's Pride in the morning, and I know of one little girl will
      be glad to see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We dined out under the apple tree in Gloucester Street. And the captain
      argued, in his hopeful way, that Tucker's visit betrayed a weak point in
      Grafton's position. But the barrister shook his head and said that Grafton
      was too shrewd a rogue to tender me an estate if he feared me. It was Mr.
      Swain's opinion that the motive of my uncle was to put himself in a good
      light; and perhaps, he added, there was a little revenge mixed therein, as
      the Kent estate was the one Mr. Carvel had given him when he cast him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      A southerly wind was sending great rolls of fog before it as Mr. Swain and
      I, with Banks, crossed over to Kent Island on the ferry the next morning.
      We traversed the island, and were landed by the other ferry on the soil of
      my native county, Queen Anne's. In due time we cantered past Master
      Dingley's tavern, the sight of which gave me a sharp pang, for it is there
      that the by-road turns over the bridge to Carvel Hall and Wilmot House;
      and force of habit drew my reins to the right across the horse's neck, so
      that I swerved into it. The barrister had no word of comment when I
      overtook him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas about two o'clock when we came to the gate Mr. Swain had erected at
      the entrance to his place; the land was a little rolling, and partly
      wooded, like that on the Wye. But the fields were prodigiously unkempt. He
      drew up, and glanced at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see there is much to be done with such fallows as these,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;The lessees from his Lordship were sportsmen rather than husbandmen,
      and had an antipathy to a constable or a sheriff like a rat to a boar cat.
      That is the curse of some of your Eastern Shore gentlemen, especially in
      Dorchester,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;they get to be fishmongers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently we came in sight of the house, long and low, like the one in
      Gloucester Street, with a new and unpainted wing just completed. That day
      the mist softened its outline and blurred the trees which clustered about
      it. Even as we swung into the circle of the drive a rounded and youthful
      figure appeared in the doorway, gave a little cry, and stood immovable. It
      was Patty, in a striped dimity gown with the sleeves rolled up, and her
      face fairly shone with joy as I leaped from my horse and took her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you like my surprise, girl?&rdquo; said her father, as he kissed her
      blushing face.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer she tore herself away, and ran through the hall to the broad
      porch in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our barrister is come, mother,&rdquo; we heard her exclaiming, &ldquo;and whom do you
      think he has brought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Richard?&rdquo; asked the gentler voice, more hastily than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped out on the porch, where the invalid sat in her armchair. She was
      smiling with joy, too, and she held out her wasted hands and drew me
      toward her, kissing me on both cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank God for His goodness,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the boy has come to stay, mother,&rdquo; said her husband, as he stooped
      over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To stay!&rdquo; cries Patty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gordon's Pride is henceforth his home,&rdquo; replied the barrister. &ldquo;And now I
      can return in peace to my musty law, and know that my plantation will be
      well looked after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Patty gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I could almost rejoice that his uncle
      cheated him out of his property. He is to be factor of Gordon's Pride?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is to be master of Gordon's Pride, my dear,&rdquo; says her father, smiling
      and tilting her chin; &ldquo;we shall have no such persons as factors here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that the tears forced themselves into my own eyes. I turned away, and
      then I perceived for the first time the tall form of my old friend, Percy
      Singleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I, too, bid you welcome, Richard,&rdquo; said he, in his manly way; &ldquo;and
      rejoice that I have got such a neighbour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Percy,&rdquo; I answered. I was not in a state to say much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; exclaims Patty, &ldquo;what a dinner we shall have in the prodigal's
      honour! I shall make you all some of the Naples biscuit Mrs. Brice told me
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flew into the house, and presently we heard her clear voice singing in
      the kitchen.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI. GORDON'S PRIDE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The years of a man's life that count the most are often those which may be
      passed quickest in the story of it. And so I may hurry over the first
      years I spent as Mr. Swain's factor at Gordon's Pride. The task that came
      to my hand was heaven-sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      That manor-house, I am sure, was the tidiest in all Maryland, thanks to
      Patty's New England blood. She was astir with the birds of a morning, and
      near the last to retire at night, and happy as the days were long. She was
      ever up to her elbows in some dish, and her butter and her biscuits were
      the best in the province. Little she cared to work samplers, or peacocks
      in pretty wools, tho' in some way she found the time to learn the spinet.
      As the troubles with the mother country thickened, she took to a
      foot-wheel, and often in the crisp autumn evenings I would hear the
      bumping of it as I walked to the house, and turn the knob to come upon her
      spinning by the twilight. She would have no English-made linen in that
      household. &ldquo;If mine scratch your back, Richard,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;you must
      grin and bear, and console yourself with your virtue.&rdquo; It was I saw to the
      flax, and learned from Ivie Rawlinson (who had come to us from Carvel
      Hall) the best manner to ripple and break and swingle it. And Mr. Swain,
      in imitation of the high example set by Mr. Bordley, had buildings put up
      for wheels and the looms, and in due time kept his own sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      If man or woman, white or black, fell sick on the place, it was Patty
      herself who tended them. She knew the virtue of every herb in the big
      chest in the storeroom. And at table she presided over her father's guests
      with a womanliness that won her more admiration than mine. Now that the
      barrister was become a man of weight, the house was as crowded as ever was
      Carvel Hall. Carrolls and Pacas and Dulanys and Johnsons, and Lloyds and
      Bordleys and Brices and Scotts and Jennings and Ridouts, and Colonel
      Sharpe, who remained in the province, and many more families of prominence
      which I have not space to mention, all came to Gordon's Pride. Some of
      these, as their names proclaim, were of the King's side; but the bulk of
      Mr. Swain's company were stanch patriots, and toasted Miss Patty instead
      of his Majesty. By this I do not mean that they lacked loyalty, for it is
      a matter of note that our colony loved King George.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must not omit from the list above the name of my good friend, Captain
      Clapsaddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was there lack of younger company. Betty Tayloe, who plied me with
      questions concerning Dorothy and London, but especially about the dashing
      and handsome Lord Comyn; and the Dulany girls, and I know not how many
      others. Will Fotheringay, when he was home from college, and Archie Brice,
      and Francis Willard (whose father was now in the Assembly) and half a
      dozen more to court Patty, who would not so much as look at them. And when
      I twitted her with this she would redden and reply: &ldquo;I was created for a
      housewife, sir, and not to make eyes from behind a fan.&rdquo; Indeed, she was
      at her prettiest and best in the dimity frock, with the sleeves rolled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas a very merry place, the manor of Gordon's Pride. A generous bowl of
      punch always stood in the cool hall, through which the south winds swept
      from off the water, and fruit and sangaree and lemonade were on the table
      there. The manor had no ball-room, but the negro fiddlers played in the
      big parlour. And the young folks danced till supper time. In three months
      Patty's suppers grew famous in a colony where there was no lack of good
      cooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweet-natured invalid enjoyed these festivities in her quiet way, and
      often pressed me to partake. So did Patty beg me, and Mr. Swain. Perhaps a
      false sense of pride restrained me, but my duties held me all day in the
      field, and often into the night when there was curing to be done, or some
      other matters of necessity. And for the rest, I thought I detected a
      change in the tone of Mr. Fotheringay, and some others, tho' it may have
      been due to sensibility on my part. I would put up with no patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no change of tone, at least, with the elder gentlemen. They
      plainly showed me an added respect. And so I fell into the habit, after my
      work was over, of joining them in their suppers rather than the sons and
      daughters. There I was made right welcome. The serious conversation spiced
      with the wit of trained barristers and men of affairs better suited my
      changed condition of life. The times were sober, and for those who could
      see, a black cloud was on each horizon. 'Twas only a matter of months when
      the thunder-clap was to come-indeed, enough was going on within our own
      province to forebode a revolution. The Assembly to which many of these gentlemen
      belonged was in a righteous state of opposition to the Proprietary and the
      Council concerning the emoluments of colonial officers and of clergymen.
      Honest Governor Eden had the misfortune to see the justice of our side,
      and was driven into a seventh state by his attempts to square his
      conscience. Bitter controversies were waging in the Gazette, and names
      were called and duels fought weekly. For our cause &ldquo;The First Citizen&rdquo; led
      the van, and the able arguments and moderate language of his letters soon
      identified him as Mr. Charles Carroll of Carrollton, one of the greatest
      men Maryland has ever known. But even at Mr. Swain's, amongst his few
      intimate friends, Mr. Carroll could never be got to admit his 'nom de
      guerre' until long after 'Antilon' had been beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      I write it with pride, that at these suppers I was sometimes asked to
      speak; and, having been but lately to England, to give my opinion upon the
      state of affairs there. Mr. Carroll honoured me upon two occasions with
      his confidence, and I was made clerk to a little club they had, and kept
      the minutes in my own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went about in homespun, which, if good enough for Mr. Bordley, was good
      enough for me. I rode with him over the estate. This gentleman was the
      most accomplished and scientific farmer we had in the province. Having
      inherited his plantation on Wye Island, near Carvel Hall, he resigned his
      duties as judge, and a lucrative practice, to turn all his energies to the
      cultivation of the soil. His wheat was as eagerly sought after as was
      Colonel Washington's tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to Mr. Bordley's counsel that the greater part of my success was
      due. He taught me the folly of ploughing with a fluke,&mdash;a custom to
      which the Eastern Shore was wedded, pointing out that a double surface was
      thus exposed to the sun's rays; and explained at length why there was more
      profit in small grain in that district than heavy tobacco. He gave me Dr.
      Eliot's &ldquo;Essays on Field Husbandry,&rdquo; and Mill's &ldquo;Husby,&rdquo; which I read from
      cover to cover. And I went from time to time to visit him at Wye Island,
      when he would canter with me over that magnificent plantation, and show me
      with pride the finished outcome of his experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Swain's affairs kept him in town the greater part of the twelve
      months, and Mrs. Swain and Patty moved to Annapolis in the autumn. But for
      three years I was at Cordon's Pride winter and summer alike. At the end of
      that time I was fortunate enough to show my employer such substantial
      results as to earn his commendation&mdash;ay, and his confidence, which
      was the highest token of that man's esteem. The moneys of the estate he
      left entirely at my order. And in the spring of '73, when the opportunity
      was suddenly offered to buy a thousand acres of excellent wheat land
      adjoining, I made the purchase for him while he was at Williamsburg, and
      upon my own responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      This connected the plantation on the east with Singleton's. It had been my
      secret hope that the two estates might one day be joined in marriage. For
      of all those who came a-courting Patty, Percy was by far the best. He was
      but a diffident suitor; he would sit with me on the lawn evening after
      evening, when company was there, while Fotheringay and Francis Willard
      made their compliments within,&mdash;silly flatteries, at which Patty
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy kept his hounds, and many a run we had together' in the sparkling
      days that followed the busy summer, when the crops were safe in the
      bottoms; or a quiet pipe and bottle in his bachelor's hall, after a
      soaking on the duck points.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this brings me to a subject on which I am loth to write. Where Mr.
      Singleton was concerned, Patty, the kindest of creatures, was cruelty
      itself. Once, when I had the effrontery to venture a word in his behalf, I
      had been silenced so effectively as to make my ears tingle. A thousand
      little signs led me to a conclusion which pained me more than I can
      express. Heaven is my witness that no baser feeling leads me to hint of it
      here. Every day while the garden lasted flowers were in my room, and it
      was Banks who told me that she would allow no other hands than her own to
      place them by my bed. He got a round rating from me for violating the
      pledge of secrecy he had given her. It was Patty who made my shirts, and
      on Christmas knitted me something of comfort; who stood on the horse-block
      in the early morning waving after me as I rode away, and at my coming her
      eyes would kindle with a light not to be mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of these things were lost upon Percy Singleton, and I often wondered
      why he did not hate me. He was of the kind that never shows a hurt. Force
      of habit still sent him to Gordon's Pride, but for days he would have
      nothing to say to the mistress of it, or she to him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII. VISITORS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not often that Mr. Thomas Swain honoured Gordon's Pride with his
      presence. He vowed that the sober Whig company his father brought there
      gave him the vapours. He snapped his fingers at the articles of the
      Patriots' Association, and still had his cocked hats and his Brussels lace
      and his spyglass, and his top boots when he rode abroad, like any other
      Tory buck. His intimates were all of the King's side,&mdash;of the worst
      of the King's side, I should say, for I would not be thought to cast any
      slur on the great number of conscientious men of that party. But, being
      the son of one of the main props of the Whigs, Mr. Tom went unpunished for
      his father's sake. He was not uncondemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to 1774, the times that Mr. Swain mentioned his son to me might be
      counted on the fingers of one hand. It took not a great deal of shrewdness
      to guess that he had paid out many a pretty sum to keep Tom's honour
      bright: as bright, at least, as such doubtful metal would polish. Tho' the
      barrister sought my ear in many matters, I never heard a whimper out of
      him on this score.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Tom had no ambition beyond that of being a macaroni; his easy-going
      nature led him to avoid alike trouble and responsibility. Hence he did not
      bother his head concerning my position. He appeared well content that I
      should make money out of the plantation for him to spend. His visits to
      Gordon's Pride were generally in the late autumn, and he brought his own
      company with him. I recall vividly his third or fourth appearance, in
      October of '73. Well I may! The family was preparing to go to town, and
      this year I was to follow them, and take from Mr. Swain's shoulders some
      of his private business, for he had been ailing a little of late from
      overwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of which I have spoken a storm had set in, the rain falling in
      sheets. I had been in the saddle since breakfast, seeing to an hundred
      repairs that had to be made before the cold weather. 'Twas near the middle
      of the afternoon when I pulled up before the weaving house. The looms were
      still, and Patty met me at the door with a grave look, which I knew
      portended something. But her first words were of my comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, will you ever learn sense? You have been wet all day long, and
      have missed your dinner. Go at once and change your clothes, sir!&rdquo; she
      commanded severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have first to look at the warehouse, where the roof is leaking,&rdquo; I
      expostulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall do no such thing,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;but dry yourself, and march
      into the dining room. We have had the ducks you shot yesterday, and some
      of your experimental hominy; but they are all gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew well she had laid aside for me some dainty, as was her habit. I
      dismounted. She gave me a quick, troubled glance, and said in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom is come. And oh, I dare not tell you whom he has with him now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courtenay?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of coarse. I hate the sight of the man. But your cousin, Philip
      Carvel, is here, Richard. Father will be very angry. And they are making a
      drinking-tavern of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave Firefly a slap that sent her trotting stable-ward, and walked
      rapidly to the house. I found the three of them drinking in the hall, the
      punch spilled over the table, and staining the cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad's life!&rdquo; cries Tom, &ldquo;here comes Puritan Richard, in his broad rim.
      How goes the crop, Richard? 'Twill have to go well, egad, for I lost an
      hundred at the South River Club last week!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next him sat Philip, whom I had not seen since before I was carried off.
      He was lately come home from King's College; and very mysteriously, his
      father giving out that his health was not all it should be. He had not
      gained Grafton's height, but he was broader, and his face had something in
      it of his father. He had his mother's under lip and complexion. Grafton
      was sallow; Philip was a peculiar pink,&mdash;not the ruddy pink of
      heartier natures, like my grandfather's, nor yet had he the peach-like
      skin of Mr. Dix. Philip's was a darker and more solid colour, and I have
      never seen man or woman with it and not mistrusted them. He wore a red
      velvet coat embroidered with gold, and as costly ruffles as I had ever
      seen in London. But for all this my cousin had a coarse look, and his
      polished blue flints of eyes were those of a coarse man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got to his feet as Tom spoke, looking anywhere but at me, and came
      forward slowly. He was loyal to no one, was Philip, not even to his
      father. When he was got within three paces he halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you, cousin?&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little wet, as you perceive, Philip,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left him and stood before the fire, my rough wool steaming in the heat.
      He sat down again, a little awkwardly; and the situation began to please
      me better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you?&rdquo; I asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got a devilish cold,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Faith, I'll warrant the doctor
      will be sworn I have been but indifferent company since we left the Hall.
      Eh, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtenay, with his feet stretched out, bestowed an amiable but languid
      wink upon me, as much as to say that I knew what Mr. Philip's company was
      at best. When I came out after my dinner, they were still sitting there,
      Courtenay yawning, and Tom and Philip wrangling over last night's play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my man of affairs, join us a hand!&rdquo; says the doctor to me. &ldquo;I have
      known the time when you would sit from noon until supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had money then,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have a little now, or I am cursed badly mistook. Oons! what do
      you fear?&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you that have played with March and Fox?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear nothing, doctor,&rdquo; I answered, smiling. &ldquo;But a man must have a
      sorry honour when he will win fifty pounds with but ten of capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of Dr. Franklin's maxims, I presume,&rdquo; says he, with sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it were, it could scarce be more pat,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;'Tis Poor
      Richard's maxim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O lud! O my soul!&rdquo; cries Tom, with a hiccup and a snigger; &ldquo;'tis time you
      made another grand tour, Courtenay. Here's the second Whig has got in on
      you within the week!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God they have not got me down to osnabrig and bumbo yet,&rdquo; replies
      the doctor. Coming over to me by the fire, he tapped my sleeve and added
      in a low tone: &ldquo;Forbearance with such a pair of asses is enough to make a
      man shed bitter tears. But a little of it is necessary to keep out of
      debt. You and I will play together, against both the lambs, Richard. One
      of them is not far from maudlin now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, doctor,&rdquo; I answered politely, &ldquo;but I have a better way to make
      my living.&rdquo; In three years I had learned a little to control my temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his thin shoulders. &ldquo;Eh bien, mon bon,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I dare swear
      you know your own game better than do I.&rdquo; And he cast a look up the
      stairs, of which I quite missed the meaning. Indeed, I was wholly
      indifferent. The doctor and his like had passed out of my life, and I
      believed they were soon to disappear from our Western Hemisphere. The
      report I had heard was now confirmed, that his fortune was dissipated, and
      that he lived entirely off these young rakes who aspired to be macaronies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since your factor is become a damned Lutheran, Tom,&rdquo; said he, returning
      to the table and stripping a pack, &ldquo;it will have to be picquet. You
      promised me we could count on a fourth, or I had never left Inman's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Tom, as I had feared, who sat down unsteadily opposite. Philip
      lounged and watched them sulkily, snuffing and wheezing and dipping into
      the bowl, and cursing the house for a draughty barn. I took a pipe on the
      settle to see what would come of it. I was not surprised that Courtenay
      lost at first, and that Tom drank the most of the punch. Nor was it above
      half an hour before the stakes were raised and the tide began to turn in
      the doctor's favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A plague of you, Courtenay!&rdquo; cries Mr. Tom, at length, flinging down the
      cards. His voice was thick, while the Selwyn of Annapolis was never
      soberer in his life. Tom appealed first to Philip for the twenty pounds he
      owed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how damned stingy my father is, curse you,&rdquo; whined my cousin, in
      return. &ldquo;I told you I should not have it till the first of the month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom swore back. He thrust his hands deep in his pockets and sank into that
      attitude of dejection common to drunkards. Suddenly he pulled himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Shblood! Here's Richard t' draw from. Lemme have fifty pounds, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a farthing,&rdquo; I said, unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say wha' shall be done with my father's money!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I call
      tha' damned cool&mdash;Gad's life! I do. Eh, Courtenay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtenay had the sense not to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have you dishcharged, Gads death! so I will!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;No damned
      airs wi' me, Mr. Carvel. I'll have you know you're not wha' you once were,
      but, only a cursht oversheer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struggled to his feet, forgot his wrath on the instant, and began to
      sing drunkenly the words of a ribald air. I took him by both shoulders and
      pushed him back into his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; I said sternly; &ldquo;while your mother and sister are here you
      shall not insult them with such a song.&rdquo; He ceased, astonished. &ldquo;And as
      for you, gentlemen,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;you should know better than to make a
      place of resort out of a gentleman's house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtenay's voice broke the silence that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all the cursed impertinences I ever saw, egad!&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;Is this
      your manor, Mr. Carvel? Or have you a seat in Kent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I would not have it in black and white that I am an advocate of fighting.
      But a that moment I was in the mood when it does not matter much one way
      or the other. The drunken man carried us past the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The damned in&mdash;intriguing rogue'sh worked himself into my father's
      grashes,&rdquo; he said, counting out his words. &ldquo;He'sh no more Whig than me. I
      know'sh game, Courtenay&mdash;he wants t' marry Patty. Thish place'll be
      hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect upon me of these words, with all their hideous implication of
      gossip and scandal, was for an instant benumbing. The interpretation of
      the doctor's innuendo struck me then. I was starting forward, with a hand
      open to clap over Tom's mouth, when I saw the laugh die on Courtenay's
      face, and him come bowing to his legs. I turned with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the stairs stood Patty herself, pale as marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me, Tom,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had obeyed her from childhood. This time he tried, and failed
      miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, Patty,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;no offensh meant. Thish factor thinks
      h' ownsh Gordon's now. I say, not'll h' marries you. Good fellow, Richard,
      but infernal forward. Eh, Courtenay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip turned away, while the doctor pretended to examine the silver
      punch-ladle. As for me, I could only stare. It was Patty who kept her
      head, and made us a stately curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you do me the kindness, gentlemen,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to leave me with my
      brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We walked silently into the parlour, and I closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slife!&rdquo; cried Courtenay, &ldquo;she's a vision. What say you, Philip? And I
      might see her in that guise again, egad, I would forgive Tom his five
      hundred crowns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A buxom vision,&rdquo; agreed my cousin, &ldquo;but I vow I like 'em so.&rdquo; He had
      forgotten his cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This conversation is all of a piece with the rest of your conduct,&rdquo; said
      I, hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candles were burning brightly in the sconces. The doctor walked to the
      glass, took snuff, and burnished his waistcoat before he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, a fortune lies under every virtue we assume,&rdquo; he recited. &ldquo;But she
      is not for you, Richard,&rdquo; says he, tapping his box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carvel, if you please,&rdquo; I replied. I felt the demon within me. But I
      had the sense to realize that a quarrel with Dr. Courtenay, under the
      circumstances, would be far from wise. He had no intention of quarrelling,
      however. He made me a grand bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carvel, your very obedient. Hereafter I shall know better than to
      forget myself with an overseer.&rdquo; And he gave me his back. &ldquo;What say you to
      a game of billiards, Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip seemed glad to escape. And soon I heard their voices, mingling with
      the click of the balls. There followed for me one of the bitterest half
      hours I have had in my life. Then Patty opened the hall door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come in for a moment, Richard?&rdquo; she said, quite calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed her, wondering at the masterful spirit she had shown. For there
      was Tom all askew in his chair, his feet one way and his hands another,
      totally subdued. What was most to the point, he made me an elaborate
      apology. How she had sobered his mind I know not. His body was as helpless
      as the day he was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before the guests thought of rising the next morning, Patty came to
      me as I was having the mare saddled. The sun was up, and the clouds were
      being chased, like miscreants who have played their prank, and were now
      running for it. The sharp air brought the red into her cheeks. And for the
      first time in her life with me she showed shyness. She glanced up into my
      face, and then down at the leaves running on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope they will go to-day,&rdquo; said she, when I was ready to mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to tighten the girths, venting my feelings on Firefly until the
      animal swung around and made a vicious pass at my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not worry over that senseless speech of Tom's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it in a properer light now, Patty,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I usually do&mdash;in
      the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so&mdash;high-strung,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was afraid you would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer until I had repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very silly,&rdquo; she said slowly, her colour mounting even higher,&rdquo; I
      was afraid that you would&mdash;leave us.&rdquo; Stroking the mare's neck, and
      with a little halt in her voice, &ldquo;I do not know what we should do without
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, I was beginning to think I would better leave, though where I
      should go was more than I could say. With a quick intuition she caught my
      hand as I put foot in the stirrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not go away!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Say you will not! What would poor
      father do? He is not so well as he used to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wild appeal in her eyes frightened me. It was beyond resisting. In
      great agitation I put my foot to the ground again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patty, I should be a graceless scamp in truth,&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;I do not
      forget that your father gave me a home when mine was taken away, and has
      made me one of his family. I shall thank God if I can but lighten some of
      his burdens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they did not depart that day, nor the next; nor, indeed, for a week
      after. For Philip's cold brought on a high fever. He stuck to his bed, and
      Patty herself made broth and dainties for him, and prescribed him medicine
      out of the oak chest whence had come so much comfort. At first Philip
      thought he would die, and forswore wine and cards, and some other things
      the taste for which he had cultivated, and likewise worse vices that had
      come to him by nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am greatly pleased to write that the stay profited the gallant Dr.
      Courtenay nothing. Patty's mature beauty and her manner of carrying off
      the episode in the hall had made a deep impression upon the Censor. I read
      the man's mind in his eye; here was a match to mend his fortunes, and do
      him credit besides. However, his wit and his languishing glances and
      double meanings fell on barren ground. No tire-woman on the plantation was
      busier than Patty during the first few days of his stay. After that he
      grew sulky and vented his spleen on poor Tom, winning more money from him
      at billiards and picquet. Since the doctor was too much the macaroni to
      ride to hounds and to shoot ducks, time began to hang exceeding heavy on
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patty and I had many a quiet laugh over his predicament. And, to add zest
      to the situation, I informed Singleton of what was going forward. He came
      over every night for supper, and to my delight the bluff Englishman was
      received in a fashion to make the doctor writhe and snort with
      mortification. Never in his life had he been so insignificant a person.
      And he, whose conversation was so sought after in the gay season in town,
      was thrown for companionship upon a scarce-grown boy whose talk was about
      as salted, and whose intellect as great, as those of the cockerouse in our
      fable. He stood it about a se'nnight, at the end of which space Philip was
      put on his horse, will-he-nill-he, and made to ride northward.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat with my cousin of an evening as he lay in bed. Not, I own, from any
      charity on my part, but from other motives which do me no credit. The
      first night he confessed his sins, and they edified me not a little. On
      the second he was well enough to sit up and swear, and to vow that Miss
      Swain was an angel; that he would marry her the very next week and his
      father Grafton were not such a stickler for family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse him,&rdquo; says his dutiful and loyal son, &ldquo;he is so bally stingy with
      my stipend that I am in debt to half the province. And I say it myself,
      Richard, he has been a blackguard to you, tho' I allow him some little
      excuse. You were faring better now, my dear cousin, and you had not given
      him every reason to hate you. For I have heard him declare more than once
      'pon my soul, I have&mdash;that he would rather you were his friend than
      his enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My contempt for Philip kept me silent here. I might quarrel with Grafton,
      who had sense enough to feel pain at a well deserved thrust. Philip had
      not the intelligence to recognize insult from compliment. It was but
      natural he should mistake my attitude now. He leaned forward in his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark you, Richard,&rdquo; whispers he, with a glance at the door, &ldquo;I might tell
      you some things and I chose, and&mdash;and it were worth my while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth your while?&rdquo; I repeated vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He traced nervously the figures on the counterpane. Next came a rush of
      anger to redden his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Gad, I will tell you. Swear to Gad I will.&rdquo; Then, the little cunning
      inherited from his father asserting itself, he added, &ldquo;Look you, Richard,
      I am the son of one of the richest men in the colony, and I get the
      pittance of a backwoods pastor. I tell you 'tis not to be borne with. And
      I am not of as much consideration at the Hall as Brady, the Irish convict,
      who has become overseer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I little wondered at this. Philip sank back, and for some moments eyed me
      between narrowed lids. He continued presently with shortened breath:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have evidence&mdash;I have evidence to get you back a good share of the
      estate, which my father will never miss. And I will do it,&rdquo; he cries,
      suddenly bold, &ldquo;I will do it for three thousand pounds down when you
      receive it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was why he had come with Tom to Talbot! I was so dumfounded that my
      speech was quite taken away. Then I got up and began pacing the room. Was
      it not fair to fight a scoundrel with his own weapons? Here at last was
      the witness Mr. Swain had been seeking so long, come of his own free will.
      Then&mdash;Heaven help me!&mdash;my mind flew on. As time had passed I had
      more than once regretted refusing the Kent plantation, which had put her
      from whom my thought never wandered within my reach again. Good Mr. Swain
      had erred for once. 'Twas foolish, indeed, not to accept a portion of what
      was rightfully mine, when no more could be got. And now, if what Philip
      said was true (and I doubted it not), here at last was the chance come
      again to win her without whom I should never be happy. I glanced at my
      cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad's life!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;it is cheap enough. I might have asked you
      double.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you might, and have been refused,&rdquo; I cried hotly. For I believe that
      speech of his recalled me to my senses. It has ever been an instinct with
      me that no real prosperity comes out of double-dealing. And commerce with
      such a sneak sickened me. &ldquo;Go back to your father, Philip, and threaten
      him, and he may make you rich. Such as he live by blackmail. And you may
      add, and you will, that the day of retribution is coming for him.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII. MULTUM IN PARVO
    </h2>
    <p>
      I lost no time after getting to Annapolis in confiding to Mr. Swain the
      conversation I had had with my cousin Philip. And I noticed, as he sat
      listening to my account in the library in Gloucester Street, that the
      barrister looked very worn. He had never been a strong man, and the severe
      strain he had been under with the patriots' business was beginning to
      tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very thoughtful when I had finished, and then told me briefly that
      I had done well not to take the offer. &ldquo;Tucker would have made but short
      work of such evidence, my lad,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I think Master Philip would
      have lied himself in and out a dozen times. I cannot think what witness he
      would have introduced save Mr. Allen. And there is scarcely a doubt that
      your uncle pays him for his silence, for I am told he is living in
      Frederick in a manner far above what he gets from the parish. However,
      Philip has given us something more to work on. It may be that he can put
      hands on the messenger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall bring them to earth yet, Richard, and I live,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And I
      have always meant to ask you whether you ever regretted your decision in
      taking Gordon's Pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you live, sir!&rdquo; I exclaimed, not heeding the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled somewhat sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of one thing I am sure, my lad,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;which is that I have had
      no regrets about taking you. Mr. Bordley has just been here, and tells me
      you are the ablest young man in the province. You see that more eyes than
      mine are upon you. You have proved yourself a man, Richard, and there are
      very few macaronies would have done as you did. I am resolved to add
      another little mite to your salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;little mite&rdquo; was of such a substantial nature that I protested
      strongly against it. I thought of Tom's demands upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could afford to give you double for what you have made off the place,&rdquo;
       he interrupted. &ldquo;But I do not believe in young men having too much.&rdquo; He
      sighed, and turned to his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated. &ldquo;You have spent time and labour upon my case, sir, and have
      asked no fee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall speak of the fee when I win it,&rdquo; he said dryly, &ldquo;and not before.
      How would you like to be clerk this winter to the Committee of
      Correspondence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppose my pleasure was expressed in my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have got you the appointment without much difficulty.
      There are many ways in which you can be useful to the party when not
      helping me with my affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation gave me food for reflection during a week. I was
      troubled about Mr. Swain, and what he had said as to not living kept
      running in my head as I wrote or figured. For I had enough to hold me
      busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the clouds fast gathering on both sides of the Atlantic
      grew blacker, and blacker still. I saw a great change in Annapolis. Men of
      affairs went about with grave faces, while gay and sober alike were
      touched by the spell. The Tory gentry, to be sure, rattled about in their
      gilded mahogany coaches, in spite of jeers and sour looks. My Aunt
      Caroline wore jewelled stomachers to the assemblies,&mdash;now become dry
      and shrivelled entertainments. She kept her hairdresser, had three men in
      livery to her chair, and a little negro in Turk's costume to wait on her.
      I often met her in the streets, and took a fierce joy in staring her, in
      the eye. And Grafton! By a sort of fate I was continually running against
      him. He was a very busy man, was my uncle, and had a kind of dignified
      run, which he used between Marlboro' Street and the Council Chamber in the
      Stadt House, or the Governor's mansion. He never did me the honour to
      glance at me. The Rev. Mr. Allen, too, came a-visiting from Frederick,
      where he had grown stout as an alderman upon the living and its
      perquisites and Grafton's additional bounty. The gossips were busy with
      his doings, for he had his travelling-coach and servant now. He went to
      the Tory balls with my aunt. Once I all but encountered him on the Circle,
      but he ran into Northeast Street to avoid me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that was the winter when the wise foresaw the inevitable, and the
      first sharp split occurred between men who had been brothers. The old
      order of things had plainly passed, and I was truly thankful that my
      grandfather had not lived to witness those scenes. The greater part of our
      gentry stood firm for America's rights, and they had behind them the best
      lawyers in America. After the lawyers came the small planters and most of
      the mechanics. The shopkeepers formed the backbone of King George's
      adherents; the Tory gentry, the clergy, and those holding office under the
      proprietor made the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was all about tea, a word which, since '67, had been steadily
      becoming the most vexed in the language. The East India Company had put
      forth a complaint. They had Heaven knows how many tons getting stale in
      London warehouses, all by reason of our stubbornness, and so it was
      enacted that all tea paying the small American tax should have a rebate of
      the English duties. That was truly a master-stroke, for Parliament to give
      it us cheaper than it could be had at home! To cause his Majesty's
      government to lose revenues for the sake of being able to say they had
      caught and taxed us at last! The happy result is now history, my dears.
      And this is not a history, tho' I wish it were. What occurred at Boston,
      at Philadelphia, and Charleston, has since caused Englishmen, as well as
      Americans, to feel proud. The chief incident in Annapolis I shall mention
      in another chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it became known with us that several cargoes were on their way to the
      colonies, excitement and indignation gained a pitch not reached since the
      Stamp Act. Business came to a standstill, plantations lay idle, and gentry
      and farmers flocked to Annapolis, and held meetings and made resolutions
      anew. On my way of a morning from Mr. Swain's house to his chambers in the
      Circle I would meet as many as a dozen knots of people. Mr. Claude was one
      of the few patriots who reaped reward out of the disturbance, for his inn
      was crowded. The Assembly met, appointed committees to correspond with the
      other colonies, and was prorogued once and again. Many a night I sat up
      until the small hours copying out letters to the committees of Virginia,
      and Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. The gentlemen were wont to dine at
      the Coffee House, and I would sit near the foot of the table, taking notes
      of their plans. 'Twas so I met many men of distinction from the other
      colonies. Colonel Washington came once. He was grown a greater man than
      ever, and I thought him graver than when I had last seen him. I believe a
      trait of this gentleman was never to forget a face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you, Richard?&rdquo; said he. How I reddened when he called me so before
      all the committee. &ldquo;I have heard your story, and it does you vast credit.
      And the gentlemen tell me you are earning laurels, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That first winter of the tea troubles was cold and wet with us, and the
      sun, as if in sympathy with the times, rarely showed his face. Early in
      February our apprehensions concerning Mr. Swain's health were realized.
      One day, without a word to any one, he went to his bed, where Patty found
      him. And I ran all the way to Dr. Leiden's. The doctor looked at him, felt
      his pulse and his chest, and said nothing. But he did not rest that night,
      nor did Patty or I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus I came to have to do with the good barrister's private affairs. I
      knew that he was a rich man, as riches went in our province, but I had
      never tried to guess at his estate. I confess the sums he had paid out in
      Tom's behalf frightened me. With the advice of Mr. Bordley and Mr. Lloyd I
      managed his money as best I could, but by reason of the non-importation
      resolutions there was little chance for good investments,&mdash;no cargoes
      coming and few going. I saw, indeed, that buying the Talbot estate had
      been a fortunate step, since the quantities of wheat we grew there might
      be disposed of in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Leiden was still coming twice a day to Gloucester Street, Mr. Tom
      must needs get into a scrape with one of the ladies of the theatre, and
      come to me in the Circle chambers for one hundred pounds. I told him, in
      despair, that I had no authority to pay out his father's money. &ldquo;And so
      you have become master, sure enough!&rdquo; he cried, in a passion. For he was
      desperate. &ldquo;You have worked your way in vastly well, egad, with your Whig
      committee meetings and speeches. And now he is on his back, and you have
      possession, you choose to cut me off. 'Slife, I know what will be coming
      next!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pulled him into Mr. Swain's private room, where we would be free of the
      clerks. &ldquo;Yes, I am master here,&rdquo; I replied, sadly enough, as he stood
      sullenly before me. &ldquo;I should think you would be ashamed to own it. When I
      came to your father I was content to be overseer in Talbot, and thankful
      for his bounty. 'Tis no fault of mine, but your disgrace, that his son is
      not managing his business, and supporting him in the rights of his
      country. I am not very old, Tom. A year older than you, I believe. But I
      have seen enough of life to prophesy your end and you do not reform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are turned preacher,&rdquo; he says, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid! But I have been in a sponging-house, and tasted the lowest
      dregs. And if this country becomes free, as I think it will some day, such
      as you will be driven to England, and die in the Fleet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not while my father lives,&rdquo; retorts he, and throws aside the oiled silk
      cape with a London name upon it. The day was rainy. I groaned. My
      responsibility lay heavy upon me. And this was not my first scene with
      him. He continued doggedly:&mdash;&ldquo;You have no right to deny me what is
      not yours. 'Twill be mine one day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to accuse me of thoughts that do not occur to men of
      honour,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I am slower to anger than I once was, but I give you
      warning now. Do you know that you will ruin your father in another year
      and you continue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me no answer. I reached for the ledger, and turning the pages,
      called off to him the sums he had spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, have done, d&mdash;n it!&rdquo; he cried, when I was not a third through.
      &ldquo;Are you or are you not to give me the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are to spend it upon an actress?&rdquo; I should have called her by a
      worse name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Actress!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Have you seen her in The Orphan? My soul, she is a
      divinity!&rdquo; Then he shifted suddenly to whining and cringing. &ldquo;I am ruined
      outright, Richard, if I do not get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abjectly he confessed the situation, which had in it enough material for a
      scandal to set the town wagging for a month. And the weight of it would
      fall; as I well knew, upon those who deserved it least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will lend you the money, or, rather, will pay it for you,&rdquo; I said, at
      last. For I was not so foolish as to put it into his hands. &ldquo;You shall
      have the sum under certain conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He agreed to them before they were out of my mouth, and swore in a dozen
      ways that he would repay me every farthing. He was heartily tired of the
      creature, and, true to his nature, afraid of her. That night when the play
      was over I went to her lodging, and after a scene too distressing to dwell
      upon, bought her off.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat with Mr. Swain many an hour that spring, with Patty sewing at the
      window open to the garden. Often, as we talked, unnoticed by her father
      she would drop her work and the tears glisten in her eyes. For the
      barrister's voice was not as strong as it once was, and the cold would not
      seem to lift from his chest. So this able man, who might have sat in the
      seats of Maryland's high reward, was stricken when he was needed most.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was permitted two visitors a day: now 'twas Mr. Carroll and Colonel
      Lloyd, again Colonel Tilghman and Captain Clapsaddle, or Mr. Yaca and Mr.
      Bordley. The gentlemen took turns, and never was their business so
      pressing that they missed their hour. Mr. Swain read all the prints, and
      in his easier days would dictate to me his views for the committee, or a
      letter signed Brutes for Mr. Green to put in the Gazette. So I became his
      mouthpiece at the meetings, and learned to formulate my thoughts and to
      speak clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For fear of confusing this narrative, my dears, I have referred but little
      to her who was in my thoughts night and day, and whose locket I wore,
      throughout all those years, next my heart. I used to sit out under the
      stars at Gordon's Pride, with the river lapping at my feet, and picture
      her the shining centre of all the brilliant scenes I had left, and wonder
      if she still thought of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor have I mentioned that faithful correspondent, and more faithful
      friend, Lord Comyn. As soon as ever I had obtained from Captain Daniel my
      mother's little inheritance, I sent off the debt I owed his Lordship.
      'Twas a year before I got him to receive it; he despatched the money back
      once, saying that I had more need of it than he. I smiled at this, for my
      Lord was never within his income, and I made no doubt he had signed a note
      to cover my indebtedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every letter Comyn writ me was nine parts Dolly, and the rest of his sheet
      usually taken up with Mr. Fox and his calamities: these had fallen upon
      him very thick of late. Lord Holland had been forced to pay out a hundred
      thousand pounds for Charles, and even this enormous sum did not entirely
      free Mr. Fox from the discounters and the hounds. The reason for this
      sudden onslaught was the birth of a boy to his brother Stephen, who was
      heir to the title. &ldquo;When they told Charles of it,&rdquo; Comyn wrote, &ldquo;said he,
      coolly: 'My brother Ste's son is a second Messiah, born for the
      destruction of the Jews.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw no definite signs, as yet, of the conversion of this prodigy, which
      I so earnestly hoped for. He had quarrelled with North, lost his place on
      the Admiralty, and presently the King had made him a Lord of the Treasury,
      tho' more out of fear than love. Once in a while, when he saw Comyn at
      Almack's, he would desire to be remembered to me, and he always spoke of
      me with affection. But he could be got to write to no one, said my Lord,
      with kind exaggeration; nor will he receive letters, for fear he may get a
      dun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, I got no message from Dorothy! Nor had she ever mentioned my name to
      Comyn. He had not seen her for eight months after I left England, as she
      had been taken to the Continent for her health. She came back to London
      more ravishing than before, and (I use his Lordship's somewhat extravagant
      language) her suffering had stamped upon her face even more of character
      and power. She had lost much of her levity, likewise. In short, my Lord
      declared, she was more of the queen than ever, and the mystery which hung
      over the Vauxhall duel had served only to add to her fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy having become cognizant of Mr. Marmaduke's trickery, Chartersea
      seemed to have dropped out of the race. He now spent his time very evenly
      between Spa and Derresley and Paris. Hence I had so much to be thankful
      for,&mdash;that with all my blunders, I had saved her from his Grace. My
      Lord the Marquis of Wells was now most conspicuous amongst her suitors.
      Comyn had nothing particular against this nobleman, saying that he was a
      good fellow, with a pretty fortune. And here is a letter, my dears, in
      which he figures, that I brought to Cordon's Pride that spring:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  &ldquo;10 SOUTH PARADE, BATH,
                    &ldquo;March 12, 1774.

   &ldquo;DEAR RICHARD:&mdash;Miss Manners has come to Bath, with a train behind
   her longer than that which followed good Queen Anne hither, when she
   made this Gehenna the fashion. Her triumphal entry last Wednesday
   was announced by such a peal of the abbey bells as must have cracked
   the metal (for they have not rung since) and started Beau Nash
   a-cursing where he lies under the floor. Next came her serenade by
   the band. Mr. Marmaduke swore they would never have done, and
   squirmed and grinned like Punch when he thought of the fee, for he
   had hoped to get off with a crown, I warrant you. You should have
   seen his face when they would accept no fee at all for the beauty!
   Some wag has writ a verse about it, which was printed, and has set
   the whole pump-room laughing this morning.

   &ldquo;She was led out by Wells in the Seasons last night. As Spring she
   is too bewildering for my pen,&mdash;all primrose and white, with the
   flowers in her blue-black hair. Had Sir Joshua seen her, he would
   never rest content till he should have another portrait. The Duc de
   Lauzun, who contrived to get two dances, might give you a
   description in a more suitable language than English. And there was
   a prodigious deal of jealousy among the fair ones on the benches,
   you may be sure, and much jaundiced comment.

   &ldquo;Some half dozen of us adorers have a mess at the Bear, and have
   offered up a prize for the most appropriate toast on the beauty.
   This is in competition with Mrs. Miller. Have you not heard of her
   among your tobacco-hills? Horry calls her Mrs. 'Calliope' Miller.
   At her place near here, Bath Easton Villa, she has set up a Roman
   vase bedecked with myrtle, and into this we drop our bouts-rimes.
   Mrs. Calliope has a ball every Thursday, when the victors are
   crowned. T'other day the theme was 'A Buttered Muffin,' and her
   Grace of Northumberland was graciously awarded the prize. In faith,
   that theme taxed our wits at the Bear,&mdash;how to weave Miss Dolly's
   charms into a verse on a buttered muffin. I shall not tire you with
   mine. Storer's deserved to win, and we whisper that Mrs. Calliope
   ruled it out through spite. 'When Phyllis eats,' so it began, and I
   vow 'twas devilish ingenious.

   &ldquo;We do nothing but play lasquenet and tennis, and go to the
   assembly, and follow Miss Dolly into Gill's, the pastry-cook's,
   where she goes every morning to take a jelly. The ubiquitous Wells
   does not give us much chance. He writes 'vers de societe' with the
   rest, is high in Mr. Marmaduke's favour, which alone is enough to
   damn his progress. I think she is ill of the sight of him.

   &ldquo;Albeit she does not mourn herself into a tree, I'll take oath your
   Phyllis is true to you, Richard, and would live with you gladly in a
   thatched hut and you asked her. Write me more news of yourself.

                  &ldquo;Your ever affectionate
                         &ldquo;COMYN
</pre>

   &ldquo;P.S. I have had news of you through Mr. Worthington, of your
   colony, who is just arrived here. He tells me that you
   have gained a vast reputation for your plantation, and likewise that
   you are thought much of by the Whig wiseacres, and that you hold
   many seditious offices. He does not call them so. Since your
   modesty will not permit you to write me any of these things, I have
   been imagining you driving slaves with a rawhide, and seeding
   runaway convicts to the mines. Mr. W. is even now paying his
   respects to Miss Manners, and I doubt not trumpeting your praises
   there, for he seems to like you. So I have asked him to join the
   Bear mess. One more unfortunate!

   &ldquo;P.S. I was near forgetting the news about Charles Fox. He sends
   you his love, and tells me to let you know that he has been turned
   out of North's house for good and all. He is sure you will be
   cursed happy over it, and says that you predicted he would go over
   to the Whigs. I can scarce believe that he will. North took a
   whole week to screw up His courage, h-s M-j-sty pricking him every
   day. And then he wrote this:

   &ldquo;'Sir, his Majesty has thought proper to order a new Commission of
   the Treasury to be made out, in which I do not see your name.' Poor
   Charles! He is now without money or place, but as usual appears to
   worry least of all of us, and still reads his damned Tasso for
   amusement.
                       &ldquo;C.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Perchance he was to be the Saint Paul of English politics, after all.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIX. LIBERTY LOSES A FRIEND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Bordley's sloop took Mr. Swain to Gordon's Pride in May, and placed
      him in the big room overlooking the widening river. There he would lie all
      day long, staring through the leaves at the water, or listening to the
      sweet music of his daughter's voice as she read from the pompous prints of
      the time. Gentlemen continued to come to the plantation, for the
      barrister's wisdom was sorely missed at the councils. One day, as I rode
      in from the field, I found Colonel Lloyd just arrived from Philadelphia,
      sipping sangaree on the lawn and mopping himself with his handkerchief.
      His jolly face was troubled. He waved his hand at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Richard,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;we children are to have our first whipping. At
      least one of us. And the rest are resolved to defy our parent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boston, Mr. Lloyd?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Boston,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;her port is closed, and we are forbid any
      intercourse with her until she comes to her senses. And her citizens must
      receive his gracious Majesty's troopers into their houses. And if a man
      kill one of them by any chance, he is to go to England to be tried. And
      there is more quite as bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis bad enough!&rdquo; I cried, flinging myself down. And Patty gave me a
      glass in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but you must hear all,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;our masters are of a mind to do the
      thing thoroughly. Canada is given some score of privileges. Her French
      Roman Catholics, whom we fought not long since, are thrown a sop, and
      those vast territories between the lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi are
      given to Quebec as a price for her fidelity. And so, if the worst comes to
      worst, George's regiments will have a place to land against us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the news, and though we were some hundreds of miles from
      Massachusetts, we felt their cause as our own. There was no need of the
      appeal which came by smoking horses from Philadelphia, for the indignation
      of our people was roused to the highest pitch. Now Mr. Swain had to take
      to his bed from the excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a history, my dears, as I have said. And time is growing
      short. I shall pass over that dreary summer of '74. It required no very
      keen eye to see the breakers ahead, and Mr. Bordley's advice to provide
      against seven years of famine did not go unheeded. War was the last thing
      we desired. We should have been satisfied with so little, we colonies! And
      would have voted the duties ten times over had our rights been respected.
      Should any of you doubt this, you have but to read the &ldquo;Address to the
      King&rdquo; of our Congress, then sitting in Philadelphia. The quarrel was so
      petty, and so easy of mending, that you of this generation may wonder why
      it was allowed to run. I have tried to tell you that the head of a
      stubborn, selfish, and wilful monarch blocked the way to reconciliation.
      King George the Third is alone to blame for that hatred of race against
      race which already hath done so much evil. And I pray God that a great
      historian may arise whose pen will reveal the truth, and reconcile at
      length those who are, and should be, brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      By October, that most beautiful month of all the year in Maryland, we were
      again in Annapolis: One balmy day 'twas a Friday, I believe, and a gold
      and blue haze hung over the Severn&mdash;Mr. Chase called in Gloucester
      Street to give the barrister news of the Congress, which he had lately
      left. As he came down the stairs he paused for a word with me in the
      library, and remarked sadly upon Mr. Swain's condition. &ldquo;He looks like a
      dying man, Richard,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and we can ill afford to lose him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as we sat talking in subdued tones, the noise of a distant commotion
      arose. We had scarce started to our feet, Mr. Chase and I, when the brass
      knocker resounded, and Mr. Hammond was let in. His wig was awry, and his
      face was flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought to find you here,&rdquo; he said to Mr. Chase. &ldquo;The Anne Arundel
      Committee is to meet at once, and we desire to have you with us.&rdquo;
       Perceiving our blank faces, he added: &ldquo;The 'Peggy Stewart' is in this
      morning with over a ton of tea aboard, consigned to the Williams's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two jumped into a chaise, and I followed afoot, stopped at every
      corner by some excited acquaintance; so that I had the whole story, and
      more, ere I reached Church Street. The way was blocked before the
      committee rooms, and 'twas said that the merchants, Messrs. Williams, and
      Captain Jackson of the brig, were within, pleading their cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the news leaked abroad that Mr. Anthony Stewart, the brig's
      owner, had himself paid the duty on the detested plant. Some hundreds of
      people were elbowing each other in the street, for the most part quiet and
      anxious, until Mr. Hammond appeared and whispered to a man at the door. In
      all my life before I had never heard the hum of an angry crowd. The sound
      had something ominous in it, like the first meanings of a wind that is to
      break off great trees at their trunks. Then some one shouted: &ldquo;To Hanover
      Street! To Hanover Street! We'll have him tarred and feathered before the
      sun is down!&rdquo; The voice sounded strangely like Weld's. They charged at
      this cry like a herd of mad buffalo, the weaker ones trampled under foot
      or thrust against the wall. The windows of Mr. Aikman's shop were
      shattered. I ran with the leaders, my stature and strength standing me in
      good stead more than once, and as we twisted into Northwest Street I took
      a glance at the mob behind me, and great was my anxiety at not being able
      to descry one responsible person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stewart's house stood, and stands to-day, amid trim gardens, in plain
      sight of the Severn. Arriving there, the crowd massed in front of it, some
      of the boldest pressing in at the gate and spreading over the circle of
      lawn enclosed by the driveway. They began to shout hoarsely, with what
      voices they had left, for Mr. Stewart to come out, calling him names not
      to be spoken, and swearing they would show him how traitors were to be
      served. I understood then the terror of numbers, and shuddered. A
      chandler, a bold and violent man, whose leather was covered with grease,
      already had his foot on the steps, when the frightened servants slammed
      the door in his face, and closed the lower windows. In vain I strained my
      eyes for some one who might have authority with them. They began to pick
      up stones, though none were thrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a figure appeared at an upper window,&mdash;a thin and wasted
      woman dressed in white, with sad, sweet features. It was Mrs. Stewart.
      Without flinching she looked down upon the upturned faces; but a mob of
      that kind has no pity. Their leaders were the worst class in our province,
      being mostly convicts who had served their terms of indenture. They
      continued to call sullenly for &ldquo;the traitor.&rdquo; Then the house door opened,
      and the master himself appeared. He was pale and nervous, and no wonder;
      and his voice shook as he strove to make himself heard. His words were
      drowned immediately by shouts of &ldquo;Seize him! Seize the d&mdash;d traitor!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;A pot and a coat of hot tar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those who were nearest started forward, and I with them. With me 'twas the
      decision of an instant. I beat the chandler up the steps, and took stand
      in front of the merchant, and I called out to them to fall back.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my astonishment they halted. The skirts of the crowd were now come to
      the foot of the little porch. I faced them with my hand on Mr. Stewart's
      arm, without a thought of what to do next, and expecting violence. There
      was a second's hush. Then some one cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three cheers for Richard Carvel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They gave them with a will that dumfounded me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said I, when I had got my wits, &ldquo;this is neither the justice
      nor the moderation for which our province is noted. You have elected your
      committee of your free wills, and they have claims before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, the committee!&rdquo; they shouted. &ldquo;Mr. Carvel is right. Take him to
      the Committee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stewart raised his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he began, as I had done, &ldquo;when you have learned the truth,
      you will not be so hasty to blame me for an offence of which I am
      innocent. The tea was not for me. The brig was in a leaky and dangerous
      state and had fifty souls aboard her. I paid the duty out of humanity&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had come so far, when they stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a vile Tory!&rdquo; they shouted. &ldquo;He is conniving with the Council. 'Twas
      put up between them.&rdquo; And they followed this with another volley of hard
      names, until I feared that his chance was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would best go before the Committee, Mr. Stewart,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go with Mr. Carvel, my friends,&rdquo; he cried at once. And he invited
      me into the house whilst he ordered his coach. I preferred to remain
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked them if they would trust me with Mr. Stewart to Church Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Mr. Carvel, we know you,&rdquo; said several. &ldquo;He has good cause to
      hate Tories,&rdquo; called another, with a laugh. I knew the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, Weld,&rdquo; I cried. And I saw McNeir, who was a stanch friend of
      mine, give him a cuff to send him spinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my vast satisfaction they melted away, save only a few of the idlest
      spirits, who hung about the gate, and cheered as we drove off. Mr. Stewart
      was very nervous, and profuse in his gratitude. I replied that I had acted
      only as would have any other responsible citizen. On the way he told me
      enough of his case to convince me that there was much to be said on his
      side, but I thought it the better part of wisdom not to commit myself. The
      street in front of the committee rooms was empty, and I was informed that
      a town meeting had been called immediately at the theatre in West Street.
      And I advised Mr. Stewart to attend. But through anxiety or anger, or
      both, he was determined not to go, and drove back to his house without me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had got as far as St. Anne's, halfway to the theatre, when it suddenly
      struck me that Mr. Swain must be waiting for news. With a twinge I
      remembered what Mr. Chase had said about the barrister's condition, and I
      hurried back to Gloucester Street, much to the surprise of those I met on
      their way to the meeting. I was greatly relieved, when I arrived, to find
      Patty on the porch. I knew she had never been there were her father worse.
      After a word with her and her mother, I went up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the hour for the barrister's nap. But he was awake, lying back on
      the pillows, with his eyes half closed. He was looking out into the
      garden, which was part orchard, now beginning to shrivel and to brown with
      the first touch of frosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is you, Richard?&rdquo; he inquired, without moving. &ldquo;What is going
      forward to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I toned down the news, so as not to excite him, and left out the
      occurrence in Hanover Street. He listened with his accustomed interest,
      but when I had done he asked no questions, and lay for a long time silent.
      Then he begged me to bring my chair nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&mdash;my son,&rdquo; said he, with an evident effort, &ldquo;I have never
      thanked you for your devotion to me and mine through the best years of
      your life. It shall not go unrewarded, my lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if my heart stood still with the presage of what was to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God reward you, sir!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wished to speak to you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and I may not have another
      chance. I have arranged with Mr. Carroll, the barrister, to take your
      cause against your uncle, so that you will lose nothing when I am gone.
      And you will see, in my table in the library, that I have left my property
      in your hands, with every confidence in your integrity, and ability to
      care for my family, even as I should have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not speak at once. A lump rose in my throat, for I had come to
      look upon him as a father. His honest dealings, his charity, of which the
      world knew nothing, and his plain and unassuming ways had inspired in me a
      kind of worship. I answered, as steadily as I might:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I am too inexperienced for such a responsibility, Mr. Swain.
      Would it not be better that Mr. Bordley or Mr. Lloyd should act?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am not a man to do things unadvisedly, or to let
      affection get the better of my judgment, where others dear to me are
      concerned. I know you, Richard Carvel. Scarce an action of yours has
      escaped my eye, though I have said nothing. You have been through the
      fire, and are of the kind which comes out untouched. You will have Judge
      Bordley's advice, and Mr. Carroll's. And they are too busy with the
      affairs of the province to be burdened as my executors. But,&rdquo; he added a
      little more strongly, &ldquo;if what I fear is coming, Mr. Bordley will take the
      trust in your absence. If we have war, Richard, you will not be content to
      remain at home, nor would I wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do what I ask?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would refuse you nothing, Mr. Swain,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;But I have heavy
      misgivings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed. &ldquo;And now, if it were not for Tom, I might die content,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were not for Tom! The full burden of the trust began to dawn upon me
      then. Presently I heard him speaking, but in so low a voice that I hardly
      caught the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In our youth, Richard,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;the wrath of the Almighty is but
      so many words to most of us. When I was little more than a lad, I
      committed a sin of which I tremble now to think. And I was the fool to
      imagine, when I amended my life, that God had forgotten. His punishment is
      no heavier than I deserve. But He alone knows what He has made me suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt that I had no right to be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I have paid Tom's debts,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;I cannot cast off my
      son. I have reasoned, implored, and appealed in vain. He is like Reuben,&mdash;his
      resolutions melt in an hour. And I have pondered day and night what is to
      be done for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he to have his portion?&rdquo; I asked. Indeed, the thought of the
      responsibility of Tom Swain overwhelmed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is to have it,&rdquo; cried Mr. Swain, with a violence to bring on a
      fit of coughing. &ldquo;Were I to leave it in trust for a time, he would have it
      mortgaged within a year. He is to have his portion, but not a penny
      additional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lay for a long time breathing deeply, I watching him. Then, as he
      reached out and took my hand, I knew by some instinct what was to come. I
      summoned all my self-command to meet his eye. I knew that the malicious
      and unthinking gossip of the town had reached him, and that he had
      received it in the simple faith of his hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing more, my lad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the dearest wish of all&mdash;that you
      will marry Patty. She is a good girl, Richard. And I have thought,&rdquo; he
      added with hesitation, &ldquo;I have thought that she loves you, though her lips
      have never opened on that subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the blow fell. I turned away, for to save my life the words would not
      come. He missed the reason of my silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand and honour your scruples,&rdquo; he went on. His kindness was like
      a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have had none, Mr. Swain,&rdquo; I exclaimed. For I would not be thought
      a hypocrite.
    </p>
    <p>
      There I stopped. A light step sounded in the hall, and Patty came in upon
      us. Her colour at once betrayed her understanding. To my infinite relief
      her father dropped my fingers, and asked cheerily if there was any news
      from the town meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following Wednesday, with her flag flying and her sails set, the
      Peggy Stewart was run ashore on Windmill Point. She rose, a sacrifice to
      Liberty, in smoke to heaven, before the assembled patriots of our city.
    </p>
    <p>
      That very night a dear friend to Liberty passed away. He failed so
      suddenly that Patty had no time to call for aid, and when the mother had
      been carried in, his spirit was flown. We laid him high on the hill above
      the creek, in the new lot he had bought and fenced around. The stone
      remains:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                HERE LIETH

            HENRY SWAIN, BARRISTER.

      The simple inscription, which speaks volumes to those who knew him, was
      cut after the Revolution. He was buried with the honours of a statesman,

      was born so soon after his death.

      CHAPTER L. FAREWELL TO GORDON'S
    </h2>
    <p>
      I cannot bear to recall my misery of mind after Mr. Swain's death. One
      hope had lightened all the years of my servitude. For, when I examined my
      soul, I knew that it was for Dorothy I had laboured. And every letter that
      came from Comyn telling me she was still free gave me new heart for my
      work. By some mystic communion&mdash;I know not what&mdash;I felt that she
      loved me yet, and despite distance and degree. I would wake of a morning
      with the knowledge of it, and be silent for half the day with some
      particle of a dream in my head, lingering like the burden of a song with
      its train of memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in the days that followed, I scarce knew myself. For a while (I shame
      to write it) I avoided that sweet woman who had made my comfort her care,
      whose father had taken me when I was homeless. The good in me cried out,
      but the flesh rebelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Patty! Her grief for her father was pathetic to see. Weeks passed in
      which she scarcely spoke a word. And I remember her as she sat in church
      Sundays, the whiteness of her face enhanced by the crape she wore, and a
      piteous appeal in her gray eyes. My own agony was nigh beyond endurance,
      my will swinging like a pendulum from right to wrong, and back again.
      Argue as I might that I had made the barrister no promise, conscience
      allowed no difference. I was in despair at the trick fate had played me;
      at the decree that of all women I must love her whose sphere was now so
      far removed from mine. For Patty had character and beauty, and every gift
      which goes to make man's happiness and to kindle his affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sorrow left her more womanly than ever. And after the first sharp
      sting of it was deadened, I noticed a marked reserve in her intercourse
      with me. I knew then that she must have strong suspicions of her father's
      request. Speak I could not soon after the sad event, but I strove hard
      that she should see no change in my conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Christmas we went to the Eastern Shore. In Annapolis fife and drum
      had taken the place of fiddle and clarion; militia companies were drilling
      in the empty streets; despatches were arriving daily from the North; and
      grave gentlemen were hurrying to meetings. But if the war was to come, I
      must settle what was to be done at Gordon's Pride with all possible speed.
      It was only a few days after our going there, that I rode into Oxford with
      a black cockade in my hat Patty had made me, and the army sword Captain
      Jack had given Captain Daniel at my side. For I had been elected a
      lieutenant in the Oxford company, of which Percy Singleton was captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed that winter, the darkest of my life. One soft spring day, when
      the birds were twittering amid new-born leaves, and the hyacinths and
      tulips in Patty's garden were coming to their glory, Master Tom rode
      leisurely down the drive at Gordon's Pride. That was a Saturday, the 29th
      of April, 1775. The news which had flown southward, night and day alike,
      was in no hurry to run off his tongue; he had been lolling on the porch
      for half an hour before he told us of the bloodshed between the minute-men
      of Massachusetts and the British regulars, of the rout of Percy's panting
      redcoats from Concord to Boston. Tom added, with the brutal nonchalance
      which characterized his dealings with his mother and sister, that he was
      on his way to Philadelphia to join a company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor invalid was carried up the stairs in a faint by Banks and Romney.
      Patty, with pale face and lips compressed, ran to fetch the hartshorn. But
      Master Tom remained undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are going, Richard,&rdquo; he remarked affably. For he treated me
      with more consideration than his family. &ldquo;We shall ride together,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ride different ways, and to different destinations,&rdquo; I replied dryly.
      &ldquo;I go to serve my country, and you to fight against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the King is right,&rdquo; he answered sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I remarked, and rose. &ldquo;Then you have studied the
      question since last I saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by G-d!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and I never will. I do not want to know your d&mdash;d
      principles&mdash;or grievances, or whatever they are. We were living an
      easy life, in the plenty of money, and nothing to complain of. You take it
      all away, with your cursed cant&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left him railing and swearing. And that was the last I saw of Tom Swain.
      When I returned from a final survey of the plantation; and a talk with
      Percy Singleton, he had ridden North again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Patty alone in the parlour. Her work (one of my own stockings she
      was darning) lay idle in her lap, and in her eyes were the unshed tears
      which are the greatest suffering of women. I sat down beside her and
      called her name. She did not seem to hear me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started. And my courage ebbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to the war&mdash;to leave us, Richard?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear there is no choice, Patty,&rdquo; I answered, striving hard to keep my
      own voice steady. &ldquo;But you will be well looked after. Ivie Rawlinson is to
      be trusted, and Mr. Bordley has promised to keep an eye upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took up the darning mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not speak a word to keep you, Richard. He would have wished it,&rdquo;
       she said softly. &ldquo;And every strong arm in the colonies will be needed. We
      shall think of you, and pray for you daily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I cast about for a cheerful reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think when they discover how determined we are, they will revoke their
      measures in a hurry. Before you know it, Patty, I shall be back again
      making the rounds in my broad rim, and reading to you out of Captain
      Cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a pitiful attempt. She shook her head sadly. The tears were come
      now, and she was smiling through them. The sorrow of that smile!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something to say to you before I go, Patty,&rdquo; I said. The words
      stuck. I knew that there must be no pretence in that speech. It must be
      true as my life after, the consequence of it. &ldquo;I have something to ask
      you, and I do not speak without your father's consent. Patty, if I return,
      will you be my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stocking slipped unheeded to the floor. For a moment she sat
      transfixed, save for the tumultuous swelling of her breast. Then she
      turned and gazed earnestly into my face, and the honesty of her eyes smote
      me. For the first time I could not meet them honestly with my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, do you love me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed my head. I could not answer that. And for a while there was no
      sound save that of the singing of the frogs in the distant marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I knew that she was standing at my side. I felt her hand laid
      upon my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is it Dorothy?&rdquo; she said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still I could not answer. Truly, the bitterness of life, as the joy of it,
      is distilled in strong drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I have known ever since that autumn morning when
      I went to you as you saddled&mdash;when I dreaded that you would leave us.
      Father asked you to marry me, the day you took Mr. Stewart from the mob.
      How could you so have misunderstood me, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked up in wonder. The sweet cadence in her tone sprang from a purity
      not of this earth. They alone who have consecrated their days to others
      may utter it. And the light upon her face was of the same source. It was
      no will of mine brought me to my feet. But I was not worthy to touch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall make another prayer, beside that for your safety, Richard,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning she waved me a brave farewell from the block where she had
      stood so often as I rode afield, when the dawn was in the sky. The invalid
      mother sat in her chair within the door; the servants were gathered on the
      lawn, and Ivie Rawlinson and Banks lingered where they had held my
      stirrup. That picture is washed with my own tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earth was praising God that Sunday as I rode to Mr. Bordley's. And as
      it is sorrow which lifts us nearest to heaven, I felt as if I were in
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      I arrived at Wye Island in season to dine with the good judge and his
      family, and there I made over to his charge the property of Patty and her
      mother. The afternoon we spent in sober talk, Mr. Bordley giving me much
      sound advice, and writing me several letters of recommendation to
      gentlemen in Congress. His conduct was distinguished by even more of
      kindness and consideration than he had been wont to show me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening I walked out alone, skirting the acres of Carvel Hall, each
      familiar landmark touching the quick of some memory of other days.
      Childhood habit drew me into the path to Wilmot House. I came upon it just
      as the sunlight was stretching level across the Chesapeake, and burning
      its windows molten red. I had been sitting long on the stone steps, when
      the gaunt figure of McAndrews strode toward me out of the dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be gude to us, it is Mr. Richard!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I hae na seen ye're
      bonny face these muckle years, sir, sync ye cam' back frae ae sight o' the
      young mistress.&rdquo; (I had met him in Annapolis then.) &ldquo;An' will ye be aff to
      the wars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him yes. That I had come for a last look at the old place before I
      left.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed. &ldquo;Ye're vera welcome, sir.&rdquo; Then he added: &ldquo;Mr. Bordley's gi'en
      me a fair notion o' yere management at Gordon's. The judge is thinking
      there'll be nane ither lad t' hand a candle to ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what news do you hear from London?&rdquo; I asked, cutting him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill uncos, sir,&rdquo; he answered, shaking his head with violence. He had
      indeed but a sorry tale for my ear, and one to make my heart heavier than
      it was. McAndrews opened his mind to me, and seemed the better for it. How
      Mr. Marmaduke was living with the establishment they wrote of was more
      than the honest Scotchman could imagine. There was a country place in
      Sussex now, said he, that was the latest. And drafts were coming in before
      the wheat was in the ear; and the plantations of tobacco on the Western
      Shore had been idle since the non-exportation, and were mortgaged to their
      limit to Mr. Willard. Money was even loaned on the Wilmot House estate.
      McAndrews had a shrewd suspicion that neither Mrs. Manners nor Miss
      Dorothy knew aught of this state of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Richard,&rdquo; he said earnestly, as he bade me good-by, &ldquo;I kennt Mr.
      Manners's mind when he lea'd here. There was a laird in't, sir, an' a
      fortune. An' unless these come soon, I'm thinking I can spae th' en'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth, a much greater fool than McAndrews might have predicted that
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday Judge Bordley accompanied me as far as Dingley's tavern, and
      showed much emotion at parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need have no fears for your friends at Gordon's Pride, Richard,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;And when the General comes back, I shall try to give him a good
      account of my stewardship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General! That title brought old Stanwix's cobwebbed prophecy into my
      head again. Here, surely, was the war which he had foretold, and I ready
      to embark in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why not the sea, indeed?

      CHAPTER LI. HOW AN IDLE PROPHECY CAME TO PASS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Captain Clapsaddle not being at his lodgings, I rode on to the Coffee
      House to put up my horse. I was stopped by Mr. Claude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I thought you on the Eastern Shore. There is
      a gentleman within will be mightily tickled to see you, or else his
      protestations are lies, which they may very well be. His name? Now, 'Pon
      my faith, it was Jones&mdash;no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This thing of being called for at the Coffee House stirred up unpleasant
      associations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What appearance does the man make?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful gad!&rdquo; mine host exclaimed; &ldquo;once seen, never forgotten, and once
      heard, never forgotten. He quotes me Thomson, and he tells me of his
      estate in Virginia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was not of a sort to allay my suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he appears to be a landowner?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ods! Blest if I know what he is,&rdquo; says Mr. Claude. &ldquo;He may be anything,
      an impostor or a high-mightiness. But he's something to strike the eye and
      hold it, for all his Quaker clothes. He is swarth and thickset, and some
      five feet eight inches&mdash;full six inches under your own height. And he
      comes asking for you as if you owned the town between you. 'Send a fellow
      to Marlboro' Street for Mr. Richard Carvel, my good host!' says he, with a
      snap of his fingers. And when I tell him the news of you, he is
      prodigiously affected, and cries&mdash;but here's my gentleman now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I jerked my head around. Coming down the steps I beheld my old friend and
      benefactor, Captain John Paul!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahoy, ahoy!&rdquo; cries he. &ldquo;Now Heaven be praised, I have found you at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out of the saddle I leaped, and straight into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold, hold, Richard!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;My ribs, man! Leave me some breath that
      I may tell you how glad I am to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jones!&rdquo; I said, holding him out, &ldquo;now where the devil got you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I am become a gentleman since I saw you,&rdquo; he answered, smiling. &ldquo;My
      poor brother left me his estate in Virginia. And a gentleman must have
      three names at the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dropped his shoulders and shook with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Jones!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;'Ad's heart! could you go no higher? Has your
      imagination left you, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Republican simplicity, sir,&rdquo; says he, looking a trifle hurt. But I
      laughed the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have contrived to mix oil and vinegar,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;A landed
      gentleman and republican simplicity. I'll warrant you wear silk-knit under
      that gray homespun, and have a cameo in your pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head, looking up at me with affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have guessed better,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;All of quality I have about
      me are an enamelled repeater and a gold brooch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This made me suddenly grave, for McAndrews's words had been ringing in my
      ears ever since he had spoken them. I hitched my arm into the captain's
      and pulled him toward the Coffee House door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you have not dined, and neither have I. We shall be merry
      to-day, and you shall have some of the best Madeira in the colonies.&rdquo; I
      commanded a room, that we might have privacy. As he took his seat opposite
      me I marked that he had grown heavier and more browned. But his eye had
      the same unfathomable mystery in it as of yore. And first I upbraided him
      for not having writ me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took you for one who glories in correspondence, captain,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and
      I did not think you could be so unfaithful. I directed twice to you in Mr.
      Orchardson's care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orchardson died before I had made one voyage,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and the Betsy
      changed owners. But I did not forget you, Richard, and was resolved but
      now not to leave Maryland until I had seen you. But I burn to hear of
      you,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I have had an inkling of your story from the landlord. So
      your grandfather is dead, and that blastie, your uncle, of whom you told
      me on the John, is in possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He listened to my narrative keenly, but with many interruptions. And when
      I was done, he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are always finding friends, Richard,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;no matter what your
      misfortunes, they are ever double discounted. As for me; I am like Fulmer
      in Mr. Cumberland's 'West Indian': 'I have beat through every quarter of
      the compass; I have bellowed for freedom; I have offered to serve my
      country; I have'&mdash;I am engaging to betray it. No, Scotland is no
      longer my country, and so I cannot betray her. It is she who has betrayed
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell into a short mood of dejection. And, indeed, I could not but
      reflect that much of the character fitted him like a jacket. Not the
      betrayal of his country. He never did that, no matter how roundly they
      accused him of it afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      To lift him, I cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were one of my first friends, Captain Paul&rdquo; (I could not stomach the
      Jones); &ldquo;but for you I should now be a West Indian, and a miserable one,
      the slave of some unmerciful hidalgo. Here's that I may live to repay
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And while we are upon toasts,&rdquo; says he, bracing immediately, &ldquo;I give you
      the immortal Miss Manners! Her beauty has dwelt unfaded in my memory since
      I last beheld her, aboard the Betsy.&rdquo; Remarking the pain in my face, he
      added, with a concern which may have been comical: &ldquo;And she is not
      married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless she is lately gone to Gretna, she is not,&rdquo; I replied, trying to
      speak lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alack! I knew it,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And if there's any prophecy in my
      bones, she'll be Mrs. Carvel one of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well captain,&rdquo; I said abruptly, &ldquo;the wheel has gone around since I saw
      you. Now it is you who are the gentleman, while I am a factor. Is it the
      bliss you pictured?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suspected that his acres were not as broad, nor his produce as salable,
      as those of Mount Vernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To speak truth, I am heartily tired of that life,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There is
      little glory in raising nicotia, and sipping bumbo, and cursing negroes.
      Ho for the sea!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The salt sea, and the British prizes. Give me
      a tight frigate that leaves a singing wake. Mark me, Richard,&rdquo; he said, a
      restless gleam coning into his dark eyes, &ldquo;stirring times are here, and a
      chance for all of us to make a name.&rdquo; For so it seemed ever to be with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are black times, I fear,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No, glorious is your word. And we are to have an
      upheaval to throw many of us to the top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather the quarrel were peacefully settled,&rdquo; said I, gravely.
      &ldquo;For my part, I want no distinction that is to come out of strife and
      misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He regarded me quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are grown an hundred years old since I pulled you out of the sea,&rdquo;
       says he. &ldquo;But we shall have to fight for our liberties. Here is a glass to
      the prospect!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you are now an American?&rdquo; I said curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, strake and keelson,&mdash;as good a one as though I had got my sap in
      the Maine forests. A plague of monarchs, say I. They are a blotch upon
      modern civilization. And I have here,&rdquo; he continued, tapping his pocket,
      &ldquo;some letters writ to the Virginia printers, signed Demosthenes, which Mr.
      Randolph and Mr. Henry have commended. To speak truth, Richard, I am off
      to Congress with a portmanteau full of recommendations. And I was resolved
      to stop here even till I secured your company. We shall sweep the seas
      together, and so let George beware!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled. But my blood ran faster at the thought of sailing under such a
      captain. However, I made the remark that Congress had as yet no army, let
      alone a navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And think you that gentlemen of such spirit and resources will lack
      either for long?&rdquo; he demanded, his eye flashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I know nothing of a ship save the little I learned on the John,&rdquo; I
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were born for the sea, Richard,&rdquo; he exclaimed, raising his glass
      high. &ldquo;And I would rather have one of your brains and strength and
      handiness than any merchant's mate I ever sailed with. The more gentlemen
      get commissions, the better will be our new service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant came a knock at the door, and one of the inn negroes to
      say that Captain Clapsaddle was below, and desired to see me. I persuaded
      John Paul to descend with me. We found Captain Daniel seated with Mr.
      Carroll, the barrister, and Mr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; I said to my old friend, &ldquo;I have a rare joy this day in making
      known to you Mr. John Paul Jones, of whom I have spoken to you a score of
      times. He it is whose bravery sank the Black Moll, whose charity took me
      to London, and who got no other reward for his faith than three weeks in a
      debtors' prison. For his honour, as I have told you, would allow him to
      accept none, nor his principles to take the commission in the Royal Navy
      which Mr. Fox offered him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Daniel rose, his honest face flushing with pleasure. &ldquo;Faith, Mr.
      Jones,&rdquo; he cried, when John Paul had finished one of his elaborate bows,
      &ldquo;this is well met, indeed. I have been longing these many years for a
      chance to press your hand, and in the names of those who are dead and gone
      to express my gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my reward now, captain,&rdquo; replied John Paul; &ldquo;a sight of you is to
      have Richard's whole life revealed. And what says Mr. Congreve?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;'For blessings ever wait on virtuous deeds,
        And tho' a late, a sure reward succeeds.'
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tho' I would not have you believe that my deed was virtuous. And you, who
      know Richard, may form some notion of the pleasure I had out of his
      companionship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hastened to present my friend to the other gentlemen, who welcomed him
      with warmth, though they could not keep their amusement wholly out of
      their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jones is now the possessor of an estate in Virginia, sirs,&rdquo; I
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you find it more to your taste than seafaring, Mr. Jones?&rdquo;
       inquired Mr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought forth a most vehement protest, and another quotation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;to be
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       'Fixed like a plant on his peculiar spot,
        To draw nutrition, propagate, and rot,'
</pre>
    <p>
      is an animal's existence. I have thrown it over, sir, with a right good
      will, and am now on my way to Philadelphia to obtain a commission in the
      navy soon to be born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase smiled. John Paul little suspected that he was a member of the
      Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is news indeed, Mr. Jones,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have yet to hear of the
      birth of this infant navy, for which we have not yet begun to make
      swaddling clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not yet an infant state, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Carroll put in, with a shade of
      rebuke. For Maryland was well content with the government she had enjoyed,
      and her best patriots long after shunned the length of secession. &ldquo;I
      believe and pray that the King will come to his senses. And as for the
      navy, it is folly. How can we hope to compete with England on the sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All great things must have a beginning sir,&rdquo; replied John Paul, launching
      forth at once, nothing daunted by such cold conservatism. &ldquo;What Israelite
      brickmaker of Pharaoh's dreamed of Solomon's temple? Nay, Moses himself
      had no conception of it. And God will send us our pillars of cloud and of
      fire. We must be reconciled to our great destiny, Mr. Carroll. No fight
      ever was won by man or nation content with half a victory. We have forests
      to build an hundred armadas, and I will command a fleet and it is given
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen listened in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I' faith, I believe you, sir,&rdquo; cried Captain Daniel, with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others, too, were somehow fallen under the spell of this remarkable
      individuality. &ldquo;What plan would you pursue, sir?&rdquo; asked Mr. Chase,
      betraying more interest than he cared to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What plan, sir!&rdquo; said Captain John Paul, those wonderful eyes of his
      alight. &ldquo;In the first place, we Americans build the fastest ships in the
      world,&mdash;yours of the Chesapeake are as fleet as any. Here, if I am
      not mistaken, one hundred and eighty-two were built in the year '71. They
      are idle now. To them I would issue letters of marque, to harry England's
      trade. From Carolina to Maine we have the wood and iron to build cruisers,
      in harbours that may not easily be got at. And skilled masters and seamen
      to elude the enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a navy must be organized, sir. It must be an unit,&rdquo; objected Mr.
      Carroll. &ldquo;And you would not for many years have force enough, or
      discipline enough, to meet England's navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would never meet it, sir,&rdquo; he replied instantly. &ldquo;That would be the
      height of folly. I would divide our forces into small, swift-sailing
      squadrons, of strength sufficient to repel his cruisers. And I would carry
      the war straight into his unprotected ports of trade. I can name a score
      of such defenceless places, and I know every shoal of their harbours. For
      example, Whitehaven might be entered. That is a town of fifty thousand
      inhabitants. The fleet of merchantmen might with the greatest ease be
      destroyed, a contribution levied, and Ireland's coal cut off for a winter.
      The whole of the shipping might be swept out of the Clyde. Newcastle is
      another likely place, and in almost any of the Irish ports valuable
      vessels may be found. The Baltic and West Indian fleets are to be
      intercepted. I have reflected upon these matters for years, gentlemen.
      They are perfectly feasible. And I'll warrant you cannot conceive the
      havoc and consternation their fulfilment would spread in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the divine power of genius ever made itself felt, 'twas on that May
      evening, at candle-light, in the Annapolis Coffee House. With my own eyes
      I witnessed two able and cautious statesmen of a cautious province
      thrilled to the pitch of enthusiasm by this strange young man of eight and
      twenty. As for good Captain Daniel, enthusiasm is but a poor word to
      express his feelings. A map was sent for and spread out upon the table.
      And it was a late hour when Mr. Chase and Mr. Carroll went home,
      profoundly impressed. Mr. Chase charged John Paul look him up in Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning I bade Captain Daniel a solemn good-by, and rode away
      with John Paul to Baltimore. Thence we took stage to New Castle on the
      Delaware, and were eventually landed by Mr. Tatlow's stage-boat at Crooked
      Billet wharf, Philadelphia.

   A BRIEF SUMMARY, WHICH BRINGS THIS BIOGRAPHY TO THE FAMOUS
   FIGHT OF THE BON HOMME RICHARD AND THE SERAPIS

          BY DANIEL CLAPSADDLE CARVEL
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Richard Carvel refers here to the narrative of his experiences in the
      War of the Revolution, which he had written in the year 1805 or 1806. The
      insertion of that account would swell this book, already too long, out of
      all proportion. Hence I take it upon myself, with apologies, to compress
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until October of that year, 1775, was the infant navy born. Mr. Carvel
      was occupied in the interval in the acquirement of practical seamanship
      and the theory of maritime warfare under the most competent of
      instructors, John Paul Jones. An interesting side light is thrown upon the
      character of that hero by the fact that, with all his supreme confidence
      in his ability, he applied to Congress only for a first lieutenancy. This
      was in deference to the older men before that body. &ldquo;I hoped,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;in that rank to gain much useful knowledge from those of more experience
      than myself.&rdquo; His lack of assertion for once cost him dear. He sailed on
      the New Providence expedition under Commodore Hopkins as first lieutenant
      of the Alfred, thirty; and he soon discovered that, instead of gaining
      information, he was obliged to inform others. He trained the men so
      thoroughly in the use of the great guns &ldquo;that they went through the
      motions of broadsides and rounds exactly as soldiers generally perform the
      manual exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jones was not long in fixing the attention and earning the
      gratitude of the nation, and of its Commander-in-Chief, General
      Washington. While in command of the Providence, twelve four-pounders, his
      successful elusions of the 'Cerberus', which hounded him, and his escape
      from the 'Solebay', are too famous to be dwelt upon here. Obtaining the
      Alfred, he captured and brought into Boston ten thousand suits of uniform
      for Washington's shivering army. Then, by the bungling of Congress,
      thirteen officers were promoted over his head. The bitterness this act
      engendered in the soul of one whose thirst for distinction was as great as
      Captain Jones's may be imagined. To his everlasting credit be it recorded
      that he remained true to the country to which he had dedicated his life
      and his talents. And it was not until 1781 that he got the justice due
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the rough and bluff captains of the American service should have
      regarded a man of Paul Jones's type with suspicion is not surprising. They
      resented his polish and accomplishments, and could not understand his
      language. Perhaps it was for this reason, as well as a reward for his
      brilliant services, that he was always given a separate command. In the
      summer of 1777 he was singled out for the highest gift in the power of the
      United States, nothing less than that of the magnificent frigate 'Indien',
      then building at Amsterdam. And he was ordered to France in command of the
      'Ranger', a new ship then fitting at Portsmouth. Captain Jones was the
      admiration of all the young officers in the navy, and was immediately
      flooded with requests to sail with him. One of his first acts, after
      receiving his command, was to apply to the Marine Committee for Mr.
      Carvel. The favour was granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather had earned much commendation from his superiors. He had
      sailed two cruises as master's mate of the Cabot, and was then serving as
      master of the Trumbull, Captain Saltonstall. This was shortly after that
      frigate had captured the two British transports off New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jones has been at pains to mention in his letters the services
      rendered him by Mr. Carvel in fitting out the Ranger. And my grandfather
      gives a striking picture of the captain. At that time the privateers, with
      the larger inducements of profit they offered, were getting all the best
      seamen. John Paul had but to take two turns with a man across the dock,
      and he would sign papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jones was the first to raise the new flag of the stars and stripes
      over a man-o'-war. They got away on November 14, 1777, with a fair crew
      and a poor lot of officers. Mr. Carvel had many a brush with the mutinous
      first lieutenant Simpson. Family influence deterred the captain from
      placing this man under arrest, and even Dr. Franklin found trouble, some
      years after, in bringing about his dismissal from the service. To add to
      the troubles, the Ranger proved crank and slow-sailing; and she had only
      one barrel of rum aboard, which made the men discontented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bringing the official news of Burgoyne's surrender, which was to cause
      King Louis to acknowledge the independence of the United States, the
      Ranger arrived at Nantes, December 2. Mr. Carvel accompanied Captain Jones
      to Paris, where a serious blow awaited him. The American Commissioners
      informed him that the Indien had been transferred to France to prevent her
      confiscation. That winter John Paul spent striving in vain for a better
      ship, and imbibing tactics from the French admirals. Incidentally, he
      obtained a salute for the American flag. The cruise of the Ranger in
      English waters the following spring was a striking fulfilment, with an
      absurdly poor and inadequate force, of the plan set forth by John Paul
      Jones in the Annapolis Coffee House. His descent upon Whitehaven spread
      terror and consternation broadcast through England, and he was branded as
      a pirate and a traitor. Mr. Carvel was fortunately not of the landing
      party on St. Mary's Isle, which place he had last beheld in John Paul's
      company, on the brigantine John, when entering Kirkcudbright. The object
      of that expedition, as is well known, was to obtain the person of the Earl
      of Selkirk, in order to bring about the rescue of the unfortunate
      Americans suffering in British prisons. After the celebrated capture of
      the sloop-of-war Drake, Paul Jones returned to France a hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Captain Jones was ambitious of personal glory, he may never, at least,
      be accused of mercenary motives. The ragged crew of the Ranger was paid in
      part out of his own pocket, and for a whole month he supported the Drake's
      officers and men, no provision having been made for prisoners. He was at
      large expense in fitting out the Ranger, and he bought back at twice what
      it was worth the plate taken from St. Mary's Isle, getting but a tardy
      recognition from the Earl of Selkirk for such a noble and unheard-of
      action. And, I take pride in writing it, Mr. Carvel spent much of what he
      had earned at Gordon's Pride in a like honourable manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carvel's description of the hero's reception at Versailles is graphic
      and very humorous. For all his republican principles John Paul never got
      over his love of courts, and no man was ever a more thorough courtier. He
      exchanged compliments with Queen Marie Antoinette, who was then in the
      bloom of her beauty, and declared that she was a &ldquo;good girl, and deserved
      to be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unruly Simpson sailed for America in the Ranger in July, Captain Jones
      being retained in France &ldquo;for a particular enterprise.&rdquo; And through the
      kindness of Dr. Franklin, Mr. Carvel remained with him. Then followed
      another period of heartrending disappointment. The fine ship the French
      government promised him was not forthcoming, though Captain Jones wrote a
      volume of beautiful letters to every one of importance, from her Royal
      Highness the Duchess of Chartres to his Most Christian Majesty, Louis,
      King of France and Navarre. At length, when he was sitting one day in
      unusual dejection and railing at the vanity of courts and kings, Mr.
      Carvel approached him with a book in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you there, Richard?&rdquo; the captain demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Franklin's Maxims,&rdquo; replied my grandfather. They were great
      favourites with him. The captain took the book and began mechanically to
      turn over the pages. Suddenly he closed it with a bang, jumped up, and put
      on his coat and hat. Mr. Carvel looked on in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going, sir?&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Paris, sir,&rdquo; says the captain. &ldquo;Dr. Franklin has taught me more wisdom
      in a second than I had in all my life before. 'If you wish to have any
      business faithfully and expeditiously performed, go and do it yourself;
      otherwise, send.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a result of that trip he got the Duras, which he renamed the 'Bon homme
      Richard' in honour of Dr. Franklin. The Duras was an ancient Indiaman with
      a high poop, which made my grandfather exclaim, when he saw her, at the
      remarkable fulfilment of old Stanwix's prophecy. She was perfectly rotten,
      and in the constructor's opinion not worth refitting. Her lowest deck (too
      low for the purpose) was pierced aft with three ports on a side, and six
      worn-out eighteen-pounders mounted there. Some of them burst in the
      action, killing their people. The main battery, on the deck above, was
      composed of twenty-eight twelve-pounders. On the uncovered deck eight
      nine-pounders were mounted. Captain Jones again showed his desire to serve
      the cause by taking such a ship, and not waiting for something better.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the American frigate 'Alliance' had brought Lafayette to
      France, and was added to the little squadron that was to sail with the
      'Bon homme Richard'. One of the most fatal mistakes Congress ever made was
      to put Captain Pierre Landais in command of her, out of compliment to the
      French allies. He was a man whose temper and vagaries had failed to get
      him a command in his own navy. His insulting conduct and treachery to
      Captain Jones are strongly attested to in Mr. Carvel's manuscript: they
      were amply proved by the written statements of other officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squadron sailed from L'Orient in June, but owing to a collision
      between the Bon homme Richard and the Alliance it was forced to put back
      into the Groix roads for repairs. Nails and rivets were with difficulty
      got to hold in the sides of the old Indianian. On August 14th John Paul
      Jones again set sail for English waters, with the following vessels:
      Alliance, thirty-six; Pallas, thirty; Cerf, eighteen; Vengeance, twelve;
      and two French privateers. Owing to the humiliating conditions imposed
      upon him by the French Minister of Marine, Commodore Jones did not have
      absolute command. In a gale on the 26th the two privateers and the Cerf
      parted company, never to return. After the most outrageous conduct off the
      coast of Ireland, Landais, in the 'Alliance', left the squadron on
      September 6th, and did not reappear until the 23d, the day of the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carvel was the third lieutenant of the 'Bon homme Richard', tho' he
      served as second in the action. Her first lieutenant (afterwards the
      celebrated Commodore Richard Dale) was a magnificent man, one worthy in
      every respect of the captain he served. When the hour of battle arrived,
      these two and the sailing master, and a number of raw midshipmen, were the
      only line-officers left, and two French officers of marines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest had been lost in various ways. And the crew of the 'Bon homme
      Richard' was as sorry a lot as ever trod a deck. Less than three score of
      the seamen were American born; near four score were British, inclusive of
      sixteen Irish; one hundred and thirty-seven were French soldiers, who
      acted as marines; and the rest of the three hundred odd souls to fight her
      were from all over the earth,&mdash;Malays and Maltese and Portuguese. In
      the hold were more than one hundred and fifty English prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a vessel and a force, truly, with which to conquer a fifty-gun
      ship of the latest type, and with a picked crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carvel's chapter opens with Landais's sudden reappearance on the
      morning of the day the battle was fought. He shows the resentment and
      anger against the Frenchman felt by all on board, from cabin-boy to
      commodore. But none went so far as to accuse the captain of the 'Alliance'
      of such supreme treachery as he was to show during the action. Cowardice
      may have been in part responsible for his holding aloof from the two duels
      in which the Richard and the Pallas engaged. But the fact that he poured
      broadsides into the Richard, and into her off side, makes it seem probable
      that his motive was to sink the commodore's ship, and so get the credit of
      saving the day, to the detriment of the hero who won it despite all
      disasters. To account for the cry that was raised when first she attacked
      the Richard, it must be borne in mind that the crew of the 'Alliance' was
      largely composed of Englishmen. It was thought that these had mutinied and
      taken her.

      CHAPTER LII. HOW THE GARDENER'S SON FOUGHT THE &ldquo;SERAPIS&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      When I came on deck the next morning our yards were a-drip with a clammy
      fog, and under it the sea was roughed by a southwest breeze. We were
      standing to the northward before it. I remember reflecting as I paused in
      the gangway that the day was Thursday, September the 23d, and that we were
      near two months out of Groix with this tub of an Indiaman. In all that
      time we had not so much as got a whiff of an English frigate, though we
      had almost put a belt around the British Isles. Then straining my eyes
      through the mist, I made out two white blurs of sails on our starboard
      beam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honest Jack Pearce, one of the few good seamen we had aboard, was rubbing
      down one of the nines beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jack,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what have we there? Another prize?&rdquo; For that
      question had become a joke on board the 'Bon homme Richard' since the
      prisoners had reached an hundred and fifty, and half our crew was gone to
      man the ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your 'art, no, sir,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;'Tis that damned Frenchy Landais in
      th' Alliance. She turns up with the Pallas at six bells o' the middle
      watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he's back, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, he's back,&rdquo; he returned, with a grunt that was half a growl; &ldquo;arter
      three weeks breakin' o' liberty. I tell 'ee what, sir, them Frenchies is
      treecherous devils, an' not to be trusted the len'th of a lead line. An'
      they beant seamen eno' to keep a full an' by with all their 'takteek'. Ez
      fer that Landais, I hearn him whinin' at the commodore in the round house
      when we was off Clear, an' sayin' as how he would tell Sartin on us when
      he gets back to Paree. An' jabberin to th'other Frenchmen as was there
      that this here butter-cask was er King's ship, an' that the commodore
      weren't no commodore nohow. They say as how Cap'n Jones be bound up in a
      hard knot by some articles of agreement, an' daresn't punish him. Be that
      so, Mr. Carvel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said that it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiver my bulkheads!&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;I gave my oath to that same, sir. For
      I knowed the commodore was the lad t' string 'em to the yard-arm an' he
      had the say on it. Oh, the devil take the Frenchies,&rdquo; said Jack, rolling
      his quid to show his pleasure of the topic, &ldquo;they sits on their bottoms in
      Brest and L'Oriong an' talks takteek wi' their han's and mouths, and
      daresn't as much as show the noses o' their three-deckers in th' Bay o'
      Biscay, while Cap'n Jones pokes his bowsprit into every port in England
      with a hulk the rats have left. I've had my bellyful o' Frenchies, Mr.
      Carvell save it be to fight 'em. An' I tell 'ee 'twould give me the
      greatest joy in life t' leave loose 'Scolding Sairy' at that there
      Landais. Th' gal ain't had a match on her this here cruise, an' t' my mind
      she couldn't be christened better, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left him patting the gun with a tender affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene on board was quiet and peaceful enough that morning. A knot of
      midshipmen on the forecastle were discussing Landais's conduct, and
      cursing the concordat which prevented our commodore from bringing him up
      short. Mr. Stacey, the sailing-master, had the deck, and the coasting
      pilot was conning; now and anon the boatswain's whistle piped for Garrett
      or Quito or Fogg to lay aft to the mast, where the first lieutenant stood
      talking to Colonel de Chamillard, of the French marines. The scavengers
      were sweeping down, and part of the after guard was bending a new
      bolt-rope on a storm staysail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the&mdash;fore-topmast crosstrees reports a sail on the weather
      quarter, the Richard is brought around on the wind, and away we go after a
      brigantine, &ldquo;flying like a snow laden with English bricks,&rdquo; as Midshipman
      Coram jokingly remarks. A chase is not such a novelty with us that we
      crane our necks to windward.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon, when I relieved Mr. Stacey of the deck, the sun had eaten up the
      fog, and the shores of England stood out boldly. Spurn Head was looming up
      across our bows, while that of Flamborough jutted into the sea behind us.
      I had the starboard watch piped to dinner, and reported twelve o'clock to
      the commodore. And had just got permission to &ldquo;make it,&rdquo; according to a
      time-honoured custom at sea, when another &ldquo;Sail, ho!&rdquo; came down from
      aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where away?&rdquo; called back Mr. Linthwaite, who was midshipman of the
      forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starboard quarter, rounding Flamborough Head, sir. Looks like a
      full-rigged ship, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sent the messenger into the great cabin to report. He was barely out of
      sight before a second cry came from the masthead: &ldquo;Another sail rounding
      Flamborough, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officers on deck hurried to the taffrail. I had my glass, but not a
      dot was visible above the sea-line. The messenger was scarcely back again
      when there came a third hail: &ldquo;Two more rounding the head, sir! Four in
      all, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was excitement indeed. Without waiting for instructions, I gave the
      command:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up royal yards! Royal yardmen in the tops!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were already swaying out of the chains, when Lieutenant Dale appeared
      and asked the coasting pilot what fleet it was. He answered that it was
      the Baltic fleet, under convoy of the Countess of Scarborough, twenty
      guns, and the Serapis, forty-four.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty-four,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Dale, smiling; &ldquo;that means fifty, as English
      frigates are rated. We shall have our hands full this day, my lads,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;You have done well to get the royals on her, Mr. Carvel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was yet speaking, three more sail were reported from aloft. Then
      there was a hush on deck, and the commodore himself appeared. As he
      reached the poop we saluted him and informed him of what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baltic fleet,&rdquo; said he, promptly. &ldquo;Call away the pilotboat with Mr.
      Lunt to follow the brigantine, sir, and ease off before the wind. Signal
      'General Chase' to the squadron, Mr. Mayrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men had jumped to the weather braces before I gave the command, and
      all the while more sail were counting from the crosstrees, until their
      number had reached forty-one. The news spread over the ship; the starboard
      watch trooped up with their dinners half eaten. Then a faint booming of
      guns drifted down upon our ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've got sight of us, sir,&rdquo; shouted the lookout. &ldquo;They be firing guns
      to windward, an' letting fly their topgallant sheets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that the commodore hurried forward, the men falling back to the
      bulwarks respectfully, and he mounted the fore-rigging as agile as any
      topman, followed by his aide with a glass. From the masthead he sung out
      to me to set our stu'nsails, and he remained aloft till near seven bells
      of the watch. At that hour the merchantmen had all scuttled to safety
      behind the head, and from the deck a great yellow King's frigate could be
      plainly seen standing south to meet us, followed by her smaller consort.
      Presently she hove to, and through our glasses we discerned a small boat
      making for her side, and then a man clambering up her sea-ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That be the bailiff of Scarborough, sir,&rdquo; said the coasting pilot, &ldquo;come
      to tell her cap'n 'tis Paul Jones he has to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the commodore lay down from aloft, and our hearts beat high
      as he walked swiftly aft to the quarterdeck, where he paused for a word
      with Mr. Dale. Meanwhile Mr. Mayrant hove out the signal for the squadron
      to form line of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recall the pilot-boat, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo; said the commodore, quietly. &ldquo;Then
      you may beat to quarters, and I will take the ship, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir.&rdquo; I raised my trumpet. &ldquo;All hands clear ship for action!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It makes me sigh now to think of the cheer which burst from that
      tatterdemalion crew. Who were they to fight the bone and sinew of the
      King's navy in a rotten ship of an age gone by? And who was he, that stood
      so straight upon the quarter-deck, to instil this scum with love and
      worship and fervour to blind them to such odds? But the bo'suns piped and
      sang out the command in fog-horn voices, the drums beat the long roll and
      the fifes whistled, and the decks became suddenly alive. Breechings were
      loosed and gun-tackles unlashed, rammer and sponge laid out, and pike and
      pistol and cutlass placed where they would be handy when the time came to
      rush the enemy's decks. The powder-monkeys tumbled over each other in
      their hurry to provide cartridges, and grape and canister and doubleheaded
      shot were hoisted up from below. The trimmers rigged the splinter
      nettings, got out spare spars and blocks and ropes against those that were
      sure to be shot away, and rolled up casks of water to put out the fires.
      Tubs were filled with sand, for blood is slippery upon the boards. The
      French marines, their scarlet and white very natty in contrast to most of
      our ragged wharf-rats at the guns, were mustered on poop and forecastle,
      and some were sent aloft to the tops to assist the tars there to sweep the
      British decks with handgrenade and musket. And, lastly, the surgeon and
      his mates went below to cockpit and steerage, to make ready for the
      grimmest work of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own duties took me to the dark lower deck, a vile place indeed, and
      reeking with the smell of tar and stale victuals. There I had charge of
      the battery of old eighteens, while Mr. Dale commanded the twelves on the
      middle deck. We loaded our guns with two shots apiece, though I had my
      doubts about their standing such a charge, and then the men stripped until
      they stood naked to the waist, waiting for the fight to begin. For we
      could see nothing of what was going forward. I was pacing up and down, for
      it was a task to quiet the nerves in that dingy place with the gun-ports
      closed, when about three bells of the dog, Mr. Mease, the purser, appeared
      on the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lunt has not come back with the pilot-boat, Carvel,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have
      volunteered for a battery, and am assigned to this. You are to report to
      the commodore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him, and climbed quickly to the quarterdeck. The 'Bon homme
      Richard' was lumbering like a leaden ship before the wind, swaying
      ponderously, her topsails flapping and her heavy blocks whacking against
      the yards. And there was the commodore, erect, and with fire in his eye,
      giving sharp commands to the men at the wheel. I knew at once that no
      trifle had disturbed him. He wore a brand-new uniform; a blue coat with
      red lapels and yellow buttons, and slashed cuffs and stand-up collar, a
      red waistcoat with tawny lace, blue breeches, white silk stockings, and a
      cocked hat and a sword. Into his belt were stuck two brace of pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took some effort to realize, as I waited silently for his attention,
      that this was the man of whose innermost life I had had so intimate a
      view. Who had taken me to the humble cottage under Criffel, who had poured
      into my ear his ambitions and his wrongs when we had sat together in the
      dingy room of the Castle Yard sponging-house. Then some of those ludicrous
      scenes on the road to London came up to me, for which the sky-blue frock
      was responsible. And yet this commodore was not greatly removed from him I
      had first beheld on the brigantine John. His confidence in his future had
      not so much as wavered since that day. That future was now not so far
      distant as the horizon, and he was ready to meet it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will take charge of the battery of nines on this deck, Mr. Carvel,&rdquo;
       said he, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; I replied, and was making my way down the poop ladder,
      when I heard him calling me, in a low voice, by the old name: &ldquo;Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned and followed him aft to the taffrail, where we were clear of the
      French soldiers. The sun was hanging red over the Yorkshire Wolds, the
      Head of Flamborough was in the blue shadow, and the clouds were like rose
      leaves in the sky. The enemy had tacked and was standing west, with ensign
      and jack and pennant flying, the level light washing his sails to the
      whiteness of paper. 'Twas then I first remarked that the Alliance had left
      her place in line and was sailing swiftly ahead toward the Serapis. The
      commodore seemed to read my exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Landais means to ruin me yet, by hook or crook,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he can't intend to close with them,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;He has not the
      courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows what he intends,&rdquo; said the commodore, bitterly. &ldquo;It is no good,
      at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart bled for him. Some minutes passed that he did not speak, making
      shift to raise his glass now and again, and I knew that he was gripped by
      a strong emotion. &ldquo;'Twas so he ever behaved when the stress was greatest.
      Presently he lays down the glass on the signal-chest, fumbles in his coat,
      and brings out the little gold brooch I had not set eyes on since Dolly
      and he and I had stood together on the Betsy's deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you see her, Richard, tell her that I have kept it as sacred as her
      memory,&rdquo; he said thickly. &ldquo;She will recall what I spoke of you when she
      gave it me. You have been leal and true to me indeed, and many a black
      hour have you tided me over since this war' began. Do you know how she may
      be directed to?&rdquo; he concluded, with abruptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced at him, surprised at the question. He was staring at the English
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ripley, of Lincoln's Inn, used to be Mr. Manners's lawyer,&rdquo; I
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out a little note-book and wrote that down carefully. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo;
       he continued, &ldquo;God keep you, my friend. We must win, for we fight with a
      rope around our necks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, Captain Paul,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is&mdash;is there no one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face took on the look of melancholy it had worn so often of late,
      despite his triumphs. That look was the stamp of fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; replied he, with an ineffable sadness, &ldquo;I am naught but a
      wanderer upon the face of the earth. I have no ties, no kindred,&mdash;no
      real friends, save you and Dale, and some of these honest fellows whom I
      lead to slaughter. My ambition is seamed with a flaw. And all my life I
      must be striving, striving, until I am laid in the grave. I know that now,
      and it is you yourself who have taught me. For I have violently broken
      forth from those bounds which God in His wisdom did set.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pressed his hand, and with bowed head went back to my station,
      profoundly struck by the truth of what he had spoken. Though he fought
      under the flag of freedom, the curse of the expatriated was upon his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly afterward he appeared at the poop rail, straight and alert, his
      eye piercing each man as it fell on him. He was the commodore once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twilight deepened, until you scarce could see your hands. There was no
      sound save the cracking of the cabins and the tumbling of the blocks, and
      from time to time a muttered command. An age went by before the trimmers
      were sent to the lee braces, and the Richard rounded lazily to. And a
      great frigate loomed out of the night beside us, half a pistolshot away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ship is that?&rdquo; came the hail, intense out of the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't hear you,&rdquo; replied our commodore, for he had not yet got his
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again came the hail: &ldquo;What ship is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Paul Jones leaned forward over the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass the word below to the first lieutenant to begin the action, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly were the words out of my mouth before the deck gave a mighty leap,
      a hot wind that seemed half of flame blew across my face, and the roar
      started the pain throbbing in my ears. At the same instant the screech of
      shot sounded overhead, we heard the sharp crack-crack of wood rending and
      splitting,&mdash;as with a great broadaxe,&mdash;and a medley of blocks
      and ropes rattled to the deck with the 'thud of the falling bodies. Then,
      instead of stillness, moans and shrieks from above and below, oaths and
      prayers in English and French and Portuguese, and in the heathen gibberish
      of the East. As the men were sponging and ramming home in the first fury
      of hatred, the carpenter jumped out under the battle-lanthorn at the main
      hatch, crying in a wild voice that the old eighteens had burst, killing
      half their crews and blowing up the gundeck above them. At this many of
      our men broke and ran for the hatches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back, back to your quarters! The first man to desert will be shot down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the same strange voice that had quelled the mutiny on the John,
      that had awed the men of Kirkcudbright. The tackles were seized and the
      guns run out once more, and fired, and served again in an agony of haste.
      In the darkness shot shrieked hither and thither about us like demons,
      striking everywhere, sometimes sending casks of salt water over the
      nettings. Incessantly the quartermaster walked to and fro scattering sand
      over the black pools that kept running, running together as the minutes
      were tolled out, and the red flashes from the guns revealed faces in a
      hideous contortion. One little fellow, with whom I had had many a lively
      word at mess, had his arm taken off at the shoulder as he went skipping
      past me with the charge under his coat, and I have but to listen now to
      hear the patter of the blood on the boards as they carried him away to the
      cockpit below. Out of the main hatch, from that charnel house, rose one
      continuous cry. It was an odd trick of the mind or soul that put a hymn on
      my lips in that dreadful hour of carnage and human misery, when men were
      calling the name of their Maker in vain. But as I ran from crew to crew, I
      sang over and over again a long-forgotten Christmas carol, and with it
      came a fleeting memory of my mother on the stairs at Carvel Hall, and of
      the negroes gathered on the lawn without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, glancing up at the dim cloud of sails above, I saw that we were
      aback and making sternway. We might have tossed a biscuit aboard the big
      Serapis as she glided ahead of us. The broadsides thundered, and great
      ragged scantlings brake from our bulwarks and flew as high as the
      mizzen-top; and the shrieks and groans redoubled. Involuntarily my eyes
      sought the poop, and I gave a sigh of relief at the sight of the
      commanding figure in the midst of the whirling smoke. We shotted our guns
      with double-headed, manned our lee braces, and gathered headway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand by to board!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boatswains' whistles trilled through the ship, pikes were seized, and
      pistol and cutlass buckled on. But even as we waited with set teeth, our
      bows ground into the enemy's weather quarter-gallery. For the Richard's
      rigging was much cut away, and she was crank at best. So we backed and
      filled once more, passing the Englishman close aboard, himself being aback
      at the time. Several of his shot crushed through the bulwarks in front of
      me, shattering a nine-pounder and killing half of its crew. And it is only
      a miracle that I stand alive to be able to tell the tale. Then I caught a
      glimpse of the quartermaster whirling the spokes of our wheel, and over
      went our helm to lay us athwart the forefoot of the 'Serapis', where we
      might rake and rush her decks. Our old Indiaman answered but doggedly; and
      the huge bowsprit of the Serapis, towering over our heads, snapped off our
      spanker gaff and fouled our mizzen rigging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hawser, Mr. Stacey, a hawser!&rdquo; I heard the commodore shout, and saw the
      sailing-master slide down the ladder and grope among the dead and wounded
      and mass of broken spars and tackles, and finally pick up a smeared rope's
      end, which I helped him drag to the poop. There we found the commodore
      himself taking skilful turns around the mizzen with the severed stays and
      shrouds dangling from the bowsprit, the French marines looking on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't swear, Mr. Stacey,&rdquo; said he, severely; &ldquo;in another minute we may
      all be in eternity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rushed back to my guns, for the wind was rapidly swinging the stern of
      the Serapis to our own bow, now bringing her starboard batteries into
      play. Barely had we time to light our snatches and send our broadside into
      her at three fathoms before the huge vessels came crunching together, the
      disordered riggings locking, and both pointed northward to a leeward tide
      in a death embrace. The chance had not been given him to shift his crews
      or to fling open his starboard gun-ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then ensued a moment's breathless hush, even the cries of those in agony
      lulling. The pall of smoke rolled a little, and a silver moonlight
      filtered through, revealing the weltering bodies twisted upon the boards.
      A stern call came from beyond the bulwarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you struck, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer sounded clear, and bred hero-worship in our souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I have not yet begun to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our men raised a hoarse yell, drowned all at once by the popping of
      musketry in the tops and the bursting of grenades here and there about the
      decks. A mighty muffled blast sent the Bon homme Richard rolling to
      larboard, and the smoke eddied from our hatches and lifted out of the
      space between the ships. The Englishman had blown off his gun-ports. And
      next some one shouted that our battery of twelves was fighting them muzzle
      to muzzle below, our rammers leaning into the Serapis to send their shot
      home. No chance then for the thoughts which had tortured us in moments of
      suspense. That was a fearful hour, when a shot had scarce to leap a
      cannon's length to find its commission; when the belches of the English
      guns burned the hair of our faces; when Death was sovereign, merciful or
      cruel at his pleasure. The red flashes disclosed many an act of coolness
      and of heroism. I saw a French lad whip off his coat when a gunner called
      for a wad, and another, who had been a scavenger, snatch the rammer from
      Pearce's hands when he staggered with a grape-shot through his chest. Poor
      Jack Pearce! He did not live to see the work 'Scolding Sairy' was to do
      that night. I had but dragged him beyond reach of the recoil when he was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a cry came floating down from aloft. Thrice did I hear it, like one
      waking out of a sleep, ere I grasped its import. &ldquo;The Alliance! The
      Alliance!&rdquo; But hardly had the name resounded with joy throughout the ship,
      when a hail of grape and canister tore through our sails from aft forward.
      &ldquo;She rakes us! She rakes us!&rdquo; And the French soldiers tumbled headlong
      down from the poop with a wail of &ldquo;Les Anglais font prise!&rdquo; &ldquo;Her
      Englishmen have taken her, and turned her guns against us!&rdquo; Our captain
      was left standing alone beside the staff where the stars and stripes waved
      black in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Alliance is hauling off, sir!&rdquo; called the midshipman of the
      mizzen-top. &ldquo;She is making for the Pallas and the Countess of
      Scarborough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; was all the commodore said.
    </p>
    <p>
      To us hearkening for his answer his voice betrayed no sign of dismay.
      Seven times, I say, was that battle lost, and seven times regained again.
      What was it kept the crews at their quarters and the officers at their
      posts through that hell of flame and shot, when a madman could scarce have
      hoped for victory? What but the knowledge that somewhere in the swirl
      above us was still that unswerving and indomitable man who swept all
      obstacles from before him, and into whose mind the thought of defeat could
      not enter. His spirit held us to our task, for flesh and blood might not
      have endured alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had now but one of our starboard nine-pounders on its carriage, and
      word came from below that our battery of twelves was all but knocked to
      scrap iron, and their ports blown into one yawning gap. Indeed, we did not
      have to be told that sides and stanchions had been carried away, for the
      deck trembled and teetered under us as we dragged 'Scolding Sairy' from
      her stand in the larboard waist, clearing a lane for her between the
      bodies. Our feet slipped and slipped as we hove, and burning bits of sails
      and splinters dropping from aloft fell unheeded on our heads and
      shoulders. With the energy of desperation I was bending to the pull, when
      the Malay in front of me sank dead across the tackle. But, ere I could
      touch him, he was tenderly lifted aside, and a familiar figure seized the
      rope where the dead man's hands had warmed it. Truly, the commodore was
      everywhere that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down to the surgeon with you, Richard!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I will look to the
      battery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dazed, I put my hand to my hair to find it warm and wringing wet. When I
      had been hit, I knew not. But I shook my head, for the very notion of that
      cockpit turned my stomach. The blood was streaming from a gash in his own
      temple, to which he gave no heed, and stood encouraging that panting line
      until at last the gun was got across and hooked to the ring-bolts of its
      companion that lay shattered there. &ldquo;Serve her with double-headed, my
      lads,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;and every shot into the Englishman's mainmast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; came the answer from every man of that little remnant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Serapis, too, was now beginning to blaze aloft, and choking wood-smoke
      eddied out of the Richard's hold and mingled with the powder fumes. Then
      the enemy's fire abreast us seemed to lull, and Mr. Stacey mounted the
      bulwarks, and cried out: &ldquo;You have cleared their decks, my hearties!&rdquo;
       Aloft, a man was seen to clamber from our mainyard into the very top of
      the Englishman, where he threw a hand-grenade, as I thought, down her main
      hatch. An instant after an explosion came like a, clap of thunder in our
      faces, and a great quadrant of light flashed as high as the 'Serapis's'
      trucks, and through a breach in her bulwarks I saw men running with only
      the collars of their shirts upon their naked bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas at this critical moment, when that fearful battle once more was won,
      another storm of grape brought the spars about our heads, and that name
      which we dreaded most of all was spread again. As we halted in
      consternation, a dozen round shot ripped through our unengaged side, and a
      babel of voices hailed the treacherous Landais with oaths and
      imprecations. We made out the Alliance with a full head of canvas, black
      and sharp, between us and the moon. Smoke hung above her rail. Getting
      over against the signal fires blazing on Flamborough Head, she wore ship
      and stood across our bows, the midshipman on the forecastle singing out to
      her, by the commodore's orders, to lay the enemy by the board. There was
      no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear us?&rdquo; yelled Mr. Linthwaite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; came the reply; and with it the smoke broke from her and the
      grape and canister swept our forecastle. Then the Alliance sailed away,
      leaving brave Mr. Caswell among the many Landais had murdered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ominous clank of the chain pumps beat a sort of prelude to what
      happened next. The gunner burst out of the hatch with blood running down
      his face, shouting that the Richard was sinking, and yelling for quarter
      as he made for the ensign-staff on the poop, for the flag was shot away.
      Him the commodore felled with a pistol-butt. At the gunner's heels were
      the hundred and fifty prisoners we had taken, released by the master at
      arms. They swarmed out of the bowels of the ship like a horde of Tartars,
      unkempt and wild and desperate with fear, until I thought that the added
      weight on the scarce-supported deck would land us all in the bilges. Words
      fail me when I come to describe the frightful panic of these creatures,
      frenzied by the instinct of self-preservation. They surged hither and
      thither as angry seas driven into a pocket of a storm-swept coast. They
      trampled rough-shod over the moaning heaps of wounded and dying, and
      crowded the crews at the guns, who were powerless before their numbers.
      Some fought like maniacs, and others flung themselves into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those of us who had clung to hope lost it then. Standing with my back to
      the mast, beating them off with a pike, visions of an English prison-ship,
      of an English gallows, came before me. I counted the seconds until the
      enemy's seamen would be pouring through our ragged ports. The seventh and
      last time, and we were beaten, for we had not men enough left on our two
      decks to force them down again. Yes,&mdash;I shame to confess it&mdash;the
      heart went clean out of me, and with that the pain pulsed and leaped in my
      head like a devil unbound. At a turn of the hand I should have sunk to the
      boards, had not a voice risen strong and clear above that turmoil,
      compelling every man to halt trembling in his steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cast off, cast off! 'The Serapis' is sinking. To the pumps, ye fools, if
      you would save your lives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That unerring genius of the gardener's son had struck the only chord!
    </p>
    <p>
      They were like sheep before us as we beat them back into the reeking
      hatches, and soon the pumps were heard bumping with a renewed and a
      desperate vigour. Then, all at once, the towering mainmast of the enemy
      cracked and tottered and swung this way and that on its loosened shrouds.
      The first intense silence of the battle followed, in the midst of which
      came a cry from our top:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their captain is hauling down, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound which broke from our men could scarce be called a cheer. That
      which they felt as they sank exhausted on the blood of their comrades may
      not have been elation. My own feeling was of unmixed wonder as I gazed at
      a calm profile above me, sharp-cut against the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was moved as out of a revery by the sight of Dale swinging across to the
      Serapis by the main brace pennant. Calling on some of my boarders, I
      scaled our bulwarks and leaped fairly into the middle of the gangway of
      the Serapis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is nearly all of my remembrance of that momentous occasion. I had
      caught the one glimpse of our first lieutenant in converse with their
      captain and another officer, when a naked seaman came charging at me. He
      had raised a pike above his shoulder ere I knew what he was about, and my
      senses left me.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIII. IN WHICH I MAKE SOME DISCOVERIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The room had a prodigious sense of change about it. That came over me with
      something of a shock, since the moment before I had it settled that I was
      in Marlboro' Street. The bare branches swaying in the wind outside should
      belong to the trees in Freshwater Lane. But beyond the branches were
      houses, the like of which I had no remembrance of in Annapolis. And then
      my grandfather should be sitting in that window. Surely, he was there! He
      moved! He was coming toward me to say: &ldquo;Richard, you are forgiven,&rdquo; and to
      brush his eyes with his ruffles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was the bed-canopy, the pleatings of which were gone, and it
      was turned white instead of the old blue. And the chimney-place! That was
      unaccountably smaller, and glowed with a sea-coal fire. And the mantel was
      now but a bit of a shelf, and held many things that seemed scarce at home
      on the rough and painted wood,&mdash;gold filigree; and China and Japan,
      and a French clock that ought not to have been just there. Ah, the
      teacups! Here at last was something to touch a fibre of my brain, but a
      pain came with the effort of memory. So my eyes went back to my
      grandfather in the window. His face was now become black as Scipio's, and
      he wore a red turban and a striped cotton gown that was too large for him.
      And he was sewing. This was monstrous!
    </p>
    <p>
      I hurried over to the tea-cups, such a twinge did that discovery give me.
      But they troubled me near as much, and the sea-coal fire held strange
      images. The fascination in the window was not to be denied, for it stood
      in line with the houses and the trees. Suddenly there rose up before me a
      gate. Yes, I knew that gate, and the girlish figure leaning over it. They
      were in Prince George Street. Behind them was a mass of golden-rose
      bushes, and out of these came forth a black face under a turban, saying,
      &ldquo;Yes, mistis, I'se comin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mammy&mdash;Mammy Lucy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The figure in the window stirred, and the sewing fell its ample lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Lawd'a mercy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I trembled&mdash;with a violence unspeakable. Was this but one more of
      those thousand voices, harsh and gentle, rough and tender, to which I had
      listened in vain this age past? The black face was hovering over me now,
      and in an agony of apprehension I reached up and felt its honest
      roughness. Then I could have wept for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mammy Lucy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Marse Dick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&mdash;where is Miss Dolly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Marse Dick, doctah done say you not t' talk, suh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Miss Dolly?&rdquo; I cried, seizing her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Marse Dick. Miss Dolly'll come terectly, suh. She's lyin' down,
      suh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door creaked, and in my eagerness I tried to lift myself. 'Twas Aunt
      Lucy's hand that restrained me, and the next face I saw was that of
      Dorothy's mother. But why did it appear so old and sorrow-lined? And why
      was the hair now of a whiteness with the lace of the cap? She took my
      fingers in her own, and asked me anxiously if I felt any pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I, Mrs. Manners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in London, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Arlington Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head sadly. &ldquo;No, my dear, not in Arlington Street. But you
      are not to talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Dorothy? May I not see Dorothy? Aunt Lucy tells me she is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Manners gave the old mammy a glance of reproof, a signal that alarmed
      me vastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tell me, Mrs. Manners! You will speak the truth. Tell me if she is
      gone away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, she is here, and under this very roof. And you shall see her
      as soon as Dr. Barry will permit. Which will not be soon,&rdquo; she added with
      a smile, &ldquo;if you persist in this conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The threat had the desired effect. And Mrs. Manners quietly left the room,
      and after a while as quietly came back again and sat down by the fire,
      whispering to Aunt Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fate, in some inexplicable way, had carried me into the enemy's country
      and made me the guest of Mr. Marmaduke Manners. As I lay staring upward,
      odd little bits of the past came floating to the top of my mind, presently
      to be pieced together. The injuries Mr. Marmaduke had done me were the
      first to collect, since I was searching for the cause of my resentment
      against him. The incidents arrived haphazard as magic lanthorn views, but
      very vivid. His denial of me before Mr. Dix, and his treachery at
      Vauxhall, when he had sent me to be murdered. Next I felt myself clutching
      the skin over his ribs in Arlington Street, when I had flung him across
      the room in his yellow night-gown. That brought me to the most painful
      scene of my life, when I had parted with Dorothy at the top of the stairs.
      Afterward followed scraps of the years at Gordon's Pride, and on top of
      them the talk with McAndrews. Here was the secret I sought. The crash had
      come. And they were no longer in Mayfair, but must have taken a house in
      some poorer part of London. This thought cast me down tremendously.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dorothy! Had time changed her? 'Twas with that query on my lips I fell
      asleep, to dream of the sun shining down on Carvel Hall and Wilmot House;
      of Aunt Hester and Aunt Lucy, and a lass and a lad romping through
      pleasant fields and gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke it was broad day once more. A gentleman sat on the edge of my
      bed. He had a queer, short face, ruddy as the harvest moon, and he smiled
      good-humouredly when I opened my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bid you good morning, Mr. Carvel, for the first time since I have made
      your acquaintance,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And how do you feel, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never felt better in my life,&rdquo; I replied, which was the whole
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, vastly well,&rdquo; says he, laughing, &ldquo;prodigious well for a young man
      who has as many holes in him as have you. Do you hear him, Mrs. Manners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that last word, I popped up to look about the room, and the doctor
      caught hold of me with ludicrous haste. A pain shot through my body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avast, avast, my hearty,&rdquo; cries he. &ldquo;'Tis a miracle you can speak, let
      alone carry your bed and walk for a while yet.&rdquo; And he turned to Dorothy's
      mother, whom I beheld smiling at me. &ldquo;You will give him the physic, ma'am,
      at the hours I have chosen. Egad, I begin to think we shall come through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But pray remember, ma'am, if he talks, you are to put a wad in his
      mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall have no opportunity to talk, Dr. Barry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save for a favour I have to ask you, doctor,&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Od's bodkins! Already, sir? And what may that be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you will allow me to see Miss Manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook with laughter, and then winked at me very roguishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and faith, I should be worse than cruel. First she comes
      imploring me to see you, and so prettily that a man of oak could not
      refuse her. And now it is you begging to see her. Had your eyes been
      opened, sir, you might have had many a glimpse of Miss Dolly these three
      weeks past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! She has been watching with me?&rdquo; I asked, in a rapture not to be
      expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Od's, but those are secrets. And the medical profession is
      close-mouthed, Mr. Carvel. So you want to see her? No,&rdquo; cries he, &ldquo;'tis
      not needful to swear it on the Evangels. And I let her come in, will you
      give me your honour as a gentleman not to speak more than two words to
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise anything, and you will not deny me looking at her,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook again, all over. &ldquo;You rascal! You sad dog, sir! No, sir, faith,
      you must shut your eyes. Eh, madam, must he not shut his eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were playmates, doctor,&rdquo; answers Mrs. Manners. She was laughing a
      little, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she shall come in. But remember that I shall have my ear to the
      keyhole, and you go beyond your promise, out she's whisked. So I caution
      you not to spend rashly those two words, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he followed Mrs. Manners out of the room, frowning and shaking his
      fist at me in mock fierceness. I would have died for the man. For a space&mdash;a
      prodigious long space&mdash;I lay very still, my heart bumping like a
      gun-carriage broke loose, and my eyes riveted on the crack of the door.
      Then I caught the sound of a light footstep, the knob turned, and joy
      poured into my soul with the sweep of a Fundy tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Dorothy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her finger to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;now you have spoken them both at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She closed the door softly behind her, and stood looking down upon me with
      such a wondrous love-light in her eyes as no man may describe. My fancy
      had not lifted me within its compass, my dreams even had not imagined it.
      And the fire from which it sprang does not burn in humbler souls. So she
      stood gazing, those lips which once had been the seat of pride now parted
      in a smile of infinite tenderness. But her head she still held high, and
      her body straight. Down the front of her dress fell a tucked apron of the
      whitest linen, and in her hand was a cup of steaming broth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to take this, Richard,&rdquo; she commanded. And added, with a touch of
      her old mischief, &ldquo;Mind, sir, if I hear a sound out of you, I am to
      disappear like the fairy godmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew full well she meant it, and the terror of losing her kept me
      silent. She put down the cup, placed another pillow behind my head with a
      marvellous deftness, and then began feeding me in dainty spoonfuls
      something which was surely nectar. And mine eyes, too, had their feast.
      Never before had I seen my lady in this gentle guise, this task of nursing
      the sick, which her doing raised to a queenly art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face had changed some. Years of trial unknown to me had left an
      ennobling mark upon her features, increasing their power an hundred fold.
      And the levity of girlish years was gone. How I burned to question her!
      But her lips were now tight closed, her glance now and anon seeking mine,
      and then falling with an exquisite droop to the coverlet. For the old
      archness, at least, would never be eradicated. Presently, after she had
      taken the cup and smoothed my pillow, I reached out for her hand. It was a
      boldness of which I had not believed myself capable; but she did not
      resist, and even, as I thought, pressed my fingers with her own slender
      ones, the red of our Maryland holly blushing in her cheeks. And what need
      of words, indeed! Our thoughts, too, flew coursing hand in hand through
      primrose paths, and the angels themselves were not to be envied.
    </p>
    <p>
      A master might picture my happiness, waking and sleeping, through the
      short winter days that came and went like flashes of gray light. The
      memory of them is that of a figure tall and lithe, a little more rounded
      than of yore, and a chiselled face softened by a power that is one of the
      world's mysteries. Dorothy had looked the lady in rags, and housewife's
      cap and apron became her as well as silks or brocades. When for any reason
      she was absent from my side, I moped, to the quiet amusement of Mrs.
      Manners and the more boisterous delight of Aunt Lucy, who took her turn
      sewing in the window. I was near to forgetting the use of words, until at
      length, one rare morning when the sun poured in, the jolly doctor dressed
      my wounds with more despatch than common, and vouchsafed that I might talk
      awhile that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cries he, putting me as ever to confusion, &ldquo;but I have a guess whom
      my gentleman will be wishing to talk with. But I'll warrant, sir, you have
      said a deal more than I have any notion of without opening your lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he went away, intolerably pleased with his joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas for the perversity of maiden natures! It was not my dear nurse who
      brought my broth that morning, but Mrs. Manners herself. She smiled at my
      fallen face, and took a chair at my bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear boy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you may ask what questions you choose, and
      I will tell you very briefly how you have come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking, Mrs. Manners,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that if it were known
      that you harboured one of John Paul Jones's officers in London, very
      serious trouble might follow for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought her brow clouded a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one knows of it, Richard, or is likely to. Dr. Barry, like so many in
      England, is a good Whig and friend to America. And you are in a part of
      London far removed from Mayfair.&rdquo; She hesitated, and then continued in a
      voice that strove to be lighter: &ldquo;This little house is in Charlotte
      Street, Mary-le-Bone, for the war has made all of us suffer some. And we
      are more fortunate than many, for we are very comfortable here, and though
      I say it, happier than in Arlington Street. And the best of our friends
      are still faithful. Mr. Fox, with all his greatness, has never deserted
      us, nor my Lord Comyn. Indeed, we owe them much more than I can tell you
      of now,&rdquo; she said, and sighed. &ldquo;They are here every day of the world to
      inquire for you, and it was his Lordship brought you out of Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so I had reason once more to bless this stanch friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of Holland?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. One morning as we sat down to breakfast, Mr. Ripley's clerk brought
      in a letter for Dorothy. But I must say first that Mr. Dulany, who is in
      London, told us that you were with John Paul Jones. You can have no
      conception, Richard, of the fear and hatred that name has aroused in
      England. Insurance rates have gone up past belief, and the King's ships
      are cruising in every direction after the traitor and pirate, as they call
      him. We have prayed daily for your safety, and Dorothy&mdash;well, here is
      the letter she received. It had been opened by the inspector, and allowed
      to pass. And it is to be kept as a curiosity.&rdquo; She drew it from the pocket
      of her apron and began to read.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  &ldquo;THE TEXEL, October 3, 1779

   &ldquo;MY DEAR Miss DOROTHY: I would not be thought to flutter y'r Gentle
   Bosom with Needless Alarms, nor do I believe I have misjudged y'r
   Warm &amp; Generous Nature when I write you that One who is held very
   High in y'r Esteem lies Exceeding Ill at this Place, who might by
   Tender Nursing regain his Health. I seize this Opportunity to say,
   my dear Lady, that I have ever held my too Brief Acquaintance with
   you in London as one of the Sacred Associations of my Life. From
   the Little I saw of you then I feel Sure that this Appeal will not
   pass in Vain. I remain y'r most Humble and Devoted Admirer,

                  &ldquo;JAMES ORCHARDSON.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she knew it was from Commodore Jones?&rdquo; I asked, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Manners, with a quiet smile, &ldquo;we women have a
      keener instinct than men&mdash;though I believe your commodore has a
      woman's intuition. Yes, Dorothy knew. And I shall never forget the fright
      she gave me as she rose from the table and handed me the sheet to read,
      crying but the one word. She sent off to Brook Street for Lord Comyn, who
      came at once, and, in half an hour the dear fellow was set out for Dover.
      He waited for nothing, since war with Holland was looked for at any day.
      And his Lordship himself will tell you about that rescue. Within the week
      he had brought you to us. Your skull had been trepanned, you had this
      great hole in your thigh, and your heart was beating but slowly. By Mr.
      Fox's advice we sent for Dr. Barry, who is a skilled surgeon, and a
      discreet man despite his manner. And you have been here for better than
      three weeks, Richard, hanging between life and death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I owe my life to you and to Dorothy,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Lord Comyn and Dr. Barry, rather,&rdquo; she replied quickly. &ldquo;We have done
      little but keep the life they saved. And I thank God it was given me to do
      it for the son of your mother and father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something of the debt I owed them was forced upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were poor, doubtless driven to make ends meet, and yet they had taken
      me in, called upon near the undivided services of an able surgeon, and
      worn themselves out with nursing me. Nor did I forget the risk they ran
      with such a guest. For the first time in many years my heart relented
      toward Mr. Marmaduke. For their sakes I forgave him over and over what I
      had suffered, and my treatment of him lay like a weight upon me. And how
      was I to repay them? They needed the money I had cost them, of that I was
      sure. After the sums I had expended to aid the commodore with the 'Ranger'
      and the 'Bon homme Richard', I had scarce a farthing to my name. With such
      leaden reflections was I occupied when I heard Mrs. Manners speaking to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, I have some news for you which the doctor thinks you can bear
      to-day. Mr. Dulany, who is exiled like the rest of us, brought them. It is
      a great happiness to be able to tell you, my dear, that you are now the
      master of Carvel Hall, and like to stay so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears stole into her eyes as she spoke. And the enormity of those
      tidings, coming as they did on the top of my dejection, benumbed me. All
      they meant was yet far away from my grasp, but the one supreme result that
      was first up to me brought me near to fainting in my weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not raise your hopes unduly, Richard,&rdquo; the good lady was saying,
      &ldquo;but the best informed here seem to think that England cannot push the war
      much farther. If the Colonies win, you are secure in your title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how is it come about, Mrs. Manners?&rdquo; I demanded, with my first
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You doubtless have heard that before the Declaration was signed at
      Philadelphia your Uncle Grafton went to the committee at Annapolis and
      contributed to the patriot cause, and took very promptly the oath of the
      Associated Freemen of Maryland, thus forsaking the loyalist party&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;I heard of it when I was on the Cabot. He
      thought his property in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Manners, laughing; &ldquo;he became the best and most
      exemplary of patriots, even as he had been the best of Tories. He sent
      wheat and money to the army, and went about bemoaning that his only son
      fought under the English flag. But very little fighting has Philip done,
      my dear. Well, when the big British fleet sailed up the bay in '77, your
      precious uncle made the first false step in his long career of rascality.
      He began to correspond with the British at Philadelphia, and one of his
      letters was captured near the Head of Elk. A squad was sent to the Kent
      estate, where he had been living, to arrest him, but he made his escape to
      New York. And his lands were at once confiscated by the state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Then they belong to the state,&rdquo; I said, with misgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so fast, Richard. At the last session of the Maryland Legislature a
      bill was introduced, through the influence of Mr. Bordley and others, to
      restore them to you, their rightful owner. And insomuch as you were even
      then serving the country faithfully and bravely, and had a clean and
      honourable record of service, the whole of the lands were given to you.
      And now, my dear, you have had excitement enough for one day.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIV. MORE DISCOVERIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      All that morning I pondered over the devious lane of my life, which had
      led up to so fair a garden. And one thing above all kept turning and
      turning in my head, until I thought I should die of waiting for its
      fulfilment. Now was I free to ask Dorothy to marry me, to promise her the
      ease and comfort that had once been hers, should God bring us safe back to
      Maryland. The change in her was little less than a marvel to me, when I
      remembered the wilful miss who had come to London bent upon pleasure
      alone. Truly, she was of that rare metal which refines, and then outshines
      all others. And there was much I could not understand. A miracle had saved
      her from the Duke of Chartersea, but why she had refused so many great men
      and good was beyond my comprehension. Not a glimpse of her did I get that
      day, though my eyes wandered little from the knob of the door. And even
      from Aunt Lucy no satisfaction was to be had as to the cause of her
      absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Clare to goodness, Marse Dick,&rdquo; said she, with great solemnity, &ldquo;'clare
      to goodness, I'se nursed Miss Dolly since she was dat high, and neber one
      minnit obher life is I knowed what de Chile gwine t' do de next. She ain't
      neber yit done what I calcelated on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, after the doctor had dressed my wounds and bantered me
      to his heart's content, enters Mr. Marmaduke Manners. I was prodigiously
      struck by the change in him, and pitied him then near as much as I had
      once despised him. He was arrayed in finery, as of old. But the finery was
      some thing shabby; the lace was frayed at the edges, there was a neat but
      obvious patch in his small-clothes, and two more in his coat. His air was
      what distressed me most of all, being that of a man who spends his days
      seeking favours and getting none. I had seen too many of the type not to
      know the sign of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran forward and gave me his hand, which I grasped as heartily as my
      weakness would permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would not let me see you until to-day, my dear Richard,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;I bid you welcome to what is left of our home. 'Tis not
      Arlington Street, my lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But more of a home than was that grander house, Mr. Manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;poverty is a bitter draught, and we have drunk deep of
      it since last we beheld you. My great friends know me no more, and will
      not take my note for a shilling. They do not remember the dinners and
      suppers I gave them. Faith, this war has brought nothing but misery, and
      how we are to get through it, God knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now I understood it was not the war, but Mr. Marmaduke himself, which had
      carried his family to this pass. And some of my old resentment rekindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that I have brought you great additional anxiety and expense, Mr.
      Manners,&rdquo; I answered somewhat testily. &ldquo;The care I have been to Mrs.
      Manners and Dorothy I may never repay. But it gives me pleasure to feel,
      sir, that I am in a position to reimburse you, and likewise to loan you
      something until your lands begin to pay again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There the Carvel speaks,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and the true son of our generous
      province. You can have no conception of the misfortunes come to me out of
      this quarrel. The mortgages on my Western Shore tobacco lands are
      foreclosed, and Wilmot House itself is all but gone. You well know, of
      course, that I would do the same by you, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled, but more in sadness than amusement. Hardship had only degraded
      Mr. Marmaduke the more, and even in trouble his memory was convenient as
      is that of most people in prosperity. I was of no mind to jog his
      recollection. But I wanted badly to ask about his Grace. Where had my fine
      nobleman been at the critical point of his friend's misfortunes? For I had
      had many a wakeful night over that same query since my talk with
      McAndrews.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have come to your own again, Richard, my lad,&rdquo; said Mr. Marmaduke,
      breaking in upon my train. &ldquo;I have felt for you deeply, and talked many a
      night with Margaret and Dorothy over the wrong done you. Between you and
      me,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;that uncle of yours is an arrant knave, whom the
      patriots have served with justice. To speak truth, sir, I begin myself to
      have a little leaning to that cause which you have so bravely espoused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time I was close to laughing outright. But he was far too serious to
      remark my mirth. He commenced once more, with an ahem, which gave me a
      better inkling than frankness of what bothered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have an agent here, Richard, I take it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Your
      grandfather had one. Ahem! Doubtless this agent will advance you all you
      shall have need of, when you are well enough to see him. Fact is, he might
      come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, Mr. Manners, that I am a pirate and an outlaw, and that you
      are the shielder of such.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That thought shook the pinch of Holland he held all over him. But he
      recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Richard, men of business are of no faction and of no nation.
      Their motto is discretion. And to obtain the factorship in London of a
      like estate to yours one of them would wear a plaster over his mouth, I'll
      warrant you. You have but to summon one of the rascals, promise him a bit
      of war interest, and he will leave you as much as you desire, and nothing
      spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To talk plainly, Mr. Manners,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I think 'twould be the height
      of folly to resort to such means. When I am better, we shall see what can
      be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face plainly showed his disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; he said, in a whining tone, &ldquo;I had forgotten your friends,
      Lord Comyn and Mr. Fox. They may do something for you, now you own your
      estate. My dear sir, I dislike to say aught against any man. Mrs. Manners
      will tell you of their kindness to us, but I vow I have not been able to
      see it. With all the money at their command they will not loan me a penny
      in my pressing need. And I shame to say it, my own daughter prevents me
      from obtaining the money to keep us out of the Fleet. I know she has
      spoken to Dulany. Think of it, Richard, my own daughter, upon whom I
      lavished all when I had it, who might have made a score of grand matches
      when I gave her the opportunity, and now we had all been rolling in
      wealth. I'll be sworn I don't comprehend her, nor her mother either, who
      abets her. For they prefer to cook Maryland dainties for a living, to put
      in the hands of the footmen of the ladies whose houses they once visited.
      And how much of that money do you suppose I get, sir? Will you believe it
      that I&mdash;&rdquo; (he was shrieking now), &ldquo;that I, the man of the family, am
      allowed only my simple meals, a farthing for snuff, and not a groat for
      chaise-hire? At my age I am obliged to walk to and from their lordships'
      side entrances in patched clothes, egad, when a new suit might obtain us a
      handsome year's income!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned my face to the wall, completely overcome, and the tears scalding
      in my eyes, at the thought of Dorothy and her mother bending over the
      stove cooking delicacies for their livelihood, and watching at my bedside
      night and day despite their weariness of body. And not a word out of these
      noble women of their sacrifice, nor of the shame and trouble and labour of
      their lives, who always had been used to every luxury! Nothing but cheer
      had they brought to the sickroom, and not a sign of their poverty and
      hardship, for they knew that their broths and biscuit and jellies must
      have choked me. No. It remained for this contemptible cur of a husband and
      father to open my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had risen when I had brought myself to look at him. And as I hope for
      heaven he took my emotion for pity of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have worried you enough for one day with my troubles, my lad,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;But they are very hard to bear, and once in a while it does me good to
      speak of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not trust myself to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Aunt Lucy who spent the morning with me, and Mrs. Manners brought
      my dinner. I observed a questioning glance as she entered, which I took
      for an attempt to read whether Mr. Marmaduke had spoke more than he ought.
      But I would have bitten off my tongue rather than tell her of my
      discoveries, though perhaps my voice may have betrayed an added concern.
      She stayed to talk on the progress of the war, relating the gallant
      storming of Stony Point by Mad Anthony in July, and the latest Tory
      insurrection on our own Eastern Shore. She passed from these matters to a
      discussion of General Washington's new policy of the defensive, for Mrs.
      Manners had always been at heart a patriot. And whilst I lay listening
      with a deep interest, in comes my lady herself. So was it ever, when you
      least expected her, even as Mammy had said. She curtseyed very prettily,
      with her chin tilted back and her cheeks red, and asked me how I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where have you been these days gone, Miss Will-o'the-Wisp, since the
      doctor has given me back my tongue?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you better when you are asleep,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;For then you are
      sometimes witty, though I doubt not the wit is other people's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I saw that she had tricked me, and taken her watch at night. For I
      slept like a trooper after a day's forage. As to what I might have said in
      my dreams&mdash;that thought made me red as an apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy, Dorothy,&rdquo; says her mother, smiling, &ldquo;you would provoke a saint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which would be better fun than teasing a sinner,&rdquo; replies the minx, with
      a little face at me. &ldquo;Mr. Carvel, a gentleman craves the honour of an
      audience from your Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so. He presents a warrant from your Excellency's physician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that she disappeared, Mrs. Manners going after her. And who should
      come bursting in at the door but my Lord Comyn? He made one rush at me,
      and despite my weakness bestowed upon me a bear's hug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Richard,&rdquo; cried he, when he had released me, &ldquo;I give you my oath that
      I never hoped to see you rise from that bed when we laid you there. But
      they say that love works wondrous cures, and, egad, I believe that now.
      'Tis love is curing you, my lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held me off at arm's length, the old-time affection beaming from his
      handsome face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to say to you, Jack?&rdquo; I answered. And my voice was all but
      gone, for the sight of him revived the memory of every separate debt of
      the legion I owed him. &ldquo;How am I to piece words enough together to thank
      you for this supreme act of charity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Od's, you may thank your own devilish thick head,&rdquo; said my Lord Comyn.
      &ldquo;I should never have bothered my own about you were it not for her. Had it
      not been for her happiness do you imagine I would have picked you out of
      that crew of half-dead pirates in the Texel fort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I must needs brush my cheek, then, with the sleeve of my night-rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you give me some account of this last prodigious turn you have
      done her?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, and pinched me playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now are you coming to your senses,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There was cursed little to
      the enterprise, Richard, and that's the truth. I got down to Dover, and
      persuaded the master of a schooner to carry me to Rotterdam. That was not
      so difficult, since your Terror of the Seas was locked up safe enough in
      the Texel. In Rotterdam I had a travelling-chaise stripped, and set off at
      the devil's pace for the Texel. You must know that the whole Dutch nation
      was in an uproar&mdash;as much of an uproar as those boors ever reach&mdash;over
      the arrival of your infamous squadron. The Court Party and our ambassador
      were for having you kicked out, and the Republicans for making you at
      home. I heard that their High Mightinesses had given Paul Jones the use of
      the Texel fort for his wounded and his prisoners, and thither I ran. And I
      was even cursing the French sentry at the drawbridge in his own tongue,
      when up comes your commodore himself. You may quarter me if wasn't knocked
      off my feet when I recognized the identical peacock of a sea-captain we
      had pulled out of Castle Yard along with you, and offered a commission in
      the Royal Navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolly hadn't told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolly tell me!&rdquo; exclaimed his Lordship, scornfully. &ldquo;She was in a state
      to tell me nothing the morning I left, save only to bring you to England
      alive, and repeat it over and over. But to return to your captain,&mdash;he,
      too, was taken all aback. But presently he whipt out my name, and I his,
      without the Jones. And when I told him my errand, he wept on my neck, and
      said he had obtained unlimited leave of absence for you from the Paris
      commissioners. He took me up into a private room in the fort, where you
      were; and the surgeon, who was there at the time, said that your chances
      were as slim as any man's he had ever seen. Faith, you looked it, my lad.
      At sight of your face I took one big gulp, for I had no notion of getting
      you back to her. And rather than come without you, and look into her eyes,
      I would have drowned myself in the Straits of Dover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Despite the host of troubles he had on his hands, your commodore himself
      came with us to Rotterdam. Now I protest I love that man, who has more
      humanity in him than most of the virtuous people in England who call him
      hard names. If you could have seen him leaning over you, and speaking to
      you, and feeling every minute for your heart-beats, egad, you would have
      cried. And when I took you off to the schooner, he gave me an hundred
      directions how to care for you, and then his sorrow bowled him all in a
      heap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is the commodore still at the Texel?&rdquo; I asked, after a space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that he is, with our English cruisers thick as gulls outside' waiting
      for a dead fish. But he has spurned the French commission they have
      offered him, saying that of the Congress is good enough for him. And he
      declares openly that when he gets ready he will sail out in the Alliance
      under the Stars and Stripes. And for this I honour him,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;and
      Charles honours him, and so must all Englishmen honour him when they come
      to their senses. And by Gads life, I believe he will get clear, for he is
      a marvel at seamanship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray with all my heart that he may,&rdquo; said I, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help him if they catch him!&rdquo; my Lord exclaimed. &ldquo;You should see the
      bloody piratical portraits they are scattering over London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the risk you ran getting me into England ever occurred to you, Jack?&rdquo;
       I asked, with some curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, not until the day after we got back, Richard,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;when I
      met Mr. Attorney General on the street. 'Sdeath, I turned and ran the
      other way like the devil was after me. For Charles Fox vows that
      conscience makes cowards of the best of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is some of Charles's wisdom!&rdquo; I cried, and laughed until I was
      forced to stop from pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my hearty,&rdquo; says Jack, &ldquo;you owe me nothing for fishing you out of
      Holland&mdash;that is her debt. But I declare that you must one day pay me
      for saving her for you. What! have I not always sworn that she loved you?
      Did I not pull you into the coffee-room of the Star and Garter years ago,
      and tell you that same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My face warmed, though I said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you sly dog! I'll warrant there has been many a tender talk just
      where I'm sitting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Slife, then, what have you been doing,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;seeing her every day
      and not asking her to marry you, my master of Carvel Hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I am permitted to use my tongue, she has not come near me, save
      when I slept,&rdquo; I answered ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor will she, I'll be sworn,&rdquo; says he, shaken with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ods, have you no invention? Egad, you must feign sleep, and seize her
      unawares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not inform his Lordship how excellent this plan seemed to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I possessed the love of such a woman, Richard,&rdquo; he said, in another
      tone, &ldquo;I think I should die of happiness. She will never tell you how
      these weeks past she has scarce left your side. The threats combined of
      her mother and the doctor, and Charles and me, would not induce her to
      take any sleep. And time and time have I walked from here to Brook Street
      without recognizing a step of the way, lifted clear out of myself by the
      sight of her devotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What was my life, indeed, that such a blessing should come into it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the crash came,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;'twas she took command, and 'tis
      God's pity she had not done so long before. Mr. Marmaduke was pushed to
      the bottom of the family, where he belongs, and was given only
      snuff-money. She would give him no opportunity to contract another debt,
      and even charged Charles and me to loan him nothing. Nor would she receive
      aught from us, but&rdquo; (he glanced at me uneasily)&mdash;&ldquo;but she and Mrs.
      Manners must take to cooking delicacies&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know,&rdquo; I faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! has the puppy told you?&rdquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. &ldquo;He was in here this morning, with his woes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did he speak of the bargain he tried to make with our old friend, his
      Grace of Chartersea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He tried to sell her again?&rdquo; I cried, my breath catching. &ldquo;I have feared
      as much since I heard of their misfortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Comyn, &ldquo;that was the first of it. 'Twas while they were
      still in Arlington Street, and before Mrs. Manners and Dorothy knew. Mr.
      Marmaduke goes posting off to Nottinghamshire, and comes back inside the
      duke's own carriage. And his Grace goes to dine in Arlington Street for
      the first time in years. Dorothy had wind of the trouble then, Charles
      having warned her. And not a word would she speak to Chartersea the whole
      of the dinner, nor look to the right or left of her plate. And when the
      servants are gone, up gets my lady with a sweep and confronts him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Will your Grace spare me a minute in the drawing-room?' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He blinked at her in vast astonishment, and pushed back his chair. When
      she was come to the door, she turns with another sweep on Mr. Marmaduke,
      who was trotting after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You will please to remain here, father,' she said; 'what I am to say is
      for his Grace's ear alone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what she spoke to the duke I can form only an estimate, Richard,&rdquo; my
      Lord concluded, &ldquo;but I'll lay a fortune 'twas greatly to the point. For in
      a little while Chartersea comes stumbling down the steps. And he has never
      darkened the door since. And the cream of it is,&rdquo; said Comyn, &ldquo;that her
      father gave me this himself, with a face a foot long, for me to
      sympathize. The little beast has strange bursts of confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And stranger confidants,&rdquo; I ejaculated, thinking of the morning, and of
      Courtenay's letter, long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the story had made my blood leap again with pride of her. The picture
      in my mind had followed his every sentence, and even the very words she
      must have used were ringing in my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as we sat talking in low tones, the door opened, and a hearty voice
      cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now where is this rebel, this traitor? They tell me one lies hid in this
      house. 'Slife, I must have at him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fox!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took my hands in his, and stood regarding me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the convenience of my friends, I was christened Charles,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared at him in amazement. He was grown a deal stouter, but my eye was
      caught and held by the blue coat and buff waistcoat he wore. They were
      frayed and stained and shabby, yet they seemed all of a piece with some
      new grandeur come upon the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is all the world turning virtuous? Is the millennium arrived?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, with his old boyish smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think me changed some since that morning we drove together to Holland
      House&mdash;do you remember it after the night at St. Stephen's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember it!&rdquo; I repeated, with emphasis, &ldquo;I'll warrant I can give you
      every bit of our talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen many men since, but never have I met your equal for a most
      damnable frankness, Richard Carvel. Even Jack, here, is not half so blunt
      and uncompromising. But you took my fancy&mdash;God knows why!&mdash;that
      first night I clapped eyes on you in Arlington Street, and I loved you
      when your simplicity made us that speech at Brooks's Club. So you have not
      forgotten that morning under the trees, when the dew was on the grass.
      Faith, I am glad of it. What children we were!&rdquo; he said, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you were a Junior Lord,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is more than I am now,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Somehow&mdash;you may laugh&mdash;somehow
      I have never been able to shake off the influence of your words, Richard.
      Your cursed earnestness scared me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scared you?&rdquo; I cried, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;Jack will bear witness that I have said so to
      Dolly a score of times. For I had never imagined such a single character
      as yours. You know we were all of us rakes at fifteen, to whom everything
      good in the universe was a joke. And do you recall the teamster we met by
      the Park, and how he arrested his salute when he saw who it was? At
      another time I should have laughed over that, but it cut me to have it
      happen when you were along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll lay an hundred guineas to a farthing the fellow would put his
      head on the block for Charles now,&rdquo; cut in his Lordship, with his hand on
      Mr. Fox's shoulder. &ldquo;Behold, O Prophet,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;one who is become the
      champion of the People he reviled! Behold the friend of Rebellion and
      'Lese Majeste', the viper in Britannia's bosom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, have done, Jack,&rdquo; said Mr. Fox, impatiently, &ldquo;you have no more music
      in your soul than a cow. Damned little virtue attaches to it, Richard,&rdquo; he
      went on. &ldquo;North threw me out, and the king would have nothing to do with
      me, so I had to pick up with you rebels and traitors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not believe him, Richard,&rdquo; cried my Lord; &ldquo;you have only to look
      at him to see that he lies. Take note of the ragged uniform of the rebel
      army he carries, and then think of him 'en petite maitre', with his
      cabriolet and his chestnuts. Egad, he might be as rich as Rigby were it
      not for those principles which he chooses to deride. And I have seen him
      reduced to a crown for them. I tell you, Richard,&rdquo; said my Lord, &ldquo;by
      espousing your cause Charles is become greater than the King. For he has
      the hearts of the English people, which George has not, and the allegiance
      of you Americans, which George will never have. And if you once heard him,
      in Parliament, you should hear him now, and see the Speaker wagging his
      wig like a man bewitched, and hear friends and enemies calling out for him
      to go on whenever he gives the sign of a pause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech of his Lordship's may seem cold in the writing, my dears, and
      you who did not know him may wonder at it. It had its birth in an
      admiration few men receive, and which in Charles Fox's devoted coterie was
      dangerously near to idolatry. During the recital of it Charles walked to
      the window, and there stood looking out upon the gray prospect, seemingly
      paying but little attention. But when Comyn had finished, he wheeled on us
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, he will be telling you next that I have renounced the devil and all
      his works, Richard,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oohs, that I will not,&rdquo; his Lordship made haste to declare. &ldquo;For they
      were born in him, and will die with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Jack,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;how is it that you are not in arms for the
      King, and commanding one of his frigates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is Charles's fault,&rdquo; said my Lord, smiling. &ldquo;Were it not for him
      I should be helping Sir George Collier lay waste to your coast towns.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LV. &ldquo;THE LOVE OF A MAID FOR A MAN&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning, when Dr. Barry had gone, Mrs. Manners propped me up in
      bed and left me for a little, so she said. Then who should come in with my
      breakfast on a tray but my lady herself, looking so fresh and beautiful
      that she startled me vastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A penny for your thoughts, Richard,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Why, you are as grave as
      a screech-owl this brave morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To speak truth, Dolly,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I was wondering how the commodore is to
      get away from the Texel, with half the British navy lying in wait
      outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not worry your head about that,&rdquo; said she, setting down the tray; &ldquo;it
      will be mere child's play to him. Oh but I should like to see your
      commodore again, and tell him how much I love him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray that you may have the chance,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a marvellous quickness she had tied the napkin beneath my chin, not
      so much as looking at the knot. Then she stepped to the mantel and took
      down one of Mr. Wedgwood's cups and dishes, and wiping them with her
      apron, filled the cup with fragrant tea, which she tendered me with her
      eyes sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency is the first to be honoured with this service,&rdquo; says she,
      with a curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was as a man without a tongue, my hunger gone from sheer happiness&mdash;and
      fright. And yet eating the breakfast with a relish because she had made
      it. She busied herself about the room, dusting here and tidying there, and
      anon throwing a glance at me to see if I needed anything. My eyes followed
      her hither and thither. When I had finished, she undid the napkin, and
      brushed the crumbs from the coverlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going?&rdquo; I said, with dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you wish anything more, sir?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dorothy,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;it is you I want, and you will not come near me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant she stood irresolute. Then she put down the tray and came
      over beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really want me, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;I must first tell you that I have some guess at the
      sacrifice you are making for my sake, and of the trouble and danger which
      I bring you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without more ado she put her hand over my mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, reddening, &ldquo;you shall tell me nothing of the sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I seized her hand, however it struggled, and holding it fast, continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have learned that you have been watching with me by night, and
      working by day, when you never should have worked at all. To think that
      you should be reduced to that, and I not know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes sought mine for a fleeting second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you silly boy, I have made a fortune out of my cookery. And fame,
      too, for now am I known from Mary-le-bone to Chelsea, while before my name
      was unheard of out of little Mayfair. Indeed, I would not have missed the
      experience for a lady-in-waiting-ship. I have learned a deal since I saw
      you last, sir. I know that the world, like our Continental money, must not
      be taken for the price that is stamped upon it. And as for the watching
      with you,&rdquo; said my lady, &ldquo;that had to be borne with as cheerfully as might
      be. Since I had sent off for you, I was in duty bound to do my share
      toward your recovery. I was even going to add that this watching was a
      pleasure,&mdash;our curate says the sense of duty performed is sure to be.
      But you used to cry out the most terrifying things to frighten me: the
      pattering of blood and the bumping of bodies on the decks, and the black
      rivulets that ran and ran and ran and never stopped; and strange, rough
      commands I could not understand; and the name of your commodore whom you
      love so much. And often you would repeat over and over: 'I have not yet
      begun, to fight, I have not yet begun to fight!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, 'twas that he answered when they asked him if he had struck,&rdquo; I
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been an awful scene,&rdquo; she said, and her shoulders quivered.
      &ldquo;When you were at your worst you would talk of it, and sometimes of what
      happened to you in London, of that ride in Hyde Park, or&mdash;or of
      Vauxhall,&rdquo; she continued hurriedly. &ldquo;And when I could bear it no longer, I
      would take your hand and call you by name, and often quiet you thus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did I speak of aught else?&rdquo; I asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. When you were caliper, it would be of your childhood, of your
      grandfather and your birthdays, of Captain Clapsaddle, and of Patty and
      her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And never of Dolly, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And never of Dolly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you what you said once, Richard,&rdquo; she answered, her voice
      dropping very low. &ldquo;I was sitting by the window there, and the dawn was
      coming. And suddenly I heard you cry: 'Patty, when I return will you be my
      wife?' I got up and came to your side, and you said it again, twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The room was very still. And the vision of Patty in the parlour of
      Gordon's Pride, knitting my woollen stocking, rose before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said at length, &ldquo;I asked her that the day before I left for the
      war. God bless her! She has the warmest heart in the world, and the most
      generous nature. Do you know what her answer was, Dorothy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; 'Twas only her lips moving that formed the word. She was twisting
      absently the tassel of the bed curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She asked me if I loved her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My lady glanced up with a start, then looked me searchingly through and
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; she said, in the same inaudible way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could answer nothing. 'Twas because of her father's dying wish I asked
      her, and she guessed that same. I would not tell her a lie, for only the
      one woman lives whom I love, and whom I have loved ever since we were
      children together among the strawberries. Need I say that that woman is
      you, Dorothy? I loved you before we sailed to Carvel Hall between my
      grandfather's knees, and I will love you till death claims me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it seemed as if my heart had stopped beating. But the snowy apron
      upon her breast fluttered like a sail stirring in the wind, her head was
      high, and her eyes were far away. Even my voice sounded in the distance as
      I continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be the mistress of Carvel Hall, Dorothy? Hallowed is the day
      that I can ask it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What of this earth may excel in sweetness the surrender of that proud and
      noble nature! And her words, my dears, shall be sacred to you, too, who
      are descended from her. She bent forward a little, those deep blue eyes
      gazing full into my own with a fondness to make me tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Richard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I believe I have loved you always. If I have
      been wilful and wicked, I have suffered more than you know&mdash;even as I
      have made you suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now our suffering is over, Dorothy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't say that, my dear!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;but let us rather make a prayer
      to God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down she got on her knees close beside me, and I took both of her hands
      between my own. But presently I sought for a riband that was around my
      neck, and drew out a locket. Within it were pressed those lilies of the
      valley I had picked for her long years gone by on my birthday. And she
      smiled, though the tears shone like dewdrops on her lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Jack brought you to us for dead, we did not take it off, dear,&rdquo; she
      said gently. &ldquo;I wept with sorrow and joy at sight of it, for I remembered
      you as you were when you picked those flowers, and how lightly I had
      thought of leaving you as I wound them into my hair. And then, when I had
      gone aboard the 'Annapolis', I knew all at once that I would have given
      anything to stay, and I thought my heart would break when we left the
      Severn cliffs behind. But that, sir, has been a secret until this day,&rdquo;
       she added, smiling archly through her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took out one of the withered flowers, and then as caressingly put it
      back beside the others, and closed the locket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbade Dr. Barry to take it off, Richard, when you lay so white and
      still. I knew then that you had been true to me, despite what I had heard.
      And if you were to die&mdash;&rdquo; her voice broke a little as she passed her
      hand over my brow, &ldquo;if you were to die, my single comfort would have been
      that you wore it then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you heard rumours of me, Dorothy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George Worthington and others told me how ably you managed Mr. Swain's
      affairs, and that you had become of some weight with the thinking men of
      the province. Richard, I was proud to think that you had the courage to
      laugh at disaster and to become a factor. I believe,&rdquo; she said shyly,
      &ldquo;twas that put the cooking into my head, and gave me courage. And when I
      heard that Patty was to marry you, Heaven is my witness that I tried to be
      reconciled and think it for the best. Through my own fault I had lost you,
      and I knew well she would make you a better wife than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would not even let Jack speak for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Jack!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;were it not for Jack we should not be here,
      Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Dolly, two people could scarce fall deeper in debt to another
      than are you and I to my Lord Viscount,&rdquo; I answered, with feeling. &ldquo;His
      honesty and loyalty to us both saved you for me at the very outset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied thoughtfully, &ldquo;I believed you dead. And I should have
      married him, I think. For Dr. Courtenay had sent me that piece from the
      Gazette telling of the duel between you over Patty Swain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Courtenay sent you that!&rdquo; I interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a wild young creature then, my dear, with little beside vanity
      under my cap. And the notion that you could admire and love any girl but
      me was beyond endurance. Then his Lordship arrived in England, brimming
      with praise of you, to assure me that the affair was not about Patty at
      all. This was far from making me satisfied that you were not in love with
      her, and I may say now that I was miserable. Then, as we were setting out
      for Castle Howard, came the news of your death on the road to Upper
      Marlboro. I could not go a step. Poor Jack, he was very honest when he
      proposed,&rdquo; she added, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He loved you, Dorothy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not hear me, so deep was she in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twas he who gave me news of you, when I was starving at Gordon's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&mdash;I starved, too, Richard,&rdquo; she answered softly. &ldquo;Dearest, I
      slid very wrong. There are some matters that must be spoken of between us,
      whatever the pain they give. And my heart aches now when I think of that
      dark day in Arlington Street when I gave you the locket, and you went out
      of my life. I knew that I had done wrong then, Richard, as soon as ever
      the door closed behind you. I should have gone with you, for better for
      worse, for richer for poorer. I should have run after you in the rain and
      thrown myself at your feet. And that would have been best for my father
      and for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She covered her face with her hands, and her words were stifled by a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy, Dorothy!&rdquo; I cried, drawing her to me. &ldquo;Another time. Not now,
      when we are so happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, and never again, dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes, I saw and heard all that
      passed in the drawing-room. And I did not blame, but praised you for it. I
      have never spoken a word beyond necessity to my father since. God forgive
      me!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;but I have despised him from that hour. When I knew that
      he had plotted to sell me to that detestable brute, working upon me to
      save his honour, of which he has not the smallest spark; that he had
      recognized and denied you, friendless before our house, and sent you into
      the darkness at Vauxhall to be murdered, then he was no father of mine. I
      would that you might know what my mother has suffered from such a man,
      Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I have often pitied her from my soul,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I shall tell you something of the story of the Duke of
      Chartersea,&rdquo; she went on, and I felt her tremble as she spoke that name.
      &ldquo;I think of all we have Lord Comyn to thank for, next to saving your life
      twice, was his telling you of the danger I ran. And, Richard, after
      refusing you that day on the balcony over the Park, I had no hope left.
      You may thank your own nobility and courage that you remained in London
      after that. Richard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you recall my asking you in the coach,
      on the way from Castle Yard, for the exact day you met my father in
      Arlington Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, in some excitement, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; For I was at last to come at
      the bottom of this affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The duke had made a formal offer for me when first we came to London. I
      think my father wrote of that to Dr. Courtenay.&rdquo; (I smiled at the
      recollection, now.) &ldquo;Then his Grace persisted in following me everywhere,
      and vowed publicly that he would marry me. I ordered him from our house,
      since my father would not. At last one afternoon he came back to dine with
      us, insolent to excess. I left the table. He sat with my father two hours
      or more, drinking and singing, and giving orders to the servants. I shut
      my door, that I might not hear. After a while my mother came up to me,
      crying, saying that Mr. Manners would be branded with dishonour and I did
      not consent to marry his Grace,&mdash;a most terrible dishonour, of which
      she could not speak. That the duke had given my father a month to win my
      consent. And that month was up, Richard, the very afternoon you appeared
      with Mr. Dix in Arlington Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you agreed to marry him, Dolly?&rdquo; I asked breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the grace of Heaven, I did not,&rdquo; she answered quickly. &ldquo;The utmost
      that I would consent to was a two months' respite, promising to give my
      hand to no one in that interval. And so I was forced to refuse you,
      Richard. You must have seen even then that I loved you, dear, though I was
      so cruel when you spoke of saving me from his Grace. I could not bear to
      think that you knew of any stain upon our family. I think&mdash;I think I
      would rather have died, or have married him. That day I threw Chartersea's
      presents out of the window, but my father made the servants gather them
      all which escaped breaking, and put them in the drawing-room. Then I fell
      ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent, I clinging to her, and shuddering to think how near I had
      been to losing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Jack who came to cheer me,&rdquo; I said presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His faith in you was never shaken, sweetheart. But I went to Newmarket
      and Ampthill, and behaved like the ingrate I was. I richly deserved the
      scolding he had for me when I got back to town, which sent me running to
      Arlington Street. There I met Dr. James coming out, who asked me if I was
      Mr. Carvel, and told me that you had called my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, you goose, you never suspected,&rdquo; says she, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was I to suspect that you loved a provincial booby like me, when you
      had the choice of so many accomplished gentlemen with titles and estates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How were you to perceive, indeed, that you had qualities which they
      lacked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were forever vowing that you would marry a nobleman, my lady. For
      you said to me once that I should call you so, and ride in the coach with
      the coroneted panels when I came home on a visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I said, too,&rdquo; retorted Dolly, with mischief in her eyes, &ldquo;do you
      remember what I told you the New Year's eve when we sat out by the sundial
      at Carvel Hall, when I was so proud of having fixed Dr. Courtenay's
      attentions? I said that I should never marry you, sir, who was so rough
      and masterful, and thrashed every lad that did not agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, so you did, and a deal more!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that she broke away from me and, getting to her feet, made me a low
      curtsey with the grace that was hers alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are my Lord and my King, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and my rough Patriot
      squire, all in one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you happy, Dolly?&rdquo; I asked, tremulous from my own joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been happy in all my life before, Richard dear,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, she was a being transformed, and more wondrous fair than ever.
      And even then I pictured her in the brave gowns and jewels I would buy her
      when times were mended, when our dear country would be free. All at once,
      ere I could draw a breath, she had stooped and kissed me ever so lightly
      on the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened upon Aunt Lucy. She had but to look at us, and her black
      face beamed at our blushes. My lady threw her arms about her neck, and hid
      her face in the ample bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now praise de good Lawd!&rdquo; cried Mammy; &ldquo;I knowed it dis longest time.
      What's I done tole you, Miss Dolly? What's I done tole you, honey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But my lady flew from the room. Presently I heard the spinet playing
      softly, and the words of that air came out of my heart from long ago.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Love me little, love me long,
          Is the burthen of my song.
          Love that is too hot and strong
          Burneth soon to waste.
          Still, I would not have thee cold,
          Nor too backward, nor too bold.
          Love that lasteth till 'tis old
          Fadeth not in haste.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVI. HOW GOOD CAME OUT OF EVIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Twas about candlelight when I awoke, and Dorothy was sitting alone beside
      me. Her fingers were resting upon my arm, and she greeted me with a smile
      all tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does my Lord feel better after&mdash;after his excitement to-day?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy, you have made me a whole man again. I could walk to Windsor and
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have your dinner, or your supper first, sir,&rdquo; she answered
      gayly, &ldquo;and do you rest quiet until I come back to feed you. Oh, Richard
      dear,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;how delightful that you should be the helpless one, and
      dependent on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I lay listening for the rustle of her gown, the minutes dragged
      eternally. Every word and gesture of the morning passed before my mind,
      and the touch of her lips still burned on my forehead. At last, when I was
      getting fairly restless, the distant tones of a voice, deep and
      reverberating, smote upon my ear, jarring painfully some long-forgotten
      chord. That voice belonged to but one man alive, and yet I could not name
      him. Even as I strained, the tones drew nearer, and they were mixed with
      sweeter ones I knew well, and Dorothy's mother's voice. Whilst I was still
      searching, the door opened, the voices fell calm, and Dorothy came in
      bearing a candle in each hand. As she set them down on the table, I saw an
      agitation in her face, which she strove to hide as she addressed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you see a visitor, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A visitor!&rdquo; I repeated, with misgiving. 'Twas not so she had announced
      Comyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you see Mr. Allen?&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Allen, who was the rector of St. Anne's? Mr. Allen in London, and
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Her breath seemed to catch at the word. &ldquo;He says he must see you,
      dear, and will not be denied. How he discovered you were with us I know
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See him!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;And I had but the half of my strength I would fling
      him downstairs, and into the kennel. Will you tell him so for me,
      Dorothy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I raised up in bed, shaken with anger against the man. In a trice she
      was holding me, fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, Richard, you will open your wound. I pray you be quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Allen has the impudence to ask to see me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Richard. Your anger makes you forget many things. Remember that
      he is a dangerous man, and now that he knows you are in London he holds
      your liberty, perhaps your life, in his hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. And not mine alone, but the lives and liberty of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what he wishes, Dorothy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he will not tell us. But he is greatly excited, and says he must see
      you at once, for your own good. For your own good, Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not trust the villain, but he may come in,&rdquo; I said, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave me the one lingering, anxious look, and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had I beheld such a change in mortal man as there was in Mr. Allen,
      my old tutor, and rector of St. Anne's. And 'twas a baffling, intangible
      change. 'Twas as if the mask bad been torn from his face, for he was now
      just a plain adventurer that need not have imposed upon a soul. The coarse
      wine and coarse food of the lower coffee-houses of London had replaced the
      rich and abundant fare of Maryland. The next day was become one of the
      terrors of his life. His clothes were of poor stuff, but aimed at the
      fashion. And yet&mdash;and yet, as I looked upon him, a something was in
      his face to puzzle me entirely. I had seen many stamps of men, but this
      thing I could not recognize.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped forward with all of his old confidence, and did not regard a
      farthing my cold stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis like gone days to see you again, Richard,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;And I perceive
      you have as ever fallen into the best of hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mr. Carvel to my enemies, if they must speak to me at all,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear fellow, I am not your enemy, or I should not be here this
      day. And presently I shall prove that same.&rdquo; He took snuff. &ldquo;But first I
      must congratulate you on coming alive out of that great battle off
      Flamborough. You look as though you had been very near to death, my lad. A
      deal nearer than I should care to get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What to say to the man! What to do save to knock him down, and I could not
      do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no passing the time of day between you and me, Mr. Allen,&rdquo; I
      answered hotly. &ldquo;You, whose machinations have come as near to ruining me
      as a man's can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was your own fault, my dear sir,&rdquo; said he, as he brushed
      himself. &ldquo;You never showed me a whit of consideration, which is very dear
      to men in my position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My head swam. Then I saw Dolly by the door regarding me curiously, with
      something of a smile upon her lips, but anxiety still in her eyes. With a
      &ldquo;by your leave, ma'am,&rdquo; to her, Mr. Allen took the chair abreast me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have but to call me when you wish, Richard,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Dorothy, Mr. Allen can have nothing to say to me that you may not
      hear,&rdquo; I said instantly. &ldquo;And you will do me a favour to remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down without a word, where I could look at her. Mr. Allen raised
      his eyebrows at the revelation in our talk, but by the grace of God he
      kept his mouth shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Mr. Allen,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to what do I owe the pain of this visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pain!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and threw back his head and gave way to a fit of
      laughter. &ldquo;By the mass! your politeness drowns me. But I like you,
      Richard, as I have said more than once. I believe your brutal
      straight-dealing has more to do with my predilection than aught else. For
      I have seen a deal of rogues in my day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they have seen a deal of you, Mr. Allen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they have,&rdquo; he cried, and laughed the more. &ldquo;Egad, Miss Dorothy, you
      have saved all of him, I think.&rdquo; Then he swung round upon me, very
      careless. &ldquo;Has your Uncle Grafton called to express his sympathies,
      Richard?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      That name brought a cry out of my head, Dolly seizing the arm of her
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grafton Carvel in London?&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, in very pretty lodgings in Jermyn Street, for he has put by enough,
      I'll warrant you, despite the loss of his lands. Your aunt is with him,
      and his dutiful son, Philip, now broken of his rank in the English army.
      They arrived, before yesterday, from New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to what is this an introduction?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely thought it strange,&rdquo; said Mr. Allen, imperturbably, &ldquo;that he had
      not called to inquire after his nephew's health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly was staring at him, with eyes wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, how did he discover I was in London, sir?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I was about
      to ask how you knew of it, but that is one and the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shot at me a look not to be solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not well to bite the hand that lifts you out of the fire, Richard,&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had not gained admission to this house were I not on my back, Mr.
      Allen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that same circumstance is a blessing for you,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas then I saw Dorothy making me mute signals of appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot think why you are here, Mr. Allen,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;When you consider
      all the harm you have done me, and all the double-dealing I may lay at
      your door, can you blame me for my feelings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, with more soberness than he had yet used; &ldquo;I honour you
      for them. And perchance I am here to atone for some of that harm. For I
      like you, my lad, and that's God's truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is neither here nor there, Mr. Allen,&rdquo; I exclaimed, wholly out
      of patience. &ldquo;If you have come with a message, let me have it. If not, I
      beg you get out of my sight, for I have neither the will nor the desire
      for palavering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Richard, do keep your temper!&rdquo; implored Dorothy. &ldquo;Can you not see
      that Mr. Allen desires to do us&mdash;to do you&mdash;a service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that I am not so sure,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his way, Miss Manners,&rdquo; said the rector, &ldquo;and I hold it not against
      him. To speak truth, I looked for a worse reception, and came steeled to
      withstand it. And had my skin been thin, I had left ere now.&rdquo; He took more
      snuff. &ldquo;It was Mr. Dix,&rdquo; he said to me slowly, &ldquo;who informed Mr. Carvel of
      your presence in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how the devil did Mr. Dix know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply, but glanced apprehensively at Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I have wondered since at his consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Manners may not wish to hear,&rdquo; he said uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Manners hears all that concerns me,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders in comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Mr. Manners, then, who went to Mr. Dix, and told him under the
      pledge of secrecy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a sound came from Dorothy, nor did I dare to look at her face. The
      whole matter was clear to me now. After his conversation with me, Mr.
      Marmaduke had lost no time in seeing Mr. Dix, in order to raise money on
      my prospects. And the man of business had gone straight to Grafton with
      the intelligence. The suspicion flashed through me that Mr. Allen had been
      sent to spy, but his very next words disarmed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Richard,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;before I say what I have come to say,
      and since you cannot now prosecute me, I mean to confess to you something
      which you probably know almost to a certainty. I was in the plot to carry
      you off and deprive you of your fortune. I have been paid for it, though
      not very handsomely. Fears for my own safety alone kept me from telling
      you and Mr. Swain. And I swear to you that I was sorry for the venture
      almost before I had embarked, and ere I had received a shilling. The
      scheme was laid out before I took you for a pupil; indeed, that was part
      of it, as you no doubt have guessed. As God hears me, I learned to love
      you, Richard, in those days at the rectory. You were all of a man, and
      such an one as I might have hoped to be had I been born like you. You said
      what you chose, and spoke from your own convictions, and catered to no
      one. You did not whine when the luck went against you, but lost like a
      gentleman, and thought no more of it. You had no fear of the devil
      himself. Why should you? While your cousin Philip, with his parrot talk
      and sneaking ways, turned my stomach. I was sick of him, and sick of
      Grafton, I tell you. But dread of your uncle drove me on, and I had debts
      to frighten me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused. &ldquo;Twas with a strange medley of emotions I looked at him. And
      Dorothy, too, was leaning forward, her lips parted and her eyes riveted
      upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am speaking the truth,&rdquo; he said bitterly. &ldquo;And I assume no virtue
      for the little justice it remains in my power to do. It is the lot of my
      life that I must be false to some one always, and even now I am false to
      your uncle. Yes, I am come to do justice, and 'tis a strange errand for
      me. I know that estates have been restored to you by the Maryland
      Legislature, Richard, and I believe in my heart that you will win this
      war.&rdquo; Here he fetched a memorandum from his pocket. &ldquo;But to make you
      secure,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in the year 1710, and on the 9th of March, old style,
      your great-grandfather, Mr. George Carvel, drew up a document entailing
      the lands of Carvel Hall. By this they legally pass to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The family settlement Mr. Swain suspected!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what am I to pay for this information?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly were the words spoken, when Dorothy ran to my bedside, and seizing
      my hand, faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;he is not well, Mr. Allen,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector had risen, and stood gazing down at us with the whole of his
      life written on his face. That look was fearful to see, and all of hell
      was expressed therein. For what is hell if it is not hope dead and buried,
      and galling regret for what might have been? With mine own great happiness
      so contrasted against his torture, my heart melted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not well, indeed, Mr. Allen,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;God knows how hard it is for
      me to forgive, but I forgive you this night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One brief instant he stared at me, and then tumbled suddenly down into his
      chair, his head falling forward on his arms. And the long sobs by which
      his frame was shaken awed our very souls. Dorothy drew back against me,
      clasping my shoulder, the tears wet upon her cheeks. What we looked on,
      there in the candlelight, was the Revelation itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long it, endured none of us might say. And when at last he raised his
      face, it was haggard and worn in truth, but the evil of it seemed to have
      fled. Again and again he strove to speak. The words would not obey. And
      when he had mastered himself, his voice was shattered and gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, I have sinned heavily in my time, and preached God's holy word
      with a sneer and unbelief in my heart. He knows what I have suffered, and
      what I shall yet suffer before His judgment comes for us all. But I beg it
      is no sin to pray to Him for your happiness and Miss Dorothy's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stumbled there, and paused, and then continued with more steadiness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came here to-night to betray you, and might have gone hence to your
      uncle to claim my pieces of silver. I remain to tell you that Grafton has
      an appointment at nine with his Majesty's chief Secretary of State. I need
      not mention his motives, nor dwell upon your peril. For the King's
      sentiments toward Paul Jones are well known. You must leave London without
      delay, and so must Mr. Manners and his family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Is it the generations which decide? When I remember bow Dorothy behaved
      that night, I think so. Scarce had the rector ceased when she had released
      me and was standing erect before him. Pity was in her eyes, but in her
      face that courage which danger itself begets in heroic women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have acted a noble part this day, Mr. Allen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to atone for
      the wrongs you have done Richard. May God forgive you, and make you
      happier than you have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struggled to his feet, listening as to a benediction. Then, with a
      single glance to give me confidence, she was gone. And for a minute there
      was silence between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How may you be directed to?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaped as out of a trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just 'the world,' Richard,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;For I am adrift again, and not very
      like to find a harbour, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were to have been paid for this, Mr. Allen,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;And a man
      must live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man must live!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The devil coined that line, and made it some
      men's history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have you on my conscience, Mr. Allen,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;for I have been at
      fault as well as you. I might have treated you better, even as you have
      said. And I command you to assign a place in London whence you may be
      reached.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter to the Mitre coffee-house will be delivered,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall receive it,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;And now I bid you good-by, and thank
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized and held my hand. Then walked blindly to the door and turned
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not tell you that I shall change my life, Richard, for I have said
      that too many times before. Indeed, I warn you that any money you may send
      will be spent in drink, and&mdash;and worse. I will be no hypocrite to
      you. But I believe that I am better this hour than I have been since last
      I knelt at my mother's knee in the little Oxfordshire cottage where I was
      born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Dorothy returned to me, there was neither haste in her step nor
      excitement in her voice. Her very coolness inspired me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel strong enough for a journey, Richard?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the world's end, Dolly, if you will but go with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled faintly. &ldquo;I have sent off for my Lord and Mr. Fox, and pray
      that one of them may be here presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely greater were the visible signs of apprehension upon Mrs. Manners.
      Her first care, and Dorothy's, was to catechise me most particularly on my
      state. And whilst they were so occupied Mr. Marmaduke entered, wholly
      frenzied from fright, and utterly oblivious to his own blame in the
      matter. He was sent out again directly. After that, with Aunt Lucy to
      assist, they hurriedly packed what few things might be taken. The costly
      relics of Arlington Street were untouched, and the French clock was left
      on the mantel to tick all the night, and for days to come, in a silent and
      forsaken room; or perhaps to greet impassively the King's officers when
      they broke in at the door. But I caught my lady in the act of wrapping up
      the Wedgwood cups and dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of these preparations Mr. Fox was heard without, and was met
      at the door by Dorothy. Two sentences sufficed her to tell him what had
      occurred, and two seconds for this man of action to make his decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour you shall have travelling chaises here, Dorothy,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;You must go to Portsmouth, and take ship for Lisbon. And if Jack does not
      arrive, I will go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Charles, you must not!&rdquo; she cried, her emotion conquering her for the
      nonce. &ldquo;That might be to ruin your career, and perchance to lose your
      life. And suppose we were to escape, what would they say of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fish!&rdquo; Charles retorted, to hide some feelings of his own; &ldquo;once our
      rebel is out of the country, they may speak their minds. They have never
      lacked for names to call me, and I have been dubbed a traitor before now,
      my dear lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped hastily to the bed, and laid his hand on me with affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this is all of a piece with your old recklessness. You
      were ever one to take any risk, but I will not hear of such a venture as
      this. Do you think I will allow the hope of all England to be staked for a
      pirate? And would you break our commander of her rank? All that Dorothy
      need do at Portsmouth is to curtsey to the first skipper she meets, and
      I'll warrant he will carry us all to the antipodes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, but that is more practical than it sounds,&rdquo; he replied, with a
      glance of admiration at my lady, as she stood so tall before us. &ldquo;She has
      a cool head, Richard Carvel, and a long head, and&mdash;and I'm thinking
      you are to come out of this the best of all of us. You cannot get far off
      your course, my lad, with her at the helm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was there his voice belied the jest in his words, and he left us with
      precipitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lifted me out of my sheets (I was appalled to discover my weakness),
      and bundled me with tender care in a dozen shawls and blankets. My feet
      were thrust into two pairs of heavy woollen stockings, and Dorothy bound
      her own silk kerchief at my throat, whispering anxious questions the
      while. And when her mother and mammy went from the room, her arms flew
      around my neck in a passion of solicitude. Then she ran away to dress for
      the journey, and in a surprising short time was back again, with her muff
      and her heavy cloak, and bending over me to see if I gave any signs of
      failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty and five minutes had been registered by the French clock, when the
      rattle of wheels and the clatter of hoofs sounded below, and Charles Fox
      panted up the stairs, muffled in a huge wrap-rascal. 'Twas he and Aunt
      Lucy carried me down to the street, Dorothy walking at my side, and
      propped me up in the padded corner of one of the two vehicles in waiting.
      This was an ample travelling-carriage with a lamp hanging from its top, by
      the light of which my lady tucked me in from head to foot, and then took
      her place next me. Aunt Lucy filled most of the seat opposite. The baggage
      was hoisted up behind, and Charles was about to slam the door, when a
      hackney-chaise turned the corner at a gallop and pulled up in the narrow
      street abreast, and the figure of my Lord Comyn suddenly leaped within the
      compass of the lanthorn's rays. He was dressed as for a ball, with only a
      thin rain-cloak over his shoulders, for the night was thick with mist. He
      threw at us a startled look that was a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack, Richard is to be betrayed to-night by his uncle,&rdquo; said Charles,
      shortly. &ldquo;And I am taking them to Portsmouth to get them off for Lisbon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles,&rdquo; said his Lordship, sternly, &ldquo;give me that greatcoat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was just the one time that ever I saw uncertainty on Mr. Fox's face. He
      threw an uneasy glance into the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought money,&rdquo; his Lordship went on rapidly; &ldquo;'Twas that kept me,
      for I guessed at something of this kind. Give me the coat, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fox wriggled out of it, and took the oiled cape in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Jack,&rdquo; he said simply, and stepped into the carriage. &ldquo;Who is
      to mend my waistcoats now?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Faith, I shall treasure this
      against you, Richard. Good-by, my lad, and obey your rebel general. Alas!
      I must even ask your permission to salute her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he kissed the unresisting Dorothy on both her cheeks. &ldquo;God keep the
      two of you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for I love you with all my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before we could answer he was gone into the night; and my Lord, standing
      without, had closed the carriage door. And that was the last I saw of this
      noble man, the true friend of America, who devoted his glorious talents
      and his life to fighting the corruption that was rotting the greatness of
      England. He who was followed by the prayers of the English race was ever
      remembered in our own humble ones.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVII. I COME TO MY OWN AGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Twas a rough, wild journey we made to Portsmouth, my dears, and I think
      it must have killed me had not my lady been at my side. We were no sooner
      started than she pulled the curtains and opened her portmanteau, which I
      saw was near filled with things for my aid and comfort. And I was made to
      take a spoonful of something. Never, I believe, was medicine swallowed
      with a greater willingness. Talk was impossible, so I lay back in the
      corner and looked at her; and now and anon she would glance at my face,
      with a troubled guess in her own as to how I might stand the night. For we
      were still in London. That I knew by the trot of our horses, and by the
      granite we traversed from time to time. But at length we rumbled over a
      bridge, there was a sharp call back from our post-boy to him of the chaise
      behind, and then began that rocking and pitching and swaying and creaking,
      which was to last the whole night long, save for the brief stops at the
      post-houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an hour of it, I was holding my breath against the lurches, like a
      sea-sick man against that bottomless fall of the ship's bows on the ocean.
      I had no pain,&mdash;only an over whelming exhaustion,&mdash;but the joy
      of her touch and her presence kept me from failing. And though Aunt Lucy
      dozed, not a wink of sleep did my lady get through all of those weary
      twelve hours. Always alert was she, solicitous beyond belief, scanning
      ever the dial of her watch to know when to give me brandy and physic; or
      reaching across to feel my temples for the fever. The womanliness of that
      last motion was a thing for a man to wonder at. But most marvellous of all
      was the instinct which told her of my chief sickening discomfort,&mdash;of
      the leathery, travelled smell of the carriage. As a relief for this she
      charged her pocket-napkin with a most delicate perfume, and held it to my
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we drew up to shift horses, Jack would come to the door to inquire if
      there was aught she wanted, and to know how I was bearing up. And often
      Mrs. Manners likewise. At first I was for talking with them, but this
      Dorothy would not allow. Presently, indeed, it was beyond my power, and I
      could only smile feebly at my Lord when I heard Dolly asking him that the
      hostlers might be more quiet. Toward morning a lethargy fell upon me. Once
      I awoke when the lamp had burned low, to perceive the curtains drawn back,
      a black blotch of trees without, and the moonlight streaming in on my
      lady's features. With the crack of a whip I was off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When next consciousness came, the tarry, salt smell of a ship was in my
      nostrils, and I knew that we were embarked. I lay in a clean bunk in a
      fair-sized and sun-washed cabin, and I heard the scraping of ropes and the
      tramp of feet on the deck above my head. Framed against the irregular
      glass of the cabin window, which was greened by the water beyond, Dorothy
      and my Lord stood talking in whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound they turned and ran toward me, asking how I felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that words are very empty, Jack, to express such a gratitude as
      mine,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Twice you have saved me from death, you have paid my
      debts, and have been stanch to us both in our troubles. And&mdash;&rdquo; The
      effort was beyond me, and I glanced appealingly at Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is to you, dear Jack,&rdquo; she finished, &ldquo;it is to you alone that we
      owe the great joy of our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were shining through her tears, and her smile was like the sun
      out of a rain-swept sky. His Lordship took one of her hands in his own,
      and one of mine. He scanned our faces in a long, lingering look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will cherish her, Richard,&rdquo; he said brokenly, &ldquo;for her like is not to
      be found in this world. I knew her worth when first she came to London, as
      arrant a baggage as ever led man a dance. I saw then that a great love
      alone was needed to make her the highest among women, and from the night I
      fought with you at the Coffee House I have felt upon whom that love would
      fall. O thou of little faith,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what little I may have done has
      been for her. No, Richard, you do not deserve her, but I would rather
      think of her as your wife than that of any man living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shall not dwell upon that painful farewell which wrung our hearts, and
      made us silent for a long, long while after the ship was tossing in the
      short seas of the Channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is it my purpose to tell you of that long voyage across the Atlantic.
      We reached Lisbon in safety, and after a week of lodgings in that city by
      the best of fortune got passage in a swift bark bound for Baltimore. For
      the Chesapeake commerce continued throughout the war, and kept alive the
      credit of the young nation. There were many excitements ere we sighted the
      sand-spits of Virginia, and off the Azores we were chased for a day and a
      night by a British sloop of war. Our captain, however, was a cool man and
      a seaman, and slipped through the cruisers lying in wait off the Capes
      very triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the remembrance of those fair days at sea fills my soul with longing.
      The weather was mild and bright for the season, and morning upon morning
      two stout topmen would carry me out to a sheltered spot on the deck,
      always chosen by my lady herself. There I sat by the hour, swathed in many
      layers of wool, and tended by her hands alone. Every nook and cranny of
      our lives were revealed to the other. She loved to hear of Patty and my
      years at Gordon's, and would listen with bated breath to the stories of
      the Ranger and the Bonhomme Richard, and of that strange man whom we both
      loved, whose genius had made those cruises famous. Sometimes, in low
      voices, we talked of our future; but often, when the wind blew and the
      deck rocked and the sun flashed upon the waters, a silence would fall
      between us that needed no word to interpret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Manners yielded to my wish for us all to go to Carvel Hall. It was on
      a sparkling morning in February that we sighted the familiar toe of Kent
      Island, and the good-natured skipper put about and made for the mouth of
      our river. Then, as of old, the white cupola of Carvel House gleamed a
      signal of greeting, to which our full hearts beat a silent response. Once
      again the great windmill waved its welcome, and the same memory was upon
      us both as we gazed. Of a hale old gentleman in the sheets of a sailing
      pinnace, of a boy and a girl on his knees quivering with excitement of the
      days to come. Dorothy gently pressed my hand as the bark came into the
      wind, and the boat was dropped into the green water. Slowly they lowered
      me into it, for I was still helpless, Dorothy and her mother and Aunt Lucy
      were got down, and finally Mr. Marmaduke stepped gingerly from the
      sea-ladder over the gunwale. The cutter leaped under the strong strokes up
      the river with the tide. Then, as we rounded the bend, we were suddenly
      astonished to see people gathered on the landing at the foot of the lawn,
      where they had run, no doubt, in a flurry at sight of the ship below. In
      the front of the group stood out a strangely familiar figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed Dolly, &ldquo;it is Ivie Rawlinson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ivie it was, sure enough. And presently, when we drew a little closer, he
      gave one big shout and whipped off the hat from his head; and off, too,
      came the caps from the white heads of Scipio and Chess and Johnson behind
      him. Our oars were tossed, Ivie caught our bows, and reached his hand to
      Dorothy. It was fitting that she should be the first to land at Carvel
      Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twas yere bonny face I seed first, Miss Dolly,&rdquo; he cried, the tears
      coursing down the scars of his cheeks. &ldquo;An' syne I kennt weel the young
      master was here. Noo God be praised for this blythe day, that Mr.
      Richard's cam to his ain at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Scipio and Chess could only blubber as they helped him to lift me out,
      Dolly begging them to be careful. As they carried me up the familiar path
      to the pillared porch, the first I asked Ivie was of Patty, and next why
      he had left Gordon's. She was safe and well, despite the Tories, and
      herself had sent him to take charge of Carvel Hall as soon as ever Judge
      Bordley had brought her the news of its restoration to me. He had supplied
      her with another overseer. Thanks to the good judge and to Colonel Lloyd,
      who had looked to my interests since Grafton was fled, Ivie had found the
      old place in good order, all the negroes quiet, and impatient with joy
      against my arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is time, my children, to bring this story to a close. I would I might
      write of those delicious spring days I spent with Dorothy at Carvel Hall,
      waited on by the old servants of my grandfather. At our whim my chair
      would be moved from one to another of the childhood haunts; on cool days
      we sat in the sun by the dial, where the flowers mingled their odours with
      the salt breezes off the Chesapeake; or anon, when it was warmer, in the
      summer-house my mother loved, or under the shade of the great trees on the
      lawn, looking out over the river. And once my lady went off very
      mysteriously, her eyes brimful of mischief, to come back with the first
      strawberries of the year staining her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were married on the fifteenth of June, already an anniversary for us
      both, in the long drawing-room. General Clapsaddle was there from the army
      to take Dorothy in his arms, even as he had embraced another bride on the
      same spot in years gone by. She wore the wedding gown that was her
      mother's, but when the hour was come to dress her Aunt Lucy and Aunt
      Hester failed in their task, and it was Patty who performed the most of
      that office, and hung the necklace of pearls about her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Patty! She hath often been with us since. You have heard your mothers
      and fathers speak of Aunt Patty, my dears, and they will tell you how she
      spoiled them when they went a-visiting to Gordon's Pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere I had regained my health, the war for Independence was won. I pray God
      that time may soften the bitterness it caused, and heal the breach in that
      noble race whose motto is Freedom. That the Stars and Stripes and the
      Union Jack may one day float together to cleanse this world of tyranny!

      AFTERWORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      The author makes most humble apologies to any who have, or think they
      have, an ancestor in this book. He has drawn the foregoing with a very
      free hand, and in the Maryland scenes has made use of names rather than of
      actual personages. His purpose, however poorly accomplished, was to give
      some semblance of reality to this part of the story. Hence he has
      introduced those names in the setting, choosing them entirely at random
      from the many prominent families of the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one may read the annals of these men, who were at once brave and
      courtly, and of these women, who were ladies by nature as well as by
      birth, and not love them. The fascination of that free and hospitable life
      has been so strong on the writer of this novel that he closes it with a
      genuine regret and the hope that its perusal may lead others to the
      pleasure he has derived from the history of Maryland.
    </p>
    <p>
      As few liberties as possible have been taken with the lives of Charles
      James Fox and of John Paul Jones. The latter hero actually made a voyage
      in the brigantine 'John' about the time he picked up Richard Carvel from
      the Black Moll, after the episode with Mungo Maxwell at Tobago. The Scotch
      scene, of course, is purely imaginary. Accuracy has been aimed at in the
      account of the fight between the 'Bonhomme Richard' and the 'Serapis',
      while a little different arrangement might have been better for the medium
      of the narrative. To be sure, it was Mr. Mease, the purser, instead of
      Richard Carvel, who so bravely fought the quarter-deck guns; and in
      reality Midshipman Mayrant, Commodore Jones's aide, was wounded by a pike
      in the thigh after the surrender. No injustice is done to the second and
      third lieutenants, who were absent from the ship during the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author must acknowledge that the only good anecdote in the book and
      the only verse worth printing are stolen. The story on page concerning Mr.
      Garrick and the Archbishop of York may be found in Fitzgerald's life of
      the actor, much better told. The verse (in Chapter X) is by an unknown
      author in the Annapolis Gazette, and is republished in Mr. Elihu Riley's
      excellent &ldquo;History of Annapolis.&rdquo;

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
