<h2><a name="DEDICATION" id="DEDICATION"></a>DEDICATION OF VOLUMES ONE AND TWO OF PLAYS FOR AN IRISH THEATRE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady Gregory</span>, I dedicate to you two volumes of plays
that are in part your own.</p>

<p>When I was a boy I used to wander about at Rosses Point and Ballisodare
listening to old songs and stories. I wrote down what I heard and made
poems out of the stories or put them into the little chapters of the
first edition of "The Celtic Twilight," and that is how I began to write
in the Irish way.</p>

<p>Then I went to London to make my living, and though I spent a part of
every year in Ireland and tried to keep the old life in my memory by
reading every country tale I could find in books or old newspapers, I
began to forget the true countenance of country life. The old tales were
still alive for me indeed, but with a new, strange, half unreal life, as
if in a wizard's glass, until at last, when I had finished "The Secret
Rose," and was half-way through "The Wind Among the Reeds," a wise woman
in her trance told me that my inspiration was from the moon, and that I
should always live close to water, for my work was getting too full of
those little jewelled thoughts that come from the sun and have no
nation. I had no need to turn to my books of astrology to know that the
common people are under the moon, or to Porphyry to remember the
image-making power of the waters. Nor did I doubt the entire truth of
what she said to me, for my head was full of fables that I had no longer
the knowledge and emotion to write. Then you brought me with you to see
your friends in the cottages, and to talk to old wise men on Slieve
Echtge, and we gathered together, or you gathered for me, a great number
of stories and traditional beliefs. You taught me to understand again,
and much more perfectly than before, the true countenance of country
life.</p>

<p>One night I had a dream almost as distinct as a vision, of a cottage
where there was well-being and firelight and talk of a marriage, and
into the midst of that cottage there came an old woman in a long cloak.
She was Ireland herself, that Cathleen ni Hoolihan for whom so many
songs have been sung and about whom so many stories have been told and
for whose sake so many have gone to their death. I thought if I could
write this out as a little play I could make others see my dream as I
had seen it, but I could not get down out of that high window of
dramatic verse, and in spite of all you had done for me I had not the
country speech. One has to live among the people, like you, of whom an
old man said in my hearing, "She has been a serving-maid among us,"
before one can think the thoughts of the people and speak with their
tongue. We turned my dream into the little play, "Cathleen ni Hoolihan,"
and when we gave it to the little theatre in Dublin and found that the
working people liked it, you helped me to put my other dramatic fables
into speech. Some of these have already been acted, but some may not be
acted for a long time, but all seem to me, though they were but a part
of a summer's work, to have more of that countenance of country life
than anything I have done since I was a boy.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>A lawn with croquet hoops, garden chairs and
tables. Door into house at left. Gate through hedge at back. The
hedge is clipped into shapes of farmyard fowl.</i> <span class="smcap">Paul
Ruttledge</span> <i>is clipping at the hedge in front. A table with toys
on it.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Coming out on steps.</i>] Paul, are you
coming in to lunch?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> No; you can entertain these people very well. They
are your friends: you understand them.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> You might as well come in. You have been
clipping at that old hedge long enough.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> You needn't worry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p002" id="Page_p002">[2]</a></span> about me. I should be bored if I
went in, and I don't want to be bored more than is necessary.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> What is that creature you are clipping at now? I
can't make it out.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh, it is a Cochin China fowl, an image of some of
our neighbours, like the others.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> I don't see any likeness to anyone.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh, yes there is, if you could see their minds
instead of their bodies. That comb now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Coming out on steps.</i>] Thomas, are you
coming in?</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> Yes, I'm coming; but Paul won't come.</p>

<div class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Thomas Ruttledge</span> <i>goes out.</i></div>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> Oh! this is nonsense, Paul; you must come. All
these men will think it so strange if you don't. It is nonsense to think
you will be bored. Mr. Green is talking in the most interesting way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p003" id="Page_p003">[3]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh! I know Green's conversation very well.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> And Mr. Joyce, your old guardian. Thomas says he
was always so welcome in your father's time, he will think it so queer.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh! I know all their virtues. There's Dowler, who
puts away thousands a year in Consols, and Algie, who tells everybody all
about it. Have I forgotten anybody? Oh, yes! Colonel Lawley, who used to
lift me up by the ears, when I was a child, to see Africa. No, Georgina,
I know all their virtues, but I'm not coming in.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> I can't imagine why you won't come in and be
sociable.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> You see I can't. I have something to do here. I
have to finish this comb. You see it is a beautiful comb; but the wings
are very short. The poor creature can't fly.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> But can't you finish that after lunch?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p004" id="Page_p004">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> No, I have sworn.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> Well, I am sorry. You are always doing
uncomfortable things. I must go in to the others. I wish you would have
come. [<i>She goes in.</i></p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> [<i>Who has come to gate as she disappears.</i>] Paul, you
there! that is lucky. I was just going to ask for you.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Flinging clipper away, and jumping up.</i>]
Oh, Father Jerome, I am delighted to see you. I haven't seen you for ever
so long. Come and have a talk; or will you have some lunch?</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> No, thank you; I will stay a minute, but I won't go in.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> That is just as well, for you would be bored to
death. There has been a meeting of magistrates in the village, and my
brother has brought them all in to lunch.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I am collecting for the Monastery, and my donkey has gone
lame; I have had to put it up in the village. I thought you might be
able to lend me one to go on with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p005" id="Page_p005">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Of course, I'm delighted to lend you that or
anything else. I'll go round to the yard with you and order it. But sit
down here first. What have you been doing all this time?</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Oh, we have been very busy. You know we are going to put
up new buildings.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Absent-mindedly.</i>] No, I didn't know that.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Yes, our school is increasing so much we are getting a
grant for technical instruction. Some of the Fathers are learning
handicrafts. Father Aloysius is going to study industries in France; but
we are all busy. We are changing with the times, we are beginning to do
useful things.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Useful things. I wonder what you have begun to
call useful things. Do you see those marks over there on the grass?</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> What marks?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Those marks over there, those little marks of
scratching.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p006" id="Page_p006">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> [<i>Going over to the place</i> <span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge</span> <i>has
pointed out.</i>] I don't see anything.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> You are getting blind, Jerome. Can't you see that
the poultry have been scratching there?</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> No, the grass is perfectly smooth.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Well, the marks are there, whether you see them
or not; for Mr. Green and Mr. Dowler and Mr. Algie and the rest of them
run out of their houses when nobody is looking, in their real shapes,
shapes like those on my hedge. And then they begin to scratch, they
scratch all together, they don't dig but they scratch, and all the time
their mouths keep going like that.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He holds out his hand and opens and shuts his fingers like a
bird's bill.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Oh, Paul, you are making fun of me.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Of course I am only talking in parables. I think
all the people I meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p007" id="Page_p007">[7]</a></span> are like farmyard creatures, they have forgotten
their freedom, their human bodies are a disguise, a pretence they keep
up to deceive one another.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> [<i>Sitting down.</i>] What is wrong with you?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh, nothing of course. You see how happy I am. I
have a good house and a good property, and my brother and his charming
wife have come to look after me. You see the toys of their children here
and everywhere. What should be wrong with me?</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I know you too well not to see that there is something
wrong with you.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> There is nothing except that I have been thinking
a good deal lately.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Perhaps your old dreams or visions or whatever they were
have come back. They always made you restless. You ought to see more of
your neighbours.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> There's nothing inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p008" id="Page_p008">[8]</a></span>esting but human nature, and
that's in the single soul, but these neighbours of mine they think in
flocks and roosts.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> You are too hard on them. They are busy men, they hav'n't
much time for thought, I daresay.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> That's what I complain of. When I hear these
people talking I always hear some organized or vested interest chirp or
quack, as it does in the newspapers. Algie chirps. Even you, Jerome,
though I have not found your armorial beast, are getting a little
monastic; when I have found it I will put it among the others. There is a
place for it there, but the worst of it is that it will take so long
getting nice and green.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I don't know what creature you could make for me.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I am not sure yet; I think it might be a pigeon,
something cooing and gentle, and always coming home to the dovecot; not
to the wild woods but to the dovecot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p009" id="Page_p009">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I wonder what creature you yourself are like.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I daresay I am like some creature or other, for
very few of us are altogether men; but if I am, I would like to be one
of the wild sort. You are right about my dreams. They have been coming
back lately. Do you remember those strange ones I had at college?</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Those visions of pulling something down?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Yes, they have come back to me lately. Sometimes I
dream I am pulling down my own house, and sometimes it is the whole
world that I am pulling down. [<i>Standing up.</i>] I would like to have
great iron claws, and to put them about the pillars, and to pull and
pull till everything fell into pieces.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I don't see what good that would do you.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh, yes it would. When everything was pulled down
we would have more room to get drunk in, to drink con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p010" id="Page_p010">[10]</a></span>tentedly out of the
cup of life, out of the drunken cup of life.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> That is a terribly wild thought. I hope you don't believe
all you say.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Perhaps not. I only know that I want to upset
everything about me. Have you not noticed that it is a complaint many of
us have in this country? and whether it comes from love or hate I don't
know, they are so mixed together here.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I wish you would come and talk to our Superior. He has a
perfect gift for giving advice.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Well, we'll go to the yard now. [<i>He gets
up.</i></p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I have often thought you would come to the Monastery
yourself in the end. You were so much the most pious of us all at
school. You would be happy in a Monastery. Something is always happening
there.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>As they go up the garden.</i>] I daresay, I
daresay; but I am not even sure that I am a Christian.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p011" id="Page_p011">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Well, anyway, I wish that you would come and talk to our
Superior. [<i>They go out.</i><br/><br/></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span> <i>enter by the path beyond
the hedge and stand at gate.</i></p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> No use going up there, Johneen, it's too grand a
place, it's a dog they might let loose on us. But I'll tell you what,
just slip round to the back door and ask do they want any cans mended.</p>

<p><i>Johneen.</i> Let you take the rabbit then we're after taking out of
the snare. I can't bring it round with me.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Faith, you can't. They think as bad of us taking a
rabbit that was fed and minded by God as if it was of their own rearing;
give it here to me. It's hardly it will go in my pocket, it's as big as
a hare. It's next my skin I'll have to put it, or it might be noticed on
me. [<i>Boy goes out.</i></p>

there e'er a tin can the maids in the house might want mended or any
chairs to be bottomed?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> A tinker; where do you live?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Faith, I don't stop long in any place. I go about
like the crows; picking up my way of living like themselves.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Opening gate.</i>] Come inside here.
[<span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span> <i>hesitates.</i>] Come in, you are welcome.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Puts his hand on his shoulder.</i> <span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span> <i>tries to
close his shirt over rabbit.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Ah, you have a rabbit there. The keeper told me
he had come across some snares in my woods.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> If he did, sir, it was no snare of mine he found.
This is a rabbit I bought in the town of Garreen early this morning.
Sixpence I was made give for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p013" id="Page_p013">[13]</a></span> it, and to mend a tin can along with that.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Touching rabbit.</i>] It's warm still, however.
But the day is hot. Never mind; you are quite welcome to it. I daresay
you will have a cheery meal of it by the roadside; my dinners are often
tiresome enough. I often wish I could change&mdash;look here, will you change
clothes with me?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Faith, I'd swap soon enough if you weren't humbugging
me. It's I that would look well with that suit on me! The peelers would
all be touching their caps to me. You'd see them running out for me to
sign summonses for them.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> But I am not humbugging. I am in earnest.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> In earnest! Then when I go back I'll commit Paddy
Cockfight to prison for hitting me yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> You don't believe me, but I will explain. I'm dead
sick of this life; I want to get away; I want to escape&mdash;as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p014" id="Page_p014">[14]</a></span> you say, to
pick up my living like the crows for a while.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> To make your escape. Oh! that's different. [<i>Coming
closer.</i>] But what is it you did? You don't look like one that would be
in trouble. But sometimes a gentleman gets a bit wild when he has a drop
taken.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Well, never mind. I will explain better while we are
changing. Come over here to the potting shed. Make haste, those
magistrates will be coming out.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> The magistrates! Are they after you? Hurry on, then!
Faith, they won't know you with this coat. [<i>Looking at his rags.</i>] It's a
pity I didn't put on my old one coming out this morning.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>They go out through the garden.</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas Ruttledge</span> <i>comes
down steps from house with</i> <span class="smcap">Colonel Lawley</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Green</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> Yes, they have made me President of the County
Horticultural Society. My speech was quite a success;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p015" id="Page_p015">[15]</a></span> it was punctuated
with applause. I said I looked upon the appointment not as a tribute to
my own merits, but to their public spirit and to the Society, which I
assured them had come to stay.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> What has become of Paul and Father Jerome? I thought
I heard their voices out here, and now they are conspicuous by their
absence.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> He seems to have no friend he cares for but that
Father Jerome.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> I wish he would come more into touch with his fellows.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> What a pity he didn't go into the army. I wish he
would join the militia. Every man should try to find some useful sphere
of employment.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> Thomas, your brother will never come to see me, though
I often ask him. He would find the best people&mdash;people worth meeting&mdash;at
my house. I wonder if he would join the Horticultural Society? I know I
voice the sentiments of all the members in saying this. I spoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p016" id="Page_p016">[16]</a></span> to a
number of them at the function the other day.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> I wish he would join something. Joyce wants him
to join the Masonic Lodge. It is not a right life for him to keep hanging
about the place and doing nothing.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> He won't even come and sit on the Bench. It's not fair
to leave so much of the work to me. I ought to get all the support
possible from local men.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Ruttledge</span> <i>comes down steps with</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Dowler</span>,
<span class="smcap">Mr. Algie</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Joyce</span>. <i>She is walking in front.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas Ruttledge</span>.] Oh! Thomas, isn't it
too bad, Paul has lent the donkey to that friar. I wanted Mr. Joyce to
see the children in their panniers. Do speak to him about it.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> Well, the donkey belongs to him, and for the
matter of that so does the house and the place. It would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p017" id="Page_p017">[17]</a></span> rather hard
on him not to be able to use things as he likes.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Algie.</i> What a pleasure it must be to Paul to have you and the
little ones living here. He certainly owes you a debt of gratitude. Man
was not born to live alone.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> Well, I think we have done him good. He hasn't done
anything for years, except mope about the house and cut the bushes into
those absurd shapes, and now we are trying to make him live more like
other people.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> He was always inclined to be a bit of a faddist.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Algie</span>.] Do let me give you a lesson in
croquet. I have learned all the new rules. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Joyce</span>.] Please
bring me that basket of balls. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Colonel Lawley</span>.] Will you
bring me the mallets? Yes, I am afraid he is a faddist. We have done our
best for him, but he ought to be more with men.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Algie.</i> Yes, Mr. Dowler was just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p018" id="Page_p018">[18]</a></span> saying he ought to try and be
made a director of the new railway.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> The militia&mdash;the militia.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> It's a great help to a man to belong to a Masonic Lodge.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> The Horticultural Society is in want of new members.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> Well, I wish he would join something.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> For goodness' sake, Paul, don't make such a fool of
yourself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p019" id="Page_p019">[19]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> What on earth has happened, and who on earth is that
man?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Opens gate for tinker. To</i> <span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span>.] Wait for
me, my friend, down there by the cross-road.</p>

<div class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span> <i>goes out.</i></div>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> Has he stolen your clothes?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh! it's all right; I have changed clothes with him. I
am going to join the tinkers.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> To join the tinkers!</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Life is getting too monotonous; I would give it a
little variety. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Green</span>.] As you would say, it has been running
in grooves.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Ruttledge</span>.] This is only his humbugging
talk; he never believes what he says.</p>

<div class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge</span> <i>goes towards the steps.</i></div>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> Surely you are not going into the house with those
clothes?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> You are quite right. Thomas will go in for me. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Thomas Ruttledge</span>.] Just go to my study, will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p020" id="Page_p020">[20]</a></span> you, and bring me my
despatch-box; I want something from it before I go.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> Where are you going to? I wish you would tell me
what you are at.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> The despatch-box is on the top of the bureau.</p>

<div class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Thomas Ruttledge</span> <i>goes out.</i></div>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> What does all this mean?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I will explain. [<i>Sits down on the edge of iron
table.</i>] Did you never wish to be a witch, and to ride through the air
on a white horse?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> I can't say I ever did.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Never? Only think of it&mdash;to ride in the darkness under
the stars, to make one's horse leap from cloud to cloud, to watch the
sea glittering under one's feet and the mountain tops going by.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> But what has this to do with the tinkers?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> As I cannot find a broomstick that will turn itself
into a white horse, I am going to turn tinker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p021" id="Page_p021">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Dowler.</i> I suppose you have some picturesque idea about these
people, but I assure you, you are quite wrong. They are nothing but
poachers.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Algie.</i> They are nothing but thieves.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> They are the worst class in the country.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh, I know that; they are quite lawless. That is what
attracts me to them. I am going to be irresponsible.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> One cannot escape from responsibility by joining a set of
vagabonds.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Vagabonds&mdash;that is it. I want to be a vagabond, a
wanderer. As I can't leap from cloud to cloud I want to wander from road
to road. That little path there by the clipped edge goes up to the
highroad. I want to go up that path and to walk along the highroad, and
so on and on and on, and to know all kinds of people. Did you ever think
that the roads are the only things that are endless; that one can walk
on and on and on, and never be stopped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p022" id="Page_p022">[22]</a></span> by a gate or a wall? They are
the serpent of eternity. I wonder they have never been worshipped. What
are the stars beside them? They never meet one another. The roads are
the only things that are infinite. They are all endless.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> But they must stop when they come to the sea?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Ah! you are always so wise.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> Stop talking nonsense, Paul, and throw away those filthy
things.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> That would be setting cleanliness before godliness. I
have begun the regeneration of my soul.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Dowler.</i> I don't see what godliness has got to do with it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Algie.</i> Nor I either.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> There was a saint who said, "I must rejoice without
ceasing, although the world shudder at my joy." He did not think he
could save his soul without it. I agree with him, and as I was
discontented here, I thought it time to make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p023" id="Page_p023">[23]</a></span> change. Like that worthy
man, I must be content to shock my friends.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Dowler.</i> But you had everything here you could want.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> That's just it. You who are so wealthy, you of all
people should understand that I want to get rid of all that
responsibility, answering letters and so on. It is not worth the trouble
of being rich if one has to answer letters. Could you ever understand,
Georgina, that one gets tired of many charming things? There are family
responsibilities [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Joyce</span>], but I can see that you, who were my
guardian, sympathize with me in that.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> Indeed I do not.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> I should think you could be cheerful without ceasing
to be a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> You are thinking of my clothes. We must feel at ease
with the people we live amongst. I shall feel at ease with the great
multitude in these clothes. I am beginning to be a man of the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p024" id="Page_p024">[24]</a></span> I
am the beggarman of all the ages&mdash;I have a notion Homer wrote something
about me.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Dowler.</i> He is either making fun of us or talking great rot. I
can't listen to any more of this nonsense. I can't see why a man with
property can't let well alone. Algie are you coming my way?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>They both go into the house, and come out presently with umbrella
and coat.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> Depend upon it, he's going to write a book. There was a man
who made quite a name for himself by sleeping in a casual ward.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh! no, I'm not going to write about it; if one writes
one can do nothing else. I am going to express myself in life. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Thomas Ruttledge</span> <i>who has returned with box.</i>] I hope soon to live by the
work of my hands, but every trade has to be learned, and I must take
something to start with. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Ruttledge</span>.] Do you think you will
have any kettles to mend when I come this way again?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p025" id="Page_p025">[25]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He has taken box from</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas Ruttledge</span> <i>and unlocked it.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> I can't make head or tail of what you are at.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> What he is at is fads.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> I don't think his motive is far to seek. He has some idea
of going back to the dark ages. Rousseau had some idea of the same kind,
but it didn't work.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Yes; I want to go back to the dark ages.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> Do you want to lose all the world has gained since then?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> What has it gained? I am among those who think that
sin and death came into the world the day Newton eat the apple. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Ruttledge</span>, <i>who is going to speak.</i>] I know you are going to tell me
he only saw it fall. Never mind, it is all the same thing.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Beginning to cry.</i>] Oh! he is going mad!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> I'm afraid he is really leaving us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p026" id="Page_p026">[26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Who has been looking at papers, tearing one or two,
etc., takes out a packet of notes, which he puts in his breast.</i>] I
daresay this will last me long enough, Thomas. I am not robbing you of
very much. Well, good-bye. [<i>Pats him gently on the shoulder.</i>] I
mustn't forget the rabbit, it may be my dinner to-night; I wonder who
will skin it. Good-bye, Colonel, I think I've astonished you to-day.
[<i>Slaps his shoulder.</i>] That was too hard, was it? Forgive it, you know
I'm a common man now. [<i>Lifts his hat and goes out of gate. Closes it
after him and stands with his hands on it, and speaks with the voice of
a common man.</i>] Go on, live in your poultry-yard. Scratch straw and
cluck and cackle at everything that you take for a fox. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> [<i>Goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Ruttledge</span>, <i>who has sat down and is wiping
her eyes.</i>] I am very sorry for this, for his father's sake, but it may
be as well in the end. If it comes to the worst, you and Thomas will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p027" id="Page_p027">[27]</a></span>
keep up the family name better than he would have done.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Dowler.</i> He'll find the poor very different from what he thinks
when they pick his pocket.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> To think that a magistrate should have such fads!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> I venture to say you will see him here in a very different
state of mind in a week.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Algie.</i> [<i>Who has been in a brown study.</i>] He has done for himself
in this world and the next. Why, he won't be asked to a single shoot if
this is heard of.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Turning from the gate.</i>] Here are the children,
Georgina. Don't say anything before the nurse.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> Well, I must be off. [<i>Goes in for stick.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> Just bring me out my coat, Green.</p>

<div class="blockquot">[<i>They all prepare to go.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Ruttledge</span> <i>has gone to open gate and
children come in, one in a perambulator.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p028" id="Page_p028">[28]</a></span>
<i>All gather round them admiringly.</i></div>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> Have you a kiss for godfather to-day?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ruttledge.</i> The poor darlings! I hope they will never know what
has happened.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> Thank goodness, they have no nonsense in their heads.
We know where we are with them.</p>

<h2><a name="ACT_II" id="ACT_II"></a>ACT II.</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>By the roadside. A wall of unmortared stone in the
background. Tinkers' encampment. Men, women, and children standing
round.</i> <span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge</span> <i>standing by a fire.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> What do you mean by "tinning" the soldering iron?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> If the face of it is not well tinned it won't lift the
solder. Show me here.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Takes soldering iron from</i> <span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge's</span> <i>hand.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Sitting down and drawing a tin can to him.</i>] Now,
let me see how you mend this hole. It seems easy. I'm sure I will be
able to learn it as well as any of you.</p>

<p>[<i>Two tinkers come and stand over him.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p030" id="Page_p030">[30]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> [<i>Pointing to one of them.</i>] This, sir, is Tommy the
Song. He's the best singer we have, but the divil a much good he is only
that. He's a great warrant to snare hares.</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> Is the gentleman going to join us?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Indeed I am, if you'll let me. There's nothing I'd
like better.</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> But are you going to learn the trade?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Yes, if you'll teach me. I'm sure I'll make a good
tinker. Look at that now, see how I've stopped that hole already.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> [<i>Taking the can from him and looking at it.</i>] If every
can had a little hole in the middle like that, I think you <i>would</i> be
able to mend them; but there's the straight hole, and the crooked hole,
the round hole, the square hole, the angle hole, the bottom hole, the
top hole, the side leak, the open leak, the leak-all-round, but I won't
frighten you with the names of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p031" id="Page_p031">[31]</a></span> all, only this I will say, that,
when you've learned to mend all the leakages in a can&mdash;and that should
take you a year&mdash;you're only in the first day of the tinker's week.</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> Don't believe him. He's only humbugging you. It's not
the hardness of the work will daunt you.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Thank you. I was not believing him at all. I'm quite
sure I'll be able to mend any can at the end of a week, but the
bottoming of them will take longer. I can see that's not so easy. When
will you start to teach me that, Charlie?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> [<i>As another tinker comes up.</i>] Paddy, here's the
gentleman I was telling you about. He's going to join us for good and
all. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge</span>.] Wait till we have time and some quiet place,
and he'll show you as good a cockfight as ever you saw. [<i>A woman comes
up.</i>] This is his wife; Molly the Scold we call her; faith, she is a
better fighter than any cock he ever had in a basket; he'd find it hard
to shut the lid on her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p032" id="Page_p032">[32]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Molly the Scold.</i> The gentleman seems foolish. Is he all there?</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> Stop your chat, Molly, or I'll hit you a welt.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Keep your tongue quiet, Molly. If the gentleman has
reasons for keeping out of the way it isn't for us to be questioning
him. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge</span>.] Don't mind her, she's cross enough, but
maybe your own ladies would be cross as well if they saw their young
sons dying by the roadside in a little kennel of straw under the
ass-cart the way she did; from first to last.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I suppose you have your troubles like others. But you
seem cheerful enough.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> It isn't anything to fret about. Some of us go soon, and
some travel the roads for their lifetime. What does it matter when we
are under the nettles if it was with a short rope or a long one we were
hanged?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Yes, that is the way to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p033" id="Page_p033">[33]</a></span> take life. What does the
length of our rope matter?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> We haven't time to be thinking of troubles like people
that would be shut up in a house. We have the wide world before us to
make our living out of. The people of the whole world are begrudging us
our living, and we make it out of them for all that. When they will
spread currant cakes and feather beds before us, it will be time for us
to sit down and fret.</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> It's likely you'll think the life too hard. Would you
like to be passing by houses in the night-time, and the fire shining out
of them, and you hardly given the loan of a sod to light your pipe, and
the rain falling on you?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Why are the people so much against you?</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> We are not like themselves. It's little we care about
them or they about us. If their saint did curse us itself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Stop. I won't have you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p034" id="Page_p034">[34]</a></span> talking about that story here.
Why would they think so much of the curse of one saint, and saints so
plenty?</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> Where's the good of a gentleman being here? He'll be
breaking down on the road. It's on the ass-cart he'll be wanting to sit.</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> Indeed, I don't think he'll stand the hardship.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh, I'll stand it well enough.</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> You're not like us that were reared to it. You were
not born like us with wandering in the heart.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh yes, I have wandering in the heart. I got sick of
these lighted rooms you were talking of just now.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> That might be so. It's the dark is welcome to a man
sometimes.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> The dark. Yes, I think that is what I want. [<i>Stands
up.</i>] The dark, where there is nothing that is anything, and nobody that
is anybody; one can be free there, where there is nothing. Well, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p035" id="Page_p035">[35]</a></span> you
let me stay with you, I don't think you will hear any complaints from
me. Charlie Ward, Paddy, and the rest of you, I want you to understand
that from this out I am one of yourselves. I'll live as you live and do
as you do.</p>

<p><i>Child.</i> Oh! but we were going to&mdash;&mdash; But I won't tell you. [<i>To the
other</i> children.] Come away here, and we'll not tell him what we'll do.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span>.] What are they going to do?
They're putting their heads together.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> They're going to put a bush across the road, and when
the friar gets down to pull it out of the way they'll snap what they can
off the ass, and away with them.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> And why wouldn't they tell me that? Am I not one of
yourselves?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Ah! It's likely they'll never trust you.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> But they will soon see that I am one of themselves.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> No; but that's the very thing, you're not one of
ourselves. You were not born on the road, reared on the road, married on
the road like us.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Well, it's too late for me to be reared on the road,
but I don't see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p037" id="Page_p037">[37]</a></span> why I shouldn't marry on the road like you. I certainly
would do it if it would make me one of you.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> It might make you one of us, there's no doubt about
that. It's the only thing that would do it.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Well, find a wife for me.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Faith, you haven't far to go to find one. Paddy there
will give you over his wife quick enough; he won't make a hard bargain
over her.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> But I am in earnest. I want to cut myself off from my
old life.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Oh! I was forgetting that.</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Molly.</span>] I wonder what was it he did? I wonder had
he the misfortune to kill anybody?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> [<i>Calling</i> <span class="smcap">Sabina</span> <i>over.</i>] Here's a girl should make a
good wife, Sabina Silver her name is. Her father is just dead; he didn't
treat her over well.</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> [<i>Coming over.</i>] What is it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p038" id="Page_p038">[38]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> This gentleman wants to speak to you. I think he's
looking out for a wife.</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> [<i>Hanging her head.</i>] Don't be humbugging me.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Indeed he's not, Sabina.</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> You're only joking a poor girl. Sure, what would make
you think of me at all?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Sabina, have you been always on the road with Charlie
Ward and the others?</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> I have, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> And you'd make a good tinker's wife?</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> You're joking me, but I would be a better wife for a
tinker than for anyone else.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Sabina, will you marry me?</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> Oh! but I'd be afraid.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Why, Sabina?</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> I'd be afraid you'd beat me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p039" id="Page_p039">[39]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> You see her father used to beat her. She's afraid of the
look of a man now.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I would not beat you, Sabina. How can you have got
such an idea?</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> Will you promise me that you won't beat me? Will you
swear it to me?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Of course I will.</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span>.] Will you make him swear it?
Haven't you a little book in your pack? Bring it out and make him swear
to me on it, and you'll be my witness.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> I think, Sibby, you need not be afraid.</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> What's your name, gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> My name is Paul. Do you like it?</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> Then I won't marry you, Mr. Paul, till you swear to me
upon the book that you will never beat me with any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p040" id="Page_p040">[40]</a></span> stick that you could
call a stick, and that you will never strike a kick on me from behind.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Charlie, go and bring out that book to satisfy her. Of
course I swear that; it is absurd.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span> <i>brings the book out of his pack.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I swear, Sabina, that I will never strike you with any
stick of any kind, and that I will never kick you. There, will that do?
[<i>He takes book and kisses it.</i></p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> I misdoubt you. Kiss the book again. [<span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge</span>
<i>kisses it.</i></p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> That's all right.</p>

<p><i>A Child.</i> [<i>Crying from a distance.</i>] He's coming now, the priest's
coming!</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Then the priest will marry us. That comes in very
handy.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> [<i>Scornfully.</i>] A priest marry you, indeed he'll do
nothing of the kind. I hate priests and friars. It's unlucky to get
talking to them at all. You never know what trouble you're in for.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p041" id="Page_p041">[41]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A Child.</i> [<i>Coming up.</i>] That's true, indeed. The last time I spoke to
a priest it's what he leathered me with a stick; may the divil fly away
with him.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> But somebody must marry us.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Of course. You'll lep over the tinker's budget the usual
way. You'll just marry her by lepping over the budget the same as the
rest of us marry.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> That's all I want to know. Please marry me in whatever
is your usual way.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> [<i>Turning.</i>] What do you want?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p042" id="Page_p042">[42]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Oh! I'm mistaken. I thought&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I am here, Father Jerome, but you're talking to the
wrong man.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Good God, Paul, what has happened?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Nothing has happened that need surprise you. Don't you
remember what we talked of to-day? You told me I was too much by myself.
After you went away I thought I would make a change.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> But a change like this!</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Why should you find fault with it? I am richer now
than I was then. I only lent you that donkey then, now I give him to
you.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> What has brought you among such people as these?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I find them on the whole better company than the
people I left a little while ago. Let me introduce you to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> What can you possibly gain by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p043" id="Page_p043">[43]</a></span> coming here? Are you going to
try and teach them?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh! no, I am going to learn from them.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> What can you learn from them?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> To pick up my living like the crows, and to solder tin
cans. Just give me that one I mended a while ago.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Holds it out to</i> <span class="smcap">Father Jerome</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> That is all nonsense.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I am happy. Do not your saints put all opponents to
the rout by saying they alone of all mankind are happy?</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I suppose you will not compare the happiness of these people
with the happiness of saints?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> There are all sorts of happiness. Some find their
happiness like Thomas &agrave; Kempis, with a little book and a little cell.</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> I would wonder at anybody that could be happy in a
cell.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> These men fight in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p044" id="Page_p044">[44]</a></span> way as your saints fought,
for their hand is against the world. I want the happiness of men who
fight, who are hit and hit back, not the fighting of men in red coats,
that formal, soon-finished fighting, but the endless battle, the endless
battle. Tell me, Father Jerome, did you ever listen in the middle of the
night?</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Listen for what?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Did you ever, when the monastery was silent, and the
dogs had stopped barking, listen till you heard music?</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> What sort of music do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Not the music we hear with these ears [<i>touching his
ears</i>], but the music of Paradise.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Brother Colman once said he heard harps in the night.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Harps! It was because he was shut in a cell he heard
harps, maybe it sounds like harps in a cell. But the music I have heard
sometimes is made of the continual clashing of swords. It comes
rejoicing from Paradise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p045" id="Page_p045">[45]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> These are very wild thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> I often heard music in the forths. There is many of us
hear it when we lie with our heads on the ground at night.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> That was not the music of Paradise.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Why should they not hear that music, although it may
not set them praying, but dancing.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> How can you think you will ever find happiness amongst their
devils' mirth?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I have taken to the roads because there is a wild
beast I would overtake, and these people are good snarers of beasts.
They can help me.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> What kind of a wild beast is it you want?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh! it's a very terrible wild beast, with iron teeth
and brazen claws that can root up spires and towers.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> It's best not to try and overtake a beast like that, but
to cross running water and leave it after you.</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> I heard one coming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p046" id="Page_p046">[46]</a></span> after me one night; very big and
shadowy it was, and I could hear it breathing. But when it came up with
me I lifted a hazel rod was in my hand, and it was gone on the moment.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> My wild beast is Laughter, the mightiest of the
enemies of God. I will outrun it and make it friendly.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> That is your old wild talk. Do have some sense and go back to
your family.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I am never going back to them. I am going to live
among these people. I will marry among them.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> That is nonsense; you will soon change your mind.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh! no, I won't; I am taking my vows as you made yours
when you entered religion. I have chosen my wife; I am going to marry
before evening.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Thank God, you will have to stop short of that, the Church
will never marry you.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh! I am not going to ask the help of the Church. But
I am to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p047" id="Page_p047">[47]</a></span> be married by what may be as old a ceremony as yours. What is
it I am to do, Charlie?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> To lep a budget, sir.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Yes, that is it, the budget is there by the wall.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I command you, in the name of the Holy Church and of the
teaching you have received from the Church, to leave this folly, this
degradation, this sin!</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> You forget, Jerome, that I am on the track of the wild
beast, and hunters in all ages have been a bad people to preach to. When
I have tamed the beast, perhaps I will bring him to your religious house
to be baptized.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I will not listen to this profanity. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span>.] It
is you who have put this madness on him as you have stolen his clothes!</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Stop your chat, ye petticoated preacher.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I think, Father Jerome, you had better be getting
home. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p048" id="Page_p048">[48]</a></span> people never gave in to the preaching of S. Patrick.</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> I'll send you riding home with your face to the tail
of the ass!</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> No, stop till we show you that we can make as good
curses as yourself. That you may never be warm in winter or cold in
summer time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> That's the chat! Bravo! Let him have it.</p>

<p><i>Tinkers.</i> Be off! be off out of this!</p>

<p><i>Molly the Scold.</i> Now curse him, Tommy.</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> A wide hoarseness on you&mdash;a high hanging to you on a
windy day; that shivering fever may stretch you nine times, and that the
curses of the poor may be your best music, and you hiding behind the
door. [<span class="smcap">Jerome</span> <i>goes out.</i></p>

<p><i>Molly the Scold.</i> And you hiding behind the door, and squeezed between

is a friend of mine.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He goes to the wall, and stands there silently, looking upward.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> It was grand talk, indeed: I didn't understand a word
of it.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> The crows are beginning to fly home. There is a flock
of them high up under that cloud. I wonder where their nests are.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> A long way off, among those big trees about Tillyra
Castle.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Yes, I remember. I have seen them coming home there on
a windy evening, tossing and whirling like the sea. They may have seen
what I am looking for, they fly so far. A sailor told me once that he
saw a crow three hundred miles from land, but maybe he was a liar.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Well, they fly far, anyway.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> They tell one another what they have seen, too. That
is why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p050" id="Page_p050">[50]</a></span> they make so much noise. Maybe their news goes round the world.
[<i>He comes towards the others.</i>] I think they have seen my wild beast,
Laughter. They could tell me if he has a face smoky from the eternal
fires, and wings of brass and claws of brass&mdash;claws of brass. [<i>Holds
out his hands and moves them like claws.</i>] Sabina, would you like to see
a beast with eyes hard and cold and blue, like sapphires? Would you,
Sabina? Well, it's time now for the wedding. So what shall we get for
the wedding party? What would you like, Sabina?</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> I don't know.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> What do you say, Charlie? A wedding cake and
champagne. How would you like champagne? [Tinkers <i>begin to return</i>.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> It might be middling.</p>

the priest. I took a hold of this, and Johneen made a snap at the
onions.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> And he didn't catch you?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> He'd want to be a lot smarter than he is to do that.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> You are a smart lad, anyway. What do you say we should
have for our wedding party?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Are you rich?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> More or less.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> I seen a whole truck full of cakes and bullseyes in the village
below. Could you buy the whole of them?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Stop talking nonsense. What we want is porter.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> All right. How many public-houses are there in the
village?</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> Twenty-four.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p052" id="Page_p052">[52]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Is there any place we can have barrels brought to?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> There's a shed near seems to be empty. We might go
there.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Then go and order as many barrels as we can make use
of to be brought there.</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> We will; and we'll stop till we've drunk them out.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Taking out money.</i>] I have more money than will pay
for that. Sabina, we'll treat the whole neighbourhood in honour of our
wedding. I'll have all the public-houses thrown open, and free drinks
going for a week!</p>

<span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge</span> <i>sitting on an upturned basket.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Stop that melodeon, now will ye, and we'll have a taste

Where in the earthly world is Tommy the Song?</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> He's over there in the corner.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> What are you doing there, Tommy?</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> Taking a mouthful of prayers, I am.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Praying! did anyone ever hear the like of that? Pull him

<div class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Paddy Cockfight</span> <i>pulls</i> <span class="smcap">Tommy the Song</span> <i>out of the corner.</i></div>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> What is it you were praying for, I would like to know?</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> I was praying that we might all soon die.</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> Die, is it?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Is it die and all that porter about? Well! you have done
enough praying, go over there and look for the basket. Who was it set
him praying, I wonder? I am thinking it is the first prayer he ever said
in his life.</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> It's likely it was Paul. He's after talking to him
through the length of an hour.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Maybe it was. Don't mind him. I said just now that
when we were all dead and in heaven it would be a sort of drunkenness, a
sort of ecstasy. There is a hymn about it, but it is in Latin. "Et calix
meus inebrians quam praeclarus est." How splendid is the cup of my
drunkenness!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p055" id="Page_p055">[55]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Well, that is a great sort of a hymn. I never thought
there was a hymn like that, I never did.</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> To think, now, there is a hymn like that. I mustn't
let it slip out of my mind. How splendid is the cup of my drunkenness,
that's it.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Have you found that old bird of mine?</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> [<i>Who has been searching among the baskets.</i>] Here he
is, in the basket and a lot of things over it.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Get out that new speckled bird of yours, Paddy, I've
been wanting to see how could he play for a week past.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Where do you get the cocks?</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> It was a man below Mullingar owned this one. The day
I first seen him I fastened my two eyes on him, he preyed on my mind,
and next night, if I didn't go back every foot of nine miles to put him
in my bag.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p056" id="Page_p056">[56]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Do you pay much for a good fighting cock?</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> [<i>Laughs.</i>] Do you pay much, Paddy?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Perhaps you don't pay anything.</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> I think Paddy gets them cheap.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> He gets them cheaper than another man would, anyhow.</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> He's the best cock I ever saw before or since.
Believe me, I made no mistake when I pitched on him.</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> I don't care what you think of him. I'll back the red;
it's he has the lively eye.</p>

<p><i>Molly the Scold.</i> Andy Farrell had an old cock, and it bent double like
himself, and all the feathers flittered out of it, but I hold you he'd
leather both your red and your speckled cock together. I tell ye, boys,
that was the cock!</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Those free drinks of yours, Paul, is playing the devil
with them. Do you hear them now and every roar out of them? They're
putting the cocks astray. [<i>He takes out a cock.</i>] Sure they think it's
thunder.</p>

<p><i>Molly the Scold.</i> There's not a man of them outside there now but would
be ready to knock down his own brother.</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> He wouldn't know him to knock him down. They're all
blind. I never saw the like of it.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> You in here stood it better than that.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> When those common men drink it's what they fall down.
They haven't the heads. They're not like us that have to keep heads and
heels on us.</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> It's well we kept them out of this, or they'd be
lying on the floor now, and there'd be no place for my poor bird to show
himself off. Look at him now! Isn't he the beauty! [<i>Takes out the
cock.</i></p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Now boys, settle the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p058" id="Page_p058">[58]</a></span> place, put over those barrels out

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I am sure you will echo Mr. Dowler, Algie.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Algie.</i> Indeed I do. I endorse his sentiments completely. There has
not been a stroke of work done for the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p060" id="Page_p060">[60]</a></span> week. The hay is lying in
ridges where it has been cut, there is not a man to be found to water
the cattle. It is impossible to get as much as a horse shod in the
village.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I think you have something to say, Colonel Lawley?</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> I have undoubtedly. I want to know when law and order
are to be re-established. The police have been quite unable to cope with
the disorder. Some of them have themselves got drunk. If my advice had
been taken the military would have been called in.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> The military are not indispensable on occasions like the
present. There are plenty of police coming now. We have wired to Dublin
for them, they will be here by the four o'clock train.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Gets down from his bin.</i>] But you have not told me
what you have come here for? Is there anything I can do for you?</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> Won't you come home, Paul? The children have been
ask<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p061" id="Page_p061">[61]</a></span>ing for you, and we don't know what to say.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> We have come to request you to go to the public-houses, to
stop the free drinks, to send the people back to their work. As for
those tinkers, the law will deal with them when the police arrive.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> Oh, Paul, why have you upset the place like this?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Well, I wanted to give a little pleasure to my
fellow-creatures.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Dowler.</i> This seems rather a low form of pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I daresay it seems to you a little violent. But the
poor have very few hours in which to enjoy themselves; they must take
their pleasure raw; they haven't the time to cook it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Algie.</i> But drunkenness!</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Putting his hand on the shoulders of two of the
magistrates.</i>] Have we not tried sobriety? Do you like it? I found it
very dull? [<i>A yell from outside.</i>] There is not one of those people
outside but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p062" id="Page_p062">[62]</a></span> thinks that he is a king, that he is riding the wind. There
is not one of them that would not hit the world a slap in the face. Some
poet has written that exuberance is beauty, and that the roadway of
excess leads to the palace of wisdom. But I forgot&mdash;you do not read the
poets.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Dowler.</i> What we want to know is, are you going to send the people
back to their work?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh, work is such a little thing in comparison with
experience. Think what it is to them to have their imagination like a
blazing tar-barrel for a whole week. Work could never bring them such
blessedness as that.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Dowler.</i> Everyone knows there is no more valuable blessing than
work.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Algie.</i> Idleness is the curse of this country.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I am prejudiced, for I have always been an idler.
Doubtless, the poor must work. It was, no doubt, of them you were
speaking. Yet, doesn't the Church<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p063" id="Page_p063">[63]</a></span> say, doesn't it describe heaven as a
place where saints and angels only sing and hold branches and wander
about hand in hand. That must be changed. We must teach the poor to
think work a thing fit for heaven, a blessed thing. I'll tell you what
we'll do, Dowler. Will you subscribe, and you, and you, and we'll send
lecturers about with magic lanterns showing heaven as it should be, the
saints with spades and hammers in their hands and everybody working. The
poor might learn to think more of work then. Will you join in that
scheme, Dowler?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Dowler.</i> I think you'd better leave these subjects alone. It is
obvious you have cut yourself off from both religion and society.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> The world could not go on without work.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> The world could not go on without work! The world
could not go on without work! I must think about it. [<i>Gets up on bin.</i>]
Why should the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p064" id="Page_p064">[64]</a></span> go on? Perhaps the Christian teacher came to bring
it to an end. Let us send messengers everywhere to tell the people to
stop working, and then the world may come to an end. He spoke of the
world, the flesh, and the devil. Perhaps it would be a good thing to end
these one by one.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> Come away out of this. He has gone mad.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Ah! I thought that would scare them.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> I wish, Paul, you would come back and live like a
Christian.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Like a Christian?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> Come away, there's no use stopping here any longer.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Sternly.</i>] Wait, I have something to say to that.
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span>.] Do not let anyone leave this place.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Tinkers <i>close together at the door</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> [<i>To</i> Tinkers.] This is nonsense. Let me through.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Tinker <i>spreads out his arms before him</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> You have come into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p065" id="Page_p065">[65]</a></span> different kingdom now; the old
kingdom of the people of the roads, the houseless people. We call
ourselves tinkers, and you are going to put us on our trial if you can.
You call yourselves Christians and we will put you on your trial first.
I will put the world on its trial, and myself of yesterday. [<i>To a</i>
Boy.] Run out, Johneen, keep a watch, and tell us when the train is
coming. Sabina, that rope; we will set these gentlemen on those barrels.
[Tinkers <i>take hold of them</i>.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> Keep your hands off me, you drunken scoundrel!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Strikes at</i> <span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span>, <i>but</i> Tinkers <i>seize his arms behind.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Tie all their hands behind them.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Dowler.</i> We'd better give in, there's no saying how many more of
them there are.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Algie.</i> I'll be quiet, the odds are too great against us.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> The police will soon be here; we may as well stay quietly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p066" id="Page_p066">[66]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> Here, give it to me, I'll put a good twist in it.
Don't be afraid, sir, it's not about your neck I'm putting it&mdash;&mdash;. There
now, sit quiet and easy, and you won't feel it at all.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Are all their hands tied? Now then, heave them up on
to the barrels.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Slight scuffle, during which all are put on the barrels in a
semicircle.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Ah! yes, you are on my barrels now; last time I saw
you, you were on your own dunghill. Let me see, is there anyone here who
can write?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Nobody.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Never mind, you can keep count on your fingers. The
rest must sit down and behave themselves as befits a court. They say
they are living like Christians. Let us see.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> Oh, Paul, don't make such a fool of yourself.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> The point is not wisdom or folly, but the Christian
life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p067" id="Page_p067">[67]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Dowler.</i> Don't answer him, Thomas. Let us preserve our dignity.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Algie.</i> Yes, let us keep a dignified attitude&mdash;we won't answer
these ruffians at all.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Respect the court! [<i>Turns to Colonel Lawley.</i>] You
have served your Queen and country in the field, and now you are a
colonel of militia.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> Well, what is there to be ashamed of in that? Answer
me that, now.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Yet there is an old saying about turning the other
cheek, an old saying, a saying so impossible that the world has never
been able to get it out of its mind. You have helped to enlist men for
the army, I think? Some of them have fought in the late war, and you
have even sent some of your own militia there.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> If I did I'm proud of it.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Did they think it was a just war?</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> That was not their business. They had taken the
Queen's pay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p068" id="Page_p068">[68]</a></span> They would have disgraced themselves if they had not gone.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Is it not the doctrine of your Christian Church, of
your Catholic Church, that he who fights in an unjust war, knowing it to
be unjust, loses his own soul?</p>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> I should like to know what would happen to the country
if there weren't soldiers to protect it.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> We are not discussing the country, we are discussing
the Christian life. Has this gentleman lived the Christian life?</p>

<p><i>All the Tinkers.</i> He has not!</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> His sergeant tried to enlist me, giving me a
shilling, and I drunk.</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> [<i>Singing.</i>]</p>

<p>
She bid me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree,<br />
But I, being young and foolish, with her would not agree.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Stop your mouth, Tommy. This is not your show. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Paul
Ruttledge</span>.] Are you going to put a fine on the Colonel? If so I'd like
his cloak.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p069" id="Page_p069">[69]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Now we'll try Mr. Dowler, the rich man. [<i>Holds up his
fingers in a ring.</i>] Mr. Dowler, could you go through this?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Algie.</i> Don't answer him, Dowler; he's going beyond all bounds.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I was a rich man and I could not, and yet I am
something smaller than a camel, and this is something larger than a
needle's eye.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> Don't answer this profanity.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> But what about the cloak?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh! go and take it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span> <i>goes and takes cloak off the</i> <span class="smcap">Colonel</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Colonel Lawley.</i> You drunken rascal, I'll see you in the dock for this.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Joyce.</i> You're encouraging robbery now.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Remember the commandment, "Give to him that asketh
thee"; and the hard commandment goes even farther, "Him that taketh thy
cloak forbid not to take thy coat also." [<i>Holding out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p070" id="Page_p070">[70]</a></span> his rags.</i>]
Have I not shown you what Mr. Green would call a shining example.
Charlie, ask them all for their coats.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> I will, and their boots, too.</p>

<p><i>All the Tinkers.</i> [<i>Uproariously.</i>] Give me your coat; I'll have your
boots, etc.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green.</i> Wait till the police come. I'll turn the tables on you; you
may all expect hard labour for this.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>To the</i> Tinkers.] Stand back, the trial is not over.
Mr. Green, these friends of yours have been convicted of breaking the
doctrine they boast of. They do not love their enemies; they do not give
to every man that asks of them. Some of them, Mr. Dowler, for instance,
lay up treasures upon earth; they ask their goods again of those who
have taken them away. But you, Mr. Green, are the worst of all. They
break the Law of Christ for their own pleasure, but you take pay for
breaking it. When their goods are taken away you condemn the taker; when
they are smitten on one cheek you punish the smiter. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p071" id="Page_p071">[71]</a></span> encourage them
in their breaking of the Law of Christ.</p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> He does, indeed. He gave me two months for snaring
rabbits.</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> He tried to put a fine on me for a cock I had, and he
took five shillings off Molly for hitting a man.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Your evidence is not wanted. His own words are enough.
[<i>Stretching out his arms.</i>] Have any of these gentlemen been living the
Christian life?</p>

<p><i>All.</i> They have not.</p>

<p><i>Johneen.</i> [<i>Coming in.</i>] Ye'd best clear off now. I see the train
coming in to the station.</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> The police will find plenty to do in the village
before they come to us; that's one good job.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> One moment. I have done trying the world I have left.
You have accused me of upsetting order by my free drinks, and I have
showed you that there is a more dreadful fermentation in the Sermon on
the Mount than in my beer-barrels.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p072" id="Page_p072">[72]</a></span> Christ thought it in the
irresponsibility of His omnipotence. [<i>Getting from his bin.</i>] Charlie,
give me that cloak. [<i>He flings it back.</i></p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Aren't you going to punish them anyway?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> No, no, from this out I would punish nobody but
myself.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Some of the</i> Tinkers <i>have gone out</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> We'd best be off while we can. Come along, Paul, Sibby's
gone.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>As they go out</i> <span class="smcap">Tommy the Song</span> <i>is singing</i>,</p></div>

Down by the sally garden my love and I did stand,<br />
And on my leaning shoulder she laid her milk-white hand;<br />

But I, being young and foolish, with her would not agree.<br />

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>All go out except</i> <span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Well, good-bye, Thomas;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p073" id="Page_p073">[73]</a></span> I don't suppose I'll see you
again. Use all I have; spend it on your children; I'll never want it.
[<i>To the others.</i>] Will you come and join us? We will find rags for you
all. Perhaps you will give up that dream that is fading from you, and
come among the blind, homeless people; put off the threadbare clothes of
the Apostles and run naked for awhile. [<i>Is going out.</i></p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> You have nothing against me, have you, Paul?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh, yes, I have; a little that I have said against all
these, and a worse thing than all, though it is not in the book.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Ruttledge.</i> What is it?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Looking back from the threshold.</i>] You have begotten
fools.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Scene 1.</span>&mdash;<i>Great door in the middle of the stage under a stone
cross, with flights of steps leading to door. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Charlie Ward,
Paddy Cockfight, Tommy The Song</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sabina Silver</span>. <i>They are
supporting</i> <span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge</span>, <i>who is bent and limping.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> We must leave you here. The monks will take you in.
We're very sorry, Paul. It's a heartscald to us to leave you and you
know that, but what can we do? [<i>They lead</i> <span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge</span> <i>to steps.</i></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Ah! that was a bad stitch! [<i>Gasps.</i>] Take care now;
put me down gently.</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> Oh! can't we keep him with us anyway; he'll find no one
to care him as well as myself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p075" id="Page_p075">[75]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tommy the Song.</i> What way can you care him, Sibby? It's no way to have
him lying out on the roadside under guano bags, like ourselves, and the
rain coming down on him like it did last night. It's in hospital he'll
be for the next month.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> We'd never leave you if you could even walk. If we have
to give you to the monks itself, we'd keep round the place to encourage
you, only for the last business. We'll have to put two counties at least
between us and Gortmore after what we're after doing.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Never mind, boys, they'll never insult a tinker again
in Gortmore as long as the town's a town.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Dear knows! it breaks my heart to think of the fine
times we had of it since you joined us. Why the months seemed like days.
And all the fine sprees we had together! Now you're gone from us we
might as well be jailed at once.</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> And how you took to the cocks! I believe you were a
better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p076" id="Page_p076">[76]</a></span> judge than myself. No one but you would ever have fancied that
black-winged cock&mdash;and he never met his match.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Ah! well, I'm doubled up now like that old cock of
Andy Farrell's.</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> No, but you were the best warrant to set a snare that
ever I came across.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Sitting down with difficulty on the steps.</i>] Yes; it
was a grand time we had, and I wouldn't take back a day of it; but it's
over now, I've hit my ribs against the earth and they're aching.</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> Oh! Paul, Paul, is it to leave you we must? And you
never once struck a kick or a blow on me all this time, not even and you
in pain with the rheumatism. [<i>A clock strikes inside.</i></p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> There's the clock striking. The monks will be getting
up. We'd best be off after the others. I hear some noise inside; they'd
best not catch us here. I'll stop and pull the bell. Be off with you,
boys!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p077" id="Page_p077">[77]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Good-bye, Sabina. Don't cry! you'll get another
husband.</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> I'll never lep the budget with another man; I swear it.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Good-bye, Paddy. Good-bye, Tommy. My mother Earth will
have none of me and I will go look for my father that is in heaven.</p>

<p><i>Paddy Cockfight.</i> Come along, Sibby.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Takes her hand and hurries off.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> [<i>Rings bell.</i>] Are they sure to let you in, Paul? Have
you got your story ready?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> No fear, they won't refuse a sick man. No one knows me
but Father Jerome, and he won't tell on me.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> There's a step inside. I'll cut for it.</p>

window high up in the wall, through which the cold dawn is
breaking. Altar in a niche at the back of stage; there are seven
unlighted candles on the altar. A little hanging lamp near the
altar.</i> <span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge</span> <i>is lying on the altar steps. Friars are
dancing slowly before him in the dim light.</i> <span class="smcap">Father Aloysius</span> <i>is
leaning against a pillar.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Some</i> Friars <i>come in carrying lanterns.</i></p>

<p><i>First Friar.</i> What are they doing? Dancing?</p>

<p><i>Second Friar.</i> I told you they were dancing, and you would not believe
me.</p>

<p><i>First Friar.</i> What on earth are they doing it for?</p>

<p><i>Third Friar.</i> I heard them saying Father Paul told them to do it if
they ever found him in a trance again. He told them it was a kind of
prayer and would bring joy down out of heaven, and make it easier for
him to preach.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p079" id="Page_p079">[79]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Second Friar.</i> How still he is lying; you would nearly think him to be
dead.</p>

<p><i>A Friar.</i> It is just a twelvemonth to-day since he was in a trance like
this.</p>

<p><i>Second Friar.</i> That was the time he gave his great preaching. I can't
blame those that went with him, for he all but persuaded me.</p>

<p><i>First Friar.</i> They think he is going to preach again when he awakes,
that's why they are dancing. When he wakes one of them will go and call
the others.</p>

<p><i>Third Friar.</i> We were all in danger when one so pious was led away.
It's five years he has been with us now, and no one ever went so quickly
from lay brother to novice, and novice to friar.</p>

<p><i>First Friar.</i> The way he fasted too! The Superior bade me watch him at
meal times for fear he should starve himself.</p>

<p><i>Third Friar.</i> He thought a great deal of Brother Paul then, but he
isn't so well pleased with him now.</p>

<p><i>Second Friar.</i> What is Father Aloysius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p080" id="Page_p080">[80]</a></span> doing there? standing so quiet
and his eyes shut.</p>

<p><i>Third Friar.</i> He is meditating. Didn't you hear Brother Paul gives
meditations of his own.</p>

<p><i>First Friar.</i> Colman was telling me about that. He gives them a joyful
thought to fix their minds on. They must not let their minds stray to
anything else. They must follow that single thought and put everything
else behind them.</p>

<p><i>Third Friar.</i> Colman fainted the other day when he was at his
meditation. He says it is a great labour to follow one thought always.</p>

<p><i>Second Friar.</i> What do they do it for?</p>

<p><i>First Friar.</i> To escape what they call the wandering of nature. They
say it was in the trance Brother Paul got the knowledge of it. He says
that if a man can only keep his mind on the one high thought he gets out
of time into eternity, and learns the truth for itself.</p>

<p><i>Third Friar.</i> He calls that getting above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p081" id="Page_p081">[81]</a></span> law and number, and becoming
king and priest in one's own house.</p>

<p><i>Second Friar.</i> A nice state of things it would be if every man was his
own priest and his own king.</p>

<p><i>First Friar.</i> I wonder will he wake soon. I thought I saw him stir just
now. Father Aloysius, will he wake soon?</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> What did you say?</p>

<p><i>First Friar.</i> Will he wake soon?</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> Yes, yes, he will wake very soon now.</p>

<p><i>Second Friar.</i> What are they going to do now; are they going to dance?</p>

<p><i>Third Friar.</i> He was too patient with him. He would have made short
work of any of us if we had gone so far.</p>

<p><i>First Dancer.</i></p>

<p>
Nam, et si ambulavero in medio umbrae mortis,<br />
Non timebo mala, quoniam tu mecum es.<br />

no use wasting words on a dead body.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> [<i>Stooping over him.</i>] His eyes are beginning to quiver. Let
me be the first to speak to him. He may say some wild things when he
awakes, not knowing who is before him.</p>

<p><i>Superior.</i> He must not preach. I must have his submission at once.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I will do all I can with him. He is most likely to listen to
me. I was once his close friend.</p>

<p><i>Superior.</i> Speak to him if you like, but entire submission is the only
thing I will accept. [<i>To the other</i> Monks.] Come with me, we will leave
Father Jerome here to speak to him. [<span class="smcap">Superior</span> <i>and</i> Friars <i>go to the
door</i>.] Such desecration, such blasphemy. Remember, Father Jerome,
entire submission, and at once. [<span class="smcap">Superior</span> <i>and</i> Friars <i>go out.</i></p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Where are the rest of his friends, Father Aloysius? Bartley
and Colman ought to be with him when he is like this.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p084" id="Page_p084">[84]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> They are resting, because, when he has given his message,
they may never be able to rest again.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> [<i>Bending over him.</i>] My poor Paul, this will wear him out;
see how thin he has grown!</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> He is hard upon his body. He does not care what happens to
his body.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> He was like this when he was a boy; some wild thought would
come on him, and he would not know day from night, he would forget even
to eat. It is a great pity he was so hard to himself; it is a pity he
had not always someone to look after him.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> God is taking care of him; what could men like us do for
him? We cannot help him, it is he who helps us.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> [<i>Going on his knee and taking his hand.</i>] He is awaking. Help
me to lift him up. [<i>They lift him into a chair.</i></p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> I will go and call the others now.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Do not let them come for a little time, I must speak to him
first.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> I cannot keep them away long.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p085" id="Page_p085">[85]</a></span> One cannot know when the
words may be put in his mouth.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Aloysius</span> <i>goes out.</i> <span class="smcap">Jerome</span> <i>stands by</i> <span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge</span>, <i>holding his
hand.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Raising his head.</i>] Ah, you are there, Jerome. I am
glad you are there. I could not get up to drive away the mouse that was
eating the wax that dropped from the candles. Have you driven it away?</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> It is not evening now. It is almost morning. You were on your
knees praying for a great many hours, and then I think you fainted.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I don't think I was praying. I was among people, a
great many people, and it was very bright&mdash;I will remember presently.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Do not try to remember. You are tired, you must be weak, you
must come and have food and rest.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I do not think I can rest. I think there is something
else I have to do, I forget what it is.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p086" id="Page_p086">[86]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I am afraid you are thinking of preaching again. You must not
preach. The Superior says you must not. He is very angry; I have never
seen him so angry. He will not allow you to preach again.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Did I ever preach?</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Yes. It was in the garden you got the trance last time. We
found you like this, and we lifted you to the bench under the yew tree,
and then you began to speak. You spoke about getting out of the body
while still alive, about getting away from law and number. All the
friars came to listen to you. We had never heard such preaching before,
but it was very like heresy.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Getting up.</i>] Jerome, Jerome, I remember now where I
was. I was in a great round place, and a great crowd of things came
round me. I couldn't see them very clearly for a time, but some of them
struck me with their feet, hard feet like hoofs, and soft cat-like feet;
and some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p087" id="Page_p087">[87]</a></span> pecked me, and some bit me, and some clawed me. There were all
sorts of beasts and birds as far as I could see.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Were they devils, Paul, were they the deadly sins?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I don't know, but I thought, and I don't know how the
thought came to me, that they were the part of mankind that is not
human; the part that builds up the things that keep the soul from God.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> That was a terrible vision.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I struggled and I struggled with them, and they heaped
themselves over me till I was unable to move hand or foot; and that went
on for a long, long time.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> [<i>Crossing himself.</i>] God have mercy on us.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Then suddenly there came a bright light, and all in a
minute the beasts were gone, and I saw a great many angels riding upon
unicorns, white angels on white unicorns. They stood all round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p088" id="Page_p088">[88]</a></span> me, and
they cried out, "Brother Paul, go and preach; get up and preach, Brother
Paul." And then they laughed aloud, and the unicorns trampled the ground
as though the world were already falling in pieces.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> It was only a dream. Come with me. You will forget it when you
have had food and rest.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Looking at his arm.</i>] It was there one of them
clawed me; one that looked at me with great heavy eyes.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> The Superior has been here; try and listen to me. He says you
must not preach.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Great heavy eyes and hard sharp claws.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> [<i>Putting his hands on his shoulders.</i>] You must awake from
this. You must remember where you are. You are under rules. You must not
break the rules you are under. The brothers will be coming in to hear
you, you must not speak to them. The Superior has forbidden it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p089" id="Page_p089">[89]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Touching</i> <span class="smcap">Jerome's</span> <i>hand.</i>] I have always been a great
trouble to you.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> You must go and submit to the Superior. Go and make your
submission now, for my sake. Think of what I have done for your sake.
Remember how I brought you in, and answered for you when you came here.
I did not tell about that wild business. I have done penance for that
deceit.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Yes, you have always been good to me, but do not ask
me this. I have had other orders.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Last time you preached the whole monastery was upset. The
Friars began to laugh suddenly in the middle of the night.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> If I have been given certain truths to tell, I must
tell them at once before they slip away from me.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I cannot understand your ideas; you tell them impossible
things. Things that are against the order of nature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p090" id="Page_p090">[90]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I have learned that one needs a religion so wholly
supernatural, that is so opposed to the order of nature that the world
can never capture it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Some </i>Friars<i> come in. They carry green branches in their hands.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> They are coming. Will you stay and listen?</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I must not stay. I must not listen.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Help me over to the candles. I am weak, my knees are
weak. I shall be strong when the words come. I shall be able to teach.
[<i>He lights a taper at the hanging lamp and tries to light the candles
with a shaking hand.</i> <span class="smcap">Jerome</span> <i>takes the taper from him and lights the
candles.</i>] Why are you crying, Jerome?</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> Because we that were friends are separated now. We shall never
be together again.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Never again? The love of God is a very terrible thing.</p>

<p><i>Jerome.</i> I have done with meddling. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p091" id="Page_p091">[91]</a></span> must leave you to authority now.
I must tell the Superior you will not obey. [<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p><i>First Friar.</i> Father Jerome had a very dark look going out.</p>

<p><i>Second Friar.</i> He was shut up with the Superior this morning. I wonder
what they were talking about.</p>

<p><i>First Friar.</i> I wonder if the Superior will mind our taking the
branches. They are only cut on Palm Sunday other years. What will he
tell us, I wonder? It seems as if he was going to tell us how to do some
great thing. Do you think he will teach us to do cures like the friars
used at Esker?</p>

<p><i>Second Friar.</i> Those were great cures they did there, and they were not
strange men, but just the same as ourselves. I heard of a man went to
them dying on a cart, and he walked twenty miles home to Burren holding
the horses head.</p>

<p><i>First Friar.</i> Maybe we'll be able to see visions the same as were seen
at Knock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p092" id="Page_p092">[92]</a></span> It's a great wonder all that was seen and all that was done
there.</p>

<p><i>Third Friar.</i> I was there one time, and the whole place was full of
crutches that had been thrown away by people that were cured. There was
a silver crutch there some rich man from America had sent as an offering
after getting his cure. Speak to him, Brother Colman. He seems to be in
some sort of a dream. Ask if he is going to speak to us now.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> We are all here, Brother Paul.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Have you all been through your meditations? [<i>They all
gather round him.</i></p>

<p><i>Bartley.</i> We have all tried; we have done our best; but it is hard to
keep our mind on the one thing for long.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> "He ascended into heaven." Have you meditated upon
that? Did you reject all earthly images that came into your mind till
the light began to gather?</p>

<p><i>Third Friar.</i> I could not fix my mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p093" id="Page_p093">[93]</a></span> well. When I put out one thought
others came rushing in.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> When I was meditating, the inside of my head suddenly became
all on fire.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> While I was meditating I felt a spout of fire going up
between my shoulders.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> That is the way it begins. You are ready now to hear
the truth. Now I can give you the message that has come to me. Stand
here at either side of the altar. Brother Colman, come beside me here.
Lay down your palm branches before this altar; you have brought them as
a sign that the walls are beginning to be broken up, that we are going
back to the joy of the green earth. [<i>Goes up to the candles and
speaks.</i>] Et calix meus inebrians quam praeclarus est. For a long time
after their making men and women wandered here and there, half blind
from the drunkenness of Eternity; they had not yet forgotten that the
green Earth was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p094" id="Page_p094">[94]</a></span> Love of God, and that all Life was the Will of God,
and so they wept and laughed and hated according to the impulse of their
hearts. [<i>He takes up the green boughs and presses them to his breast.</i>]
They gathered the green Earth to their breasts and their lips, as I
gather these boughs to mine, in what they believed would be an eternal
kiss. [<i>He remains a little while silent.</i></p>

<p><i>Second Friar.</i> I see a light about his head.</p>

<p><i>Third Friar.</i> I wonder if he has seen God.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> It was then that the temptation began. Not only the
Serpent who goes upon his belly, but all the animal spirits that have
loved things better than life, came out of their holes and began to
whisper. The men and women listened to them, and because when they had
lived according to the joyful Will of God in mother wit and natural
kindness, they sometimes did one another an injury, they thought that it
would be better to be safe than to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p095" id="Page_p095">[95]</a></span> be bless&egrave;d, they made the Laws. The
Laws were the first sin. They were the first mouthful of the apple, the
moment man had made them he began to die; we must put out the Laws as I
put out this candle.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He puts out the candle with an extinguisher, still holding the
boughs with his left hand. Two orthodox Friars have come in.</i></p></div>

<p><i>First Orthodox Friar.</i> You had better go for the Superior.</p>

<p><i>Second Orthodox Friar.</i> I must stop and listen.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The First Orthodox Friar listens for a minute or two and then
goes out.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> And when they had lived amidst the green Earth that is
the Love of God, they were sometimes wetted by the rain, and sometimes
cold and hungry, and sometimes alone from one another; they thought it
would be better to be comfortable than to be bless&egrave;d. They began to
build big houses and big towns. They grew wealthy and they sat
chattering at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p096" id="Page_p096">[96]</a></span> their doors; and the embrace that was to have been
eternal ended, lips and hands were parted. [<i>He lets the boughs slip out
of his arms.</i>] We must put out the towns as I put out this candle.
[<i>Puts out another candle.</i></p>

<p><i>A Friar.</i> Yes, yes, we must uproot the towns.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> But that is not all, for man created a worse thing,
yes, a worse defiance against God. [<i>The</i> Friars <i>groan</i>.] God put
holiness into everything that lives, for everything that desires is full
of His Will, and everything that is beautiful is full of His Love; but
man grew timid because it had been hard to find his way amongst so much
holiness, and though God had made all time holy, man said that only the
day on which God rested from life was holy, and though God had made all
places holy, man said, "no place but this place that I put pillars and
walls about is holy, this place where I rest from life"; and in this and
like ways he built up the Church. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p097" id="Page_p097">[97]</a></span> must destroy the Church, we must
put it out as I put out this candle. [<i>Puts out another candle.</i></p>

<p><i>Friars.</i> [<i>Clasping one another's hands.</i>] He is right, he is right.
The Church must be destroyed. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Superior</span> <i>comes in.</i></p>

<p><i>First Friar.</i> Here is the Superior.</p>

<p><i>A Friar.</i> He has been saying&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Superior.</i> Hush! I will hear him to the end.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> That is not all. These things may be accomplished and
yet nothing be accomplished. The Christian's business is not reformation
but revelation, and the only labours he can put his hand to can never be
accomplished in Time. He must so live that all things shall pass away.
[<i>He stands silent for a moment and then cries, lifting his hand above
his head.</i>] Give me wine out of thy pitchers; oh, God, how splendid is
my cup of drunkenness. We must become blind, and deaf, and dizzy. We
must get rid of everything that is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p098" id="Page_p098">[98]</a></span> measureless eternal life. We
must put out hope as I put out this candle. [<i>Puts out a candle.</i>] And
memory as I put out this candle. [<i>As before.</i>] And thought, the waster
of Life, as I put out this candle. [<i>As before.</i>] And at last we must
put out the light of the Sun and of the Moon, and all the light of the
World and the World itself. [<i>He now puts out the last candle, the
chapel is very dark. The only light is the faint light of morning coming
through the window.</i>] We must destroy the World; we must destroy
everything that has Law and Number, for where there is nothing, there is
God.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Superior</span> <i>comes forward. One of</i> <span class="smcap">Paul's</span> Friars <i>makes as if to

time. You have not yet heard the voices and seen the faces.</p>

<p><i>Superior.</i> A miracle! God is making the heretic speak against himself.
Listen to him!</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> We will not stay behind, we will go with you.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I am led by hands that are colder than ice and harder

in the hearts of all that love me, and there will be a fire in my heart
that will make it as bare as the wilderness.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Smooth level grass near the Shannon. Ecclesiastical ruins,
a part of which have been roofed in. Rocky plain in the distance,
with a river.</i> <span class="smcap">Father Colman</span> <i>sorting some bundles of osiers.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aloysius</span> <i>enters with an empty bag.</i>
</p></div>


<p><i>Colman.</i> You are the first to come back Aloysius. Where is Brother
Bartley?</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> He parted from me at the cross roads and went on to preach
at Shanaglish. He should soon be back now.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> Have you anything in the bag?</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> Nothing. [<i>Throws the bag down.</i>] It doesn't seem as if our
luck was growing. We have but food enough to last till to-morrow. We
have hardly that. The rats from the river got at the few potatoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p104" id="Page_p104">[104]</a></span> I
gathered from the farmers at Lisheen last week, in the corner where they
were.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> This is the first day you got nothing at all. Maybe you didn't
ask the right way.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> I asked for alms for the sake of the love of God. But the
first place where I asked it, the man of the house was giving me a
handful of meal, and the woman came and called out that we were serving
the devil in the name of God, and she drove me from the door.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> It is since the priests preached against us they say that. Did
you go on to Lisheen. They used always to treat us well there.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> I did, but I got on no better there.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> That is a wonder, after the woman that had the jaundice being
cured with prayers by Brother Paul.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> That's just it. If he did cure her, they say the two best of
her husband's bullocks died of the blackwater the next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p105" id="Page_p105">[105]</a></span> day, and he was
no way thankful to us after that.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> Did you try the houses along the bog road?</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> I did, and the children coming back from school called out
after me and asked who was it did away with the widow Cloran's cow.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> The widow Cloran's cow?</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> That was the cow that died after grazing in the ruins here.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> If it did, it was because of an old boot it picked up and ate,
and that never belonged to us.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> I wish we had something ourselves to eat. They should be
sitting down to their dinner in the monastery now. They will be having a
good dinner to-day to carry them over the fast to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> I am thinking sometimes, Brother Paul should give more thought
to us than he does. It is all very well for him, he is so taken up with
his thoughts and his visions he doesn't know if he is full or fasting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p106" id="Page_p106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> He has such holy thoughts and visions no one would like to
trouble him. He ought not to be in the world at all, or to do the
world's work.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> So long as he is in the world, he must give some thought to
it. There must be something wrong in the way he is doing things now. I
thought he would have had half Ireland with him by this time with his
great preaching, but someway when he preaches to the people, they don't
seem to mind him much.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> He is too far above them; they have not education to
understand him.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> They understand me well enough when I give my mind to it. But
it is harder to preach now than it was in the monastery. We had
something to offer then; absolution here, and heaven after.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> Isn't it enough for them to hear that the kingdom of heaven
is within them, and that if they do the right meditations&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p107" id="Page_p107">[107]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> What can poor people that have their own troubles on them get
from a few words like that they hear at a cross road or a market, and
the wind maybe blowing them away? If we could gather them together
now.... Look, Aloysius, at these sally rods; I have a plan in my mind
about them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He has stuck some of the rods in the ground, and begins weaving
others through them.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> Are you going to make baskets like you did in the monastery
schools?</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> We must make something if we are to live. But it is more than
that I was thinking of; we might coax some of the youngsters to come and
learn the basket making; it would make them take to us better if we
could put them in the way of earning a few pence.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> [<i>Taking up some of the osiers and beginning to twist
them.</i>] That might be a good way to come at them; they could work
through the day, and at evening we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p108" id="Page_p108">[108]</a></span> could tell them how to repeat the
words till the light comes inside their heads. But would Paul think well
of it? He is more for pulling down than building up.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> When I explain it to him I am sure he will think well of it;
he can't go on for ever without anyone to listen to him.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> I suppose not, and with no way of living. But I don't know,
I'm afraid he won't like it.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> Hush! Here he is coming.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> If one had a plan now for doing some destruction&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> Hush! don't you see there is somebody with him.<br/><br/></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge</span> <i>comes in with</i> <span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span>.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> This is Charlie Ward, my old friend.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> The Charlie Ward you lived on the roads with?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Yes, when I went looking for the favour of my hard
mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p109" id="Page_p109">[109]</a></span> Earth, he helped me. He is her good child and she loves him.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> He is welcome. How did he find you out?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I don't know. How did you find me out, Charlie?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Oh, I didn't lose sight of you so much as you thought. I
had to stop away from Gortmore a good while after we left you at the
gate, but I sent Paddy Cockfight one time to get news, and he mended
cans for the laundry of the monastery, and they told him you were well
again, and a monk as good as the rest. But a while ago I got word there
was a monk had gone near to break up the whole monastery with his talk
and his piety, and I said to myself, "That's Paul!" And then I heard
there was a monk had been driven out for not keeping the rules, and I
said to myself, "That's Paul!" And the other day when what's left of us
came to Athlone, I heard talk of some disfrocked monks that were
upsetting the whole neighbourhood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p110" id="Page_p110">[110]</a></span> and I said, "That's Paul." To Sabina
Silver I said that. "That merry chap Paul," I said.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I'm afraid you have a very bad opinion of me, Charlie.
Well, maybe I earned it.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> You cannot know much of him if you have a bad opinion of
him. He will be made a saint some day.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> He will, if there's such a thing as a saint of mischief.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> A saint of mischief? Well, why not that as well as
another? He would upset all the beehives, he would throw them into the
market-place. Sit down now, Charlie, and eat a bit with us.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> You are welcome, indeed, to all we can give you, but we have
not a bit of food that is worth offering you. Aloysius got nothing at
all in the villages to-day, Brother Paul. The people are getting cross.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Well, sit down, anyway. The country people liked me
well enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p111" id="Page_p111">[111]</a></span> once, there was no man they liked so much as myself when I
gave them drink for nothing. Didn't they, Charlie?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Oh, that was a great time. They were lying thick about
the roads. I'll be thinking of it to my dying day.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I have given them another kind of drink now.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> What sort of a drink is that?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> We have rolled a great barrel out of a cellar that is
under the earth. We have rolled it right into the midst of them. [<i>He
moves his hand about as if he were moving a barrel.</i>] It's heavy, and
when they have drunk what is in it, I would like to see the man that
would be their master.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> That would be a great drink, but I wouldn't be sure that
you're in earnest.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Colman and Aloysius will tell you all about it. It was
made in a good still, the barley was grown in a field that's down under
the earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p112" id="Page_p112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> That's likely enough. I often heard of places like that.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> And when they have drunk from my barrel, they will
break open the door, they will put law and number under their two feet;
and they will have a hot palm and a cold palm, for they will put down
the moon and the sun with their two hands.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> There's no mistake but you're the same Paul still; nice
and plain and simple, only for your hard talk. And what about the
rheumatism? It's hardly you got through that fit you had, and you don't
look as if much hardship would agree with you now.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> He does not, indeed, and if he doesn't kill himself one way
he will another. Wait now till I tell you the way he is living. I don't
think he tasted bit or sup to-day, and all he had last night was a
couple of dry potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Is that so? [<i>Takes</i> <span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge's</span> <i>arm.</i>] You haven't
much more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p113" id="Page_p113">[113]</a></span> flesh on you than a crane in moonlight. They don't seem to
have much notion of minding you here, you that were reared soft. It
would be better for you to come back to us; bad as our lodging is,
there'd be a bit in the pot for you and Sabina to care you. It's she
would give you a good welcome.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> [<i>Starting up.</i>] We can mind him well enough here. I have a
plan. We haven't been getting on the way we ought with the people. It's
no way to be getting on with people to be asking things of them always,
they have no opinion at all of us seeing us the way we are. They have no
notion of the respect they should show to Brother Paul, and the way all
the Brothers used to be listening to his preaching, and the townspeople
as well. And I, myself, the time I preached in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> Yes, indeed, Paul, think of the great crowds used to come
when you preached in the Abbey church, and all the money that was
gathered that time of the Mission.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p114" id="Page_p114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Yes, I used to like once to see all the faces looking
up at me. But now all that is gone from me. Now I think it is enough to
be a witness for the truth, and to think the thoughts I like. God will
bring the people to me. He will make of my silence a great wind that
will shatter the ships of the world.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> That is all very well, but the people are not coming.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> And more than that, they are driving us away from their
doors now, Paul.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> The way they do to us. But Paul was not born on the
roads. [<i>Lights his pipe.</i></p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> It's no use stopping waiting for a wind; if we have anything
to say that's worth the people listening to, we must bring them to hear
it one way or another. Now, it is what I was saying to Aloysius, we must
begin teaching them to make things, they never had the chance of any
instruction of the sort here.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p115" id="Page_p115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> To make things? This sort of things? [<i>Takes the
half-made basket from</i> <span class="smcap">Colman</span>.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> Those and other things, we got a good training in the old
days. And we'll get a grant from the Technical Board. The Board pays up
to four hundred pounds to some of its instructors.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> And then?</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> Oh, then we'll sell all the things we make. I'm sure we'll
get a market for them.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh, I understand; you will sell them. And what about
the dividing of the money? You will need to make laws about that.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> Of course; we will have to make rules, and to pay according to
work.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh, we will grow quite rich in time. What are we to do
then? we can't go on living in this ruin?</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> Of course not. We'll build workshops and houses for those who
come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p116" id="Page_p116">[116]</a></span> to work from a distance, good houses, slated, not thatched.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Aloysius</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Charlie Ward</span>.] Yes, you see
his plan. To gather the people together, to build houses for them; to
make them rich too, and to keep their money safe. And the Kingdom of God
too? What about that?</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> Oh, I'm just coming to that. They will think so much more of
our teaching when we have got them under our influence by other things.
Of course we will teach them their meditations, and give them a regular
religious life. We must settle out some little place for them to pray
in&mdash;there's a high gable over there where we could hang a bell&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh yes, I understand. You would weave them together
like this [<i>weaves the osiers in and out</i>], you would add one thing to
another, laws and money and church and bells, till you had got
everything back again that you have escaped from. But it is my business
to tear things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p117" id="Page_p117">[117]</a></span> asunder like this [<i>tears pieces from the basket</i>], and
this, and this&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> I told him you'd never agree to it. He ought to have known
that himself.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> We must have something to offer the people.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> You say that because you got nothing to-day. Aloysius
has got nothing in his sack. [<i>Taking sack and turning it upside down.</i>]
It is quite empty. Every religious teacher before me has offered
something to his followers, but I offer them nothing. [<i>Plunging his arm
down into the sack.</i>] My sack is quite empty. I will never dip my hand
into nature's full sack of illusions; I am tired of that old conjuring
bag. [<i>He walks up and down muttering.</i></p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Colman</span>.] You may as well give up trying to settle
him down to anything. He was a tinker once, and he'll be a tinker
always; he has got the wandering into his blood. Will you come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p118" id="Page_p118">[118]</a></span> back to
the roads, Paul, to your old friends and to Sabina?</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Sitting down beside him.</i>] Ah, my old friends, they
were very kind to me; but these friends too are very kind to me.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Well, come and see them anyway; they'll be glad to see
you, those that are left of us.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Those that are left of you? Where are the others?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Some are dead, and some are jailed, and some are on the
roads here and there. Sabina is with us always, and Johneen is a great
hand with the tools now, but Tommy the Song&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Oh, Tommy the Song, does he pray still? He was
beginning to pray. Did he ever get an answer?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> Well, I don't know about an answer, but I believe he
heard something one night beside an old thorn tree, some sort of a voice
it was.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> A voice? What did it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p119" id="Page_p119">[119]</a></span> say to him? Did he see anything?
We have learned too much, our minds are like troubled water&mdash;we get
nothing but broken images. He who knew nothing may have seen all. Is he
praying still?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> If he is, it's in Galway gaol he's praying, with or
without a thorn tree.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Did he tell no one what the voice said to him?</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> He did not, unless he might have told Johneen or some
other one.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I will go with you and see them. [<i>Gets up.</i></p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Aloysius</span>, <i>with whom he has been whispering</i>.] Take care,
but if he goes back to his old friends, he'll stop with them and leave
us.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> [<i>Putting his hand on</i> <span class="smcap">Paul Ruttledge's</span> <i>arm.</i>] Don't go,
Brother Paul, till I talk to you awhile.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Do you want me? Well, Charlie, I will stay here, I
won't go;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p120" id="Page_p120">[120]</a></span> but bring all the rest to see me, I want to ask them about
that vision.</p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> I'll bring one of them, anyway. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> Brother Paul, it is what I am thinking; now the tinkers have
come back to you, you could begin to gather a sort of an army; you can't
fight your battle without an army. They could call to the other tinkers,
and the tramps and the beggars, and the sieve-makers and all the
wandering people. It would be a great army.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Yes, that would be a great army, a great wandering
army.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> The people would be afraid to refuse us then; we would march
on&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Yes, we could march on. We could march on the towns,
and we could break up all settled order; we could bring back the old
joyful, dangerous, individual life. We would have banners, we would each
have a banner, banners with angels upon them&mdash;we will march upon the
world with banners&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p121" id="Page_p121">[121]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> We would not be in want of food then, we could take all we
wanted.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> We could take all we wanted, we would be too many to put in
gaol; all the people would join us in the end; you would be able to
persuade them all, Brother Paul, you would be their leader; we would
make great stores of food&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> We will have one great banner that will go in front,
it will take two men to carry it, and on it we will have Laughter, with
his iron claws and his wings of brass and his eyes like sapphires&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> That will be the banner for the front, we will have
different troops, we will have captains to organize them, to give them
orders&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Standing up.</i>] To organize? That is to bring in law
and number? Organize&mdash;organize&mdash;that is how all the mischief has been
done. I was forgetting, we cannot destroy the world with armies, it is
inside our minds that it must be destroyed, it must be consumed in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p122" id="Page_p122">[122]</a></span>
moment inside our minds. God will accomplish his last judgment, first in
one man's mind and then in another. He is always planning last
judgments. And yet it takes a long time, and that is why he laments in
the wind and in the reeds and in the cries of the curlews.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> I think we had better go down to the river and see are there
any eels on the lines we set. We must find something for supper. It is
near sunset; see how the crows are flying home.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> [<i>Looking up.</i>] The crows are my darlings! I like
their harsh merriment better than those sad cries of the wind and the
rushes. Look at them, they are tossing about like witches, tossing about
on the wind, drunk with the wind.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> Well, I'll go look at the lines, anyhow. Put turf on the fire,
Aloysius; Bartley should soon be home from Shanaglish.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> I wonder why he isn't home by this. I'm uneasy till I see
him, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p123" id="Page_p123">[123]</a></span> the way the people treated me to-day. [<i>Shades his eyes to
look out.</i>] Here he is! He's running!</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> [<i>Coming over to him.</i>] He is running hard! He must be in some
danger&mdash;&mdash;<br/><br/></p>

<hr />

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bartley</span> <i>out of breath.</i></p>

<p><i>Bartley.</i> Run, run, come away, there's not a minute to lose.</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> What is the matter? what has happened?</p>

<p><i>Bartley.</i> The people are coming up the road! They attacked me in the
market! They followed me, they are on the road. I slipped away across
the fields. Run, run!</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> What is it? What are they going to do to us?</p>

<p><i>Bartley.</i> You would know that if you saw them! They have stones and
sticks. Raging they are, and calling for our lives. They say we brought
witchcraft and ill-luck on the place! Come to the boat, it's in the
rushes; they won't see us, we'll get to the island. Hurry, hurry! [<i>He
runs out.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p124" id="Page_p124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> Come, Brother Paul, hurry, hurry!</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I am going to stay.</p>

<p><i>Bartley.</i> They will kill us if we stay! Brother Colman said they have
stones and sticks; I think I hear them!</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> You are afraid because you have been shut up so long.
I am not afraid because I have lived upon the roads, where one is ready
for anything that may happen. One has to learn that, like any other
thing. I will stay.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> He wants the crown!</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Where is Bartley?</p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> He is gone. Come, you must go too, we can't leave you here.
You have too much to do to throw your life away, we have all too much to
do.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> No, no. There is nothing to do; I am going to stay.</p>

<p><i>Aloysius.</i> I will stay with you. [<i>Takes his hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Death is the last adventure, the first perfect joy,
for at death the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p125" id="Page_p125">[125]</a></span> soul comes into possession of itself, and returns to
the joy that made it. [<i>A great shout outside.</i></p>

<p><i>Colman.</i> [<i>Seizing</i> <span class="smcap">Aloysius</span>.] Come, come, Aloysius! come, Paul! We
haven't a moment, here they are. [<i>Drags</i> <span class="smcap">Aloysius</span> <i>away.</i></p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Good-bye, Aloysius, good-bye, Colman. Keep a pick
going at the foundations of the world.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Colman</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Aloysius</span> <i>run on.</i></p></div>

<p><i>One of the Mob outside.</i> They are here in the ruins!</p>

<p><i>Another Voice.</i> This way! This way!</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> I will not go. I have a little reason for staying, but
no reason is too little to be the foundation of martyrdom. People have
been martyred for all kinds of reasons, and my reason that is not worth
a rush will do as well as any other. [<i>Looks round.</i>] Ah! they are gone.
A little reason, a little reason. I have entered into the second
freedom&mdash;the irresponsibility of the saints.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p126" id="Page_p126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> They have done for him. I thought they would.</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> Oh, Paul, I never thought to find you like this! He's

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> [<i>Opens his shirt and puts in his hand on his heart.</i>]
Paul!</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> Ah! Charlie, give me the soldering iron&mdash;no, bring me

<p><i>Charlie Ward.</i> He thinks he's back on the roads with us! He is done
for.</p>

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> I knew he'd have to come back to me to die after all;
it's a lonesome thing to die among strangers.</p>

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> That is right, that is right, take me up in your
brazen claws. But no&mdash;no&mdash;I will not go out beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p129" id="Page_p129">[129]</a></span> Saturn into the

<p><i>Paul Ruttledge.</i> O plunge me into the wine barrel, into the wine barrel

<p><i>Sabina Silver.</i> Won't you speak to me, Paul? Don't you know me? I am

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
