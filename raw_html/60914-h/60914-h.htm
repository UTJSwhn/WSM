<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> work of art is the exaggeration of an
idea, says Gide in the epilogue of the
&#8220;Prometheus Illbound.&#8221; This is really the
explanation of the whole book and of many
other books of Gide.</p>

<p>His world is a world of abstract ideas,
under the action of which most of his
characters move as marionettes. &#8220;Time
and space are the boards, which, with the
help of our minds, have been set up by the
innumerable truths of the universe as a stage
for their own performances. And there we
play our parts like determined, convinced,
devoted and voluptuous marionettes.&#8221;</p>

<p>That is the reason why there is a determinist
atmosphere in his books and that even
the disinterested act appears as the reaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of the mind on its own concept. Zeus, the
banker, poses this disinterested act because
his thought refuses or hesitates to admit
it; the same thing happens with Lafcadio in
the &#8220;Caves du Vatican&#8221; when he is on the
point of murdering Amédée Fleurissoire.</p>

<p>The tyranny of ideas is the dominating
force of his characters. Even his first
writings&mdash;where one finds some of his best
pages, which appear to be purely lyrical
explosion&mdash;such as &#8220;Les Nourritures Terrestres&#8221;
and &#8220;Le Voyage d&#8217;Urien,&#8221; are
really the songs of a mind which leads its life
by the <i>concept</i> of eternal desire and detachment&mdash;a
mind very near that of Nietzsche.</p>

<p>It is because of that tyranny of ideas that
Gide is attracted by religious psychology.
After all, Alissa of &#8220;La Porte Étroite&#8221;
sacrifices her life and her happiness to her
ideas. It is because of that also that one of
the most daring books of the time, &#8220;L&#8217;Immoraliste,&#8221;
is written in the most moral way:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the feelings are only described by their
reaction on the brain. And this applies to
nearly the whole work of Gide.</p>

<p>Even his concept of heroism is ruled by it.
His heroes are monomaniacs of a thought
which they believe or create ideal. His
&#8220;Roi Candaule&#8221; is a man stupefied by
the <i>idea</i> of his possessions.</p>

<p>That which does not nourish his brain is
a reason for depression, and as love or
passion absorbs the brain without nourishing
it, he resents it. Every attempt of a purely
amorous adventure is a failure, as well in
&#8220;L&#8217;Immoraliste&#8221; as in the &#8220;Tentative
Amoureuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the contrary, when it becomes by
struggle a problem for the brain it excites
him. Alissa was really his only love, and he
could not love Isabelle when she had lost her
power of attraction through the revelation of
the unknown she represented to his mind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>The exaltation of Gide is a Nietzschean
exaltation&mdash;it is an exaltation caused by the
power of mind.</p>

<p>The definition of genius he gives in
&#8220;Prétextes&#8221; is very characteristic from
that point of view. He calls it: &#8220;Le
sentiment de la ressource.&#8221;</p>

<p>His sensitiveness is the sensitiveness of the
brain, which is so acute that it vibrates
through his whole personality. From there
comes the clear, logical form of his tales.</p>

<p>The book, &#8220;Prometheus Illbound,&#8221; which
we present to the English public to-day is
one of the most characteristic books of Gide:
a work of pure intellectual fantasy, where
the subtle brain of the author has full play.
It is the expression of the humorous side of
a mind which must be ranked among the
greatest of the world&#8217;s literature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the month of May 189..., at two o&#8217;clock
in the afternoon, this occurred which might
appear strange:</p>

<p>On the boulevard leading from the Madeleine
to the Opéra, a stout gentleman of
middle age, with nothing remarkable about
him but uncommon corpulence, was approached
by a thin gentleman, who smilingly,
thinking no harm, we believe, gave him back
a handkerchief that he had just dropped.
The corpulent gentleman thanked him
briefly and was going his way when he
suddenly leant towards the thin man and
must have asked for information, which must
have been given, for he produced from his
pocket a portable inkpot and pens, which
without more ado he handed to the thin
gentleman, and also an envelope which up
to this minute he had been holding in his
hand. And those who passed could see the
thin man writing an address upon it.&mdash;But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
here begins the strange part of the story,
which no newspaper, however, reported:
the thin gentleman, after having given back
the pen and the envelope, had not even the
time to smile adieu when the fat gentleman,
in form of thanks, abruptly struck
him on the face, then jumped in a cab
and disappeared, before any of the spectators,
stupefied with surprise (I was there),
thought of stopping him.</p>

<p>I have been told since that it was Zeus,
the banker.</p>

<p>The thin gentleman, visibly upset by the
attentions of the crowd, insisted that he had
hardly felt the blow, notwithstanding that
the blood poured out of his nose and his
cut-open lip. He begged them to be kind
enough to leave him alone, and the crowd,
on his insistence, slowly dispersed. Thus
the reader will allow us to leave at present
some one he will hear of sufficiently later
on.</p>

<h3>I</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">I will</span> not speak of public morals, for
there are none, but this reminds me of an
anecdote:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When, on the heights of the Caucasus,
Prometheus found that chains, clamps,
strait-waistcoats, parapets, and other scruples,
had on the whole a numbing effect on
him, for a change he turned to the left,
stretched his right arm and, between the
fourth and fifth hours of an autumn afternoon,
walked down the boulevard which
leads from the Madeleine to the Opéra.
Different Parisian celebrities passed continually
before his eyes. Where are they
going? Prometheus asked himself, and
settling himself in a café with a book he
asked: &#8220;Waiter, where are they going?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE HISTORY OF THE WAITER AND THE
MIGLIONAIRE</h4>

<p>&mdash;If his lordship could see them coming
and going every day as I do, said the waiter,
he would also ask where do they come from?
It must be the same place, as they pass every
day. I say to myself: Since they always
return they cannot have found what they
want. I now wait for his lordship to ask
me: What are they looking for? and his
lordship will see what I shall reply.</p>

<p>Then Prometheus asked: What are they
looking for?</p>

<p>The waiter replied: Since they do not
remain where they go, it cannot be happiness.
His lordship may believe me or
not, and, coming nearer, he said in a low
voice: They are looking for their personalities;&mdash;His
lordship does not live
here?...</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&mdash;No, said Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;One can easily see that, said the waiter;
Yes: personality; we call it here idiosyncrasy:
Like me (for example), from what
you see, you think I am just a waiter in a
restaurant! Well! your lordship, no! It
is by choice; you may believe me or not:
I have an inner life: I observe. Personalities
are the only interesting things; and
then the relations between personalities.
It is very well arranged in this restaurant;
tables for three; I will explain the management
later on. You will dine soon, will you
not? We will introduce you....</p>

<p>Prometheus was a little tired. The waiter
continued: Yes, tables for three, that is
what I found the easiest: three gentlemen
arrive; they are introduced; they are introduced
(if they wish it, of course), for in my
restaurant before dining you must give your
name; then say what you do; so much
the worse if you deceive each other. Then
you sit down (not I); you talk (not I, of
course)&mdash;but I put you in sympathy; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
listen; I scrutinize; I direct the conversation.
At the end of dinner I know three
inner men, three personalities! They, no.
I, you understand, I listen, I bring into
relation; they submit to the relationship....
You will ask me: What do you gain by
this? Oh, nothing at all! It pleases me to
create relationships.... Oh! not for me!...
It is what one could call an absolutely
gratuitous act.</p>

<p>Prometheus appeared a little tired. The
waiter continued: A gratuitous act! Does
this convey nothing to you?&mdash;To me it
seems extraordinary. I thought for a long
time that this was the one thing that distinguished
man from the animals&mdash;a gratuitous
act. I called man an animal capable of a
gratuitous act;&mdash;and then afterwards I
thought the contrary; that man is the only
being incapable of acting gratuitously;&mdash;gratuitously!
just think; without reason&mdash;yes,
I hear&mdash;shall we say without motive;
incapable! then this idea began to fidget me.
I said to myself: why does he do this? why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
does he do that? ... and yet I am not a
determinist ... but that reminds me of an
anecdote:</p>

<p>&mdash;I have a friend, my lord, you will
hardly believe me, who he is a miglionaire.
He is also intelligent. He said to himself:
A gratuitous act? how to do it? And
understand this does not only mean an act
that brings no return.... No, but gratuitous:
an act that has no motive. Do
you understand? no interest, no passion,
nothing. The act disinterested; born of
itself; the act without aim, thus without
master; the free act; the act Autochthon!</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey? said Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;Listen well, said the waiter. My friend
went out one morning, taking with him a
bank-note of £20 in an envelope and a blow
prepared in his hand.</p>

<p>The point was to find somebody without
choosing him. So he drops his handkerchief
in the street, and, to the man who picks it
up (evidently kindly since he picked it up),
the miglionaire:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>&mdash;Pardon, sir, do you not know some
one?</p>

<p>The other:&mdash;Yes, several.</p>

<p>The miglionaire: Then, sir, will you have
the kindness to write his name on this envelope;
here is a table, pens, and a pencil....</p>

<p>The other, good-naturedly, writes, then:&mdash;Now,
sir, will you explain yourself...?</p>

<p>The miglionaire replies: It is on principle;
then (I forgot to tell you he is very strong)
he strikes him with the blow he had in his
hand; then calls a cab and disappears.</p>

<p>Do you understand?&mdash;two gratuitous acts
in one go! The bank-note of £20 sent to
an address which he had not selected, and
the blow given to a person who selected
himself to pick up the handkerchief. No!
but is it gratuitous enough? And the relation?
I bet you have not seriously scrutinized
the relationship; for, as the act is
gratuitous, it is what we call here reversible:
One receives £20 for a blow, and the other
a blow for £20 ... then.... No one knows
... one is lost&mdash;think of it! A gratuitous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
act! There is nothing more demoralizing.&mdash;But
my lord is beginning to be hungry;
I beg his lordship&#8217;s pardon; I forget myself,
I talk too much.... Will his lordship
kindly give me his name,&mdash;so that I can
introduce him....</p>

<p>&mdash;Prometheus, said Prometheus simply.</p>

<p>&mdash;Prometheus! I was right, his lordship
is a stranger here ... and his lordship&#8217;s
occupation is...?</p>

<p>&mdash;I do nothing, said Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh! no. No, said the waiter with an
ingratiating smile.&mdash;Only to see his lordship,
one knows at once that he is a man
with an occupation.</p>

<p>&mdash;It is so long ago, stammered Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;Never mind, never mind, continued the
waiter. Anyway, his lordship need not be uneasy;
in introducing I only say the name,
if you like; but the occupation never. Come,
tell me: his lordship&#8217;s occupation is...?</p>

<p>&mdash;Making matches, murmured Prometheus,
blushing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>There followed a painful silence, the
waiter understanding that he should not
have insisted, Prometheus feeling that he
should not have answered.</p>

<p>In a consoling tone: Well! after all his
lordship does not make them any more ...
said the waiter. But then, what? I must
write down something, I cannot write
simply: Prometheus. His lordship has perhaps
an avocation, a speciality.... After
all, what can his lordship do?</p>

<p>&mdash;Nothing, again said Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;Then let us say: Journalist.&mdash;Now, if
his lordship will come into the restaurant;
I cannot serve dinner outside. And he
cried:&mdash;A table for three! one!...</p>

<p>By two doors two gentlemen entered;
they could be seen giving their names to
the waiter; but the introductions not having
been asked for, without more ado the two
men both sat down.</p>

<p>And when they had sat down:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>&mdash;Gentlemen, said one of them,&mdash;if I
have come to this restaurant, where the
food is bad, it is only to talk. I have a
horror of solitary meals, and this system
of tables for three pleases me, as with
two one might wrangle.... But you look
taciturn?</p>

<p>&mdash;It is quite unintentional, said Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;Shall I continue?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, please do.</p>

<p>&mdash;It seems to me quite possible that
during lunch three people have time to
become very well known to each other,&mdash;not
losing too much time eating,&mdash;not talking too
much; and avoiding trite topics; I mean to
say mentioning only strictly individual experiences.
I do not pretend that one is
obliged to talk, but why come to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
restaurant, where the food is bad, if conversation
does not suit you?</p>

<p>Prometheus was very tired: the waiter
leant over and whispered: That is Cocles.
The one who is going to speak is Damocles.</p>

<p>Damocles said:</p>


<h4>THE HISTORY OF DAMOCLES</h4>

<p>Sir, if you had said that to me a month
ago, I should have had nothing to say; but
after what happened to me last month, all
my ideas have changed. I will not speak of
my old thoughts except to make you understand
in what way I have changed.&mdash;Now,
gentlemen, since thirty days I feel that I
am an original, unique being, with a very
singular destiny.&mdash;So, gentlemen, you can
deduct that before I felt the contrary, I
lived a perfectly ordinary life and made it
my business to be as commonplace as
possible. Now, however, I must admit that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a commonplace man does not exist, and I
affirm that it is a vain ambition to try to
resemble everybody, for everybody is composed
of each one, and each one does not
resemble anybody. But never mind, I took
the greatest pains to put things right; I
drew up statistics; I calculated the happy
medium&mdash;without understanding that extremes
meet, that he who goes to bed very
late comes across him who gets up very
early, and that he who chooses the happy
medium risks to fall between two stools.&mdash;Every
night I went to bed at ten. I slept
eight hours and a half. I was most careful
in all my actions to copy the majority, and
in all my thoughts the most approved
opinions. Useless to insist.</p>

<p>But one day a personal adventure happened
to me, the importance of which in
the life of a well-ordered man as I was can
only be understood later on. It is a precedent;
it is terrible. And I received it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Just imagine, one morning I received a
letter. Gentlemen, I see by your lack of
astonishment that I am telling my story very
badly. I should have told you first that I
did not expect any letters. I receive exactly
two a year: one from my landlord to ask
for the rent, and one from my bankers to
inform me that I can pay it; but on the
first of January I received a third letter....
I cannot tell you where from. The address
was in an unknown hand. The complete
lack of character shown in the writing,
which was revealed to me by graphologists,
whom I consulted, gave me no clue. The
only indication the writing gave was one of
great kindness; and here again certain of
them inferred weakness. They could make
nothing of it. The writing ... I speak,
you understand, of the writing on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
envelope; for in the envelope there was
none; none&mdash;not a word, not a line. In
the envelope there was nothing but a bank-note
of £20.</p>

<p>I was just going to drink my chocolate;
but I was so astonished that I let it get cold.
I searched my mind ... nobody owes me
money. I have a fixed revenue, gentlemen,
and with little economies each year, notwithstanding
the continual fall in the value
of stock, I manage to live within my income.
I expected nothing, as I have said. I have
never asked for anything. My usual regular
life prevents me from even wishing for anything.
I gave much thought to the question
after the best methods: <i>Cur, unde, quo,
qua?</i>&mdash;From where, for where, by where,
why? And this note was not an answer, for
this was the first time in my life I questioned
anything. I thought: it must be a mistake;
perhaps I can repair it. This sum was
intended no doubt for some one of the same
name. So I looked in the Post Office
Directory for a homonym, who was perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
expecting the letter. But my name cannot
be common, as in looking through that
enormous book I was the only one of that
name indicated.</p>

<p>I hoped to come to a better result by the
writing on the envelope, and find out who
sent the letter, if not to whom it was sent.
It was then that I consulted the graphologists.
But nothing&mdash;no nothing&mdash;they
could tell me nothing; which only increased
my distress. These £20 troubled me more
and more every day; I would like to get
rid of them, but I do not know what to do.
For anyhow ... or if some one had given
them to me, at least they deserve to be
thanked. I should like to show my gratitude,&mdash;but
to whom?</p>

<p>Always in the hope of something turning
up, I carry the note with me. It does
not leave me day or night. I am at its
disposal. Before, I was banal but free.
Now I belong to that note. This adventure
has decided me; I was nothing, now I am
somebody. Since this adventure I am restless;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
I search for people to talk to, and if
I come here for my meals it is because of
this system of tables for three; among the
people I meet here I hope one day to find
the one who will know the writing on the
envelope, here it is....</p>

<p>With these words Damocles drew from
his breast a sigh and from his frock-coat
a dirty yellow envelope. His full name
was written there in a very ordinary handwriting.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened: Cocles,
who up to that time had been silent,
kept silent,&mdash;but suddenly raised his
hand and made a violent effort to strike
Damocles, the waiter catching his hand just
in time. Cocles recovered himself and sadly
made this speech, which can be only understood
later on: After all, it is better so,
for if I had succeeded in returning you
the blow you would have believed it your
duty to give me back the note and ... it
does not belong to me.&mdash;Then, seeing that
Damocles was waiting for a further explanation:&mdash;It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was I, he added, pointing to
the envelope, who wrote your address.</p>

<p>&mdash;But how did you know my name, cried
Damocles, rather annoyed by the incident.</p>

<p>&mdash;By chance&mdash;quietly said Cocles;&mdash;in
any case that is of little importance in this
story. My story is even more curious than
yours; let me tell you in a few words:</p>


<h4>THE HISTORY OF COCLES</h4>

<p>I have very few friends in the world; and
before this happened I did not know of
one. I do not know who was my father
and I never knew my mother; for a long
time I wondered why I lived.</p>

<p>I went out into the streets, searching for
a determining influence from outside. I
thought, the first thing that happens to me
will decide my destiny; for I did not
make myself as I am, too naturally kind
for that. The first act, I knew, would give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a motive to my life. Naturally kind, as I
have said, my first act was to pick up a
handkerchief. The one who dropped it had
only gone three steps. Running after him
I returned it to him. He took it without
appearing surprised; no&mdash;the surprise was
mine when he handed me an envelope&mdash;the
same one that you see here.&mdash;Will you
have the kindness, he said smilingly, to
write here an address.&mdash;What address? I
asked.&mdash;That, he replied, of any one you
know.&mdash;So saying he placed near me all
the materials to write with. Wishing to let
myself go to exterior influence I submitted.
But, as I told you, I have few friends in the
world. I wrote the first name that came
into my head at the moment, a name
quite unknown to me. Having written the
name I bowed&mdash;would have walked on&mdash;when
I received a tremendous blow on my
face.</p>

<p>In my astonishment I lost sight of my
adversary. When I came to myself, I was
surrounded by a crowd. All spoke at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
They would not let me alone. I could only
rid myself of their attentions by assuring
them that I was not hurt at all, even though
my jaw caused me terrible pain and my
nose was bleeding furiously.</p>

<p>The tumefaction of my face confined me
to my room for a week. I passed my time
thinking:</p>

<p>Why did he strike me?</p>

<p>It must have been a mistake. What could
he have against me? I have never hurt
anybody; nobody could wish me ill.&mdash;There
must be a reason for ill-will.</p>

<p>And if it was not a mistake?&mdash;for the
first time I was thinking. If that blow was
intended for me! In any case, what does it
matter! by mistake or not, I received it
and ... shall I return it? I have told you,
I am naturally good-hearted. And then there
is another thing which worries me: the man
who struck me was much stronger than I.</p>

<p>When my face was well and I could again
go out, I looked everywhere for my adversary;
yes, but it was to avoid him. Anyway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
I never saw him again, and if I avoided
him it was without knowing it.</p>

<p>But&mdash;and in saying this he leant towards
Prometheus, you see to-day how everything
joins up, it is becoming more complicated
instead of less so: I understand that, thanks
to my blow, this gentleman has received £20.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ah, but allow me! said Damocles.</p>

<p>&mdash;I am Cocles, sir, said he, bowing to
Damocles;&mdash;Cocles! and I tell you my
name, Damocles, for you must certainly be
pleased to know to whom you owe your
windfall....</p>

<p>&mdash;But....</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes&mdash;I know: we will not say to
whom; we will say: from the suffering of
whom.... For understand and do not
forget that your gain came from my
misfortune....</p>

<p>&mdash;But....</p>

<p>&mdash;Do not cavil, I beg you. Between
your gain and my trouble there is a relation;
I do not quite know which, but there is a
relation....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>&mdash;But, sir....</p>

<p>&mdash;Do not call me sir.</p>

<p>&mdash;But, my dear Cocles.</p>

<p>&mdash;Say simply Cocles.</p>

<p>&mdash;But once again, my best Cocles....</p>

<p>&mdash;No, sir,&mdash;no, Damocles,&mdash;and it is
no use your talking, for I still wear the mark
of the blow on my cheek ... it is a wound
that I will show you at once.</p>

<p>The conversation becoming disagreeably
personal, the waiter at this moment showed
his tact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>By a clever movement,&mdash;simply upsetting
a full plate over Prometheus,&mdash;he
suddenly diverted the attention of the
other two. Prometheus could not restrain
an exclamation, and his voice after the
others seemed so profound that one realized
that up to this minute he had not
spoken.</p>

<p>The irritation of Damocles and Cocles
joined forces.</p>

<p>&mdash;But you say nothing&mdash;they cried.</p>


<h4>PROMETHEUS SPEAKS</h4>

<p>&mdash;Oh, gentlemen, anything that I can say
has so little importance.... I do not
really see how ... and then the more I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
think.... No, truly I have nothing to say.
You have each of you a history; I have
none. Excuse me. Believe me it is with
the greatest interest that I have heard you
each relate an adventure which I wish ... I
could.... But I cannot even express myself
easily. No, truly you must excuse
me, gentlemen. I have been in Paris less
than two hours; nothing has as yet happened
to me, except my delightful meeting
with you, which gives me such a good idea
of what a conversation can be between two
Parisians, when they are both men of
talent....</p>

<p>&mdash;But before you came here, said
Cocles.</p>

<p>&mdash;You must have been somewhere, added
Damocles.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, I admit it, said Prometheus....
But again, once more, it has absolutely no
connexion....</p>

<p>&mdash;Never mind, said Cocles, we came here
to talk. We have both of us, Damocles and
I, already given our share; you alone bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
nothing; you listen; it is not fair. It is
time to speak Mr....?</p>

<p>The waiter, feeling instinctively that the
moment had come for the introduction,
quietly slipped in the name to complete the
sentence:</p>

<p>&mdash;Prometheus&mdash;he said simply.</p>

<p>&mdash;Prometheus, repeated Damocles.&mdash;Excuse
me, sir, but it seems to me that that
name already....</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh! interrupted Prometheus quickly,
that is not of the slightest importance.</p>

<p>&mdash;But if there is nothing of importance,
impatiently cried the other two, why have
you come here, dear Mr.... Mr....?</p>

<p>&mdash;Prometheus, replied Prometheus simply.</p>

<p>&mdash;Dear Mr. Prometheus&mdash;as I remarked
a while ago, continued Cocles, this restaurant
invites conversation, and nothing will convince
me that your strange name is the only
thing that distinguishes you; if you have
done nothing, you are surely going to do
something. What are you capable of doing?
What is the most distinguishing thing about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
you? What have you that nobody else
possesses? Why do you call yourself Prometheus?</p>

<p>Drowned beneath this flow of questions
Prometheus bent his head and slowly and in
a serious voice stammered...:</p>

<p>&mdash;What have I, gentlemen?&mdash;What have
I?&mdash;Oh, I have an eagle.</p>

<p>&mdash;A what?</p>

<p>&mdash;Eagle&mdash;Vulture perhaps&mdash;opinions
differ.</p>

<p>&mdash;An eagle! That&#8217;s funny!&mdash;an eagle
... where is he?</p>

<p>&mdash;You insist on seeing it, said Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, they cried, if it is not too indiscreet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then Prometheus, quite forgetting where
he was, suddenly started up and gave a
great cry, a call to his eagle. And this
stupefying thing happened:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>


<h4>HISTORY OF THE EAGLE</h4>

<p>A bird which from afar looked enormous,
but which seen close to was not so very big
after all, darkened for a moment the sky
above the boulevard and sped like a whirlwind
towards the café; bursting through
the window, it put out Cocles&#8217; eye with one
stroke of its wing and then, chirruping as it
did so, tenderly indeed but imperiously, fell
with a swoop upon Prometheus&#8217; right side.</p>

<p>And Prometheus forthwith undid his
waistcoat and offered his liver to the bird.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>There was a great disturbance. Voices
now mingled confusedly, for some other
people had come into the restaurant.</p>

<p>&mdash;But for goodness&#8217; sake, take care! cried
Cocles.</p>

<p>His remark was unheard beneath the loud
cries of:</p>

<p>&mdash;That! an eagle! I don&#8217;t think!!
Look at that poor gaunt bird! That ... an
eagle!&mdash;Not much!! at the most, a conscience.</p>

<p>The fact is that the great eagle was pitiful
to see&mdash;thin and mangy, and with drooping
wings as it greedily devoured its miserable
pittance, the poor bird seemed as if it had
not eaten for three days.</p>

<p>Others, nevertheless, made a fuss and
whispered insinuatingly to Prometheus:
But, sir, I hope you do not think that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
eagle distinguishes you in any way. An
eagle, shall I tell you?&mdash;an eagle, we all
have one.</p>

<p>&mdash;But ... said another.</p>

<p>&mdash;But we do not bring them to Paris,
continued another.&mdash;In Paris it is not the
fashion. Eagles are a nuisance. You see
what it has already done. If it amuses you
to let it eat your liver you are at liberty to
do so; but I must tell you that it is a
painful sight. When you do it you should
hide yourself.</p>

<p>Prometheus, confused, murmured: Excuse
me, gentlemen,&mdash;Oh! I am really
sorry. What can I do?</p>

<p>&mdash;You ought to get rid of it before you
come in, sir.</p>

<p>And some said: Smother it.</p>

<p>And others: Sell it. The newspaper
offices are there for nothing else, sir.</p>

<p>And in the tumult which followed no one
noticed Damocles, who suddenly asked the
waiter for the bill.</p>

<p>The waiter gave him the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td><i>3 lunches (with conversation) &nbsp; &nbsp; </i></td><td class="tdr">Fr. 30.00</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Shop window</i></td><td class="tdr">450.00</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>A glass eye for Cocles</i></td><td class="tdr">3.50</td></tr>
</table>

<p>... and keep the rest for yourself, said
Damocles, handing the bank-note to the
waiter. Then he quickly made off, beaming
with joy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The end of this chapter is much less
interesting. Little by little the restaurant
became empty. In vain Prometheus and
Cocles insisted on paying their share of the
bill&mdash;Damocles had already paid it. Prometheus
said good-bye to the waiter and
Cocles, and going back slowly to the Caucasus
he thought: Sell it?&mdash;Smother it?...
Tame it perhaps?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a few days after this that Prometheus,
denounced by the over-zealous waiter, found
himself in prison for making matches without
a licence.</p>

<p>The prison was isolated from the rest of
the world, and its only outlook was on to
the sky. From the outside it had the appearance
of a tower. In the inside Prometheus
was consumed by boredom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The waiter paid him a visit.</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh! said Prometheus smiling, I am so
happy to see you! I was bored to death. Tell
me, you who come from outside; the wall
of this dungeon separates me from everything
and I know nothing about other
people. What is happening?&mdash;And you,
first tell me what you are doing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>&mdash;Since your scandal, replied the waiter
nothing much; hardly anybody has been to
the restaurant. We have lost a great deal
of time in repairing the window.</p>

<p>&mdash;I am greatly distressed, said Prometheus;&mdash;but
Damocles? Have you seen Damocles?
He left the restaurant so quickly the
other day; I was not able to say good-bye.
I am so sorry. He seemed a very quiet
person, well-mannered, and full of scruples;
I was touched when he told me so naturally
of his trouble.&mdash;I hope when he left the
table he was happier?</p>

<p>&mdash;That did not last, said the waiter.
I saw him the next day more uneasy than
ever. In talking to me he cried. His
greatest anxiety was the health of Cocles.</p>

<p>&mdash;Is he unwell? asked Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;Cocles?&mdash;Oh no, replied the waiter.
I will say more: He sees better since he sees
with only one eye. He shows every one
his glass eye, and is delighted when he is
condoled with. When you see him, tell
him that his new eye looks well, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
wears it gracefully; but add how he must
have suffered....</p>

<p>&mdash;He suffers then?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, perhaps, when people do not
sympathize with him.</p>

<p>&mdash;But then, if Cocles is well and does not
suffer, why is Damocles anxious?</p>

<p>&mdash;Because of that which Cocles should
have suffered.</p>

<p>&mdash;You advise me then strongly....</p>

<p>&mdash;To say it, yes, but Damocles thinks it,
and that&#8217;s what kills him.</p>

<p>&mdash;What else does he do?</p>

<p>&mdash;Nothing. This unique occupation wears
him out. Between us, he is a man obsessed.&mdash;He
says that without those £20
Cocles would not be miserable.</p>

<p>&mdash;And Cocles?</p>

<p>&mdash;He says the same.... But he has
become rich.</p>

<p>&mdash;Really ... how?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh! I do not know exactly;&mdash;but he
has been talked about in the papers; and a
subscription has been opened in his favour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>&mdash;And what does he do with it?</p>

<p>&mdash;He is an artful fellow. With the
money collected he thinks of founding a
hospital.</p>

<p>&mdash;A hospital?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, a small hospital for the one
eyed. He has made himself director of
it.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ah bah! cried Prometheus; you interest
me enormously.</p>

<p>&mdash;I hoped you would be interested, said
the waiter.</p>

<p>&mdash;And tell me ... the Miglionaire?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh! he, he is a wonderful chap!&mdash;If
you imagine that all that upsets him!
He is like me: he observes.... If it would
amuse you, I will introduce you to him&mdash;when
you come out of this....</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, by the way, why am I here?
Prometheus said at last. What am I
accused of? Do you know, waiter, you
seem to know everything?</p>

<p>&mdash;My goodness no, pretended the waiter.
All that I know is that it is only preliminary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
detention. After they have condemned you,
you will know.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, so much the better! said Prometheus.
I always prefer to know.</p>

<p>&mdash;Good-bye, said the waiter; it is late.
With you it is astonishing how the time
flies.... But tell me: your eagle? What
has become of him?</p>

<p>&mdash;Bless me! I have thought no more
of him, said Prometheus. But when the
waiter had gone Prometheus began to think
of his eagle.</p>


<h4>HE MUST INCREASE BUT I MUST DECREASE</h4>

<p>And as Prometheus was bored in the
evening, he called his eagle.&mdash;The eagle
came.</p>

<p>&mdash;I have waited a long time for thee,
said Prometheus.</p>

<p>Why didst thou not call me before?
replied the eagle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>For the first time Prometheus looked at
his eagle, casually perched upon the twisted
bars of the dungeon. In the golden light of
the sunset he appeared more spiritless than
ever; he was grey, ugly, stunted, surly,
resigned, and miserable; he seemed too
feeble to fly, seeing which Prometheus cried
with pity.</p>

<p>&mdash;Faithful bird, he said to him, dost thou
suffer?&mdash;tell me: what is the matter?</p>

<p>&mdash;I am hungry, said the eagle.</p>

<p>&mdash;Eat, said Prometheus, uncovering his
liver.</p>

<p>The bird ate.</p>

<p>&mdash;I suffer, said Prometheus.</p>

<p>But the eagle said nothing more that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The next day at sunrise Prometheus
longed for his eagle; he called it from the
depth of the reddening dawn, and as the
sun rose the eagle appeared. He had three
more feathers and Prometheus sobbed with
tenderness.</p>

<p>&mdash;How late thou comest, he said, caressing
his feathers.</p>

<p>&mdash;It is because I cannot yet fly very fast,
said the bird. I skim the ground....</p>

<p>&mdash;Why?</p>

<p>&mdash;I am so weak!</p>

<p>&mdash;What dost thou want to make thee fly
faster?</p>

<p>&mdash;Thy liver.</p>

<p>&mdash;Very well, eat.</p>

<p>The next day the eagle had eight more
feathers and a few days after he arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
before the dawn. Prometheus himself became
very thin.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tell me of the world, he said to the
eagle. What has happened to all the others?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh! now I fly very high, replied the
eagle; I see nothing but the sky and thee.</p>

<p>His wings had grown slowly bigger.</p>

<p>&mdash;Lovely bird, what hast thou to tell me
this morning?</p>

<p>&mdash;I have carried my hunger through the
air.</p>

<p>&mdash;Eagle, wilt thou never be less cruel?</p>

<p>&mdash;No! But I may become very beautiful.</p>

<p>Prometheus, enamoured of the future
beauty of his eagle, gave him each day
more to eat.</p>

<p>One evening the eagle did not leave
him.</p>

<p>The next day it was the same.</p>

<p>He fascinated the prisoner by his gnawings;
and, the prisoner, who fascinated him
by his caresses, languished and pined away
for love, all day caressing his feathers, sleeping
at night beneath his wings, and feeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
him as he desired.&mdash;The eagle did not stir
night or day.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sweet eagle, who would have believed
it?</p>

<p>&mdash;Believed what?</p>

<p>&mdash;That our love could be so charming.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ah! Prometheus....</p>

<p>&mdash;Tell me, my sweet bird! Why am I
shut up here?</p>

<p>&mdash;What does that matter to thee? Am I
not with thee?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; it matters little! but art thou
pleased with me, beautiful eagle?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, if thou thinkest I am beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>It was spring-time; around the bars of the
tower the fragrant wisteria was in flower.</p>

<p>&mdash;One day we will go away, said the eagle.</p>

<p>&mdash;Really? cried Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;Because I am now very strong and thou
art thinner. I can carry thee.</p>

<p>&mdash;Eagle, my eagle!... Take me away.</p>

<p>And the eagle carried him away.</p>


<h4>A CHAPTER WHILE WAITING THE
NEXT ONE</h4>

<p>That evening Cocles and Damocles met
each other. They chatted together; but
with a certain embarrassment.</p>

<p>&mdash;What can you expect? said Cocles,
our points of view are so opposed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>&mdash;Do you think so? replied Damocles.
My only desire is that we understand each
other.</p>

<p>&mdash;You say that, but you only understand
yourself.</p>

<p>&mdash;And you, you do not even listen to
what I say.</p>

<p>&mdash;I know all that you would say.</p>

<p>&mdash;Say it then if you know it.</p>

<p>&mdash;You pretend to know it better than I do.</p>

<p>&mdash;Alas! Cocles, you get cross;&mdash;but for
the love of God tell me what ought I to do?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ah! nothing more for me, I beg you;
you have already given me a glass eye....</p>

<p>&mdash;Glass, in lack of a better, my Cocles.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes&mdash;after having half blinded me.</p>

<p>&mdash;But it was not I, dear Cocles.</p>

<p>&mdash;It was more or less; and in any case
you can pay for the eye&mdash;thanks to my blow.</p>

<p>&mdash;Cocles! forget the past!...</p>

<p>&mdash;No doubt it pleases you to forget.</p>

<p>&mdash;That&#8217;s not what I mean to say to you.</p>

<p>&mdash;But what do you mean to say then?
Go on, speak!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>&mdash;You do not listen to me.</p>

<p>&mdash;Because I know all that you would
say!...</p>

<p>The discussion, for want of something new
began to take a dangerous turn, when both
men were suddenly arrested by an advertisement
which ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">THIS EVENING AT 8 O&#8217;CLOCK<br />
IN THE<br />
<span class="xlarge">HALL OF THE NEW MOONS<br />
PROMETHEUS DELIVERED</span><br />
WILL SPEAK OF<br />
HIS<br />
<span class="xlarge">EAGLE</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>At 8.30 the Eagle will be presented and will perform
some tricks. At 9 o&#8217;clock a collection will be
made by the waiter on behalf of Cocles&#8217; hospital.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash;I must see that, said Cocles.</p>

<p>&mdash;I will go with you, said Damocles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In the Hall of the New Moons, at eight
o&#8217;clock precisely, the crowd gathered.</p>

<p>Cocles sat on the left; Damocles on the
right; and the rest of the public in the
middle.</p>

<p>A thunder of applause greeted the entry
of Prometheus; he mounted the steps of
the platform, placed his eagle at the side of
him, and pulled himself together.</p>

<p>In the hall there was a palpitating silence....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h4>THE PETITIO PRINCIPII</h4>

<p>&mdash;Gentlemen, began Prometheus, I do not
pretend, alas! to interest you by what I am
about to say, so I was careful to bring this
eagle with me. After each tiresome part
of my lecture he will play some tricks.
I have also with me some indecent photographs
and some fireworks, with which
when I reach the most serious moments of
my lecture I will try to distract the attention
of the public. Thus, I dare to hope,
gentlemen, for some attention. At each
new head of my discourse I shall have
the honour, gentlemen, to ask you to watch
the eagle eating his dinner,&mdash;for, gentlemen,
my discourse has three heads; I did
not think it proper to reject this form, which
is agreeable to my classical mind.&mdash;This
being the exordium, I will tell you at once
and without more ado, the first two heads
of the discourse:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>First head: One must have an eagle.</p>

<p>Second head: In any case, we all have
one.</p>

<p>Fearing that you will accuse me of prejudice,
gentlemen; fearing also to interfere
with my liberty of thought, I have prepared
my lecture only up to that point; the third
head will naturally unfold from the other
two. I will let inspiration have all its own
way.&mdash;As conclusion, the eagle, gentlemen,
will make the collection.</p>

<p>&mdash;Bravo! Bravo! cried Cocles.</p>

<p>Prometheus drank a little water. The
eagle pirouetted three times round Prometheus
and then bowed. Prometheus looked
round the hall, smiled at Damocles and at
Cocles, and as no sign of restlessness was as
yet shown he kept the fireworks for later on,
and continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>&mdash;However clever a rhetorician I may be
gentlemen, in the presence of such perspicacious
minds as yours I cannot juggle away
the inevitable <i>petitio principii</i> which awaits
me at the beginning of this lecture.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, try as we may, we cannot
escape the <i>petitio principii</i>. Now; what is a
petition of principles? Gentlemen, I dare
to say it: Every <i>petitio principii</i> is an affirmation
of temperament; for where principles
are missing, there the temperament is
affirmed.</p>

<p>When I declare: You must have an eagle
you may all exclaim: Why?&mdash;Now, what
answer can I make in reply that will not
bring us back to that formula, which is the
affirmation of my temperament: I do not
love men: I love that which devours them.
Temperament, gentlemen, is that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
must affirm itself. A fresh <i>petitio principii</i>,
you will say. But I have demonstrated that
every <i>petitio principii</i> is an affirmation of
temperament; and as I say one must
affirm one&#8217;s temperament (for it is important),
I repeat: I do not love men: I love
that which devours them.&mdash;Now what devours
man?&mdash;His eagle. Therefore, gentlemen,
one must have an eagle. I think I
have fully demonstrated this.</p>

<p>... Alas! I see, gentlemen, that I bore
you; some of you are yawning. I could, it
is true, here make a few jokes; but you
would feel them out of place; I have an
irredeemably serious mind.</p>

<p>I prefer to circulate among you some
indecent photographs; they will keep those
quiet who are feeling bored, which will
enable me to go on.</p>

<p>Prometheus drank a drop of water. The
eagle pirouetted three times round Prometheus
and bowed. Prometheus went
on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<h4>CONTINUATION OF PROMETHEUS&#8217;
LECTURE</h4>

<p>&mdash;Gentlemen, I have not always known
my eagle. That is what makes me deduce,
by a process of reasoning which the logic
books I never studied till a week ago, call by
some particular name I have forgotten&mdash;that
is what makes me deduce, I say, that,
even though the only eagle here is mine,
you all, gentlemen, have an eagle.</p>

<p>I have said nothing, up to the present, of
my own history; firstly because, up to the
present, I have not understood it. And if I
decide to speak of it now it is because,
thanks to my eagle, it now appears to me
marvellous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>&mdash;Gentlemen, as I have already said, my
eagle was not always with me. Before his
time I was unconscious and beautiful, happy
and naked and unaware. Oh! Charming
days! On the many-fountained sides of
the Caucasus, lascivious Asia, naked too and
unaware, held me in her arms.</p>

<p>Together we sported, tumbling in the
valleys; the air sang, the water laughed, the
simplest flowers were fragrant for our delight.
And often we lay beneath spreading
branches, among flowers which were the
haunt of murmuring bees.</p>

<p>Asia wedded me, all laughter and then the
murmuring swarms and the rustling leaves,
with which was mingled the music of the
streams, gently lulled us to the sweetest of
slumbers. Around us all consented&mdash;all
protected our inhuman solitude.&mdash;Suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
one day Asia said to me: You should
interest yourself in men.</p>

<p>I first had to find them.</p>

<p>I was willing enough to interest myself in
them&mdash;but it was to pity them.</p>

<p>They lived in such darkness; I invented
for them certain kinds of fire, and from
that moment my eagle began. And it is
since that day that I have become aware
that I am naked.</p>

<p>At these words, applause arose from
various parts of the hall. All of a sudden
Prometheus broke into sobs.</p>

<p>The eagle flapped his wings and cooed.</p>

<p>With an agonizing gesture Prometheus
opened his waistcoat and offered his tortured
liver to the bird.</p>

<p>The applause redoubled.</p>

<p>Then the eagle pirouetted three times
round Prometheus, who drank a few drops
of water, and continued his lecture in these
words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>&mdash;Gentlemen, my modesty overcame me.
Excuse me, it is the first time I speak in
public. But now it is my sincerity which
overcomes me. Gentlemen, I have been
more interested in men than I have ever
admitted. Gentlemen, I have done a great
deal for men. Gentlemen, I have passionately,
wildly, and deplorably loved men&mdash;and
I have done so much for them&mdash;one
can almost say that I have made them; for
before, what were they? They existed, but
had no consciousness of existence; I made
this consciousness like a fire to enlighten
them, gentlemen; I made it with all the
love I bore them.&mdash;The first consciousness
they had was that of their beauty. It is
this which caused the propagation of the
race. Men were prolonged in their posterity.
The beauty of the first was repeated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
equally, indifferently, uneventfully. It could
have lasted a long time.&mdash;Then I grew
anxious, for I carried in me already, without
knowing it, my eagle&#8217;s egg and I wanted
more or better. This propagation, this
piecemeal prolongation, seemed to me to
indicate in them an expectancy&mdash;when in
reality only my eagle was waiting. I did
not know; that expectancy I thought was
in man; that expectancy I put in man.
Besides, having made man in my image, I
now understood that in every man there was
something hatching; in each one was the
eagle&#8217;s egg.... And then, I do not know;
I cannot explain this.&mdash;All that I know is
that, not satisfied with giving them consciousness
of existence, I also wished to
give them a reason for existence. So I gave
them Fire, flame and all the arts which a
flame nourishes. By warming their minds,
I brought forth the devouring faith in progress.
And I was strangely happy when
their health was consumed in producing it.
No more belief in good, but the morbid hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
for better. The belief in progress, gentlemen,
that was their eagle. Our eagle is our
reason for existence, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Man&#8217;s happiness grew less and less&mdash;but
that was nothing to me: the eagle was born,
gentlemen! I loved men no more, I loved
what fed on them. I had had enough of a
humanity without history.... The history
of man is the history of their eagles, gentlemen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Applause broke out here and there. Prometheus,
abashed, excused himself:</p>

<p>&mdash;Gentlemen, I was lying: pardon me:
it did not happen quite so quickly: No, I
have not always loved eagles: For a long
time I preferred men; their injured happiness
was dear to me, because once having
interfered I believed myself responsible,
and in the evening every time I thought
of it, my eagle, sad as remorse, came to
eat.</p>

<p>He was at this time gaunt and grey,
careworn and morose, and he was as ugly as
a vulture.&mdash;Gentlemen, look at him now
and understand why I tell you this; why
I asked you to come here; why I entreat
you to listen to me. It is because I have
discovered this: the eagle can become very
beautiful. Now, every one of us has an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
eagle; as I have just most earnestly asserted.
An eagle?&mdash;Alas, a vulture perhaps! no,
no, not a vulture, gentlemen!&mdash;Gentlemen,
you must have an eagle....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now I touch the most serious question:&mdash;Why
an eagle?... Ah! Why?&mdash;let
him say why. Here is mine, gentlemen;
I bring him to you.... Eagle! Will you
reply now? Anxiously Prometheus turned
towards his eagle. The eagle was motionless
and remained silent.... Prometheus continued
in a distressed voice:</p>

<p>&mdash;Gentlemen, gentlemen, I have vainly
questioned my eagle.... Eagle! speak
now: every one listens to you.... Who
sends you? Why have you chosen me?
Where do you come from? Where do you
go to? Speak: What is your nature?
(The eagle remained silent.) No, nothing!
Not a word! Not a cry!&mdash;I hoped he
would speak to you at any rate; that is why
I brought him with me.... Must I speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
alone here?&mdash;All is silence!&mdash;All is
silence!</p>

<p>What does it mean?... I have questioned
in vain. Then turning towards the
audience:</p>

<p>Oh! I hoped, gentlemen, that you would
love my eagle, that your love would affirm
his beauty.&mdash;That is why I gave myself
up to him, that is why I filled him with the
blood of my soul.... But I see I am alone
in admiring him. Is it not enough for you
that he is beautiful? Or do you not admit
his beauty? Look at him at least. I have
lived only for him&mdash;and now I bring him
to you: There he is! As for me I live for
him&mdash;but he ... but he, why does he live?</p>

<p>Eagle that I have nourished with the
blood of my soul, whom with all my love
I have caressed ... (here Prometheus was
interrupted by sobs)&mdash;must I then leave
the earth without knowing why I loved you,
nor what you will do, nor what you will be,
after me on the earth ... on the earth? I
have ... asked in vain ... in vain....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>The words choked in his throat&mdash;his
voice could not be heard through his tears.&mdash;Pardon
me, gentlemen,&mdash;he continued a
little calmer; pardon me for saying such
serious things, but if I knew more serious
ones I would say them....</p>

<p>Perspiring, Prometheus wiped his face,
drank some water, and added:</p>


<h4>THE END OF PROMETHEUS&#8217; LECTURE</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have only prepared my lecture up to
this point....</p>

<p>... At these words there was a rustling
among the audience; several, feeling bored,
wished to go out.</p>

<p>&mdash;Gentlemen, cried Prometheus, I beseech
you to stay, it will not be very long
now; but the most important thing of all
remains to be said, if I have not already
persuaded you.... Gentlemen!&mdash;for
goodness&#8217; sake.... Here! quickly: a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
fireworks; I will keep the best for the
end.... Gentlemen!&mdash;sit down again, I
pray you; look: do not think I want to
economize: I light six at a time.&mdash;But
first, waiter, shut the doors.</p>

<p>The fireworks were more or less effective.
Nearly every one sat down again.</p>

<p>&mdash;But where was I? cried Prometheus.
I counted upon getting under weigh; disturbance
has checked me.</p>

<p>&mdash;So much the better, cried some one.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ah! I know ... continued Prometheus.
I wished to tell you again....</p>

<p>&mdash;Enough! enough!! cried voices from
all parts of the hall.</p>

<p>... That you must love your eagle.</p>

<p>Several cried &#8220;Why?&#8221; ironically.</p>

<p>&mdash;I hear, gentlemen, some one asks me
&#8220;Why?&#8221; I reply: Because then he will
become beautiful.</p>

<p>&mdash;But if we become ugly?</p>

<p>&mdash;Gentlemen, I do not speak here words
of self-interest....</p>

<p>&mdash;One can see that.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>&mdash;They are words of self-devotion. Gentlemen,
one must devote oneself to one&#8217;s
eagle.... (Agitation&mdash;many get up.)
Gentlemen, do not move: I will be personal.
It is not necessary to remind you of the
history of Cocles and Damocles.&mdash;All here
know it. Well&mdash;Well! I will tell them to
their faces: the secret of their lives is in
their self-devotion to their debt: You,
Cocles, to your blow; you, Damocles, to
your bank-note. Cocles, your duty was to
make your scar deeper and your empty
orbit emptier, oh! Cocles! yours, Damocles,
to keep your bank-note, to continue owing
it, owing it without shame, owing even more,
owing it with joy. There is your eagle;
there are other and more glorious ones.
But I tell you this: the eagle will devour us
anyway&mdash;vice or virtue&mdash;duty or passion,&mdash;cease
to be commonplace and you cannot
escape it. But....</p>

<p>(Here the voice of Prometheus was barely
heard in the tumult)&mdash;but if you do not
feed your eagle lovingly he will remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
grey and miserable, invisible to all and sly;
then you will call him conscience, not worthy
of the torments he causes; without beauty.&mdash;Gentlemen,
you must love your eagle,
love him to make him beautiful; for it is
for his future beauty that you must love
your eagle....</p>

<p>Now I have finished, gentlemen, my eagle
will make the collection. Gentlemen, you
must love my eagle.&mdash;In the meantime I
will let off some fireworks....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thanks to the pyrotechnic diversion,
the assembly dispersed without too much
trouble; but Damocles took cold on coming
out of the hall.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&mdash;You</span> know that he is not at all well, said
the waiter, seeing Prometheus a few days later.</p>

<p>&mdash;Who?</p>

<p>&mdash;Damocles&mdash;Oh! very bad:&mdash;it was
coming out after your lecture that he was
taken ill....</p>

<p>&mdash;But what is the matter?</p>

<p>&mdash;The doctors hesitate;&mdash;it is a very
unusual illness ... a shrinkage of the
spine....</p>

<p>&mdash;The spine?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, the spine.&mdash;At least, unless a
miracle happens he must get worse. He is
very low, I assure you, and you should go
and see him.</p>

<p>&mdash;You go very often yourself?</p>

<p>&mdash;I? Yes, every day.&mdash;He is very
anxious about Cocles; I bring him news
every day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>&mdash;Why doesn&#8217;t Cocles go to see him
himself?</p>

<p>&mdash;Cocles?&mdash;He is too busy. Don&#8217;t you
remember your lecture? It has made an
extraordinary effect upon him. He talks of
nothing but self-devotion, and passes all his
time looking in the streets for another
blow, which may benefit some unknown
Damocles. In vain he offers his other
cheek.</p>

<p>&mdash;Why not tell the Miglionaire?</p>

<p>&mdash;I give him news every day. That is
really the reason why I visit Damocles
every day.</p>

<p>&mdash;Why does he not go and see Damocles
himself?</p>

<p>&mdash;That is what I tell him, but he refuses.
He does not wish to be known. And yet
Damocles would certainly get well immediately
if he knew his benefactor. I tell him
all this, but he insists upon keeping his incognito&mdash;and
I understand now that it is not
Damocles but his illness which interests
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>&mdash;You spoke of introducing me?...</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, at once, if you like.</p>

<p>They went off immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Not knowing him ourselves, we have
decided not to say very much about the
waiter&#8217;s friend, Zeus, but just to report
these few remarks.</p>


<h4>INTERVIEW OF THE MIGLIONAIRE</h4>

<p>The waiter:&mdash;Is it not true that you are
very rich?</p>

<p>The Miglionaire, half turning towards
Prometheus:&mdash;I am richer than you can
ever imagine. You belong to me; he
belongs to me; everything belongs to me.&mdash;You
think I am a banker; I am really something
quite different. My effect on Paris is
hidden, but it is none the less important.
It is hidden because it is not continuous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Yes, I have above all the spirit of initiative.
I launch; then, once the affair is set going,
I leave it; I have nothing more to do with it.</p>

<p>The waiter:&mdash;Isn&#8217;t it true that your
actions are gratuitous?</p>

<p>The Miglionaire:&mdash;It is only I, only a
person whose fortune is infinite, who can
act with absolute disinterestedness; for man
it is impossible. From that comes my love
of gambling; I do not gamble for gain, you
understand&mdash;I gamble for the pleasure of
gambling. What could I gain that I do not
possess already? Even time.... Do you
know my age?</p>

<p>Prometheus and the waiter:&mdash;You appear
still young, sir.</p>

<p>The Miglionaire:&mdash;Well, do not interrupt
me, Prometheus.&mdash;Yes, I have a
passion for gambling. My game is to lend
to men. I lend, but it is not for pleasure. I
lend, but it is sinking the capital. I lend,
but with an air of giving.&mdash;I do not wish it
known that I lend. I play, but I hide my
game. I experiment; I play, as a Dutchman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
sows his seed; as he plants a secret
bulb; that which I lend to men, that which
I plant in man, I amuse myself by watching
it grow; without that, man would be so
empty!&mdash;Let me tell you my most recent
experience. You will help me to analyse it.
Just listen, you will understand later.</p>

<p>I went down into the street with the idea
of making some one suffer for a gift I
would make to another; to make one happy
by the suffering of the other. A blow and
a note of £20 was all that was necessary.
To one the blow, and to the other the note.
Is it clear? What is less clear is the way
of giving them.</p>

<p>&mdash;I know it already, interrupted Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, really, you know of it, said
Zeus.</p>

<p>&mdash;I have met both Damocles and Cocles;
it is precisely about them that I have come
to speak to you:&mdash;Damocles looks and calls
for you, he is very anxious; he is ill;&mdash;for
goodness&#8217; sake go and see him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>&mdash;Sir, stop&mdash;said Zeus&mdash;I have no need
of advice from anybody.</p>

<p>&mdash;What did I tell you? said the waiter.</p>

<p>Prometheus was going away, but suddenly
turned again: Sir, pardon me. Excuse an
indiscreet question. Oh! show it to me,
I beg you! I should love so much to
see it....</p>

<p>&mdash;What?</p>

<p>&mdash;Your eagle.</p>

<p>&mdash;But I have no eagle, sir.</p>

<p>&mdash;No eagle? He has no eagle! But....</p>

<p>&mdash;Not so much of one as I can hold in
the hollow of my hand. Eagles (and he
laughed), eagles! It is I who give them.</p>

<p>Prometheus was stupefied.</p>

<p>&mdash;Do you know what people say? the
waiter asked the banker.</p>

<p>&mdash;What do they say?</p>

<p>&mdash;That you are God.</p>

<p>&mdash;I let them say so, said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Prometheus went to see Damocles; and
then he went very often. He did not talk to
him every time; but in any case the waiter
gave him the news. One day he brought
Cocles with him.</p>

<p>The waiter received them.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, how is he? asked Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;Bad. Very bad, replied the waiter.
For three days the miserable man has not
been able to take any food. His bank-note
torments him; he looks for it everywhere;
he thinks he may have eaten it;&mdash;he
takes a purgative and thinks to find it
in his stool. When his reason returns and
he remembers his adventure, he is again in
despair. He has a grudge against you,
Cocles, because he thinks you have so complicated
his debt that he no longer knows
where he is. Most of the time he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
delirious. At night there are three of us to
watch him, but he keeps leaping upon his
bed, which prevents us sleeping.</p>

<p>&mdash;Can we see him? said Cocles.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, but you will find him changed.
He is devoured by anxiety. He has become
thin, thin, thin. Will you recognize him?&mdash;And
will he recognize you?</p>

<p>They entered on the tips of their toes.</p>


<h4>THE LAST DAYS OF DAMOCLES</h4>

<p>Damocles&#8217; bedroom smelt horribly of
medicines. Low and very narrow, it was
lighted gloomily by two night-lights. In an
alcove, covered with innumerable blankets,
one could see Damocles tossing about. He
spoke all the time, although there was no one
near him. His voice was hoarse and thick.
Full of horror Prometheus and Cocles looked
at each other; he did not hear them approach
and continued his moaning as if he were alone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>&mdash;And from that day, he was saying,
it seemed to me, both that my life began to
have another meaning and that I could no
longer live! That hated bank-note I believed
I owed it to every one and I dared not
give it to any one&mdash;without depriving all the
others. I only dreamed of getting rid of
it&mdash;but how?&mdash;The Savings Bank! but
this increased my trouble; my debt was augmented
by the interest on the money; and,
on the other hand, the idea of letting it
stagnate was intolerable to me; so I thought
it best to circulate the sum; I carried it
always upon me; regularly every week I
changed the note into silver, and then the
silver into another note. Nothing is lost
or gained in this exchange. It is circular
insanity.&mdash;And to this was added another
torture: that it was through a blow given to
another that I received this note!</p>

<p>One day, you know well, I met you in
a restaurant....</p>

<p>&mdash;He is speaking of you, said the waiter.</p>

<p>&mdash;The eagle of Prometheus broke the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
window of the restaurant and put out
Cocles&#8217; eye.... Saved!!&mdash;Gratuitously,
fortuitously, providentially! I will slip my
bank-note into the interstices of these events.
No more debt! Saved! Ah! gentlemen!
what an error.... It was from that day that
I became a dying man. How can I explain
this to you? Will you ever understand my
anguish? I am still in debt for this note,
and now it is no longer in my possession!
I tried like a coward to get rid of my debt,
but I have not acquitted it. In my nightmares
I awake covered with perspiration.
Kneeling down, I cry aloud: Lord! Lord!
to whom do I owe this? I know nothing
of it, but I owe&mdash;owing is like duty. Duty,
gentlemen, is a horrible thing; look at me,
I am dying of it.</p>

<p>And now I am more tormented than ever
because I have passed this debt on to you,
Cocles.... Cocles! it does not belong to
you that eye, as the money it was bought
with did not belong to me. And what hast
thou that thou didst not receive? says the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Bible ... received from whom? whom??
Whom??... My distress is intolerable.</p>

<p>The wretched man spoke in short, sharp
jerks; his voice grew inarticulate, choked as
it was by gasps, sobs and tears. Anxiously
Prometheus and Cocles listened; they took
each other&#8217;s hand and trembled. Damocles
said, seeming to see them:</p>

<p>Debt is a terrible duty, gentlemen ... but
how much more terrible is the remorse of
having wished to evade a duty.... As if
the debt could cease to exist because it was
transferred to another.... But your eye
burns you, Cocles!&mdash;Cocles!! I am certain
it burns you, your glass eye; tear it
out!&mdash;If it does not burn you, it ought
to burn you, for it is not yours&mdash;your
eye ... and if it is not yours it must be
your brother&#8217;s ... whose is it? whose?
Whose??</p>

<p>The miserable man wept; he became
delirious and lost strength; now and again
fixing his eyes on Prometheus and Cocles
he seemed to recognize them, crying:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>&mdash;But understand me for pity&#8217;s sake!
The pity I claim from you is not simply a
compress on my forehead, a bowl of fresh
water, a soothing drink; it is to understand
me. Help me to understand myself, for
pity&#8217;s sake! <i>This</i> which has come to me
from I know not where, to whom do I owe
it? to whom?? to Whom??&mdash;And, in
order to cease one day from owing it one
day, believing, I made with <i>this</i> a present to
others! To others!!&mdash;to Cocles&mdash;the
gift of an eye!! but it is not yours, that
eye, Cocles! Cocles!! give it back. Give
it back, but to whom? to whom? to
Whom??</p>

<p>Not wishing to hear more, Cocles and
Prometheus went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>&mdash;There, you see, said Cocles, coming
down the stairs, the fate of a man who has
grown rich by another&#8217;s suffering.</p>

<p>&mdash;But is it true that you suffer? asked
Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;From my eye occasionally, said Cocles,
but from the blow, no more; I prefer to have
received it. It does not burn any more;
it has revealed to me my goodness. I am
flattered by it; I am pleased about it. I
never cease to think that my pain was useful
to my neighbour and that it brought him £20.</p>

<p>&mdash;But the neighbour is dying of it, Cocles,
said Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;Did you not tell him that one must
nourish one&#8217;s eagle? What do you expect?
Damocles and I never could understand
each other, our points of view are entirely
opposed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>Prometheus said good-bye to Cocles and
ran to the house of Zeus, the banker.</p>

<p>&mdash;For goodness&#8217; sake, show yourself! he
said, or at least make yourself known. The
miserable man is dying. I could understand
your killing him since that is your
pleasure; but let him know at least who
it is that is killing him&mdash;that he may be at
peace.</p>

<p>The Miglionaire replied:&mdash;I do not wish
to lose my prestige.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The end of Damocles was admirable; he
pronounced a little while before his last hour
some words which drew tears from the most
unbelieving and made pious people say:
How edifying! The most notable sentiment
was the one expressed so well in these words:
I hope at any rate that he will not have felt
the loss of it.</p>

<p>&mdash;Who? asked some one.</p>

<p>&mdash;He, said Damocles, dying; he who
gave me ... something.</p>

<p>&mdash;No! it was Providence, cleverly replied
the waiter.</p>

<p>Damocles died after hearing these comforting
words.</p>


<h4>THE FUNERAL</h4>

<p>&mdash;Oh! said Prometheus to Cocles, leaving
the chamber of death,&mdash;all that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
horrible! The death of Damocles upsets
me. Is it true that my lecture can have
been the cause of his illness?</p>

<p>&mdash;I cannot say, said the waiter, but I
know that at any rate he was greatly moved
by all that you said of your eagle.</p>

<p>&mdash;Of our eagle, replied Cocles.</p>

<p>&mdash;I was so convinced, said Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;That is why you convinced him....
Your words were very strong.</p>

<p>&mdash;I thought that no one paid any attention
and I insisted.... If I had known that he
would listen so attentively....</p>

<p>&mdash;What would you have said?</p>

<p>&mdash;The same thing, stammered Prometheus.</p>

<p>&mdash;Then?</p>

<p>&mdash;But I would not say the same thing now.</p>

<p>&mdash;Are you no longer convinced?</p>

<p>&mdash;Damocles was too much so.... I
have other ideas about my eagle.</p>

<p>&mdash;By the way, where is he?</p>

<p>&mdash;Do not fear, Cocles. I have my eye
on him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&mdash;Good-bye. I shall wear mourning,
said Cocles. When shall we see each other
again?</p>

<p>&mdash;But ... at the funeral, I suppose. I
will make a speech there. I ought to repair
in some way the damage I have done. And
afterwards I invite you to the funeral feast
in the restaurant exactly where we saw
Damocles for the first time.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>At the funeral there were not many
people; Damocles was very little known;
his death passed unnoticed except for those
few interested in his history. Prometheus,
the waiter, and Cocles found themselves at
the cemetery, also a few idle listeners of the
lecture. Every one looked at Prometheus,
as they knew he was to speak; and they
said: &#8220;What will he say?&#8221; for they remembered
what he had said before. Before
Prometheus began to speak great astonishment
was caused by the fact that he was
unrecognizable; he was fat, fresh, smiling;
smiling so much that his conduct was
judged a little indecent, as smiling still he
advanced to the edge of the grave, turned
his back on it, and spoke these simple
words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>


<h4>THE HISTORY OF TITYRUS</h4>

<p>&mdash;Gentlemen who are kind enough to listen
to me, the words of Scripture which serve as
text for my brief discourse to-day are these:</p>

<p><i>Let the dead bury their dead.</i> We will
therefore occupy ourselves no more with
Damocles.&mdash;The last time that I saw you
all together was to hear me speak of my
eagle; Damocles died of it; leave the dead
... it is nevertheless because of him, or rather
thanks to his death, that now I have killed
my eagle....</p>

<p>&mdash;Killed his eagle!!! cried every one.</p>

<p>&mdash;That reminds me of an anecdote....
Let us grant I have said nothing.</p>


<h5>I</h5>

<p>In the beginning was Tityrus.</p>

<p>And Tityrus being alone and completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
surrounded by swamps was bored.&mdash;Then
Menalcas passed by, who put an idea into
the head of Tityrus, a seed in the swamp
before him. And this idea was the seed and
this seed was the Idea. And with the help
of God the seed germinated and became a
little plant, and Tityrus in the evening and
in the morning knelt before it, thanking
God for having given it to him. And the
plant became tall and great, and as it had
powerful roots it very soon completely dried
up the soil around it, and thus Tityrus had
at last firm earth on which to set his feet,
rest his head, and strengthen the works of
his hands.</p>

<p>When this plant had grown to the height
of Tityrus, Tityrus tasted the joy of sleeping
stretched under its shadow. Now, this
tree, being an oak-tree, grew enormously;
so much so that soon Tityrus&#8217; hands were
no longer sufficient to till and hoe the earth
around the oak&mdash;to water the oak, to prune,
to trim, to decorticate, to destroy the caterpillars,
and to ensure in due season the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
picking of its many and diverse fruits. He
engaged, therefore, a tiller and a hoer, and
a trimmer and a decorticator, and a man to
destroy the caterpillars, and a man to water
the oak, and two or three fruit boys. And
as each had to keep strictly to his own
speciality, there was a chance of each person&#8217;s
work being well done.</p>

<p>In order to arrange for the paying of the
wages, Tityrus had to have an accountant,
who soon shared with a cashier the worries
of Tityrus&#8217; fortune; this grew like the oak.</p>

<p>Certain arguments arising between the
trimmer, and the pruner, and the depilator&mdash;as
to where each man&#8217;s work began and
finished, Tityrus saw the necessity of an
arbitrator, who called for two lawyers to
expose both sides of the question.</p>

<p>Tityrus took a secretary to record their
judgments, and as they were only recorded
for future reference, there had to be a
keeper of the rolls.</p>

<p>On the soil meanwhile houses appeared
one by one, and it was necessary to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
police for the streets, to guard against excesses.
Tityrus, overcome by work, began
to feel ill. He sent for a doctor who told
him to take a wife&mdash;and finding the work
too much for him, Tityrus was forced to
choose a sheriff, and he himself was therefore
appointed mayor. From this time he
had only very few hours of leisure, when he
could fish with a line from the windows of
his house, which still continued to open
on the swamp.</p>

<p>Then Tityrus instituted bank holidays so
that his people might enjoy themselves; but
as this was expensive and no one was very
rich, Tityrus, in order to be able to lend
them all money, first began by raising it
from each of them separately.</p>

<p>Now the oak in the middle of the plain
(for in spite of the town, in spite of the
effort of so many men, it had never ceased
to be the plain), the oak, as I said, in the
middle of the plain, had no difficulty in
being placed so that one of its sides was in
shadow and the other in the sunshine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Under the oak then, on the shady side
Tityrus rendered justice; on the sunny side
he fulfilled his natural necessities. And
Tityrus was happy, for he felt his life was
useful to others and fully occupied.</p>


<h5>II</h5>

<p>Man&#8217;s effort can be intensified. Tityrus&#8217;
activity seemed to grow with encouragement;
his natural ingenuity caused him to
think of other means of employment. He
set to work to furnish and decorate his
house. The suitable character of the hangings
and the convenience of each object
were much admired. Industrious, he excelled
in empiricism; he even made a
little hook to hang his sponges on the
wall, which after four days he found perfectly
useless. Then Tityrus built another
room by the side of his room, where he
could arrange the affairs of the nation; the
two rooms had the same entrance, to indicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
that their interests were the same; but
because of the one entrance which supplied
both rooms with air, the two chimneys
would not draw at the same time, so that
when it was cold and a fire was lighted
in one, the other was full of smoke. The
days therefore that he wished for a fire,
Tityrus was forced to open his window.</p>

<p>As Tityrus protected everything and
worked for the propagation of the species, a
time came when the slugs crawled on his
garden paths in such abundance that he did
not know where to step for fear of crushing
them and finally resigned.</p>

<p>He invited a woman with a circulating
library to come to the town, with whom he
opened a subscription. And as she was
called Angèle he became accustomed to go
there every three days and pass his evenings
with her. And by this means Tityrus learnt
metaphysics, algebra, and theodicy. Tityrus
and Angèle began to practise together successfully
various accomplishments, and Angèle
showing particular taste for music, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
hired a grand piano upon which Angèle
played the little tunes which between times
he composed for her.</p>

<p>Tityrus said to Angèle: So many occupations
will kill me. I am at the end of my
tether; I feel that I am getting used up,
these consolidated interests intensify my
scruples, and as my scruples grow greater I
grow less. What is to be done?</p>

<p>&mdash;Shall we go away? said Angèle to him.</p>

<p>&mdash;I cannot go: I have my oak.</p>

<p>&mdash;Suppose you were to leave it, said Angèle.</p>

<p>&mdash;Leave my oak! You don&#8217;t mean it!</p>

<p>&mdash;Is it not large enough now to grow alone?</p>

<p>&mdash;But I am attached to it.</p>

<p>&mdash;Become unattached, replied Angèle.</p>

<p>And a little while after, having realized
strongly that after all, occupations, responsibilities,
and other scruples could hold him
no more than the oak, Tityrus smiled and
went off, taking with him the cash-box and
Angèle, and towards the end of the day
walked with her down the boulevard which
leads from the Madeleine to the Opéra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>


<h5>III</h5>

<p>That evening the boulevard had a strange
look. One felt that something unusually
grave was going to happen. An enormous
crowd, serious and anxious, overflowed the
pavement, spreading on to the road, which
the Paris police, placed at intervals, with
great trouble kept free. Before the restaurants,
the terraces disproportionately enlarged
by the placing of chairs and tables,
made the obstruction more complete and
rendered circulation impossible. Now and
again an onlooker impatiently stood upon
his chair for an instant&mdash;the time that one
could beg him to get down. Evidently all
were waiting; one felt without doubt that
between the two pavements upon the protected
route something was going to pass.
Having found a table with great difficulty
and paid a large price for it, Angèle and
Tityrus installed themselves in front of two
glasses of beer and asked the waiter:</p>

<p>&mdash;What are they all waiting for?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>&mdash;Where does your lordship come from?
said the waiter. Does not your lordship
know that every one is waiting to see Melib&oelig;us?
He will pass by between 5 and 6
... and there&mdash;listen: I believe one can
already hear his flute.</p>

<p>From the depths of the boulevard the
frail notes of a pipe were heard. The
crowd thrilled with still greater attention.
The sound increased, came nearer, grew
louder and louder.</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, how it moves me! said Angèle.</p>

<p>The setting sun soon threw its rays from
one end of the boulevard to the other. And,
as if issuing from the splendour of the
setting sun, Melib&oelig;us was at last seen
advancing&mdash;preceded by the simple sound
of his flute.</p>

<p>At first nothing could be clearly distinguished
but his figure, but when he drew
nearer:</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, how charming he is! said Angèle.
In the meantime Melib&oelig;us as he arrived
opposite Tityrus, ceased to play his flute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
stopped suddenly, saw Angèle, and every
one realized that he was naked.</p>

<p>Oh! said Angèle, leaning upon Tityrus,
how beautiful he is! what strong thighs he
has! His playing is adorable!</p>

<p>Tityrus felt a little uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ask him where he is going, said
Angèle.</p>

<p>&mdash;Where are you going? questioned
Tityrus.</p>

<p>Melib&oelig;us replied:&mdash;Eo Romam.</p>

<p>&mdash;What does he say? asked Angèle.</p>

<p>Tityrus:&mdash;You would not understand, my
dear.</p>

<p>&mdash;But you can explain it to me, said
Angèle.</p>

<p>&mdash;Romam, insisted Melib&oelig;us.... Urbem
quam dicunt Romam.</p>

<p>Angèle:&mdash;Oh, it sounds delicious! What
does it mean?</p>

<p>Tityrus:&mdash;But my dear Angèle, I assure
you it is not so delightful as it sounds;
it means quite simply that he is going to
Rome.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>&mdash;Rome! said Angèle dreamily. Oh, I
should love so much to see Rome!</p>

<p>Melib&oelig;us, resuming his flute, once more
began to play his primæval melody, and at
the sound, Angèle, in a passion of excitement,
raised herself, stood up, drew near;
and as Melib&oelig;us&#8217; arm was bent to her hand,
she took it, and thus the two together went
on their way along the boulevard; further,
further they went, gradually vanished from
sight, and disappeared into the finality of
the twilit dusk.</p>

<p>The crowd, now unbridled in its agitation,
became more and more tumultuous. On all
sides one heard the questions: What did he
say?&mdash;What did he do?&mdash;Who was that
woman?&mdash;And when, a few minutes later,
the evening papers appeared, a furious curiosity
swept over them like a cyclone, and it
was suddenly divulged that the woman was
Angèle, and that this Melib&oelig;us was a naked
person who was going to Italy.</p>

<p>Then, all their curiosity having died
down, the crowd streamed off like water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
flowing away and the main boulevards were
deserted.</p>

<p>And Tityrus found himself alone, completely
surrounded by the swamp.</p>

<p>Let us grant that I have said nothing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An irrepressible laughter shook the audience
for several seconds.</p>

<p>&mdash;Gentlemen, I am happy that my story
has amused you, said Prometheus, laughing
also. Since the death of Damocles I have
found the secret of laughter. For the present
I have finished, gentlemen. Let the
dead bury the dead and let us go quickly to
lunch.</p>

<p>He took the waiter by one arm and Cocles
by the other; they all left the cemetery;
after passing the gates, the rest of the
assembly dispersed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>&mdash;Pardon me, said Cocles. Your story
was charming, and you made us laugh....
But I do not quite understand the
connexion....</p>

<p>&mdash;If there had been more you would not
have laughed so much, said Prometheus.
Do not look for too much meaning in all
this. I wanted above all to distract you,
and I am happy to have done so; surely
I owed you that? I wearied you so the
other day.</p>

<p>They found themselves on the boulevards.</p>

<p>&mdash;Where are we going? said the waiter.</p>

<p>&mdash;To your restaurant, if you do not mind,
in memory of our first meeting.</p>

<p>&mdash;You are passing it, said the waiter.</p>

<p>&mdash;I do not recognize it.</p>

<p>&mdash;It is all new now.</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, I forgot!... I forgot that my
eagle.... Don&#8217;t trouble: he will never do
it again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>&mdash;Is it true, said Cocles, what you say?</p>

<p>&mdash;What?</p>

<p>&mdash;That you have killed him?</p>

<p>&mdash;And that we are going to eat him?...
Do you doubt it? said Prometheus. Have
you looked at me?&mdash;When he was alive,
did I dare to laugh?&mdash;Was I not horribly
thin?</p>

<p>&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<p>&mdash;He fed on me long enough. I think
now that it is my turn.</p>

<p>&mdash;A table! Sit down! Sit down, gentlemen!</p>

<p>&mdash;Waiter, do not serve us: as a last
remembrance, take the place of Damocles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The meal was more joyful than it is
possible to say. The eagle was found to be
delicious, and at dessert they all drank his
health.</p>

<p>&mdash;Has he then been useless? asked one.</p>

<p>&mdash;Do not say that, Cocles!&mdash;his flesh
has nourished us.&mdash;When I questioned him
he answered nothing, but I eat him without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
bearing him a grudge: if he had made me
suffer less, he would have been less fat; less
fat, he would have been less delectable.</p>

<p>&mdash;Of his past beauty, what is there left.</p>

<p>&mdash;I have kept all his feathers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

book. May you, rare friend, not find it too
foolish.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
