<p class="indent">"<em>I want to prove that whoever acts rightly and<br />
nobly, can by that alone bear misfortune."</em></p>

<p style="padding-left: 55%; ">BEETHOVEN.</p>

<p class="right" style="margin-bottom: 2em; padding-right: 5em; ">(To the Municipality of Vienna, Feb. 1, 1819.)</p>

<p>The air is heavy around us. The world is stifled
by a thick and vitiated atmosphere&mdash;an undignified
materialism which weighs on the mind and
heart hindering the work of governments and
individuals alike. We are being suffocated. Let
us throw open the windows that God's free air
may come in, and that we may breathe the breath
of heroes.</p>

<p>Life is stern. It is a daily battle for those not
content with an unattractive mediocrity of soul.
And a sad battle it is, too, for many&mdash;a combat
without grandeur, without happiness, fought in
solitude and silence. Weighed down by poverty
and domestic cares, by excessive and senseless
tasks which waste the strength to no purpose,
without a gleam of hope, many souls are
separated from each other, without even the consolation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of holding out a hand to their brothers
in misfortune who ignore them and are ignored
by them. They are forced to rely on themselves
alone; and there are moments when even the
strongest give way under their burden of trouble.
They call out&mdash;for a friend.</p>

<p>Let them then gather around themselves the
heroic friends of the past&mdash;the great souls who
suffered for the good of universal humanity. The
lives of great men are not written for the proud
or for the ambitious; they are dedicated rather
to the unhappy. And who really is not? To
those who suffer, we offer the balm of their sacred
sufferings. No one is alone in the fight. The
darkness of the world is made clear by the guiding
light of the souls of the heroes.</p>

<p>I do not give the name hero to those who have
triumphed by infinite thought or by sheer physical
strength&mdash;but only to those made great by
goodness of heart. Beethoven wrote, "I recognise
no sign of superiority in mankind other
than goodness." Where the character is not
great, there is no great man, there is not even a
great artist, nor a great man of action; there are
only idols unearthed for the cheap and short-lived
applause of the multitude; time will efface them
altogether. Outward success matters little. The
only thing is to be great, not to appear so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>The lives of the great heroes were lives of one
long martyrdom; a tragic destiny willed their souls
to be forged on the anvil of physical and moral
grief, of misery and ill-health. They were made
great through their misfortune. Because these
mighty souls complained little of their unhappiness,
the best of humanity is with them. Let us
gather courage from them; for torrents of quiet
strength and inspiring goodness issued from their
great hearts. Without even consulting their works
or hearing their voices, we read in their eyes
the secret of their lives&mdash;that it is good to have
been in trouble, for thence the character acquires
even more greatness, happiness and fruition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The strong and pure Beethoven himself hoped
in the midst of his sufferings that his example
would give help to other unfortunate ones ...
"that the unhappy being may be consoled in finding
another as unfortunate as himself, who in face
of all obstacles has done everything possible to become
worthy of the name, <span class="smcap">MAN</span>." After years of
battling with almost superhuman efforts to rise
superior to his sufferings and accomplish his life's
work&mdash;to breathe a little more courage into poor
weak humanity, this conquering Prometheus observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
to a friend who called too much on God,
"O man, help thyself!"</p>

<p>May we be inspired by his noble words. Animated
by the example of this man's faith in life
and his quiet confidence in himself, let us again
take heart.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="center" style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 2em; "><span class="smcap">By Edward Carpenter</span></p>


<p>It is not very generally recognised that Beethoven
was not only a great musician, but a great leader
and teacher. He freed the human spirit from innumerable
petty bonds and conventions, he recorded
the profoundest experiences of life, and
gave form and utterance to emotions hardly guessed&mdash;certainly
not definitely expressed&mdash;before his
time. Personally I feel I owe much more to
Beethoven in these respects than I do to Shakespeare:
and though this, of course, may be a purely
personal or accidental matter, yet I mention it
in order to show that the music of such a man has,
after all, the closest bearing on actual life.</p>

<p>M. Romain Rolland in his excellent little study
has brought this prophetic and inspiring quality
of Beethoven's life and music out very strongly.
He has traced the tragedy of Beethoven's life and
experience, and its culmination in a kind of liberation
of his spirit from the bonds of mortality; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
has shown how this connects up with the composer's
strong sentiment of democracy and sympathy
with the suffering masses; and how it leads
to the utterance of that strange sense of joy which
penetrates and suffuses his later work. In all these
respects M. Rolland regards Beethoven as one of
the greatest benefactors of humanity.</p>

<p>On the other hand our author builds in the picture
of Beethoven's life and character with a great
number of small touches derived from all sorts of
writers and biographers&mdash;and so succeeds in giving
a life-like impression of his personality.</p>

<p class="right" style="margin-top: 1em; padding-right: 2em; "><span class="smcap">Edward Carpenter.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As bearing on the subject of M. Romain Rolland's
book, Mr. Carpenter has kindly given permission
to insert the following few extracts from
his own book, "Angels' Wings."</p>

<p>"Everything conspired in Beethoven to make
his utterance authentic, strong, unqualified&mdash;like a
gushing spring which leaps from the inaccessible
depths of the mountain. His solitary habits kept
his mind clear from the mud and sediment which
the market-place and the forum mistake for
thought; his deafness coming on at so early an
age (twenty-eight), increased this effect, it left him
fancy-free in the world of music; Wagner even
mentions the excessive thickness of his skull (ascertained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
long after his death), as suggesting the
special isolation of his brain. From a boy Beethoven
was a great reader. He fed his mind in
his own way. Unlike the musicians who went
before him, he could brook no dependence upon
condescending nobilities. He was not going to
be a Court fool. The man who could rush into the
courtyard of his really sincere friend and 'patron,'
Prince Lobkowitz, and shout 'Lobkowitz donkey,
Lobkowitz donkey,' for all the valets and chambermaids
to hear; or who could leave his humble lodgings
because the over-polite landlord of the house
would insist on doffing his hat each time they
passed on the stairs; must have had 'something
of the devil in him!' (This was the verdict of
Hummel, Vogler, Gelinck, and others when they
first heard him improvise on his arrival at Vienna).
In politics, in a quite general way, he evolved
radicalism or republicanism as his creed; in religion,
though nominally a Catholic, he was quite
informal. A pantheist one might perhaps call him,
or a mystic after Eckhardt and Tauler. Finally,
one may mention, as an indication of the great
range and strength of his personality, its exceedingly
slow growth. While Mozart at the age of
twenty-three had written a great number of Operas,
Symphonies, Cantatas and Masses&mdash;many of them
of quite mature character&mdash;Beethoven at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
age had little or nothing to show. His first Symphony
and his Septet, which he always looked
back upon as childish productions, were not written
till about the age of twenty-seven; and his first
great Symphony (the <em>Eroica</em>) not till he was thirty-two."&mdash;<em>Angels'
Wings</em>, pp. 141-2.</p>

<p>"Beethoven came at the culmination of a long
line of musical tradition. He also came at a moment
when the foundations of society were breaking
away for the preparation of something new.
His great strength lay in the fact that he united
the old and the new. He was epic and dramatic,
and held firmly to the accepted outlines and broad
evolution of his art, like the musicians who went
before him; he was lyrical, like those who followed,
and uttered to the full his own vast individuality.
And so (like the greatest artists) he transformed
rather than shattered the traditions into which he
was born.</p>

<p>"Beethoven was always trying to express <em>himself</em>;
yet not, be it said, so much any little phase
of himself or of his feelings, as the total of his
life-experience. He was always trying to reach
down and get the fullest, deepest utterance of which
his subject in hand was capable, and to relate it to
the rest of his experience. But being such as he
was, and a master-spirit of his age, when he reached
into himself for his own expression, he reached to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
the expression also of others&mdash;to the expression of
all the thoughts and feelings of that wonderful revolutionary
time, seething with the legacy of the
past and germinal with the hopes and aspirations
of the future. Music came to him rich already
with gathered voices; but he enlarged its language
beyond all precedent for the needs of a new humanity."&mdash;<em>Ibid</em>,
pp. 146-7.</p>

<p>"Bettina Brentano, writing to Goethe of Beethoven,
says: 'I am, indeed, only a child, but I am
not on that account wrong in saying (what perhaps
no one yet perceives and believes) that he far surpasses
the measure of other men. Shall we ever
attain to him? I doubt it. May he but live till
the lofty problem of his spirit be fully solved; let
him but reach his highest aim, and he will put
into our hands the key to a glorious knowledge
which shall bring us a stage nearer to true blessedness....
He said himself, "I have no friend,
I must live alone; but I know that in my heart
God is nearer to me than to others. I approach
him without fear, I have always known him.
Neither am I anxious about my music, which no
adverse fate can overtake, and which <em>will free him
who understands it from the misery which afflicts
others</em>".'</p>

<p>"These are wonderful words which are put into
Beethoven's mouth. Though their authenticity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
has been doubted, it is difficult, almost impossible,
to suppose that the 'child' or any one else invented
them. On the other hand, they agree
strangely with those authentic words of his already
quoted, 'Every day I come nearer to the object
which I can feel though I cannot describe it.'</p>

<p>"Beethoven is the prophet of the new era which
the nineteenth century ushers in for mankind. As
things must be <em>felt</em> before they can be acted out;
so they may be expressed in the indefinite emotional
forms of music, before they can be uttered
and definitely imaged forth in words or pictorial
shapes. Beethoven is the forerunner of Shelley
and Whitman among the poets, of J. W. Turner
and J. F. Millet among the painters. He is the
great poet who holds Nature by the one hand and
Man by the other. Within that low-statured,
rudely-outlined figure which a century ago walked
hatless through the fields near Mödling or sat
oblivious in some shabby restaurant at Vienna,
dwelt an emotional giant&mdash;a being who&mdash;though
his outer life by deafness, disease, business-worries,
poverty, was shattered as it were into a thousand
squalid fragments&mdash;in his great heart embraced all
mankind, with piercing insight penetrated intellectually
through all falsehoods to the truth, and
already in his art-work gave outline to the religious,
the human, the democratic yearnings, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
loves, the comradeship, the daring individualities,
and all the heights and depths of feeling of a new
dawning era of society. He was in fact, and he
gave utterance to, a new type of Man. What that
struggle must have been between his inner and
outer conditions&mdash;of his real self with the lonely
and mean surroundings in which it was embodied&mdash;we
only know through his music. When we
listen to it we can understand the world-old tradition
that now and then a divine creature from far
heavens takes mortal form and suffers in order that
it may embrace and redeem mankind."&mdash;<em>Ibid</em>, pp.
205-7.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">HIS LIFE</h2>

<p>He was short and thick set, broad shouldered and
of athletic build. A big face, ruddy in complexion&mdash;except
towards the end of his life, when his
colour became sickly and yellow, especially in the
winter after he had been remaining indoors far from
the fields. He had a massive and rugged forehead,
extremely black and extraordinarily thick hair
through which it seemed the comb had never
passed, for it was always very rumpled, veritable
bristling "serpents of Medusa."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His eyes shone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
with prodigious force. It was one of the chief
things one noticed on first encountering him, but
many were mistaken in their colour. When they
shone out in dark splendour from a sad and tragic
visage, they generally appeared black; but they
were really a bluish grey.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Small and very deep-set,
they flashed fiercely in moments of passion or
warmth, and dilated in a peculiar way under the
influence of inspiration, reflecting his thoughts with
a marvellous exactness.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Often they inclined upwards
with a melancholy expression. His nose
was short and broad with the nostrils of a lion; the
mouth refined, with the lower lip somewhat prominent.
He had very strong jaws, which would
easily break nuts, a large indentation in his chin
imparted a curious irregularity to the face. "He
had a charming smile," said Moscheles, "and in
conversation a manner often lovable and inviting
confidence; on the other hand his laugh was most
disagreeable, loud, discordant and strident"&mdash;the
laugh of a man unused to happiness. His usual
expression was one of melancholy. Rellstab in
1825 said that he had to summon up all his courage
to prevent himself from breaking into tears when
he looked into Beethoven's "tender eyes with their
speaking sadness." Braun von Braunthal met
him in an inn a year later. Beethoven was sitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
in a corner with closed eyes, smoking a long pipe&mdash;a
habit which grew on him more and more as he
approached death. A friend spoke to him. He
smiled sadly, drew from his pocket a little note-tablet,
and in a thin voice which frequently
sounded cracked notes, asked him to write down
his request. His face would frequently become
suddenly transfigured, maybe in the access of
sudden inspiration which seized him at random,
even in the street, filling the passers-by with
amazement, or it might be when great thoughts
came to him suddenly, when seated at the piano.
"The muscles of his face would stand out, his
veins would swell; his wild eyes would become
doubly terrible. His lips trembled, he had the
manner of a wizard controlling the demons which
he had invoked." "... A Shakespearean
visage&mdash;'King Lear<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>'"&mdash;so Sir Julius Benedict
described it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ludwig van Beethoven was born on December
16th, 1770, in a little bare attic of a humble
dwelling at Bonn, a small University town on the
Rhine near Cologne. He came of Flemish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
origin.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> His father was an illiterate and lazy
tenor singer&mdash;a "good-for-nothing fellow" and a
confirmed drunkard. His mother was the daughter
of a cook. She had been a maidservant and
by her first marriage was the widow of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de
chambre</i>.</p>

<p>Unlike the more fortunate Mozart, Beethoven
spent an unhappy childhood devoid of domestic
comfort. From his earliest years life was for him a
sad, even a brutal, fight for existence. His father
wished to exploit the boy's musical talents and to
turn him to lucrative purposes as a prodigy. At
the age of four he compelled the boy to practise on
the harpsichord for hours together and he shut him
up alone with the violin, forcing him to work in
this way. It is astonishing that the boy was not
completely disgusted with music, for the father
persisted in this treatment for many years, often
resorting to actual violence. Beethoven's youth
was saddened by the care and anxiety of earning
his daily bread by tasks far too burdensome for
his age. When he was eleven years old he was
placed in the theatre orchestra; at thirteen he became
an organist of the chapel. In 1787 he lost
his mother whom he adored. "She was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
good to me, so worthy of love, the best friend I
had! How happy was I when I could utter that
dear name of mother and she could hear it!"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
She died of consumption and Beethoven believed
himself to be affected with the same complaint.
Already he suffered continually, and a depression
of spirits even more terrible than the physical pain
hung over him always.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> When he was seventeen
he was practically the head of the family and responsible
for the education of his two younger
brothers. He suffered the humiliation of being
obliged to beg for a pension for his father, that
his father's pension should be paid to himself, as
the father only squandered it in drink. These
sad experiences made a profound impression on
the youth. However, he found great affection
and sympathy from a family in Bonn who always
remained very dear to him&mdash;the Breuning family.
The gentle "Lorchen," Eleonore von Breuning,
was two years younger than Beethoven. He
taught her music and she initiated him into the
charms of poetry. She was the companion of his
youth and there may have been between them a
still more tender sentiment. Later on Eleonore
married Dr. Wegeler, one of Beethoven's best
friends; and up to Beethoven's last day there existed
between the three a deep, steady friendship,
amply proven by the regular and loving epistles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Wegeler and Eleonore, and those of their old
faithful friend (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">alter treuer Freund</i>) to the dear
good Wegeler (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">guter lieber Wegeler</i>). These
friendly bonds became all the more touching as
old age crept on all three, and still their hearts
remained warm.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Beethoven also found a safe
guide and good friend in Christian Gottlob Neefe,
his music master, whose high moral character
had no less influence on the young musician
than did his broad and his intelligent, artistic
views.</p>

<p>Sad as was the childhood of Beethoven, he
always treasured a tender and melancholy memory
of the places where it was spent. Though compelled
to leave Bonn, and destined to spend nearly
the whole of his life in the frivolous city of Vienna
with its dull environs, he never forgot the beautiful
Rhine valley and the majestic river. "<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unser
Vater Rhine</i>" (our father Rhine) as he called it,
was to him almost human in its sympathy, being
like some gigantic soul whose deep thoughts
are beyond all human reckoning. No part
is more beautiful, more powerful, more calm,
than that part where the river caresses the shady
and flowered slopes of the old University city of
Bonn. There Beethoven spent the first twenty
years of his life. There the dreams of his waking
heart were born&mdash;in the fields, which slope
languishingly down to the water side, with their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
mist-capped poplars, their bushes and their willows
and the fruit trees whose roots are steeped
in the rapid silent stream. And all along lying
gently on the banks, strangely soft, are towns,
churches, and even cemeteries, whilst away on the
horizon the blue tints of the Seven Mountains
show in wild jagged edges against the sky, forming
a striking background to the graceful, slender,
dream-like silhouettes of old ruined castles. His
heart remained ever faithful to the beautiful,
natural surroundings of his childhood, and until
his very last moment he dreamt of seeing these
scenes once again. "My native land, the beautiful
country where I first saw the light of day; it is
always as clear and as beautiful in my eyes as
when I left it."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> He never saw it again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In November, 1792, Beethoven removed to
Vienna, the musical metropolis of Germany.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
The Revolution had broken out. It threatened
to spread over the whole of Europe. Beethoven
left Bonn just at the moment when the war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
reached it. On his way to Vienna he passed the
Hessian armies marching to France. In 1796
and 1797 he set the war poems of Friedberg to
music: a Song of Farewell, and a patriotic chorus;
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein grosses deutsches Volk sind wir</i> (A great
German people are we). But it was in vain that
he sang of the enemies of the Revolution; the
Revolution overcame the world&mdash;and Beethoven
with it. From 1798, in spite of the strained relations
between Austria and France, Beethoven
became closely connected with the French, with
the Embassy and General Bernadotte, who had
just arrived in Vienna. In this intercourse strong
republican sympathies showed themselves in Beethoven,
and these feelings became stronger and
stronger with time.</p>

<p>A sketch which Steinhauser made of him at this
time gives a good idea of his general appearance
at this period. This portrait of Beethoven is to
later ones what Guérin's portrait of Napoleon is
to the other effigies. Guérin's face is rugged,
almost savage, and wasted with ambition.
Beethoven looks very young for his age, thin and
straight, very stiff in his high cravat, a defiant,
strained look in his eyes; he knows his own worth
and is confident of his power. In 1796 he wrote in
his notebook, "Courage! in spite of all my
bodily weakness my genius shall yet triumph....
Twenty-five years! that is my age now.... This
very year the man I am, must reveal himself entirely."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Both Madame von Bernhard and Gelinck
say that he was extremely proud with rough
and clumsy ways and spoke with a strong
provincial accent. Only his intimate friends
knew what exquisite talent lay hidden under this
rough exterior. Writing to Wegeler about his successes,
the first thought that springs to his mind
is the following: "for example, I meet a friend
in need; if my purse does not allow me to help
him at once, I have only to go to my work table,
and in a short time I have removed his trouble....
See how charming it is to do this."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> And a little
further on, he says: "My art shall be devoted to
no other object than the relief of the poor" (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dann
soll meine Kunst sich nur zum Besten der Armen
zeigen</i>).</p>

<p>Trouble was already knocking at the door; it
entered&mdash;never more to leave him. Between 1796
and 1800, deafness began its sad work. He suffered
from continual singing and humming in his
ears.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> His hearing became gradually weaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>For several years he kept the secret to himself,
even from his dearest friends. He avoided company,
so that his infliction should not be noticed.
But in 1801 he can no longer remain silent; and
in his despair he confides in two of his friends,
Dr. Wegeler and Pastor Amenda. "My dear,
good, loving Amenda, how often have I longed to
have you near me! Your Beethoven is very unhappy.
You must know that the best part of
me, my hearing, has become very weak. Even at
the time when we were together I was aware of
distressing symptoms which I kept to myself; but
my condition is now much worse.... Can I ever
be cured? Naturally I hope so; but my hopes
are very faint, for such maladies are the least
hopeful of all. How sad my life is! For I am
obliged to avoid all those I love and all that are
dear to me; and all this in a world so miserable
and so selfish!... How sad is this resignation
in which I take refuge! Of course I have steeled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
myself to rise above all these misfortunes. But
how is this going to be possible?<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>..." And to
Wegeler: "... I lead a miserable life indeed.
For the last two years I have completely avoided
all society, for I cannot talk with my fellow-men.
I am deaf. Had my profession been any other,
things might still be bearable; but as it is, my
situation is terrible. What will my enemies say?
And they are not few!... At the theatre I
always have to be quite near the orchestra in
order to understand the actor. I cannot hear the
high notes of the instruments or the voices, if I am
but a little distance off.... When anyone speaks
quietly I only hear with difficulty, ... On the
other hand, I find it unbearable when people shout
to me.... Often I have cursed my very
existence. Plutarch has guided me to a spirit
of resignation. If it be possible at all, I will
courageously bear with my fate; but there are
moments in my life when I feel the most miserable
of all God's creatures.... Resignation! What
a sorry refuge! And yet it is the only one left to
me!"</p>

<p>This tragic sadness is expressed in some of the
works of this period, in the <em>Sonate pathétique</em> Op.
13 (1799), and especially in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Largo</i> of the Piano
Sonata in D, Opus 10, No. 3 (1798). It is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
marvel that we do not find it in all the works;
the radiant Septet (1800), the limpid First Symphony
(C Major, 1800), both breathe a spirit of
youthful gaiety. There is no doubt that he is
determined to accustom his soul to grief. The
spirit of man has such a strong desire for happiness
that when it has it not, it is forced to create
it. When the present has become too painful, the
soul lives on the past. Happy days are not effaced
at one stroke. Their radiance persists long
after they have gone. Alone and unhappy in
Vienna, Beethoven took refuge in the remembrances
of his native land; his thoughts were
always of Bonn. The theme of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> for
the Variation in the <em>Septet</em> is a Rhenish Song.
The Symphony in C Major is also inspired by
the Rhine. It is a poem of youth smiling over its
own dreams. It is gay and languorous; one feels
there the hope and the desire of pleasing. But in
certain passages in the Introduction, in the shading
of the sombre bass passages of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i>, in
this young composer, in the fantastic <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i>, one
feels with emotion the promise of the great genius
to come. The expression calls to mind the
eyes of Botticelli's <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bambino</i> in his <em>Holy Families</em>&mdash;those
eyes of a little child in which one already
divines the approaching tragedy.</p>

<p>Troubles of another kind were soon to be added
to his physical sufferings. Wegeler says that he
never knew Beethoven to be free of a love passion
carried to extremes. These love affairs seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to have always been of the purest kind. With
him there was no connection between passion and
pleasure. The confusion established between the
two things now-a-days only shows how little most
men know of passion and its extreme rarity.
Beethoven had something of the Puritan in his
nature; licentious conversation and thoughts were
abhorrent to him; he had always unchangeable
ideas on the sanctity of love.... It is said that
he could not forgive Mozart for having prostituted
his genius by writing <em>Don Giovanni</em>. Schindler,
who was his intimate friend, assures us that "he
spent his life in virginal modesty without ever
having to reproach himself for any weakness."
Such a man was destined to be the dupe and
victim of love; and so indeed it came about. He
was always falling violently in love and ceaselessly
dreaming of its happiness, only however to be
deceived and to be plunged in the deepest suffering.
In these alternating states of love and
passionate grief, of youthful confidence and outraged
pride, we find the most fruitful source of
Beethoven's inspiration, until at length his fiery,
passionate nature gradually calms down into
melancholy resignation.</p>

<p>In 1801 the object of his passion appears to have
been Giulietta Guicciardi, whom he immortalised
in the dedication of the famous (so-called) "Moonlight"
Sonata, Opus 27 (1802). "I now see
things in a better light," he writes to Wegeler,
"and associate more with my kind.... This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
change has been brought about by the charm of a
dear girl; she loves me and I love her. These
are the first happy moments I have had for two
years."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He paid dearly for them. From the
first, this love made him feel more keenly the
misery of the infirmity which had overtaken him
and the precarious conditions of his life which
made it impossible for him to marry the one he
loved. Moreover, Giulietta was a flirt, childish
and selfish by nature; she made Beethoven suffer
most cruelly, and in November 1803, she married
Count Gallenberg.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Such passions devastate the
soul; indeed, when the spirit is already enfeebled
by illness, as was Beethoven's, complete disaster
is risked. This was the only time in Beethoven's
life when he seems to have been on the point of
succumbing. He passed the terrible crisis, however,
and the details are given in a letter known
as the <em>Heiligenstadt Testament</em> to his brothers
Carl and Johann, with the following direction:
"To be read and carried out after my
death."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It is an outcry of revolt, full of the
most poignant grief. One cannot hear it without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
being cut to the heart. In that dark hour he was
on the verge of suicide. Only his strong moral
force saved him.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> His final hopes of recovering
his health disappeared. "Even the lofty courage
which has hitherto sustained me has now disappeared.
O Providence, grant that but a single
day of real happiness may be mine once again.
I have been a stranger to the thrill of joy for so
long. When, O God, when shall I feel joy once
more?... Ever again? No, that would be too
cruel!"</p>

<p>This is indeed a cry of a torn heart, and
Beethoven was destined to live yet twenty-five
years longer. His powerful nature would not
refuse to sink beneath the weight of his woe.
"My physical strength improves always with the
growth of my intellectual force.... Yes, I
really feel that my youth is only just beginning.
Each day brings me nearer to my goal, which I
can feel without being able to define clearly....
O, if I were only free from my deafness I would
embrace the world!... No rest! At least,
none that I know of except sleep; and I am so
unhappy that I have to give more time to it than
formerly. If only I could be free of a part of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
infirmity; and then ... no, I can bear it no
longer. I will wage war against destiny. It
shall not overcome me completely. Oh, how fine
it would be to live a thousand lives in one!"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>This love of his, this suffering, this resignation,
these alternations of dejection and pride, these
"soul-tragedies" are all reflected in the great
compositions written in 1802&mdash;the Sonata with
the Funeral March, Opus 26; the <em>Sonata quasi
una Fantasia</em>, Opus 27, No. 1; the Sonata called
the "Moonlight," Opus 27; the Sonata in
D Minor, Opus 31, No. 2, with its dramatic recitatives
which seem like some grand yet heart-broken
monologue; the Sonata in C minor for Violin,
Opus 30, dedicated to the Emperor Alexander;
the Kreutzer Sonata, Opus 47; and the Six Religious
Songs, heroic yet grief-laden, to the words
of Gellert, Opus 48. The Second Symphony
written in 1803 reflects rather his youthful love;
and here one feels that his will is decidedly gaining
the upper hand. An irresistible force sweeps
away his sad thoughts, a veritable bubbling over
of life shows itself in the finale. Beethoven was
determined to be happy. He was not willing to
believe his misfortune hopeless, he wanted health,
he wanted love, and he threw aside despair.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>In many of his works one is struck by the
powerful and energetic march rhythms, full of the
fighting spirit. This is especially noticeable in
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i> and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> of Second Symphony,
and still more in the first movement, full of superb
heroism, of the Violin Sonata dedicated to the Emperor
Alexander. The war-like character of this
music recalls the period in which it was written.
The Revolution had reached Vienna. Beethoven
was completely carried away by it. "He spoke freely
amongst his intimate friends," said the Chevalier
de Seyfried, "on political affairs, which he estimated
with unusual intelligence, with a clear and
well-balanced out-look. All his sympathies
leaned towards revolutionary ideas." He liked
the Republican principles. Schindler, the friend
who knew him best during the last period of his
life, said, "He was an upholder of unlimited
liberty and of national independence ...
he desired that everyone should take part in the
government of the State.... For France he desired
universal suffrage and hoped that Bonaparte
would establish it, thus laying down the proper
basis of human happiness." A Roman of the
revolutionary type, brought up on Plutarch, he
dreamt of a triumphant Republic, founded by the
god of victory, the first Consul. And blow by
blow he forged the Eroica Symphony, Bonaparte,
1804,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> the <em>Iliad</em> of Empire, and the Finale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of the Symphony in C minor, 1805 to 1808, the
grand epic of glory. This is really the first music
breathing the revolutionary feeling. The soul of
the times lives again in it with the intensity and
purity which great events have for those mighty
and solitary souls who live apart and whose impressions
are not contaminated by contact with
the reality. Beethoven's spirit reveals itself,
marked with stirring events, coloured by the reflections
of these great wars. Evidences of this,
(perhaps unconscious to him) crop up everywhere
in the works of this period, in the <em>Coriolanus</em>
Overture (1807), where tempests roar over the
scene; in the Fourth Quartet, Opus 18, the first
movement of which shows a close relation to this
Overture; in the <em>Sonata Appassionata</em>, Op. 57
(1804), of which Bismarck said, "If I heard that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
often I should always be very valiant";<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> in the
score of <em>Egmont</em>; and even in his Pianoforte Concertos,
in the one in E flat, Opus 73 (1809), where
even the virtuosity is heroic: whole armies of
warriors pass by. Nor need we be astonished at
this. Though when writing the Funeral March
on the death of an hero (Sonata, Opus 26), Beethoven
was ignorant that the hero most worthy of
his music, namely Hoche, the one who approximated
more closely than Bonaparte to the model
of the <em>Eroica Symphony</em>, had just died near the
Rhine, where indeed his tomb stands at the top
of a small hill between Coblentz and Bonn....
He had twice seen the Revolution victorious in
Vienna itself. French officers were present at the
first production of <em>Fidelio</em> in Vienna in November,
1805. It was General Hulin, the conqueror of the
Bastille, who stayed with Lobkovitz, Beethoven's
friend and protector, to whom he dedicated the
Eroica and the C minor Symphony. And on
10 May, 1809, Napoleon slept at Schönbrunn.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Beethoven suddenly broke off the C minor Symphony
to write the Fourth Symphony at a single
sitting without his usual sketches. Happiness
had come to him. In May 1806, he was betrothed
to Theresa von Brunswick.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> She had
loved him for a long time&mdash;ever since as a young
girl she had taken piano lessons from him during
his first stay in Vienna. Beethoven was a friend
of her brother Count Franz. In 1806 he stayed
with them at Martonvasar in Hungary, and it was
there that they fell in love. The remembrance of
these happy days is kept fresh by some stories in
some of Theresa's writings.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> "One Sunday evening"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
she says, "after dinner, with the moon
shining into the room, Beethoven was seated at the
piano. At first he laid his hands flat on the keyboard.
Franz and I always understood this, for it
was his usual preparation. Then he struck some
chords in the bass and slowly with an air of solemnity
and mystery drifted into a song of John
Sebastian Bach: '<em>If thou wilt give me thy heart,
first let it be in secret, that our hearts may commingle
and no one divine it</em>.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> My mother and the
priest had fallen asleep and my brother was dream
gazing whilst I who understood his song and his
expression, felt life come to me in all its fullness.
The following morning we met in the park and he
said to me, 'I am now writing an opera; the principal
character is in me and around me wherever I
go. Never before have I reached such heights of
happiness; I feel light, purity and splendour all
around me and within. Until now I have been
like the child in the fairy story, picking up pebbles
along the road without seeing the beautiful flower
blossoming close by.'... It was in May, 1806,
that I became betrothed to him with the ready
consent of my dear brother Franz."</p>

<p>The <em>Fourth Symphony</em> composed in this year
is a pure fragrant flower which treasures up the
perfume of these days, the calmest in all his life.
It has been justly remarked that at this time
"Beethoven's desire was to reconcile his genius as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
far as possible with what was generally known
and admired in the forms handed down by his
predecessors.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>"</p>

<p>The same conciliating spirit springing from
this love re-acted on his manners and his way of
living in general. Ignaz von Seyfried and Grillparzar
say that he was full of life, bright, happy
and witty, courteous in society, patient with
tedious people and careful in his dress. Even his
deafness was not noticed, and they say that he
was in good health with the exception of his
eyesight, which was rather weak.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
This strikes one in looking at Mahler's portrait of him
painted at this time, in which he is represented
with an elegance unusual for him and a romantic,
even slightly affected look. Beethoven wishes
to please, and rather fancies himself in doing so.
The lion is in love; he draws in his claws. But
one feels deep beneath under all this playfulness,
the imagination and tenderness of the Symphony
in B flat, the tremendous force, the capricious
humour and the passionate temper of his nature.</p>

<p>This profound peace was not destined to last
although love exercised its soothing influence until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
1810. Beethoven doubtless owed to it the self-mastery
which at this period enabled him to produce
some of the most perfect fruits of his genius;
that great classical tragedy, the Symphony in C
minor and that delicious idyll of a summer's day:
the Pastoral Symphony, 1808.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The Sonata
Appassionata, inspired by Shakespeare's <em>Tempest</em>,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
the Sonata which he himself regarded as
his most powerful one, appeared in 1807 and was
dedicated to Theresa's brother. To Theresa herself
he dedicated the dreamy and fantastic Sonata in
F sharp, Opus 78 (1809). An undated letter<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> addressed
to his "Immortal Beloved" expresses the
intensity of his love no less strongly than does
the <em>Sonata Appassionata</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em; "> July (1801).</p>

<p>"My Angel, my all, my very self.</p>

<p>Just a few words to-day&mdash;and indeed
in pencil (with thine). Only till to-morrow is
my room definitely engaged. What an unworthy
waste of time in such matters! Why
this deep sorrow where necessity speaks? Can
our love endure otherwise than through sacrifices,
through restraint in longing? Canst
thou help not being wholly mine? Can I, not
being wholly thine? Oh! gaze at nature in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
its beauty, and calmly accept the inevitable&mdash;love
demands everything, and rightly so. Thus
is it for me with thee, for thee with me, only
thou so easily forgettest that I must live for myself
and for thee. Were we wholly united, thou
wouldst feel this painful fact as little as I should.
My journey was terrible. I arrived here only
yesterday morning at four o'clock, and as they
were short of horses, the mail-coach selected
another route; but what an awful road! At
the last stage but one, I was advised not to
travel by night; they warned me against the
wood, but that only spurred me on, and I was
wrong; the coach must needs break down, the
road being dreadful, a swamp, a mere country
road; without the postillions I had with me I
should have stuck on the way. Esterhazi, by
the ordinary road, met the same fate with eight
horses as I with four&mdash;yet it gave me some
pleasure, as successfully overcoming any difficulty
always does. Now for a quick change
from without to within; we shall probably soon
see each other; besides, to-day I cannot tell thee
what has been passing through my mind during
the past few days concerning my life. Were
our hearts closely united I should not do things
of this kind. My heart is full of the many
things I have to say to thee. Ah! there are
moments in which I feel that speech is powerless.
Cheer up. Remain my true, my only
treasure, my all!!! As I to thee. The gods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
must send the rest; what is in store for us must
be and ought to be.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60%; "> Thy faithful</p>
<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em; "><span class="smcap">Ludwig</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is difficult to divine what was the barrier
which separated these two from the consummation
of their love. Was it the lack of fortune or the
difference in social position? Perhaps Beethoven
rebelled against the long period of probation
which was imposed on him or resented the humiliation
of keeping his love secret for an indefinite
period. Perhaps, impulsive and afflicted as he
was, a misanthrope too, he caused his loved one
to suffer without wishing it and gave himself up
to despair in consequence. The fact remains that
the engagement was broken off, although neither
seems ever to have proved faithless.</p>

<p>Even to her last day (she lived till 1861) Theresa
von Brunswick loved Beethoven, and Beethoven
was no less faithful. In 1816 he remarked,
"When I think of her my heart beats as violently
as on the day when I first saw her." To this year
belong the six songs, Opus 98, which have so
touching and profound a feeling. They are dedicated
"To the loved one far away" (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">An die ferne
Geliebte</i>). He wrote in his notes, "My heart
overflows at the thought of her beautiful nature;
and yet she is not here, not near me!" Theresa
had given her portrait to Beethoven, inscribed,
"To the rare genius, the great artist, the generous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
man. T.B."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Once during the last year of his
life a friend surprised Beethoven alone, and found
him holding this portrait and speaking to himself
through his tears: "Thou wert so lovely and
great, so like to an angel!" The friend withdrew,
and returning a little later found him at the
piano, and said "To-day, my old friend, there are
no black looks on your face." Beethoven replied
"It is because my good angel has visited
me." The wound was deep. "Poor Beethoven"
he said to himself, "there is no happiness for you
in this world; only in the realms of the ideal will
you find strength to conquer yourself."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>In his notebook he wrote, "submission, complete
submission to your destiny. You can no
longer live for yourself, only for others. For you
there is happiness only in your art. O God,
give me strength to conquer "myself"."...</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Love then abandoned him. In 1810 he was
once more alone; but joy had come to him and
the consciousness of his power. He was in the
prime of life. He gave himself up to his violent
and wild moods regardless of results, and certainly
without care for the opinions of the world and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
usual conventions of life. What, indeed, had he
to fear or to be careful of? Gone are love and
ambition. Strength and the joy of it, the necessity
for using it, almost abusing it, were left to him.
"Power constitutes the morality of men who distinguish
themselves above the ordinary." He
returned to his neglect in matters of dress, and his
manners now became even freer than before. He
knew that he had the right to speak freely even to
the greatest. "I recognise no sign of superiority
in mankind other than goodness," he writes on 17
July, 1812.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Bettina Brentano, who saw him at that
time, says that "no king or emperor was ever so
conscious of his power." She was fascinated by
his very strength. "When I saw him for the
first time," she wrote to Goethe, "the whole exterior
world vanished from me. Beethoven made
me forget the world, and even you, O Goethe....
I do not think I am wrong in saying this man is
very far ahead of modern civilisation." Goethe
attempted to make Beethoven's acquaintance.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
They met at a Bohemian spa, Töplitz, in 1812, but
did not agree well. Beethoven passionately admired
Goethe's genius; but his own character
was too free and too wild not to wound the susceptibilities
of Goethe. Beethoven himself has
told us of this walk which they took together, in
the course of which the haughty republican gave
the courtly councillor of the Grand-duke of
Weimar a lesson in dignity which he never forgot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Kings and princes can easily make professors
and privy councillors; they can bestow titles
and decorations, but they cannot make great
men, or minds which rise above the base turmoil
of this world ... and when two men are
together such as Goethe and myself these fine
gentlemen must be made conscious of the difference
between ourselves and them. Yesterday,
as we were returning home on foot, we met the
whole of the Imperial family. We saw them
approaching from a distance. Goethe let go
my arm to take his stand by the road side with
the crowd. It was in vain that I talked to him.
Say what I would I could not get him to move
a single step. I drew my hat down upon my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
head, buttoned up my overcoat, and forced my
way through the throng. Princes and courtiers
stood aside. Duke Rudolph raised his hat to
me, the Empress bowing to me first. The great
of the earth know me and recognise me. I
amused myself in watching the procession pass
by Goethe. He remained on the road side
bowing low, hat in hand. I took him to task for
it pretty severely and did not spare him at all."
<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nor did Goethe forget the scene.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>In 1812 the Seventh and Eighth Symphonies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
were written during a stay of several months at
Töplitz. These works are veritable orgies of
rhythm and humour; in them he is perhaps revealing
himself in his most natural and as he
styled it himself, most "unbuttoned" (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">aufgeknöpft</i>)
moods, transports of gaiety contrasting
unexpectedly with storms of fury and disconcerting
flashes of wit followed by those Titanic
explosions which terrified both Goethe and Zelter<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
and caused the remark in North Germany that the
<em>Symphony in A</em> was the work of a drunkard. The
work of an inebriated man indeed it was, but one
intoxicated with power and genius; one who said
of himself, "I am the Bacchus who crushes delicious
nectar for mankind. It is I who give the
divine frenzy to men." Wagner wrote, "I do
not know whether Beethoven wished to depict a
Dionysian orgy<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> in the Finale of his Symphony,
though I recognise in this passionate <em>kermesse</em> a
sign of his Flemish origin, just as we see it likewise
in his bold manner of speech and in his
bearing so free and so utterly out of harmony with
a country ruled by an iron discipline and rigid
etiquette. Nowhere is there greater frankness or
freer power than in the <em>Symphony in A</em>. It is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
mad outburst of superhuman energy, with no other
object than for the pleasure of unloosing it like a
river overflowing its banks and flooding the surrounding
country. In the Eighth Symphony the
power is not so sublime, though it is still more
strange and characteristic of the man, mingling
tragedy with farce and a Herculean vigour with
the games and caprices of a child."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The year 1814 marks the summit of Beethoven's
fortunes. At the Vienna Congress he enjoyed
European fame. He took an active part in the
fêtes, princes rendered him homage, and (as he
afterwards boasted to Schindler) he allowed himself
to be courted by them. He was carried away
by his sympathy with the War of Independence.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
In 1813 he wrote a Symphony on <em>Wellington's
Victory</em> and in the beginning of 1814 a martial
chorus, <em>Germany's Rebirth</em> (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Germanias Wiedergeburt</i>).
On November 29th, 1814, he conducted
before an audience of kings a patriotic Cantata,
<em>The Glorious Moment</em> (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der glorreiche Augenblick</i>),
and on the occasion of the capture of Paris
in 1815 he composed a Chorus, <em>It is accomplished</em>
(<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Es ist vollbracht</i>). These occasional pieces did
more to spread his fame than all the rest of his
music together. The engraving by Blasius Hofel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
from a sketch by the Frenchman Latronne and the
savage-looking cast by Franz Klein in 1812 present
a life-like image of Beethoven at the time of
the Congress of Vienna. The dominating characteristic
of this leonine face with its firm set jaws
scored with the furrows of anger and trouble, is
determination&mdash;a Napoleonic will. One recognises
the man who said of Napoleon after Jena,
"How unfortunate that I do not know as much
about warfare as music! I would show myself
his master." But his kingdom was not of this
world. "My empire is in the air," he wrote to
Franz von Brunswick.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After this hour of glory comes the saddest and
most miserable period. Vienna had never been
sympathetic to Beethoven. Haughty and bold
genius as he was, he could not be at ease in this
frivolous city with its mundane and its mediocre
spirit, which Wagner laughed to scorn later on.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
He lost no opportunities of going away; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
towards 1808 he thought seriously of leaving
Austria to go to the court of Jerome Bonaparte,
King of Westphalia.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> But Vienna had abundant
musical resources; and one must do it justice by
saying that there were always noble <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">dilettanti</i> who
felt the grandeur of Beethoven, and who spared
their country the shame of losing him. In 1809,
three of the richest noblemen of Vienna, the Archduke
Rudolph, a pupil of Beethoven, Prince
Lobkovitz and Prince Kinsky undertook to pay
him annually a pension of 4,000 florins on the sole
condition that he remained in Austria. "As it is
evident," they said, "that a man can only devote
himself entirely to art when he is free from all
material care, and that it is only then that he can
produce such sublime works which are the glory of
art, the undersigned have formed a resolution to
release Ludwig van Beethoven from the shadow of
need, and thus disperse the miserable obstacles
which are so detrimental to his flights of genius."
Unhappily the results did not come up to the
promises. The pension was always very irregularly
paid; soon it ceased altogether. Also Vienna
had very much changed in character after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Congress of 1814. Society was distracted from
art by politics. Musical taste was spoilt by
Italianism, and the fashionable people favoured
Rossini, treating Beethoven as pedantic.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Beethoven's friends and protectors went away or
died: Prince Kinsky in 1812, Lichnovsky in 1814,
Lobkovitz in 1816. Rasumowsky, for whom he
had written the three admirable Quartets, Opus
59, gave his last concert in February, 1815. In
1815 Beethoven quarrelled with Stephen von
Breuning, the friend of his childhood, the brother
of Eleonore.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> From this time he was alone.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> "I
have no friends. I am alone in the world" he
wrote in his notebook of 1816.</p>

<p>His deafness became complete.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> After the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
autumn of 1815 he could only communicate with
his friends by writing.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The oldest conversation-book
is dated 1816.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> There is a sad story recorded
by Schindler with regard to the representation of
<em>Fidelio</em> in 1822. "Beethoven wanted to conduct
the general rehearsal.... From the duet of the
First Act, it was evident that he could hear nothing
of what was going on. He kept back the
pace considerably; and whilst the orchestra followed
his beat, the singer hurried the time. There
followed general confusion. The usual leader of
the orchestra, Umlauf, suggested a short rest,
without giving any reason; and after exchanging
a few words with the singers, they began again.
The same disorder broke out afresh. Another
interval was necessary. The impossibility of continuing
under Beethoven's direction was evident;
but how could they make him understand? No
one had the heart to say to him, 'Go away, poor
unfortunate one, you cannot conduct.' Beethoven,
uneasy and agitated, turned from side to side,
trying to read the expression of the different faces,
and to understand what the difficulty was: a
silence came over all. Suddenly he called me in
his imperious manner. When I was quite near to
him, he handed me his pocket-book, and made
signs to me to write. I put down these words:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
'I beg you not to continue; I will explain why at
your house.' With one leap he jumped from the
platform, saying to me, 'Let us go quickly.' He
ran straight to his house, went in and threw himself
down on a sofa, covering his face with his
hands; he remained like that until dinner-time.
At the table it was impossible to draw a word
from him; he wore an expression of complete despondency
and profound grief. After dinner
when I wanted to leave him, he kept me, expressing
a desire not to be left alone. When we
separated he asked me to go with him to his
doctor, who had a great reputation for complaints
of the ear. During the whole of my connection
with Beethoven I do not know of any day which
can compare with this awful day of November.
He had been smitten to the heart, and until the
day of his death, he retained the impression of this
terrible scene."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Two years later, on 7 May, 1824, when conducting
the <em>Choral Symphony</em> (or rather, as the programme
said, "taking part in the direction of the
concert") he heard nothing at all of the clamour
of the audience applauding him. He did not
even suspect it, until one of the singers, taking
him by the hand turned him round; and he suddenly
saw the audience waving their hats and
clapping their hands. An English traveller,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Russell, who saw him at the piano about the year
1825, says that when he wanted to play quietly the
notes did not sound and that it was very moving
to follow in silence the emotion animating him
expressed in his face, and in the movements of his
fingers. Buried in himself,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and separated from
all mankind, his only consolation was in Nature.
"She was his sole confident," says Theresa of
Brunswick, "she was his refuge." Charles Neate,
who knew him in 1815, says that he never saw
anyone who loved flowers, clouds and nature so
devotedly<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>; he seemed to live in them. "No one
on earth can love the country so much as I,"
wrote Beethoven. "I love a tree more than a
man." When in Vienna he walked round the
ramparts every day. In the country from daybreak
till night he walked alone, without hat, in
sunshine or rain. "Almighty God! In the
woods I am happy, happy in the woods, where
each tree speaks through Thee. O God, what
splendour! In the forests, on the hills, it is the
calm, the quiet, that helps me."</p>

<p>His unrestfulness of mind found some respite
there.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> He was harassed by financial cares. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
wrote in 1818, "I am almost reduced to beggary,
and I am obliged to pretend that I do not lack
necessities"; and at another time, "The <em>Sonata
Op. 106</em> has been written under pressing circumstances.
It is a hard thing to have to work for
bread." Spohr says that often he could not go
out on account of his worn-out shoes. He owed
large debts to his publishers and his compositions
did not bring him in anything. The <em>Mass in D</em>,
published by subscription, obtained only seven
subscribers (of whom not one was a musician).<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
He received barely thirty or forty ducats for his
fine Sonatas, each one of which cost him three
months' work. The Quartets, <em>Opp.</em> 127, 130, and
132, amongst his profoundest works, which seem
to be written with his very heart-blood, were
written for Prince Galitzin, who neglected to pay
for them. Beethoven was worn out with domestic
difficulties, and with endless law suits to obtain
the pensions owing to him or to retain the
guardianship of a nephew, the son of his brother
Carl, who died of consumption in 1815.</p>

<p>He had bestowed on this child all the care and
devotion with which his heart overflowed. But he
was repaid with cruel suffering. It seemed that a
kind of special fate had taken care to renew ceaselessly
and to accumulate his miseries in order that
his genius should not lack for food. At first he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
had a dispute over Carl with his mother, who
wanted to take him away. "O, my God," he
cried, "my shield and my defence, my only refuge!
Thou readest the depths of my soul and
Thou knowest the griefs that I experience when
I have to cause suffering to those who want to
dispute my Carl, my treasure.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Hearken unto
me, Great Being, that I know not how to name.
Grant the fervent prayer of the most unhappy of
Thy creatures!"</p>

<p>"O God, aid me! Thou wilt not leave me entirely
in the hands of men; because I do not wish
to make a covenant with injustice! Hear the
prayer which I make to Thee, that at least for
the future I may live with my Carl!... O
cruel fate, implacable destiny! No, no, my unhappiness
will never end!"</p>

<p>Then this nephew, so passionately loved, proved
unworthy of the confidence of his uncle. The
correspondence between Beethoven and him is sad
and revolting, like that of Michael Angelo with
his brothers, but more simple and touching.</p>

<p>"Am I to be repaid once again with the most
abominable ingratitude? Ah, well, if the bond
must be broken, so be it! All impartial people
who hear of it will hate you. If the compact between
us weighs too heavily, in the name of God,
may it be according to His will! I abandon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
you to Providence; I have done all that I
could; I am ready to appear before the Supreme
Judge!</p>

<p>"Spoilt as you are, that should not make it
difficult to teach you to be simple and true; my
heart has suffered so much by your hypocritical
conduct, and it is difficult for me to forget....
God is my witness, I only long to be a thousand
miles from you and from that sorry brother and
from this abominable family.... I shall never
more have confidence in you." And he signed
"Unhappily your father&mdash;or rather, not your
father." But pardon came almost immediately.</p>

<p>"My dear son! No more of this! Come to
my arms. You shall not hear one harsh word.
I will receive you with the same love. We will
talk over what is to be done for your future in
a friendly manner. On my word of honour there
will be no reproach. That would do no good.
You have nothing to expect from me but sympathy
and the most loving care. Come, come to
the faithful heart of your father. Come immediately
you receive this letter, come to the house."
(And on the envelope in French, "If you do not
come, you will surely kill me.")</p>

<p>"Do not deceive me," he begged, "be always
my beloved son. What a horrible discord it would
be if you were to be false to me, as many persons
maintain that you already are.... Good-bye, he
who has not given you life but who has certainly
preserved it, and who has taken all possible care
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
with your moral development, with an affection
more than paternal, begs you from the bottom of
his heart to follow the only true path of the good
and the just.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10em; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.0em ">Your faithful foster-father."
<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>After having cherished all kinds of dreams for
the future of this nephew, who was not lacking
in intelligence and whom he wished to take up
a University career, Beethoven had to consent to
make a merchant of him. But Carl frequented
gambling dens and contracted debts. By a sad
phenomenon, more frequent than one believes, the
moral grandeur of his uncle, instead of doing him
good, made him worse. It exasperated him, impelling
him to revolt, as he said in those terrible
words where his miserable soul appears so plainly,
"I have become worse because my uncle wished
me to do better." He reached such a state that
in the summer of 1826 he shot himself in the head
with a pistol. He did not die from it, but it was
Beethoven who just missed dying. He never recovered
from this terrible fright.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Carl recovered;
he lived to the end to cause suffering to his uncle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
whose death he hastened in no slight measure.
Nor was he with him at the hour of his death.
"God has never abandoned me," wrote Beethoven
to his nephew, some years before. "He will find
someone to close my eyes." This was not to be
the one whom he called "his son."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was from the depth of this abyss that Beethoven
undertook to chant his immortal <em>Ode to
Joy</em>. It was the plan of his whole life. As early as
1793, he had thought of it at Bonn.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> All his life
he wished to celebrate Joy; and to make it the
climax of one of his great works. He was always
striving to find the exact form of the Hymn, and
the work where he could place it. He was far
from being decided, even in his <em>Ninth Symphony</em>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Until the very last moment, he was on the point
of putting off the <em>Ode to Joy</em> to a <em>Tenth</em> or
<em>Eleventh Symphony</em>. One ought to notice that
the <em>Ninth Symphony</em> is not entitled <em>Choral Symphony</em>,
but as it is now invariably called, <em>Symphony
with a Final Chorus on the Ode to Joy</em>.
It narrowly missed having another conclusion. In
July, 1823, Beethoven still thought of giving it an
instrumental <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">finale</i>, which he used later on for the
quartet Op: 132. Both Czerny and Sonnleithner
say that even after the performance in May, 1824,
Beethoven had not abandoned this idea.</p>

<p>He found great technical difficulties in introducing
the Chorus into the Symphony, as is shown
by Beethoven's note-books and his numerous attempts
to make the voices enter at another part
of the work and in a different manner. In the
sketches for the second subject of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i><a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> he
wrote "Perhaps the Chorus could enter conveniently
here." But he could not decide to part
from his faithful orchestra. "When an idea comes
to me," he said, "I hear it on an instrument,
never on a voice." So he put back the place for
employing voices as late as possible. At first he
wanted to give the instruments not only the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">recitatives</i>
of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i><a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> but even the Theme of Joy
itself.</p>

<p>But we must go still further into the reason of
these hesitations and delays. The explanation is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
very deep. Continually tormented by grief, this
unfortunate man had always aspired to sing the
excellence of Joy; and from year to year he put
off his task, held back ceaselessly by the whirlwind
of his passion and grief. It was only at
the very last that he succeeded. But with what
a success!</p>

<p>At the moment when the Theme of Joy appears
for the first time, the orchestra stops abruptly,
thus giving a sudden unexpected character to the
entrance of the Song. And this is a true touch;
this theme is rightly divine. Joy descends from
heaven enveloped in a supernatural calm; it
soothes the suffering with its cool breath; and
the first impression that it makes, is so tender
as it steals into the sorrowing heart, that a friend
of Beethoven has said "One feels inclined to
weep, as one looks into those soft, calm eyes of
his." When the Theme passes first to the voices,
it is the Basses who present it first with a solemn
and rather weighty character. But, little, by little,
Joy takes possession of us. It is a real battle, a
fight with sorrow. We can hear the rhythms of
marching, the armies moving. In the ardent
panting song of the tenor, in all these quivering
pages we can almost feel the breath of Beethoven
himself, the rhythm of his breathing and his inspired
cries as he wandered across the fields, composing
the work, transported by a demoniacal
fury, like King Lear in the middle of a storm.
After the war-like joy comes religious Ecstasy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Then follows a sacred orgy, a very delirium of
love. A whole trembling humanity lifts its arms
to the sky, utters powerful outcries, rushes forth
towards this Joy and clasps it to the heart.</p>

<p>This Titanic work overcame the indifference of
the public. The frivolous crowds of Vienna were
moved for an instant, but they still favoured
Rossini and his Italian operas. Humiliated and
saddened, Beethoven was on the point of going
to live in London and thought of giving his <em>Ninth
Symphony</em> there. A second time, as in 1809,
some noble friends sent him a petition asking that
he would not leave the country. They said "We
know that you have written a new composition of
sacred music<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> in which you have expressed sentiments
inspired by your profound faith. The
supernatural light which penetrates your great
soul illumines the work. We know besides that
the garland of your inspired symphonies has been
increased by an immortal flower.... Your
absence during these last years has troubled all
those whose eyes are turned to you.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Everyone
sadly thought that the man of genius placed so
high amongst living beings remained silent whilst
another kind of foreign art sought to plant itself
in our country, causing the productions of German
art to be forgotten.... From you only, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
nation awaits new life, new laurels, and a new
reign of truth and beauty, despite the fashion of
the day.... Give us the hope of soon seeing
our desires satisfied. And then the springtime
which is coming will blossom again doubly, thanks
to your gifts to us and to the world!"<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> This
noble address shews what power, not only artistic
but also moral, Beethoven exercised over the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> of Germany. The first word which occurs
to his followers who wish to praise his genius is
neither science, nor art; it is <em>faith</em>.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Beethoven was deeply moved by these words.
He stayed. On May 7th, 1824, the first performance
in Vienna of the <em>Mass in D</em> and the <em>Ninth
Symphony</em> took place. The success was amazing;
and his greeting almost of a seditious character
for when Beethoven appeared he was accorded
five rounds of applause; whereas according to the
strict etiquette of the city, it was the custom to
give three only for the entrance of the Royal
Family. The police had to put an end to the
manifestations. The Symphony raised frantic
enthusiasm. Many wept. Beethoven fainted with
emotion after the concert; he was taken to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Schindler's house where he remained asleep all
the night and the following morning, fully dressed,
neither eating nor drinking. The triumph was
only fleeting, however, and the concert brought
in nothing for Beethoven. His material circumstances
of life were not changed by it. He found
himself poor, ill,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
alone but a conquerer<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>: conqueror
of the mediocrity of mankind, conqueror
of his destiny, conqueror of his suffering. "Sacrifice,
always sacrifice the trifles of life to art! God
is over all!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He had then completed the object of his whole
life. He had tasted perfect Joy. Would he be
able to rest on this triumph of the soul which
ruled the tempest? Certainly he ought to feel the
relief from the days of his past anguish. Indeed
his last quartets are full of strange forebodings.
But it seems that the victory of the <em>Ninth Symphony</em>
had left its glorious traces in its nature.
The plans which he had for the future:<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> the <em>Tenth</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
<em>Symphony</em>,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> the overture on the name of <span class="smcap">Bach</span>,
the music for Grillparzer's <em>Melusina</em>,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> for Körner's
<em>Odyssey</em> and Goethe's <em>Faust</em>,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> the Biblical oratorio
of <em>Saul and David</em>, all shew that he was
attracted by the mighty serenity of the old German
masters&mdash;Bach and Handel&mdash;and more still to the
light of the South&mdash;the South of France or Italy,
where he hoped to travel.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Spiker, who saw him in 1826, said that his
face had become smiling and jovial. The same
year when Grillparzer spoke to him for the last
time, it was Beethoven who had more energy than
the worn-out poet: "Ah!" said the latter, "if I
had a thousandth part of your strength and determination."
Times were hard; the monarchial reaction
oppressed their spirits. "The censors have
killed me," groaned Grillparzer. "One must go to
North America if one wishes to speak freely."
But no power could put a stop to Beethoven's
thoughts. "Words are bound in chains, but,
happily, sounds are still free," he wrote to the
poet Kuffner. Beethoven's is the great voice of
freedom, perhaps the only one then of the whole
of German thought. He felt it. Often he spoke
of the duty which was imposed on him to act by
means of his art "for poor humanity, for humanity
to come, to restore its courage and to
shake off its lassitude and cowardice." "At the
present time," he wrote to his nephew, "there
is need for mighty spirits to lash into action these
wretched rebellious human souls." Dr. Müller
said in 1827 that "Beethoven always expressed
himself freely on the subjects of government, the
police, the aristocracy, even in public. The police
knew him but they looked on his criticisms and
satires as harmless fancies, and they did not care
to interfere with the man whose genius had such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
an extraordinary reputation."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Thus nothing was
able to break this indomitable will. It seemed
now to make sport of grief. The music written
in these last years, in spite of the painful circumstances
under which it was composed,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> has often
quite a new, ironical character of heroic and joyous
disdain. The very last piece that he finished, the
new <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> to the <em>Quartet, Op. 130</em>, is very gay.
This was in November 1826, four months before
his death. In truth this gaiety is not of the usual
kind; for at times it is the harsh and spasmodic
laughter of which Moscheles speaks; often it is
the affecting smile, the result of suffering conquered.
It matters not; he is the conqueror. He
does not believe in death.</p>

<p>It came, however. At the end of November,
1826, he caught a chill which turned to pleurisy:
he was taken ill in Vienna when returning from a
journey undertaken in winter to arrange for the
future of his nephew.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> He was far from his friends.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
He told his nephew to go for a doctor. The wretch
forgot his commission and only remembered two
days after. The doctor came too late and treated
Beethoven unskillfully. For three months his iron
constitution fought against the illness. On January
3rd, 1827, he made his well-loved nephew his
chief executor. He thought of his dear friends
on the Rhine; he wrote again to Wegeler: "How
I would like to talk with you! But I am too
weak. I can do no more than embrace you in my
heart, you and your Lorchen." Poverty would
have made his last moments more gloomy, had it
not been for the generosity of some English
friends. He had become very gentle and very
patient.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> On his death-bed on February 17th,
1827, after three operations and awaiting a fourth,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
he wrote with perfect calmness, "I am patient
and I think that all misfortune brings some blessing
with it." This boon was deliverance&mdash;"the
end of the comedy," as he said when dying. We
might say rather the end of the <em>tragedy</em>....
He died in the climax of a violent storm, a tempest
of snow, heavily punctuated with terrible thunder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
claps. A strange hand closed his eyes,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> March
26th, 1827.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Beloved Beethoven! So many others have
praised his artistic grandeur. But he is easily the
first of musicians. He is the most heroic soul in
modern art. He is the grandest and the best
friend of those who suffer and struggle. When
we are saddened by worldly miseries, it is he who
comes near to us, as he used to go and play
to a mother in grief, and without uttering a
word thus console her by the song of his own
plaintive resignation. And when we are utterly
exhausted in the eternal battle uselessly waged
against mediocrity, vice and virtue, it is an
unspeakable boon to find fresh strength in this
great ocean-torrent of strong will and faith. An atmosphere
of courage emanates from his personality,
a love of battle,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> the exultation of a conscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
feeling of the <em>God within</em>. It seems that in his
constant communion with nature<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> he had ended by
assimilating its deep and mighty powers. Grillparzer,
who admired Beethoven with a kind
of awe, said of him, "He penetrated into
regions where art melts away and unites with
the wild and capricious elements." Schumann
wrote similarly of his <em>Symphony in C minor</em>:
"Every time it is performed it exercises an unvarying
power on us, like natural phenomena
which fill us with awe and amazement every
time they occur." And Schindler, his confidential
friend, says, "He possessed the spirit of
nature." It is true, "Beethoven is a force of
nature; and this battle of elemental power against
the rest of nature is a spectacle of truly Homeric
grandeur."</p>

<p>His whole life is like a stormy day. At the beginning&mdash;a
fresh clear morning, perhaps a languid
breeze, scarcely a breath of air. But there is already
in the still air a secret menace, a dark foreboding.
Large shadows loom and pass; tragic
rumblings; murmuring awesome silences; the
furious gusts of the winds of the <em>Eroica</em> and the
<em>C minor</em>. However, the freshness of the day is
not yet gone. Joy remains joy; the brightness of
the sky is not overcast; sadness is never without
a ray of hope. But after 1810 the poise of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
soul is disturbed. A strange light glows. Mists
obscure his deepest thoughts; some of the clearer
thoughts appear as vapour rising; they disappear,
are dispelled, yet form anew; they obscure the
heart with their melancholy and capricious gloom;
often the musical idea seems to vanish entirely,
to be submerged, but only to re-appear again at
the end of a piece in a veritable storm of melody.
Even joy has assumed a rough and riotous character.
A bitter feeling becomes mingled in all his
sentiments.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Storms gather as evening comes on.
Heavy clouds are big with tempests. Lightning
flashes o'er the black of night. The climax of
the hurricane is approaching. Suddenly, at the
height of the tempest, the darkness is dispersed.
Night is driven away and the clear, tranquil atmosphere
is restored by a sheer act of will power.
What a conquest was this! What Napoleonic
battle can be likened to it? What was Austerlitz
glory to the radiance of this superhuman effort,
this victory, the most brilliant that has ever been
won by an infirm and lonely spirit. Sorrow personified,
to whom the world refused joy, created
joy himself to give to the world. He forged it
from his own misery, as he proudly said in reviewing
his life. And indeed it was the motto of
his whole heroic soul:</p>

little notice of him. Haydn, whose acquaintance he made at

deafness first appeared six years before&mdash;very likely in 1796.
Let us notice in passing that in the catalogue of his works,
Opus one alone (Three Trios) was written before 1796. Opus 2,
the first three Piano Sonatas appeared in March, 1796. It may,
therefore, be said that the whole of Beethoven's work is that of
a deaf man.
</p>
<p>
See the article on Beethoven's deafness by Dr. Klotz Forest
in the "Medical Chronicle" of 15th May, 1905. The writer of
the article believes that the complaint had its origin in a general
hereditary affliction (perhaps in the phthisis of his mother). The
deafness increased without ever becoming total. Beethoven
heard low sounds better than high ones. In his last years it is
said that he used a wooden rod, one end of which was placed in
the piano sound-box, the other between his teeth. He used this
means of hearing when he composed.

around Bonaparte, and the first MS. still bears the title, "Bonaparte."
Afterwards Beethoven learnt of the Coronation of
Napoleon. Breaking out into a fury, he cried: "He is only an
ordinary man"; and in his indignation he tore off the dedication
and wrote the avenging and touching title: <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sinfonia
Eroica composta per festeggiare il souvenire di un grand Uomo</i>.
(Heroic Symphony composed to celebrate the memory of a great
man). Schindler relates that later on his scorn for Napoleon
became more subdued; he saw in him rather the unfortunate
victim of circumstances worthy of pity, an Icarus flung down
from Heaven. When he heard of the St. Helena catastrophe
in 1821, he remarked: "I composed the music suitable for this
sad event some seventeen years ago." It pleased him to recognise
in the Funeral March of his Symphony a presentiment
of the conqueror's tragic end. There was then probably in
the <em>Eroica Symphony</em> and especially in the first movement, a
kind of portrait of Bonaparte in Beethoven's mind, doubtless
very different from the real man, and rather what he imagined
him to be or would have liked him to be&mdash;the genius of the
Revolution. Beethoven, in the Finale of the Eroica Symphony,
used again one of the chief phrases of the work he had already
written on the revolutionary hero par excellence, the god of
liberty, Prometheus, 1801.</p></div>

Vienna which Napoleon had blown up after the taking of the
city. "What an awful life, with ruins all around me," wrote
Beethoven to the publishers, Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, on 26th June,
1809, "nothing but drums, trumpets, and misery of every kind."
A portrait of Beethoven at this time has been left to us by a
Frenchman who saw him in Vienna in 1809, Baron Trémont,
of the Council of State. It gives a picturesque description of
the disorder in Beethoven's room. They talked together of
philosophy, religion, politics, and "especially of Shakespeare."
Beethoven was very much inclined to follow Trémont to Paris,
where he knew they had already performed his Symphonies at
the Conservatoire, and there he had many enthusiastic admirers.
(See <em>Mercure Musical</em>, 1 May, 1906, <em>Une visite à Beethoven</em>, by Baron Trémont,

met the Brunsviks at Vienna between 1796 and 1799. Giulietta
Guicciardi was the cousin of Theresa. Beethoven seems also
to have been attracted at one period by one of Theresa's
sisters, Josephine, who first married Count Deym, and
later on, the Baron Stackelberg. Some very striking details on
the Brunsvik family are found in an article by M. André de
Hevesy. <em>Beethoven et l'Immortelle Bien-aimée</em>
(<em>Revue de Paris</em>, March 1 and 15, 1910). For this study M. de Hevesy has made
use of the MS. Memoires and the papers of Theresa, which were
preserved at Martonvasar in Hungary. They all show an affectionate
intimacy between Beethoven and the Brunsviks, and
raise again the question of his love for Theresa. But the arguments
are not convincing, and I leave them to be discussed at
some future time.</p></div>

To Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, 8th August, 1809, Nohl, <em>New Letters</em>,
LIII.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that Beethoven's taste in literature was so
sound in view of his neglected education. In addition to Goethe,
who he said was "grand, majestic, always in D major" (and
more than Goethe) he loved three men, Homer, Plutarch and
Shakespeare. Of Homer's works he preferred the <em>Odyssey</em> to
the <em>Iliad</em>; he was continually reading Shakespeare (from a
German translation) and we know with what tragic grandeur
he has set <em>Coriolanus</em> and the <em>Tempest</em> in music. He read
Plutarch continually, as did all who were in favour of the
revolution. Brutus was his hero, as was also the case with
Michael Angelo; he had a small statue of him in his bedroom.
He loved Plato, and dreamed of establishing his republic in the
whole world. "Socrates and Jesus have been my models," he
wrote once on his note-books (<em>Conversations during 1819 and
1820</em>).</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> "Beethoven," said Goethe to Zelter, "is, unfortunately,
possessed of a wild and uncouth disposition; doubtless, he is
not wrong in finding the world detestable, but that is not the
way to make it pleasant for himself or for others. We must
excuse and pity him for he is deaf." After that he did nothing
against Beethoven nor did he do anything for him, but he ignored
him completely. At the bottom, however, he admired
Beethoven's music and feared it also. He was afraid it would
cause him to lose that mental calm which he had gained through
so much trouble. A letter of young Felix Mendelssohn, who
passed through Weimar in 1830, gives us a very interesting
glimpse into the depths of that storm-tossed passionate soul,
controlled as it was by a masterly and powerful intellect....
"At first," writes Mendelssohn, "he did not want to hear
Beethoven's name mentioned, but after a time he was persuaded
to listen to the First Movement of the Symphony in C minor,
which moved him deeply. He would not show anything outwardly,
but merely remarked to me, 'that does not touch me, it
only surprises me.' After a time he said 'It is really grand,
it is maddening, you would think the house was crumbling to
pieces.' Afterwards, at dinner, he sat pensive and absorbed until
he began to question me about Beethoven's music. I saw quite
clearly that a deep impression had been made on him...."

that one has really known melody. <em>Fidelio</em> is quite devoid of

Schiller's Ode was written in 1785. The actual theme appeared
in 1808 in the <em>Fantasy for piano, orchestra and Choir, Op. 80</em>,
and in 1810 in the Song on Goethe's words: <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kleine Blumen,
Kleine Blaetter</i>. I have seen in a notebook of 1812 belonging
to Dr. Erich Prieger at Bonn, between the sketches of the
<em>Seventh Symphony</em> and a plan for an <em>Overture to Macbeth</em>, an
attempt to adopt some words of Schiller to the theme which
he used later on in the <em>Overture Op. 115</em> (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Namensfeier</i>).
Several instrumental motives of the <em>Ninth Symphony</em> appeared
before 1815. Thus the definite theme of Joy was put down in

Beethoven wrote to Moscheles on March 18th, 1827: "The
complete sketch of a Symphony is in my desk with a new
overture." This sketch has never been found. One only reads
in his notes:</p>

<p>"Adagio cantique." Religious song for a symphony in the
old modes (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Herr Gott dich loben wir.&mdash;Alleluja</i>), may be in an
independent style, may be as introduction to a fugue. This
Symphony might be characterised by the entrance of voices,
perhaps in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">finale</i>, perhaps in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">adagio</i>. The violins in the
orchestra, etc., increased ten times for the last movements. The
voices to enter one by one; or to repeat the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">adagio</i> somehow
in the last movements. For words for the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">adagio</i>, a Greek
myth or an ecclesiastical canticle, in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">allegro</i>, Bacchus' Feast
(1818). As has been seen the choral conclusion was intended
to be reserved for a <em>Tenth Symphony</em> and not for the <em>Ninth
Symphony</em>.</p>

<p>Later he said that he wished to accomplish in his <em>Tenth
Symphony</em> "the reconciliation of the modern world with the
ancient, which Goethe had attempted in his <em>Second Faust</em>."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> The subject is the legend of a horseman who is loved and
captured by a fairy, and who suffers from nostalgia and
lack of liberty. There are analogies between this poem and that
of <em>Tannhäuser</em>. Beethoven worked at it between 1823 and 1826.
(See A. Ehrhard <em>Franz Grillparzer</em>, 1900).</p></div>

to <em>Faust</em>. (The first part of <em>Faust</em> appeared under the title of

followed by the police for having said aloud
"That, after all, Christ was only a crucified Jew." He was
then writing the <em>Mass in D</em>. That work alone is enough to show
the freedom of his religious inspirations. (For the religious
opinions of Beethoven, see Theodor von Frimmel; <em>Beethoven</em>, 3rd
Edition, Verlag Harmonie; and <em>Beethovenia</em>, edited Georg Müller,
Vol. II, Blöchinger). No less free in politics, Beethoven
boldly attacked the vices of the government. He attacked
amongst other things, the administration of justice, hindered by
the slowness of its process, the stupid police regulations, the rude
and lazy clerks in office, who killed all individual initiative and
paralysed all action: the unfair privileges of a degenerate aristocracy,
the high taxation, etc. His political sympathies seemed
to be with England at that time.</p></div>

<p>For my brothers CARL and &mdash;&mdash; BEETHOVEN.</p>


<p>O ye men who regard or declare me to be
malignant, stubborn or cynical, how unjust are
ye towards me! You do not know the secret cause
of my seeming so. From childhood onward, my
heart and mind prompted me to be kind and tender,
and I was ever inclined to accomplish great deeds.
But only think that during the last six years I
have been in a wretched condition, rendered worse
by unintelligent physicians. Deceived from year
to year with hopes of improvement, and then
finally forced to the prospect of <em>lasting infirmity</em>
(which may last for years, or even be totally incurable).
Born with a fiery, active temperament,
even susceptive of the diversions of society, I had
soon to retire from the world, to live a solitary life.
At times, even, I endeavoured to forget all this,
but how harshly was I driven back by the redoubled
experience of my bad hearing. Yet it was not
possible for me to say to men: "Speak louder,
shout, for I am deaf." Alas! how could I declare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the weakness of a <em>sense</em> which in me <em>ought to be</em>
more acute than in others&mdash;a sense which <em>formerly</em>
I possessed in highest perfection, a perfection such
as few in my profession enjoy, or ever have enjoyed;
no, I cannot do it. Forgive, therefore, if
you see me withdraw, when I would willingly mix
with you. My misfortune pains me doubly, in that
I am certain to be misunderstood. For me there
can be no recreation in the society of my fellow
creatures, no refined conversations, no interchange
of thought. Almost alone, and only mixing in
society when absolutely necessary, I am compelled
to live as an exile. If I approach near to people,
a feeling of hot anxiety comes over me lest my
condition should be noticed&mdash;for so it was during
these past six months which I spent in the country.
Ordered by my intelligent physician to spare my
hearing as much as possible, he almost fell in with
my present frame of mind, although many a time
I was carried away by my sociable inclinations.
But how humiliating was it, when some one
standing close to me heard a distant flute, and I
heard <em>nothing</em>, or a <em>shepherd singing</em>, and again
I heard nothing. Such incidents almost drove me
to despair; at times I was on the point of putting
an end to my life&mdash;<em>art</em> alone restrained my hand.
Oh! it seemed as if I could not quit this earth
until I had produced all I felt within me, and so
I continued this wretched life, wretched indeed,
with so sensitive a body that a somewhat sudden
change can throw me from the best into the worst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
state. <em>Patience</em>, I am told, I must choose as my
guide. I have done so&mdash;lasting, I hope, will be
my resolution to bear up until it pleases the inexorable
Parcae to break the thread. Forced,
already in my 28th year,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> to become a philosopher
it is not easy; for an artist more difficult than for
any one else. O Divine Being, Thou Who lookest
down into my inmost soul, Thou understandest,
Thou knowest that love for mankind and a desire
to do good dwell therein. Oh, my fellow men,
when one day you read this, remember that you
were unjust to me, and let the unfortunate one
console himself if he can find one like himself,
who in spite of all obstacles which nature has
thrown in his way, has still done everything in his
power to be received into the ranks of worthy artists
and men. You, my brothers Carl and &mdash;&mdash;, as
soon as I am dead, beg Professor Schmidt, if he
be still living, to describe my malady, and annex
this written account to that of my illness, so that
at least the world may know, so far as it is possible,
may become reconciled to me after my death. And
now I declare you both heirs to my small fortune
(if such it may be called). Divide it honourably
and dwell in peace, and help each other. What
you have done against me, has, as you know,
long been forgiven. And you, brother Carl, I
especially thank you for the attachment you have
shown towards me of late. My prayer is that your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
life may be better, less troubled by cares than mine.
Recommend to your children virtue; it alone can
bring happiness, not money. I speak from experience.
It was virtue which bore me up in time
of trouble; to her, next to my art, I owe thanks
for my not having laid violent hands on myself.
Farewell, and love one another. My thanks to all
friends, especially <em>Prince Lichnovsky and Professor
Schmidt</em>. I should much like one of you
to keep as an heirloom the instruments given to
me by Prince L., but let no strife arise between
you concerning them; if money should be of more
service to you, just sell them. How happy I feel
that even when lying in my grave I may be useful
to you.</p>

<p>So let it be. I joyfully hasten to meet death.
If it come before I have had opportunity to develop
all my artistic faculties, it will come, my hard fate
notwithstanding, too soon, and I should probably
wish it later&mdash;yet even then I shall be happy, for
will it not deliver me from a state of endless suffering?
Come when thou wilt, I shall face thee
courageously; farewell, and when I am dead, do
not entirely forget me. This I deserve from you,
for during my lifetime I often thought of you, and
how to make you happy. Be ye so.</p>

<p>On the fourth side of the large Will sheet:&mdash;</p>

<p>Heiglnstadt, October, 1802, thus I take my
farewell of thee&mdash;and, indeed, sadly&mdash;yes, that
fond hope which I entertained when I came here,
of being at any rate healed up to a certain point,
must be entirely abandoned. As the leaves of
autumn fall and fade, so it has withered away for
me; almost the same as when I came here do I
go away&mdash;even the high courage which often in
the beautiful summer days quickened me, that has
vanished. O Providence, let me have just one
pure day of <em>joy</em>; so long is it since true joy filled
my heart. Oh when, oh when, oh Divine Being,
shall I be able once again to feel it in the temple
of nature and of men? Never&mdash;no&mdash;that would be
too hard.</p>

<p>For my brothers Carl and &mdash;&mdash; to execute after
my death.</p>

<h3>I.<br />
To <span class="smcap">Carl Amenda</span> at Wirben in Courland.</h3>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 1em; ">(<em>Vienna, June</em> 1, 1800).</p>

<p style="padding-left: 4em; ">My dear, my good Amenda, my heartily beloved friend.</p>

<p>With deep emotion, with mixed pain and
pleasure did I receive and read your last letter.
To what can I compare your fidelity, your attachment
to me. Oh! how pleasant it is that
you have always remained so kind to me; yes,
I also know that you, of all men, are the most
trustworthy. You are no <em>Viennese friend</em>; no,
you are one of those such as my native country
produces. How often do I wish you were with
me, your Beethoven is most unhappy, and at
strife with nature and Creator. The latter I have
often cursed for exposing His creatures to the
smallest chance, so that frequently the richest
buds are thereby crushed and destroyed. Only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
think that the noblest part of me, my sense of
hearing has become very weak. Already, when
you were with me I noticed traces of it, and I
said nothing. Now it has become worse, and
it remains to be seen whether it can ever be
healed.... I much fear that my hearing will not
improve; maladies of that kind are the most
difficult of all to cure. What a sad life I am
now compelled to lead; I must avoid all that is
near and dear to me, and then to be among
such wretched egotistical beings such as ...
etc. I can say that among all, Lichnowski has
best stood the test. Since last year he has settled
on me 600 florins, which, together with the good
sale of my works, enables me to live without
anxiety. Everything I write I can sell immediately
five times over, and also be well paid.
I have composed a fair quantity, and as I hear
you have ordered pianofortes from ... I will send
you many things in one of the packing cases so
it will not cost you so very much. Now to my
consolation, a man has come here with whom
intercourse is a pleasure, and whose friendship
is free from all selfishness. He is one of the
friends of my youth. I have often spoken to
him about you, and told him that since I left my
native country, you are the one whom my heart
has chosen. Even he does not like ... the
latter is and remains too weak for friendship.
I consider him and ... mere instruments
on which when it pleases me I play; but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
can never become noble witnesses of my inner
and outer activity, nor be in true sympathy with
me; I value them according as they are useful
to me. Oh! how happy should I now be if I had
my perfect hearing, for I should then hasten
to you. As it is, I must in all things be behind-hand;
my best years will slip away without
bringing forth what, with my talent and my
strength I ought to have accomplished. I must
now have recourse to sad resignation. I have,
it is true, resolved not to worry about all this
but how is it possible? Yes, Amenda, if six
months hence my malady is beyond cure, then
I lay claim to your help. You must leave everything
and come to me. I will travel (my malady
interferes least with my playing and composition,
most only in conversation), and you must be my
companion. I am convinced good fortune will
not fail me. With whom need I be afraid of
measuring my strength? Since you went away
I have written music of all kinds except operas
and sacred works.</p>

<p>Yes, do not refuse; help your friend to bear
with his troubles, his infirmity. I have also
greatly improved my pianoforte playing. I hope
this journey may also turn to your advantage;
afterwards you will always remain with me. I
have duly received all your letters, and although
I have only answered a few, you have been always
in my mind, and my heart, as always, beats
tenderly for you. <em>Please keep as a great secret</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
<em>what I have told you about my hearing; trust
no one, whoever it may be, with it.</em> Do write
frequently; your letters, however short they may
be, console me, do me good. I expect soon to
get another one from you, my dear friend. Don't
lend out my Quartet any more, because I have
made many changes in it. I have only just learnt
how to write quartets properly, as you will see
when you receive them.</p>

<p>Now, my dear good friend, farewell! If,
perchance, you believe that I can show you any
kindness here, I need not of course, remind you
to first address yourself to</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 1em; ">(1798?)</p>

<p style="padding-left: 4em; ">Dear Chr.</p>

<p>You let me hear something yesterday about
a portrait of myself. I wish you to proceed
somewhat carefully in the matter. I fear if we
return it through F., the disagreeable B. or the
arch-fool Joseph might interfere, and then the
matter might be meant as a mean trick played
on me, and that would be really most annoying.
I should have to avenge myself, and the whole
<em>populasse</em> does not deserve it. Try to get hold
of the thing as well as you can. I assure you
that after this I should put a notice in the newspaper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
requesting all painters not to take my
portrait without my consent, were I afraid of
falling into perplexity over my own countenance.
As to the matter of taking off my hat, it is altogether
stupid, and at the same time too impolite
for me to retaliate. Pray explain to him the
truth about the walk.</p>

<h3>III.<br />
To Frl. <span class="smcap">Eleonore von Breuning</span> in Bonn.</h3>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 1em; "><em>Vienna, November</em> 2, 1793.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 4em; ">Honoured Eleonore, my dearest friend.</p>

<p>I shall soon have been in this capital a
whole year, yet only now do you receive a letter
from me, but you were certainly constantly in
my thoughts. Frequently, indeed, did I hold
converse with you and your dear family, but,
for the most part, not with the tranquility of mind
which I should have liked. Then it was that
the fatal quarrel hovered before me, and my
former behaviour appeared to me so abominable.
But the past cannot be undone, and what would
I not give if I could blot out of my life my
former conduct so dishonouring to me, so contrary
to my character. Many circumstances,
indeed, kept us at a distance from each other,
and, as I presume, it was especially the insinuations
resulting from conversations on either side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
which prevented all reconciliation. Each of us
believed that he was convinced of the truth of
what he said, and yet it was mere anger, and
we were both deceived. Your good and noble
character is, indeed, a guarantee that I have long
since been forgiven. But true repentance consists,
so it is said, in acknowledging one's faults,
and this I intended to do. And now let us draw
a curtain over the whole story, and only learn
from it the lesson that when friends fall out it
is always better to have no go-between, but for
friend to turn directly to friend.</p>

<p>Herewith you receive a dedication from me
to yourself, and I only wish that the work were
more important, more worthy of you. I have
been worried here to publish this small work,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
and I make use of this opportunity to give
you, my adorable Eleonore, a proof of my
high esteem and of my friendship towards
you, and of my constant remembrance of
your family. Accept this trifle, and realise
that it comes from a friend who holds you in
high esteem. Oh, if it only gives you pleasure,
I am fully rewarded. Let it be a small reawakening
of that time in which I spent so many
and such happy hours in your home; it may,
perhaps, keep me in your remembrance, until
one day I return, but that will not be for a long
time. Oh, how we shall then rejoice, my dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
friend. You will then find your friend a more
cheerful being, for whom time and his better
fortune have smoothed down the furrows of the
horrid past. If you happen to see B. Koch,
please tell her that it is not nice of her not to
have sent me a single line. For I have written
twice; to Malchus I wrote three times&mdash;and no
answer. Tell her that if she would not write,
she ought to have urged Malchus to do so. As
conclusion to my letter, I add a request; it is
that I may be lucky enough, my dear friend,
again to possess an Angora vest knitted by
your hands. Forgive this indiscreet request
from your friend. It arises from the great
preference I have for everything coming from
your hands, and, as a secret, I may say to
you that in this there is at bottom a little vanity,
viz., to be able to say that I possess something
given to me by one of the best, most worthy
young ladies in Bonn. I still have the first one
which you were kind enough to give me in
Bonn, but it is now so out of fashion that I can
only keep it in my wardrobe as a precious gift
from you. If you would soon write me a nice
letter, it would afford me great pleasure. If,
perchance, my letters give you pleasure, I certainly
promise that I will willingly send news
as often as I can. For everything is welcome
to me whereby I can show you in what esteem
you are held by</p>

<h3>IV.<br />
To Dr. <span class="smcap">F. Wegeler</span> in Bonn.</h3>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 1em; "><em>Vienna, June</em> 29, 1800.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 4em; ">My good, dear Wegeler.</p>

<p>I am most grateful to you for thinking of
me; I have so little deserved it, or sought to
deserve it at your hands. And yet you are so
very good, and are not kept back by anything,
not even by my unpardonable negligence, but
always remain a faithful, good, honest friend.
That I could ever forget you, and especially all
of you who were so kind and affectionate to me,
no, do not believe it; there are moments in which
I myself long for you&mdash;yes, and wish to spend
some time with you. My native land, the beautiful
country in which I first saw the light of the
world, is ever as beautiful and distinct before
mine eyes as when I left you. In short, I shall
regard that time as one of the happiest of my
life, when I see you again, and can greet our
father Rhine. When that will be I cannot yet
say. This much will I tell you, that you will
only see me again when I am really great; not
only greater as an artist, but as a man you shall
find me better, more perfect; and if in our native
land there are any signs of returning prosperity,
I will only use my art for the benefit of the poor.
O, happy moment, how fortunate I think myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
in being able to get a fatherland created here!</p>

<p>You want to know something about my
present state; well, at present, it is not so bad.
Since last year, Lichnowsky, who, however incredible
it may seem when I tell it you, was always
my warmest friend, and has remained so (of
course, there have been slight misunderstandings
between us, but just these have strengthened our
friendship), has settled a fixed sum of 600 florins
on me, and I can draw it so long as I fail to find
a suitable post. My compositions are bringing
in a goodly sum, and I may add, it is scarcely
possible for me to execute the orders given. Also,
for every work I have six, seven publishers, and
if I choose, even more. They do not bargain
with me; I demand and they pay. You see how
pleasant it is. For example, I see a friend in distress,
and if my purse do not allow of my helping
him, I have only to sit down and in a short time
he is relieved. Also I am more economical than
I was formerly. If I should settle here, I shall
certainly contrive to get one day every year for
concerts, of which I have given some.</p>

<p>Only my envious demon, my bad health, has
thrown obstacles in my way. For instance, my
hearing has become weaker during the last three
years, and this infirmity was in the first instance
caused by my general health, which, as you know,
was already, in the past, in a wretched state.
Frank wished to restore me to health by means
of strengthening medicines, and to cure my deafness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
by means of oil of almonds, but, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">prosit!</i>
nothing came of these remedies; my hearing
became worse and worse, and my ill-health always
remained in its first state. This continued
until the autumn of last year, and ofttimes I
was in despair. Then an Asinus of a doctor
advised cold baths; a more skillful one, the usual
tepid Danube baths. These worked wonders;
the state of my health improved, my deafness
remained, or became worse. This winter I was
truly miserable. I had terrible attacks of colic,
and I fell quite back into my former state. So
I remained for about four weeks and then went
to Vering, for I thought that this state required
medical aid, and in addition I had always
placed faith in him. He ordered tepid Danube
baths, and whenever I took one I had to pour
into it a little bottle full of strengthening stuff.
He gave me no medicine until about four days
ago, when he ordered an application of herbs for
the ear. And through these I can say I feel
stronger and better; only the humming in my
ears continues day and night without ceasing.
I may truly say that my life is a wretched one.
For the last two years I have avoided all society,
for it is impossible for me to say to people 'I
am deaf.' Were my profession any other it
would not so much matter, but in my profession
it is a terrible thing; and my enemies, of whom
they are not a few, what would they say to this?
To give you an idea of this extraordinary deafness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
I will tell you that when at the theatre, I
am obliged to lean forward close to the orchestra,
in order to understand what is being said on the
stage. When somewhat at a distance I cannot
hear the high tones of instruments, voices. In
speaking it is not surprising that there are people
who have never noticed it, for as a rule I am
absent-minded, and they account for it in that
way. Often I can scarcely hear anyone speaking
to me; the tones, yes, but not the actual words;
yet as soon as anyone shouts, it is unbearable.
What will come of all this, heaven only knows!
Vering says that there will <em>certainly be an improvement,
though perhaps not a perfect cure</em>.
I have, indeed, often &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; cursed my
existence; Plutarch taught me resignation. If
nothing else is possible I will defy my fate, although
there will be moments in my life when
I shall be God's most wretched creature. I beg
you not to tell anyone about this; don't say even
a word to Lorchen. I only tell it you as a secret;
I should be glad if you would open up correspondence
with Vering on the subject. Should
my present state continue, I would come next
spring to you. You would take a house for me
in some beautiful place in the country, and so
I would rusticate for six months. By that means
there might come a change. Resignation! what
a miserable refuge, and yet it is the only way
for me.</p>

<p>Pray forgive me for telling you of a friend's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
trouble, when you yourself are in sad circumstances.
Stephen Breuning is now here, and we
are together almost daily. It does me good to
hark back to old times. He is really a good, noble
young fellow, who knows a thing or two, and
whose heart, as with all of us more or less, is
sound. I have very fine rooms now, which look
on to the bastion, and this for my health is of
double value. I really think I can arrange for
Breuning to come and live with me. You shall
have your Antiochus, and a rare lot of my new
compositions, unless you think it will cost you
too much. Honestly speaking, your love for art
gives me the highest pleasure. Only write to me
how it is to be managed, and I will send you
all my works, of which the number is now pretty
large and it is daily increasing. In place of the
portrait of my grandfather, which I beg you to
send as soon as possible by stage coach, I send
you that of his grandson, your ever good and
affectionate Beethoven. It is coming out here at
Artaria's, who, also other art firms, have often
asked me for it. I will write shortly to Stoffel,
and read him a bit of a lecture about his cross
temper. He shall hear what I have to say about
old friendship, he shall promise on his oath not
to grieve you any more in your, apart from this,
sad circumstances. I will also write to kind
Lorchen. I have never forgot a single one of
you, my dear good people, although you never
get any news from me; but writing, as you well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
know, was never a strong point with me&mdash;years,
even, have passed without my best friends ever
receiving anything. I only live in my music,
and I have scarcely begun one thing when I
start another. As I am now working, I am
often engaged on three or four things at the
same time.</p>

<p>Write often to me now; I will see to it that
I find time sometimes to write to you. Greetings
to all, also to the good wife of the privy councillor,
and tell her that I still, occasionally, have
a "raptus." I am not surprised at the change
in K; fortune is fickle, and does not always fall
to the most worthy, the best. A word about
Ries, to whom hearty greetings. As regards his
son, about whom I will write shortly, although
I am of opinion that to make his way in the
world, Paris is better than Vienna. The latter
city is overcrowded, and even persons of the
highest merit find it hard to maintain themselves.
By the autumn, or the winter, I will see what I
can do for him, for then every one is returning.</p>

<p>Farewell, good, faithful Wegeler. Rest assured
of the love and friendship of</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10em; margin-top: 1.5em; ">Your,</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em; "><span class="smcap">Beethoven</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h3>V.<br />
To Dr. <span class="smcap">Franz Wegeler</span> in Bonn.</h3>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 1em; "><em>November</em> 16 (1801 ?)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10em; ">My good Wegeler.</p>

<p>I thank you for the fresh proof of your
anxiety concerning myself, and all the more as
I am so little deserving of it. You want to know
how I am, what I am taking; and however unwillingly
I may discuss the matter, I certainly
like best to do it with you. For the last few
months, Vering has ordered herb plasters to be
constantly placed on both arms; and these,
as you will know, are composed of a certain
bark. This is a most unpleasant cure, as, until
the bark has sufficiently drawn, I am deprived
for a day or so of the free use of my arms, to
say nothing of the pain. I cannot, it is true,
deny that the humming with which my deafness
actually began, has become somewhat weaker,
especially in the left ear. My hearing, however,
has not in the least improved; I really am not
quite sure whether it has not become worse. My
general health is better, and especially after I
have taken luke warm baths a few times, I am
fairly well for eight or ten days. I seldom take
any tonic; I am now applying herb-plasters according
to your advice. Vering won't hear of
shower baths, but I am really very dissatisfied
with him; he shows so little care and forbearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
for such a malady; if I did not actually go to him,
and that costs me a great effort, I should never
see him. What is your opinion of Schmidt? I
do not like making a change, yet it seems to me
that Vering is too much a practitioner to be able
to take in new ideas through books. Schmidt appears
to me a very different kind of man, and perhaps
would not be so remiss. I hear wonders of
galvanism; what do you say about it? A doctor
told me he had seen a deaf and dumb child in
Berlin who had recovered his hearing, also a
man who had been deaf for seven years. I have
just heard that your Schmidt is making experiments
with it.</p>

<p>My life is again somewhat pleasanter, for
I mix in society. You can scarcely imagine
what a dreary, sad life I have led during the
past two years. My weak hearing always seemed
to me like a ghost and I ran away from people,
was forced to appear a misanthrope, though not
at all in my character. This change has been
brought about by an enchanting maiden, who
loves me, and whom I love. Again during the
past two years I have had some happy moments,
and for the first time I feel that marriage can
bring happiness. Unfortunately, she is not of
my station in life, and now&mdash;for the moment I
certainly could not marry&mdash;I must bravely bustle
about. If it were not for my hearing, I should
already long ago have travelled half over the
world, and that I must do. For me there is no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
greater pleasure than that of practising and displaying
my art. Do not believe that I should feel
happy among you. What, indeed, could make
me happier? Even your solicitude would pain
me; at every moment I should read pity on
your faces, and that would make me still more
miserable. My beautiful native country, what
was my lot when there? Nothing but hope of
a better state, and, except for this evil, I should
already have won it! O that I could be free from
it, and encompass the world! My youth, yes I
feel it, is only now beginning; have I not always
been sickly? My strength, both of body and
mind, for some time has been on the increase.
Every day I approach nearer to the goal; this
I feel, though I can scarcely describe it. Only
through this, can your Beethoven live. Don't
talk of rest! I know no other but sleep, and
sorry enough am I, that I am compelled to give
more time to it than formerly. If only half freed
from my infirmity, then&mdash;as a thorough, ripe
man&mdash;I will come to you and renew the old
feelings of friendship. You will see me as happy
as my lot can be here below, not unhappy. No,
that I could not endure; I will seize fate by the
throat; it shall certainly never wholly overcome
me. Oh! life is so beautiful, would I could have
a thousand lives! I feel I am no longer fit to
lead a quiet life! Do write as soon as you can.
See to it that Stephen makes up his mind to get
an appointment in the Order of German Knights.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
For his health, life here is too fatiguing. And
besides, he leads such a retired life, that I do
not see how he can get on. You know how it
is here; I do not mean to say that society would
render him less languid; he can never be persuaded
to go into it. Some time ago I had a
musical party at my house; but our friend Stephen
did not turn up. Do advise him to take more
rest and to be more steady. I have done all I
could; without he takes this advice, he can never
become either happy or healthy. Now, tell me
in your next letter, whether it matters if I send
you a great deal of my music. What you really
don't want you can sell, and so you will have
your postage&mdash;also my portrait. Best remembrances
to Lorchen&mdash;also Mamma&mdash;and
Christoph. You do really love me a little, do
you not? Be as well assured of this (of my
love), as of the friendship of your</p>

<h3>VI.<br />
To <span class="smcap">Capellmeister Hofmeister</span> in Leipzig.</h3>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 1em; "><em>Vienna</em>, 15<em>th</em>
(or something like it), <em>January</em>, 1801.</p>

<p>With great pleasure, my dearly beloved
brother and friend, have I read your letter.
I thank you right heartily for the good opinion
you have expressed concerning me and my works,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and hope I may prove myself really worthy of
it. Please also convey my dutiful thanks to
Herr K. for his courtesy and friendly feelings
towards me.</p>

<p>Your undertakings likewise make me glad,
and I hope, if works of art can procure gain,
that it will fall to the lot of genuine true artists,
rather than to mere shopkeepers. That you wish
to publish the works of <em>Sebastian</em> Bach rejoices
my heart, which beats in unison with the high
art of this forefather of harmony, and I desire
soon to see the scheme in full swing. I hope
that here, so soon as golden peace has been proclaimed,
I shall be able to be of great assistance
in the matter, when you issue a subscription
list. As regards our special business, since you
wish it, I hope this may be to your liking: I
now offer you the following: <em>Septet</em> (concerning
which I have already written to you; by <em>arranging</em>
it for pianoforte, it would become better
known and be more profitable) 20 ducats, <em>Symphony</em>
20 ducats, <em>Concerto</em> 10 ducats, <em>Solo
Sonata</em> (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i>, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>,
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Minuetto</i>, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Rondo</i>) 20
ducats. This <em>Sonata</em> is A1, dearest brother!
Now for a word of explanation; you will perhaps
be surprised that I here make no difference between
<em>Sonata</em>, <em>Septet</em>, <em>Symphony</em>, because I find
that there is not such a demand for a Septet or
a <em>Symphony</em> as for a Sonata; that is why I do so,
although a <em>Symphony</em> is undoubtedly of greater
value (N.B.&mdash;the Septet consists of a short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
introductory <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>, then <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i>,
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>,
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Minuetto</i>, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> with
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Variations</i>, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Minuetto</i>,
another short introductory <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>, and then
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i>). The <em>Concerto</em> I only value at 10 ducats,
because, as I have already written, I do not give
it out as one of my best. All things considered,
I do not think you will find this excessive; anyhow
I have tried to name prices for you as
moderate as I possibly could. Concerning the
money order, since you leave me the choice, you
could make it payable at Geimüller's or Schüller's.
The full amount would therefore be 70 ducats
for all four works. I do not understand any
other money than Viennese ducats; how many
thalers and gulden that makes, is no affair of
mine, for I am a bad <em>business</em> man and reckoner.</p>

<p>There is an end of the troublesome business.
So I name it, because I only wish it could be
otherwise in the world. There ought to be an
artistic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">depôt</i> where the artist need only hand in
his art-work in order to receive what he asks for.
As things are, one must be half a business man,
and how can one understand,&mdash;good heavens!&mdash;that's
what I really call <em>troublesome</em>. As for
the Leipzig O (?) let them just go on talking;
<em>they</em> will never by their chatter confer immortality
on any one, neither can they take it away from
any one for whom Apollo has destined it. Now,
may heaven have <em>you and yours</em> in its keeping.
For some time I have not been well; and so it
is now somewhat difficult for me to write notes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
still more so alphabet letters. I hope that we
shall often have opportunity to assure ourselves
that you are a great friend to me, and that I am</p>

<h3>VII.<br />
Letter from Wegeler and Eleonore von Breuning
to Beethoven.</h3>

<p class= "right" style="padding-right: 1em; "><em>Coblentz</em>, 28 <em>December</em>, 1825.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 4em; ">My dear old Louis.</p>

<p>I cannot allow one of Ries' ten children
to leave Vienna without recalling him to your
remembrance. If during the twenty-eight years
since I left Vienna, you have not received a
long letter from me every two months, you must
put it down to your own silence after the first
letters which I sent you. It should not be so
and especially now that we other old people
live so entirely in the past and derive our chief
pleasure in recollections of our youth. For me
at least, my acquaintance and my firm friendship
to you, thanks to your good mother whom God
now blesses, is a guiding star in my life, towards
which I turn with pleasure.... I raise
my eyes to you as to a hero, and I am proud to
be able to say: 'I have had some influence on
his development; he confided in me his ambitions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and his dreams; and when later he was so often
misunderstood, I knew quite well what he
wanted.' God be praised that I have been able
to speak of you with my wife, and now with my
children! My mother-in-law's house was more
your home than your own home, especially after
the death of your good mother. Tell us still
once more, 'I think of you both in joy and in
sorrow.' A man, even when he has risen as high
as you, is only happy once in his life: when he
is young. Your thoughts should hark back
happily many times to the stones of Bonn,
Godesburg, Pépinière, etc. Now I want to
speak of myself, of ourselves, to give you an
example of how you ought to reply to me.</p>

<p>After my return from Vienna in 1796, things
went rather badly with me. For a long time I
had to rely for a living on my consultations as
a doctor, and that lasted for several years in this
wretched country, before I could even make a
bare livelihood. Then I became a professor with
a salary, and I married. A year later I had a
daughter who is still living and who is quite
accomplished. In addition to a very clear head,
she has the quiet ways of her father; and she
plays admirably some of Beethoven's Sonatas.
She can claim no merit for this, for it is an inborn
gift with her. In 1807 I had a son who is now
studying medicine in Berlin. In four years I
shall send him to Vienna. Will you look after
him for me? I celebrated, in August, my 60th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
birthday by a party of sixty friends and acquaintances,
including the chief people of Bonn.
I have lived here since 1807, and have a fine
house and a good position. My superiors are
satisfied with me, and the King has given me
some orders and medals. Lore and I are content.
Now that I have told you all about ourselves,
it is your turn....</p>

<p>Do you never wish to turn your eyes from
the tower of St. Stephen's? Has travel no
charms for you? Do you never wish to see the
Rhine again? With every good wish from
Madam Lore and myself,</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10em; margin-top: 1.5em; ">Your very old friend,</p>
<p class="right" style= "padding-right: 2em; "><span class="smcap">Wegeler</span>.</p>

<p class= "right" style="padding-right: 1em; "><em>Coblentz</em>, 29 <em>December</em>, 1825.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 4em; ">Dear Beethoven&mdash;dear for such a long time!</p>

<p>It was my wish that Wegeler should write
to you again. Now that this is done, I should
like to add a few words&mdash;not only to recall myself
to your remembrance, but to renew the
pressing question whether you have not a desire
to see the Rhine and your birthplace again, and
to give Wegeler and me the greatest joy possible.
Our Lenchen thanks you for so many happy
hours; she delights in hearing us speak of you;
she knows all the little adventures of our happy
youthful days at Bonn&mdash;of the quarrel and the
reconciliation.... How happy she would be
to see you! Unfortunately, the little one has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
no special aptitude for music; but she has done
so much by application and perseverance that
she can play your Sonatas, Variations, etc.; and
as music is always the greatest relaxation for
Wegeler, she is thus able to give him many
happy hours. Julius has some talent for music,
but up to the present it has been neglected; for
the last six months, he has been learning the
violoncello with zest and pleasure; and as he has
a good teacher in Berlin I believe that he will
get on well. The two children are tall and resemble
their father; they also possess that fine
cheery disposition which Wegeler, thanks to
God, has not even yet lost.... He takes great
pleasure in playing the themes of your Variations;
the old ones have the greater preference,
but he often plays the new ones, too, with incredible
patience. Your <em>Opferlied</em> is placed above
everything. Wegeler never goes to his room
without putting it on the piano. So, dear Beethoven,
you can see how lasting and real a thing
is the remembrance which we always have of
you! Tell us then just once that this is not worthless
to you, and that we are not quite forgotten.
If it were not so difficult to do as one wishes,
we should already have been to Vienna to see
my brother, and have the pleasure of seeing you
again; but such a journey is out of the question
now that our son is at Berlin. Wegeler has
told you how everything goes with us&mdash;we should
do wrong to complain. Even the most difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
times have been better for us than for hundreds
of others. The greatest blessing is that we all
keep well and that we have such good and noble
children. Yes, they have hardly given us any
trouble, and they are such merry and happy little
people. Lenchen has had only one great grief; it
was when our poor Burscheid died: a loss none
of us will ever forget. Adieu, dear Beethoven,
and think of us as the most loyal of friends.</p>

<h3>VIII.<br />
To Dr. <span class="smcap">Franz Wegeler</span>.</h3>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 1em; "><em>Vienna</em>, 7<em>th</em> <em>October</em>, 1826.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 4em; ">My dear old friend.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how much pleasure your
letter and that of your Lorchen gave me. Certainly,
a reply ought to have been sent with
lightning speed, but I am generally somewhat
careless about writing, because I think that the
better sort of men know me without this. I
often compose the answer in my mind, but when
I wish to write it down, I usually throw the pen
away, because I cannot write as I feel. I remember
all the love which you have constantly
shown me, for instance, when you had my room
whitewashed, and so pleasantly surprised me.
It is the same with the Breuning family. If
we were separated, that happened in the natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
course of things; every one must pursue and try
to attain distinction in his calling; but the eternal
unshaken foundations of virtue held us ever
firmly united. Unfortunately, I cannot write to
you to-day so much as I wished, as I am bed-ridden,
and therefore confine myself to answering
certain points of your letter.</p>

<p>You write that I am somewhere spoken of
as a natural son of the late King of Prussia;
I, likewise, heard of this long ago, but have made
it a principle never to write anything about myself,
nor to reply to anything written about me.
So I willingly leave it to you to make known to
the world the uprightness of my parents, and
especially of my mother. You write about your
son. I need not say that if he comes here he
will find in me a friend and father, and if I
can help, or be of service to him in any way, I
will gladly do so.</p>

<p>I still have the silhouette of your Lorchen,
from which you will see that all the goodness
and affection shown to me in my youth are still
dear to me.</p>

<p>Of my diplomas, I will only tell you briefly,
that I am honorary member of the Royal Society
of Sciences of Sweden, as well as of Amsterdam,
and also honorary citizen of Vienna. A short
time ago a certain Dr. Spiker took with him my
last great Symphony with chorus to Berlin; it
is dedicated to the King, and I had to write the
dedication with my own hand. I had already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sought permission through the Embassy to be
allowed to dedicate this work to the King, and
it was granted. At Dr. Spiker's instigation, I
was obliged myself to hand over to him the
manuscript for the King, with the corrections
in my own handwriting, as it was to be placed
in the Royal Library. Something has been said
to me about the red order of the Eagle, 2nd
class; what will come of it, I do not know, for
I have never sought such tokens of honour; yet
in these times, they would not be unwelcome to
me for many reasons.</p>

<p>Moreover, my motto is always: 'Nulla dies
sine linea,' and if I ever let the Muse sleep, it
is only that she may awaken all the stronger. I
hope still to bring some great works into the
world, and then, like an old child, to end my
earthly career amongst good men.</p>

<p>You will also soon receive some music from
Schott Brothers of Mainz. The portrait which
you receive enclosed, is certainly an artistic
masterpiece, but it is not the last which has been
taken of me. With regard to tokens of honour,
which I know will give you pleasure, I may also
mention that a medal was sent to me by the late
King of France with the inscription: '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Donné
par le Roi a Monsieur Beethoven'</i>, accompanied
by a very obliging letter from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premier
gentilhomme du Roi Duc de Châtres</i>.</p>

<p>My dear friend, for to-day, farewell. For the
rest, the remembrance of the past takes hold of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
me, and not without many tears will you receive
this letter. A beginning is now made, and you
will soon get another letter, and the more frequently
you write, the more pleasure will you
give me. No inquiry is necessary on either side
concerning our friendship; and so, farewell. I
beg you to kiss and embrace your dear Lorchen
and the children in my name, and at the same
time to think of me. God be with you all.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10em; margin-top: 1.5em; ">As always, your true friend who honours you,</p>

<p>Fortunately I received your second letter
through Breuning. I am still too weak to
answer it, but you may believe me that everything
in it is welcome and desirable. My recovery,
if I may call it so, is very slow; a fourth
operation is to be expected, although the doctors
do not say anything about it. I am patiently
thinking that every evil has sometimes its good.
But now I am astonished to see from your last
letter that you have not received anything. From
the present letter you will perceive that I wrote
to you already on the tenth of December last
year. With the portrait, it is the same, as you
will see from the date when you receive it.

offered, but they remained lying here up to this
date; moreover until now, it was difficult to send
them back. You will now get the portrait by
post, through Schott and Co., who also send you
the music. I should like to tell you still much
more, but I am too weak, thus I can only embrace
you and your Lorchen in spirit.</p>

<h3>X.<br />
To Sir <span class="smcap">G. Smart</span> in London.</h3>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 1em; "><em>March</em> 6, 1827.</p>

<p>I do not doubt that you, dear Sir, have
received through Herr Moscheles my letter of
the 22nd of February; but as I have found by
chance among my papers, S.'s address, I do not
hesitate to write direct to you and recall my request
again to your mind.</p>

<p>Up to now I cannot look forward to an end
of my terrible illness; on the contrary, my sufferings,
and with it, my cares, have still increased.
On the 29th of February I underwent my fourth
operation, and it may be, perhaps, my fate to
undergo a fifth or even more. If this continues,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
my illness will surely last till the middle of summer,
and what will then become of me? How
shall I then manage to live till I have recovered
strength enough to gain my own living by my
pen? In short, I will not trouble you further
with my complaints, and refer only to my letter
of the 22nd of February, asking you to use all
your influence to induce the Philharmonic
Society to carry out their former resolution
concerning the concert for my benefit.</p>


<h3>XI.<br />
To <span class="smcap">I. Moscheles</span> in London.</h3>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 1em; "><em>Vienna, March</em> 14, 1827.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 4em; ">My dear Moscheles.</p>

<p>Some days ago I found out through Herr
Lewinger that you inquired in a letter to him
of the 10th of February regarding the state of
my illness, of which so many different rumours
have been spread about. Although I have no
doubts whatever that my letter of the 24th of
February has arrived, which will explain everything
you desire to know, I can but thank you
for your sympathy with my sad lot, and beseech
you to be solicitous about the request which you
know of from my first letter, and I am quite
convinced that, in union with Sir Smart and other
of my friends, you will succeed in bringing about
a favourable result for me at the Philharmonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Society. I have once more written to Sir Smart
about it.</p>

<p>On the 27th of February I underwent the
fourth operation, and there are visible symptoms
that I shall have to suffer a fifth. What does
it tend to, and what will become of me if it
continues for some time longer? A hard lot,
indeed, has fallen upon me! However, I submit
to the will of fate, and only pray to God so to
ordain it in His divine will, that I may be protected
from want as long as I have to endure
death in life. This will give me strength to bear
my lot, however terrible it may be, with humble
submission to the will of the Most High.</p>

<p>Therefore, my dear Moscheles, I entrust
once more my affair to you, and remain with
greatest respect ever</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10em; margin-top: 1.5em; ">Your friend,</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em; "><span class="smcap">L. van Beethoven</span>.</p>

<p>Hummel is here and has called on me several times.</p>


<h3>XII.<br />
To <span class="smcap">I. Moscheles</span> in London.</h3>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 1em; "><em>Vienna, March</em> 18, 1827.</p>


<p>With what emotion I read your letter of the
1st March is not to be described in words. This
magnanimity of the Philharmonic Society, with
which they anticipated my request, has touched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
my inmost heart. I, therefore, ask you, dear
Moscheles, to be the organ through which I can
express my most heartfelt thanks to the Philharmonic
Society for their sympathy and help.
Tell these worthy men that if God restores me
to health, I shall try practically to show my
gratitude by works, and that I leave it to the
Society to choose what I shall write for them.
A whole sketched Symphony (the 10th) is in
my desk, also a new Overture, or even something
else. As regards the concert which the
Philharmonic Society has resolved on giving for
my benefit, I beg the Society not to give up this
intention. In short, I shall try to fulfil any wish
expressed by the Society, and never have I
undertaken a work with such ardour as will now
be displayed. May it only please God to restore
me soon again to health, and then I shall prove
to these magnanimous Englishmen that I know
how to value their sympathy to me in my sad
condition.</p>

<p>I was compelled to accept the whole sum of
1,000 fl., since I was then in the disagreeable
position of having to draw out invested money.</p>

<p>Your noble behaviour I shall never forget,
and I shall soon render my thanks in particular
to Sir Smart and Herr Stump. The metronomised
<em>Ninth Symphony</em> please hand to the Philharmonic
Society. Enclosed find the markings.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10em; margin-top: 1.5em; ">Your most devoted friend,</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em; "><span class="smcap">Beethoven</span>.</p>

<h3>XIII.<br />
<span class="smcap">Schindler</span> to <span class="smcap">B. Schott Sohne</span>, Mainz.</h3>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 1em; "><em>Vienna, April</em> 12, 1827.</p>

<p>I would already have liked to take the liberty
of forwarding to you the enclosed document in
the name of our Beethoven as his dying request;
but after the passing away of our friend, there
was so much business to attend to that I found
it impossible. Unfortunately, it was not possible
to get the document legalised, for that Beethoven
would have had to sign it at the law court, which
was utterly impossible. Beethoven, however,
requested Court Councillor v. Breuning and
myself to add our names as witnesses, as we
were both present. We, therefore, believe that
it will serve the purpose for which it was drawn
up. I must further mention that in this document
you possess the <em>last</em> signature of this
immortal man; for this was the last stroke of his
pen.</p>

<p>I cannot now refrain from telling you something
about the last hours when he was still
conscious (namely, on the 24th of March, from
early morning until about one o'clock in the
afternoon), for to you, sirs, this will surely be
of great interest. When I came to him on the
morning of the twenty-fourth of March, I found
his face quite drawn; moreover, he was so weak
that with the greatest effort he could only utter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
two or three intelligible words. The <em>Ordinarius</em>
soon arrived, and, after watching him for a few
moments, said to me: 'Beethoven's end is
rapidly approaching.' As the business of the
Will had been settled, so far as was possible,
the previous day, there remained for us only
one ardent wish: to get him reconciled with
heaven, in order that the world might also be
shown that he ended his life as a true Christian.
The Professor Ordinarius wrote it down, and
begged him in the name of all his friends, to
partake of the Sacrament for the dying, whereupon
he answered calmly and steadily: 'I will.'
The doctor went away, leaving me to see to this.
Beethoven then said to me: 'My only request
is that you write to Schott and send him the
document: he <em>will need it</em>. And write to him
in my name, for I am too weak, and say that
I much desire him to send the wine. Also, if
you have still time to-day, write to England.'
The clergyman came about twelve o'clock, and
the religious ceremony took place in the most
edifying manner. And now for the first time
he seemed to feel that his end was approaching,
for the clergyman had scarcely gone when he
said to me and to young v. Breuning: '<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Plaudite
amici, com&oelig;dia finita est!</i>' Have I not always
said that it would be thus? He then,
once again, begged me not to forget Schott; also
again to write in his name to the Philharmonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Society<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> to thank them for their great gift, and
to add that the Society had comforted his last
days, and that even on the brink of the grave
he thanked the Society and the whole English
nation for the great gift. God bless them.</p>

<p>At this moment the chancery servant of v.
Breuning entered the room with the case of wine
and the decoction, about quarter to one o'clock.
I put the two bottles of Rüdesheimer and the
two other bottles of the decoction on the table
at his bedside. He looked at them, saying:
''Tis a pity, a pity, too late!' These were his
last words. Immediately after, commenced the
death throes, so that he could not utter a sound.
Towards evening he lost consciousness and became
delirious, which lasted up to the evening
of the 25th, when visible signs of approaching
death appeared. In spite of it, he died only on
the 26th at quarter to six o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>This death struggle was terrible to behold,
for his constitution, especially his chest, was like
that of a giant. Of your Rüdesheimer, he took
still a few spoonfuls until he passed away.</p>

<p>Thus I have the pleasure of acquainting you
with the last three days of our unforgettable
friend.</p>

<p>In conclusion, accept the assurance, etc.,</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Symphony</span> No. 1 in C major, Opus 21.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to the Baron van Swieten.</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio molto&mdash;Allegro con brio&mdash;Andante cantabile
con moto&mdash;Minuetto e Trio&mdash;Finale.</i></p>

<p>Although this Symphony was originally performed
at the first of the composer's personally-arranged
concerts in Vienna, on April 2nd, 1800,
the sketches for it extend over the preceding five
years. Though the symphony is in the composer's
first period style, it does not rank amongst the
very finest works of this period. The slow introduction
starts on a dominant seventh out of the
key.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The first movement proper is orthodox in form,
and only once or twice do we catch a glimpse of
the Beethoven to be, notably in the muttering bass
passages near the end of the exposition. The
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> which is also in Sonata-form proper and
opens fugally, contains some original drum-work.
The Minuet, purely Haydnesque, shows a certain
delight in orchestral colour.</p>

</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score_p110.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>In the trio the first chord is struck no less than
nine times, as though the young composer was
entirely occupied with the charm of his orchestral
colouring. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> is not highly individual.
The work is scored for strings, wood-wind, two
horns, two trumpets and two drums.</p>


<h3>2nd <span class="smcap">Symphony</span> in D, Opus 36.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to Prince Carl Lichnovsky.</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio molto&mdash;Allegro con brio&mdash;Larghetto&mdash;Scherzo
and Trio&mdash;Allegro molto.</i></p>

<p>In the Second Symphony, which is a great advance
on the first, the composer's hold of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
subject is much firmer and the subjects themselves
are more striking.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score1_p111.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Larghetto</i> is full of lovely curves,
and there is some charming conversational work
between the wood-wind instruments. The horn
passage is the precursor of many fine symphony
subjects of a martial nature for the horns.</p>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score2_p111.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>Whilst the chromatic harmony is purely Mozartian,
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> is a genuine Beethovenian
outburst, full of verve and piquant in touch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score3_p111.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>There is a feeling of broadness about the brilliant
and energetic <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> which is absent from the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> of the First Symphony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<h3>3rd <span class="smcap">Symphony</span>, Opus 35, "Eroica" in E flat.</h3>
<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to Prince Lobkovitz.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro con brio&mdash;Marcia funèbre&mdash;Scherzo and
Trio&mdash;Finale.</i></p>

<p>This Symphony was completed in August, 1804,
and first performed on April 7th, 1805. The
French Ambassador at Vienna had suggested that
Beethoven should write a work on the grand scale
based on his admiration for Napoleon as the
saviour of France from the horrors of the Revolution;
and it is a fact that Beethoven actually dedicated
this Symphony to Napoleon, but when the
news came that the First Consul had declared
himself Emperor, Beethoven tore up the title page
in a rage and added the following superscription:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>
<p><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sinfonia Eroica, composta per festeggiare il
Souvenire di un grand' Uomo,
E dedicata A Sua Altezza Serenissima
Il Principe di Lobkovitz da Luigi van Beethoven,
Op. 55 No. III. delle Sinfonie.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of the grandest and most powerful of
the works in the Second Period style. It is noteworthy
that all the principal themes are based on
the intervals of the common chord, or on the
little pendant of the diminished third which forms
the tail of the first subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The work opens <em>in medias res</em> with two strong
chords, the chief subject entering on the cellos.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/score_p113.jpg" width="500" height="184" alt="score_p113" />
</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score_p113.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>There is some lovely responsive work between
the wood-wind and the string bands for the second
subject. The development is masterly and embraces
a wonderful new subject, first entering on
the oboes in the strange key of E minor. The
recapitulation is approached in a marvellous way&mdash;the
climax of the development being reached
with a chord in C flat, the echoing reflections of
which gradually die away until they reach a mere
shimmering of violins, into which is suddenly
thrown an unexpected entrance of the horn with
the chief theme in the tonic key. Was it a
slip? Of course not. Rather a stroke of genius.
The movement has an immense <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">coda</i>, which with
Beethoven at this period amounts to a second
development.</p>

<p>The Funeral March is one of the grandest
things in music. It is a pageant of a great world
tribulation rather than an elegy for Napoleon, who
was certainly not dead at that time. More probably
Beethoven's mind was occupied with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
misery and wretchedness caused by war than with
the single hero of that period who reaped both glory
and dishonour at one blow. The oboe subject
in the Trio portion is only one of many wonderful
passages in this piece. The speaking bass melodies,
the majestic second subject on the strings
almost bursting with eloquence, and the wonderful
coda, not broken-hearted but buoyed up by the
rhythm of things viewed broadly. Any attempt to
connect the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> with Napoleon must
fail ludicrously. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> is simply one of
Beethoven's finest productions in one of his bubbling,
vivacious moods. The three horns have a
subject which appears to be a genuine hunting call.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/score_p114.jpg" width="500" height="132" alt="score_p114" />
</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score_p114.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>It is a seven-bar phrase, the echoes to which are
enchantingly coloured. The common chordal formation
of the duple time interjection near the end
suggests something more massive, and the little
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">coda</i> figure, <em>E flat, E natural, F</em>, comes from the
opening theme of the Symphony. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> is
an amazing set of variations, the bass of the eight-bar
theme being displayed and varied many times
before the melody itself enters at the eightieth bar;
and even then we continually hark back to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
bass. It is not until the close, after the melody
has been given at a slow rate on the wood-wind in
its proper setting, that it is taken up triumphantly
and carried victoriously into the coda. Beethoven
used this particular theme four times&mdash;in a Contretanz,
in his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> to the <em>Men of Prometheus</em>,
as the theme for his set of variations for piano,
Opus 35 and in this Symphony. This curious
method of writing a set of variations recurs 20
years later in the Ninth Symphony. A somewhat
similar process has been adopted by Elgar in his
<em>Enigma Variations</em>, as the theme used there is said
to be the counter-subject of a concealed melody.</p>


<h3>4th <span class="smcap">Symphony</span> in B flat, Opus 60.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to Count Oppensdorf.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio&mdash;Allegro vivace&mdash;Adagio&mdash;Menuetto&mdash;Finale.</i></p>

<p>This happy and serene work has been undeservedly
overshadowed by its two towering neighbours.
Schumann has called it a slender Greek maiden
between two Norse giants. The opening <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>
sounds the only dark mood in the Symphony.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/score_p115.jpg" width="500" height="201" alt="score_p115" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>It is lashed on to the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i> by some powerful
violin scales.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score1_p116.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>The flute, oboe and bassoon converse sportively
over the second subject. A strange sequential
passage in unison upon the strings in three-bar
phrases following a happy little canon on the
wood-wind instruments and some powerful syncopations
lead in to the development. An atmosphere
of humour and good feeling permeates the
movement.</p>

<p>The lovely melody which forms the chief theme
of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> is given to the violins. It is accompanied
by a strong persistent rhythmic figure,
which is transferred later on to the drums with
great effect. The wood-wind work and the horn
passages are exquisite.</p>

<p>The third movement <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro vivace</i> is full of
fun, lively syncopations and duple time effects
giving it more of the nature of a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/score2_p116.jpg" width="500" height="199" alt="score2_p116" />

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score2_p116.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>It has a charmingly tender trio and a coda of
exquisite poetry ending with Schumann's "Just
one more question for the horn to put" before the
final crash. This is one of the longest movements
which Beethoven has written in this form. The
bright, sunny mood of the opening movements
increases in the radiant <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>. There the modulations
are surprising and the touches of humour
delightful. The little skirmish on the part of the
bassoon just before the return, the whimsical little
notes on the flutes and violins, the augmentation
of the subject as it fades away into the stealthy
questionings between the violins and bassoons
near the end, are but a few of the many little
quips and sallies.</p>


<h3>5th <span class="smcap">Symphony</span> in C minor, Opus 67.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to the Prince von Lobkovitz and the
Count von Rasumovsky.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro con brio&mdash;Andante con moto&mdash;Scherzo
and Trio&mdash;Finale Allegro.</i></p>

<p>This famous Symphony with its rugged first
movement, its lovely <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i>, its mysterious
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> and its proud, fiery <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>, was first performed
together with the so-called Sixth Symphony
on December 22nd, 1808. The Pastoral
Symphony No. 6 was probably written before the
5th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The first movement opens without introduction
with the famous phrase of four unison notes which
Beethoven once explained as "Thus fate knocks
at the door."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/score1_p118.jpg" width="500" height="217" alt="score1_p118" />
</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score1_p118.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>From this tiny germ the whole of this fierce
stormy movement is evolved. Not even the beautiful
tender second subject, nor the lovely little
unbarred oboe cadenza can win it away from this
rugged fierce mood. When this second subject appears
in the recapitulation, still in the minor, the
atoning major outburst which immediately follows
is quickly brushed aside by the impatience of the
reinstated first theme. Even the limitations of the
old-fashioned horns and trumpets in those days
seemed to be turned to advantage in the colossal
bare thirds and fourths of the "Fate" notes.</p>

<p>The chief theme of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i>, wonderfully
sad, yet wonderfully beautiful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
is further enhanced by one of those majestic
marching subjects which only Beethoven could
conceive. The beauty of the wood-wind work is
remarkable and the coda is full of strange fancies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/score1_p119.jpg" width="500" height="165" alt="score1_p119" />
</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score1_p119.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> has some eloquent bass passages,
and its rhythmic horn figures are full of veiled
mystery and heavy with some dark foreboding.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/score2_p119.jpg" width="500" height="144" alt="score2_p119" />
</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score2_p119.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>The trio is a fiery <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fugato</i> with strange outbursts
on the basses. The curious hesitations on its re-appearance
and the weird bridge passages at the
end, with the long sustained chord on the strings
and the mysterious drum tapping, cause the movement
to veer gradually round to the fiery march-like
coda, with its light, graceful, contrasted episodes.
The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> theme insinuates itself into
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> near the coda, which is of amazing
brilliancy, ending with a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i> which fairly
sweeps the hearer away with it.</p>

<p>The orchestra is the largest the composer has
used so far. It includes three trombones, double
bassoon, and piccolo, which, however, are only
used for the brilliant <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>


<h3>6th <span class="smcap">Symphony</span> (Pastoral) in F, Opus 68.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to Prince von Lobkovitz and Count von
Rasumovsky.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><em>Pastoral Symphony, or a recollection of country life.<br />
More an expression of feeling than a painting.</em></p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro ma non troppo&mdash;Andante molto moto&mdash;Allegro&mdash;Allegretto.</i></p>

<p>This Symphony, often slighted on account of
its so-called realisms and its classification amongst
"programme music," is, nevertheless, one of the
finest pieces in the whole range of absolute music.
The labelling of the various movements by Beethoven&mdash;"Joyous
sensations roused by arrival in
the country," "Scene by the brook," "Merry
gathering of country peasants," "Thunderstorm,"
"Glad and grateful feeling after the storm"&mdash;is
quite superfluous. How artistically Beethoven has
introduced the bird calls&mdash;the quail, the nightingale,
and the cuckoo&mdash;into just the right place&mdash;the
coda of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i>. And the thunder-storm.
What a magnificent introduction to the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> it makes! Beethoven has never once
transgressed the great principles of form and
balance in this Symphony.</p>

<p>The opening movement is a true country picture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
full of the tonics and dominants of summer happiness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score1_p121.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>Bird-like twitterings and horn calls come from
all directions, yet how perfectly balanced it all is
and what a marvel of development! The scene by
the brook with its drowsy re-iterated figure on the
under-current of divided strings is the very Bourdon
ever sounding in Nature herself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/score2_p121.jpg" width="500" height="188" alt="score2_p121" />
</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score2_p121.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>Wagner has not forgotten this in his <em>Woodland
Murmurs</em>. The dance of the villagers, founded
on the old country dances, is full of humorous
touches, the drowsy bassoon notes, the romp
round, and into this almost without warning,
breaks the storm. A remarkably controlled storm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
it is, too, free from any vulgarity. A lovely
bit of blue sky showing at the end, leads straight
into the shepherd's song of thankfulness, which
although containing several interesting points, the
triple pedal at the opening with its horn yodel,
etc., is somewhat lengthy and not very interesting.
Beethoven had once intended to introduce words
and chorus here, "Lord, we thank Thee," and it
seems a pity that this idea was not carried out.</p>


<h3>7th <span class="smcap">Symphony</span> in A major, Opus 92.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to Count Moritz von Fries.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Poco sostenuto&mdash;Vivace&mdash;Allegretto&mdash;Scherzo&mdash;Finale.</i></p>

<p>This Symphony was completed in May, 1812,
but was not performed until December, 1813, at
a Concert undertaken by Maelzel for the benefit
of the wounded soldiers at the Battle of Hanau,
October 30th, which Concert also contained
Beethoven's <em>Battle Symphony</em>. In form, the
Symphony contains nothing unusual. In subject,
it is full of romance and colour from beginning
to end.</p>

<p>Opening with a long introduction, which is
almost a movement in itself, this contains a strong
marching figure, and runs into the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vivace</i> by the
means of a half cadence. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vivace</i>, a rhythmical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
movement in 6-8 time, is full of a verve and
vitality which seems to reach its fullest power on
the horns and wind instruments with their tucketting
rhythms.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/score_p123.jpg" width="500" height="188" alt="score_p123" />
</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score_p123.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coda</i> amounts to a second development, and
the whole movement goes with a splendid swing
from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Rhythm but of another kind is also paramount
in the elegiac pageant-like movement designated
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegretto</i>, but curiously enough marked by
Beethoven himself at 76, by Maelzel's newly-invented
metronome. It is a highly coloured
pageant, seen through a veil of mist, typified by
the wonderful six-four chord on the wood-wind
with which it commences and concludes. The
structure of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> (here marked <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i>) has
a strong relationship with its splendid fire and
strong duple time effects to that in the 6th
Symphony. The romance of the Trio with its
wonderful low horn work is equally fine, and the
movement is broadened out to considerable length
by the return of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trio</i> and of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i>, thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
making it a kind of Rondo&mdash;A, B, A, B, A&mdash;to
say nothing of the humorous juxta-position of the
two near the end.</p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> is also planned on the big scale,
colossal in force and mighty in stride. There is
a curious perversity of scale in the First Subject
as though Beethoven was no longer satisfied with
the ordinary major. The marvellous stride of the
Bass at the end is not the least amazing of the
features in this wonderful movement. Perhaps,
this symphony holds together as one complete
whole more than any other. It gives one the
impression of having been written uninterruptedly
from the first movement to last.</p>


<h3>8th <span class="smcap">Symphony</span>, in F major, Opus 93.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro vivace e con brio&mdash;Allegretto&mdash;Presto&mdash;Allegro
vivace.</i></p>

<p>"The little one," as Beethoven affectionately
called this symphony, was written during four
months of the summer and early autumn of 1812.
It is smaller in scale, slighter in texture, than the
other symphonies. Erroneously regarded as a
return to an earlier style, and labouring for some
time under the absurd title of "Ballet-Symphony,"
it has been somewhat neglected in the past. Without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the grandeur of the Fifth or the romance of
the Seventh, it contains a lasting, if less easy,
charm, perfect finish, and a rich fund of good
humour. Only a small orchestra is used, but it
is handled in a masterly way, as the octave drums
in the masterly finale, the charming <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">staccato</i> chords
for wood-wind with boisterous interjections from
the full orchestra, the running conversations between
the violins and the basses, fully testify.</p>

<p>The first movement is in the usual development
form.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score1_p125.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>A sprightly <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegretto</i> takes the place of the
slow movement. The third movement goes back
to the early minuet, instead of the Scherzo.</p>

and development which its astounding
interruptions so amply justifies finally.</p>

<h3>9th <span class="smcap">Symphony</span>, in D minor,<br />

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro ma non troppo un poco maestoso&mdash;Molto
vivace&mdash;Adagio molto e cantabile&mdash;Choral Finale.</i></p>

<p>It is important to remember, as M. Romain
Rolland has reminded us, that this is not a Choral
Symphony in the strict sense of the term, but a
"Symphony with a Final Chorus." The choral
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> was written by Beethoven in a separate MS.,
and, as with most of his other final movements, he
seems to have expected no closer connection with
the preceding three movements than that of general
suitability. His original idea for a last movement
to this Symphony was the Finale of the String
Quartet in A minor, Opus 132, but for some reason
or other his sketches for voices on Schiller's Ode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
were taken up again and worked into a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> for
this Symphony. Ten years had elapsed between
the completion of the Eighth Symphony and the
consummation of the Ninth, the colossal first three
movements of which are on the highest plane of
all music. As to the complete success of the choral
numbers, opinions differ widely. The first movement,
colossal in conception and dignified in tone,
has moods of great passion and wonderful tenderness.
The opening theme is mighty in aspiration,
rugged in power.</p>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score1_p127.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>The second movement is the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i>, one of
Beethoven's longest, and perhaps his very finest.
It is all brought about by the little germ theme
of three notes, which, amongst other things,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>suggests
an unusual tuning of the drums in octaves.
A <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fugato</i> follows, after which the second subject
enters in the unorthodox key of C major. It is
here that many conductors take upon themselves
to thicken Beethoven's wood-wind melody, with
the brass instruments. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trio</i> is built up on
a delightful double theme ushered in by the very
first entry of the bass trombone.</p>

</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score1_p128.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> opens with a melody of the utmost
nobility, perfect in curve, and of a marvellous
serenity.</p>

</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score2_p128.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>A sudden modulation brings us to a new subject
in D major in 3/4 time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The first subject then re-appears in G major, this
is followed by a mystic passage in E flat major,
in which fragments of the first theme appear after
the manner of a dreamy meditation in which there
is some magnificent work for the horn. The first
subject then appears in the original key and
gradually passes over into a solemn and majestic
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">coda</i>. The form is original, even with Beethoven.</p>

<p>Immediately a huge hubbub breaks out from the
whole of the wood-wind instruments. A short
hasty review of a few bars from each of the first
three movements follows, and after the bass instruments
had commented rather brusquely on
these appearances, the famous tune in D major
breaks in on the cellos and basses alone. The
melody gradually unfolds itself but finally is
suddenly broken off by the discordant hubbub
again, and the solo baritone voice enters with the
words, "O brothers, not these tones."</p>

</div>

<p class="center ebhide"><a href="music/score_p129.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>The opening quartet and chorus is based entirely
on the famous tune. The following number
is a tenor solo and chorus to the accompaniment
of a military band with all the appurtenances
thereof&mdash;big drum, triangle and cymbals. A broad
chorus follows, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante maestoso, a capella</i> in
style; and as movement after movement enters, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
devout feeling of mysticism and awe increases,
until the final chorus</p>

<p class="center"><em>Chant one greeting, myriads countless</em></p>

<p>caps with warm dazzling sunlight one of the
highest peaks in all music.</p>

</div>



<h2>THE PIANOFORTE SONATAS</h2>

<h3>1st <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Op. 2, No. 1, in F minor.</h3>

<p>The first Sonata has the usual four movements
of the Haydn form: <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Adagio&mdash;Menuetto
and Trio&mdash;Prestissimo</i>. The first and the last are
in the usual Sonata form proper. The slow movement
follows Mozartian lines. This Sonata is the
first of the set of three in this Opus, which are
all dedicated to Joseph Haydn, and the fact of
such a superscription points to the respect which
Beethoven had for the older composer, although
he could not find it in his heart to continue with
him long as his pupil. The whole of the Sonata,
which appeared for the first time in 1796 and was
probably written much earlier, is decidedly conventional
in form, and shews us Beethoven starting
on the lines laid down by those who went before
him&mdash;Philip Emanuel Bach, Haydn, and Mozart.</p>

<p>The first movement is pure Haydn music, and
the only glimmer of the future Beethoven comes
in with that lovely little tune at the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coda</i>. The
development portion is thin and characterless.
The first subject of the second movement was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
adapted from an early pianoforte quartet. A
similar process was resorted to in the first movement
of the third Sonata of this set for the second
subject. The expression of this movement is not
deep, nor does it sound that note of serenity which
we regard as the chief characteristic of a Beethoven
slow movement of the mature period.</p>

<p>The <em>Minuet and Trio</em> is purely Mozartian,
especially in its double counterpoint and its inversion
of parts. Some characteristic touches are
found in the second subject of the last movement,
which is in two parts, and the use of an altogether
new subject in the development portion. This
device is next used in the Sonata in F, Opus 10,
No. 2&mdash;a device carried to great perfection in the
development portion of the first movement of the
<em>Eroica Symphony</em>. The use of this broad subject
does away with any idea of development, although
the movement is built up on a figure of three
chords, a point referred to in both codas. The
first part of the second subject has that weird,
foreboding feeling, which we feel frequently in
Schumann's music. Already he shews a striking
fondness for the diminished third; but the passage
is not particularly striking. Far otherwise is the
beautiful little tune of eight bars which forms the
second part of this subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>


<h3>2nd <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Op. 2, No. 2, in A.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro vivace&mdash;Largo appassionata&mdash;Scherzo
and Trio&mdash;Rondo grazioso.</i></p>

<p>There is a distinct advance in the second Sonata.
Although there are still the accepted four movements,
the Minuet has now become a Scherzo.
This Sonata was probably written shortly after the
first, and in it we see how quickly Beethoven took
a firm hold of form and design in construction.
There is a feeling of considerable power about the
first subject, and its short, pithy figures promise
well for the development portion, a fact of which
Beethoven takes immediate advantage.</p>

<p>The second subject has a dual tonality, beginning
in E minor and ending in E major. This,
of course, re-appears in the final section in A minor
and major. There is considerable double counterpoint,
and we have the characteristic rumblings in
the bass. The canon in three parts at the octave,
in the development portion, taxes the right hand
of most players. The recapitulation is shortened
and considerably altered.</p>

<p>In the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Largo Appassionata</i> we get very near to
the grandeur of Beethoven's middle style. The
opening subject has serenity, and there is scarcely
anything passionate in the whole movement which
breathes of solemn yet tender earnestness. This
movement may be regarded as either in Rondo
form or in Ternary form. There is a powerful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
episode in flats near the end, but the music closes
with an epilogue full of tender feeling.</p>

<p>We find a right boisterous joy in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i>,
which is evolved from one single little figure. The
sequence of dominant seventh chords in the bridge,
however, was already somewhat hackneyed even
at that time.</p>

<p>The final Rondo is a graceful movement which
owes much to Mozart. An episode leads to the
second subject in E major, and this in its turn to
the re-appearance of the first subject in varied form.
Then comes a stormy episode in the minor which
gradually subsides into the return of the first
subject, then of the second subject, and finally
winds up with a long <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">coda</i> containing reminiscences
of all the subjects.</p>


<h3>3rd <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 2, No. 3, in C major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro con brio&mdash;Adagio&mdash;Scherzo&mdash;Allegro
assai.</i></p>

<p>This, the third of the set of the three early
Sonatas dedicated to Haydn, appeared for the first
time on March 9th, 1796, when Beethoven was
twenty-six years of age. Eugen d'Albert regards
this Sonata as essentially a virtuoso piece. This
is saying rather much, although he is right in
warning the interpreter against any attempts to
render it mysterious by hyper-critical subtleties.</p>

<p>The first subject of the opening movement is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
typical Beethoven one, evolved from a short figure
of two bars. Some brilliant passage work then
occurs. It was certainly Beethoven's custom at
this early period to regard such passages in a more
physical sense. The second subject enters with a
dominant minor section, followed by a major
section, in which appears some fine canonic work.
The minor part of this subject, which was adapted
from an early pianoforte quartet which Beethoven
had written in his youthful period, abounds in the
turns and trills characteristic of that time. The
broken octaves in the coda are frequently rendered
now-a-days by alternate double octaves between
the two hands in demisemiquavers.</p>

<p>The development is much more Beethovenish,
containing some striking double octave cataclysms.
There is also a very fine enharmonic change from
an F minor chord to F sharp minor. The Coda
is noteworthy as it includes some fine arpeggio
effects and a striking slow <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cadenza</i>.</p>

<p>The second movement, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> in E major,
opens with one of Beethoven's dignified slow
themes, which is sandwiched in Rondo fashion
with disturbing episodes throughout. The first
episode (in E minor) contains conversational work
between the bass and the treble, the left hand
crossing the right for the latter. At the end of
the return of the first theme, there is a very striking
example of an interrupted cadence&mdash;the dominant
chord of E major being followed by the tonic
chord of C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> (three-four time) is in C major,
and should be taken at a fast rate. It is one of
those movements which would have been better
written in six-four time by running two bars into
one.</p>

<p>The final movement is a grandiose Rondo&mdash;six-eight
time&mdash;in C major, which requires a good
technique, especially for the left hand. The
second subject is somewhat conventional, but the
next episode contains one of those lovely hymn-like
tunes in which Beethoven delights. For the third
episode, the subject of the first episode is repeated,
but here in the tonic key; thus making the form
what is known as Modern Rondo or Sonata Rondo,
in contrast to the old Rondo in which every episode
was different. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coda</i> is remarkable and is certainly
of the virtuoso order. I never play it without
thinking of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coda</i> to Mendelssohn's <em>Wedding
March</em>. The sequences at the 15th bar after the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vivacissimo</i> are not easy to finger. D'Albert
fingers the upper part, 3, 4, 5, and the lower three
notes with the thumb. Larger hands will produce
a better effect by fingering the right hand top
notes, 4, 5, 5, and the alto, 2, 1, 1. The triple
shake near the end is frequently played by an
alternation of six-four chords in either hand.
There is a remarkable example of an interrupted
cadence here, where D becomes D sharp leading
to an A major chord. These unexpected rallentandos
and calando before the strepitous rush home
become a standing characteristic in Beethoven's
music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>


<h3>4th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 7, in E flat.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro molto e con brio&mdash;Largo con gran espressione&mdash;Allegretto
Minore&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p>This Sonata which appeared for the first time
on October 7, 1797, is dedicated to the Countess
Babette von Keglevics. The composer, at the age
of twenty-seven was rapidly winning his spurs,
but still wrote on the old lines and with the customary
four movements. His Minuet however
has now become a lively movement and lost all
traces of its origin in the stately dance. It is quite
likely, however, that the Minuets of Haydn and
Mozart were also taken at a lively rate, incompatible
with the dance.</p>

<p>The first movement in regular "Sonata Form"
is in six-eight time, in happy mood. The joyous
rhythm is occasionally emphasised by sforzando
syncopations. The subjects are all very taking,
and there are some striking modulations in the
development.</p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Largo</i> is full of religious calm. There is
a striking interrupted cadence at bar 19, and one
of those majestic march-like movements for the
second subject, which on its return at the end,
appears as a tenor melody. The movement is full
of rich colouring. The tones of the flutes and
other wood-wind instruments, may be imitated
in parts also the song of birds.</p>

<p>The first part of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i>, which takes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
place of the Minuet movement, is much more
extended than usual. In place of the Trio, we
have a movement in the tonic minor of low broken
chords, full of that brooding sadness to which
Schumann and Brahms in later days became so
prone. This is linked up, however, to the return
of the first joyous theme to which it forms an
effective foil. The final Rondo in E flat is real
Mozart, and Mozart at his best. Play the first
subject through, sixteen bars in length. Still the
bridge passage which follows is real Beethoven.
He seems fairly obsessed with his little figure,
unable to let it alone, repeating it no less than
thirteen times in succession. There is a virile
second subject. The middle episode is stormy and
difficult to play unless one divines intuitively the
right action. There is a remarkable enharmonic
change on the last page but one, where the tonality
is moved up a semitone from B flat to B natural
(a device of which the composer is fond), returning
seven bars later on by the chameleon-like
"diminished seventh" chord. Reference is made
in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coda</i> to the rhythm of the stormy middle
episode which is here turned to good use in the
brilliant peroration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<h3>5th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 10, No. 1, in C minor.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro molto e con brio&mdash;Adagio molto&mdash;Prestissimo.</i></p>

<p>This Sonata is dedicated to the Countess von
Brovne, and appeared for the first time on September
26, 1798. It is in three movements&mdash;the
slow movement in A flat major. There is no
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Minuet</i> or <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i>, the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> instead being instilled
with the spirit of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i>.</p>

<p>The first movement is the usual development
form, the first subject being composed in Beethoven's
usual manner of two figures here, (a)
upward flight, (b) soft chords. It ends with a
decided perfect cadence, the bridge subject entering
after a bar's silence. It is noteworthy that the
second subject on its return appears in F major,
before settling down finally into C minor. This
first movement, although in the minor, breathes
a happy contented spirit, which deepens into
seriousness in the Adagio. This opens with a
beautiful 16 bar phrase. We then pass straight
into the second subject, a florid one in a lighter
vein of thought, closing in E major. A sprinkled
dominant seventh takes the place of the development
section, and the whole is then repeated. For
the Coda, the first subject has passed into that
serene happy atmosphere which only Beethoven's
spirit seems to have penetrated. The Finale is
again cast into development form, and is typical
of the way Beethoven expands his movements from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the smallest idea. There is a beautiful hymn-like
second subject. Characteristically enough, just
before finishing this bubbling movement joyfully,
the composer falls into a deep reverie, but only to
brush it aside almost impatiently by returning to
the original idea.</p>


<h3>6th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 10, No. 2, in F major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Allegretto&mdash;Presto.</i></p>

<p>The tenth Opus, which first appeared on September
26th, 1798, contains three Sonatas, all dedicated
to the Countess von Brovne. The Sonata is in
three movements&mdash;the first a movement of development,
the second a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i>, and the third a playful
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i>. The whole Sonata is cast in happy mood.
The mysterious and somewhat eerie feeling of the
Minuet being completely dispelled by the happiness
of the Trio (which, curiously, enough, Brahms
seems to have written over again in his Scherzo in
E flat minor). The mood at the first part of this
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> has a close relationship with the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i>
in the <em>Eroica Symphony</em>.</p>

<p>There are several noteworthy points about the
development of the first movement. It opens with
a treatment of the last three notes of the exposition
in capricious manner. The development closes,
too, with this idea, but it also contains a completely
new subject in D minor. The prevalence of this
tonality brings in the return section irregularly in
D major. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i> is one of those playful movements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
full of fun and written broadly in Sonata
form lines.</p>


<h3>7th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 10, No. 3, in D major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto&mdash;Largo e mesto&mdash;Menuetto&mdash;Trio&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p>This Sonata is one of the greatest works of the
first period, if not, indeed, the greatest of them
all. The first movement is a wonderful evolution
from the first four-note figure, the development full
of all kinds of strong devices, the stormy episode
in the middle based on the rhythm of the opening
phrase of the Sonata and the marvellous slow movement
full of passion and tenderness, from its opening
five-bar phrase to its beautiful close with those
amazing tonic pedal chords. The spirited Minuet,
really a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> with two bars taken as one, is
admirably contrasted with the Hunting Song of
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trio</i>. Did Beethoven ever use the horse which
Count Brovne gave him? The fine Rondo is cast
on the old lines but filled with such new feeling.</p>

<p>The structure of the slow movement is in song
form with five sections:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(a) Theme in D minor in two parts with
cadences in C major and A minor.</p>

<p>(b) Modulatory section from F to D minor.</p>

<p>(c) Theme in D minor with cadences in B
flat and in D.</p>

<p>(d) Development of the (a) and (b) sections.</p>

<p>(e) Concluding portion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>


<h3>8th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, (Pathétique), Opus 13, in C minor.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Grave&mdash;Allegro di molto e con brio&mdash;Adagio
cantabile&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p>Published for the first time in 1799, and dedicated
to the Prince Carl von Lichnovsky. Although
one of the few authentic titles, it is difficult to see
the meaning of its bearing of the Sonata as a whole,
unless indeed it is applied to the sad and dramatic
introduction theme which, indeed, deserves as a
leading motive to the first movement being introduced
before the development section, and it ends
just before the coda. The slow movement is of
wonderful serenity and breathes a great religious
calm. Still, it was a great offence against good
feeling to make the single a double chant out of
it as one of our cathedral organists has done.
The Rondo does not quite reach the high plains
of the first two movements, it was probably
written much earlier; note the reflective mood again
just before the final whirlwind. There is no
Scherzo or Minuet in this Sonata.</p>


<h3>9th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 14, No. 1, in E major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Allegretto&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p>The two Sonatas in this Opus, which is dedicated
to the Baroness von Braun, are not very
interesting. No. 9 has no slow movement. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
meditative feeling having, apparently, crept into
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegretto</i>, which should again be taken as two
bars in one. The Rondo in E is of great beauty
and finish. The middle episode has again the
feeling of a hunting song.</p>

<p>They appeared for the first time in December,
1799.</p>


<h3>10th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 14, No. 2, in G major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Andante&mdash;Scherzo.</i></p>

<p>The first movement, in Sonata form, is a remarkable
example of the growth of a whole
movement from a single germ.</p>

<p>The Andante is an air with variations. The form
of this is really ternary, although if the second
part be repeated, it will throw the theme into five
sections, A, B, A, B, A. The first variation places
the air in the tenor, the second divides the harmony
rhythmically, the third breaks up the harmony
into semiquavers. Purists hold that this movement
is wrongly barred throughout, the first beat coming
where the third now is.</p>

<p>In the last sprightly movement, the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> and
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> seem to have run into one.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2em; font-size: 0.9em; ">The only other examples of Beethoven's use of the designation
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> for a movement not in Scherzo and Trio form are in the
pianoforte sonata Opus 31 No. 3, and in the string quartet in C minor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>


<h3>11th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 22, in B flat.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro con brio&mdash;Adagio con molta espressione&mdash;Minuetto&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to the Countess von Brovne.</p>

<p>This Sonata is the finest since the Opus 10, No.
3 in D. It is not so deep in feeling as some of
the preceding pieces, and the composer's preoccupation
with development somewhat duly prolongs
the first movement. It is full, however, of
characteristic vigour for its own sake, and the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>, long-drawn as it is, possess a great charm.</p>

<p>This long-drawn meditative piece is the only case
in the Sonatas of a slow movement having all the
elements of the true Sonata forms&mdash;exposition and
development, recapitulation, coda. If the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>
breathes of the open country, the Minuet savours
of the salon. In this rather old-fashioned Minuet,
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trio</i> is styled "Minore." The Rondo with
four refrains, the last two varied.</p>


<h3>12th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Op. 26, in A flat.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante con variazioni&mdash;Scherzo&mdash;Marcia funèbre&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to the Prince Carl von Lichnovsky.</p>

<p>This Sonata was announced for the first time on
March 3rd, 1802. Two of the movements are in
slow time&mdash;an Air with Variations, and a "Funeral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
March on the death of a hero." The March is said
to have been written as a set-off to the popular one
of that day in Paer's opera, <em>Achilles</em>.</p>

<p>It is not a lamentation, but rather a tragic elegiac
picture set in an impressive frame. One feels the
throb of brass, the blare of trumpets, the roll of
muffled drums, the impressive pageantry of death.
The opening <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> is beautiful, and in the
variations the theme breathes as it were through a
thin lovely veil. The technique looks backwards
rather than forwards, and the movement ends
with a calm phrase. The final Rondo bubbles
with life ceaselessly until it disappears in a
faint whisper.</p>


<h3>13th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 27, No. 1, in E flat.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><em>Sonata quasi una Fantasia.</em></p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante&mdash;Allegro&mdash;Andante&mdash;Allegro molto e
vivace&mdash;Adagio con espressione&mdash;Allegro vivace.</i></p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to Princess Lichtenstein.</p>

<p>This Sonata was first published together with
the following one in C sharp minor on March 3rd,
1802. They were both composed in 1801, the happy
year of the composer's love for Countess Giuletta
Guicciardi. The term <em>Fantasia</em> by no means implies
formlessness, but rather a departure from the
ordinary Sonata form. The first movement&mdash;an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i>, full of light and shade&mdash;is held by
purists to be wrongly barred throughout, the first
beat being the third, and so on. It is followed by
an <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i> in C major which leads back to the
return of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i>, this time varied. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i>,
which takes the place of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i>, is full
of imagination and vigour. The slow movement
is used as a bridge leading into the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>. All
the movements are chained together in one whole.
Just before the precipitant <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coda</i>, Beethoven takes
a final glance back at the subject of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>.</p>


<h3>14th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 27, No. 2, in C sharp minor.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio sostenuto&mdash;Allegretto&mdash;Presto agitato.</i></p>

<p>The title page describes the work as <em>for clavecin
or pianoforte</em>. The nickname, "Moonlight,"
given to it by the poet Rellstab, has no authority
and only serves very faintly to define the peaceful
charm of this sensitive picture, which was more
probably inspired by the composer's romantic love
for the Countess Giulietta Guicciardi. The direction
in Italian, "to be played throughout with the
greatest delicacy," is significant, although the
term <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">senza sordini</i> is somewhat vague. It may
have meant that it is to be played with the sustaining
pedal, i.e., without the dampers. It is
probably a general indication that the piece requires
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the pedal to sustain each harmony, for
nowhere is harmony put to such effective use as
in the dreamy yet placid opening <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>. There
is scarcely a stir, except where an occasional minor
9th causes a slight emotional ripple.</p>

<p>A little <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegretto</i> takes the place of the usual
Minuet. It might be a dance of peasants, heard
in the distance. The restless and passionate <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i>
is one of the finest movements in all the master's
works.</p>

<p>Like the preceding Sonata, all the movements
follow on without break. But there is a definite
organic connection between them, the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>, and
the opening movement in particular. Compare the
first four semiquavers of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i> with the
second quaver group of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>, and the quaver
chords in the second bar of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i> with the
melodic figure in bars 5 and 6 of the opening
movement.</p>

<p>The second subject of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> has three well-defined
sections, the first melodic, the second
dolorous expressive chords, the third a souvenir
of the first. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coda</i> is one of the most deeply
expressive things Beethoven has ever written. It
ends with a powerful gust of unpent passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>


<h3>15th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 28, in D major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Andante&mdash;Scherzo&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to Joseph Eiden von Sonnenfels.</p>

<p>It was christened by the Hamburg publisher,
Cranz, with the name of "Pastoral Sonata." The
autograph is dated 1801, and the work is exceeding
happy in mood, the last two movements almost
boisterously so, the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> being a mad gallop
home. This Sonata has four movements, and it
is most probable that it was written before the two
<em>Fantasia Sonatas</em>. The first movement opens with
a phrase of nine bars over a gentle tapping tonic
pedal. It is a splendid specimen of development
by elimination and condensation. In the middle
portion, just before the recapitulation, the phrase
seems almost to disappear into thin air.</p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> in D minor, with its epigrammatic
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trio</i> in the tonic major, was once a great favourite
with the composer. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> which despite
its title is really a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Minuet</i>, is one of his happiest,
and the Rondo is full of the joy of field and forest.</p>


<h3>16th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 31, No. 1, in G major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro vivace&mdash;Adagio grazioso&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p>This Opus contains three Sonatas&mdash;a favourite
grouping with the composer. Although No. 1 was
published in 1802, this Sonata, so simple in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
technique, has the feeling of having been conceived
much earlier. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>, with its elaborate
flowery passages of no particular meaning, drops
back to the Hummel style, and is developed to a
considerable length. The Rondo is bright and
sunshiny throughout.</p>


<h3>17th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 31, No. 2, in D minor.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Adagio&mdash;Allegretto.</i></p>

<p>One of the most splendid of all Beethoven's
Sonatas. The opening movement is full of the most
speaking of all Beethoven's sonorous and passionate
recitatives. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> is in full binary form.
It is very expressive, entirely evolved from a three-note
figure, a little Hummelian. The final <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegretto</i>
is all spun out from the little four-note germ
said to have been suggested to the composer by
the cantering of a horse.</p>


<h3>18th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 31, No. 3, in E flat.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Scherzo&mdash;Minuet and Trio&mdash;Presto con
fuoco.</i></p>

<p>In this characteristic work, where we find both
a Scherzo and a Minuet, the former in duple time,
we again return to four movements. The mood
throughout is of unclouded happiness. It is extremely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
interesting throughout, from the first bar
which opens in an original manner with the
"added sixth" chord to the Coda which returns
to the same idea.</p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> is in one of Beethoven's freakish
moods, full of capricious turns and fun of all kinds.
The third movement is a true Minuet of the olden
style, whilst the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i> is one of those cantering
movements the germ for which must have been
derived from the hunting songs of the people.</p>


<h3>19th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 49, No. 1, in G minor
and major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p>This and the following Sonata, although
published in 1802, must have been written much
earlier; in fact, the theme of the G major Rondo
was the original of the Minuet of the <em>Septet</em>.</p>


<h3>20th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 49. No. 2, in G major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro ma non troppo&mdash;Minuet and Trio.</i></p>

<p>This Sonata contains little of interest, both the
Allegro and the Minuet are in the olden style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>


<h3>21st <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 53, in C major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro con brio&mdash;Introduzione&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p>This fine Sonata, too often made a mere piece
of virtuosity, was dedicated to Beethoven's early
friend and patron, Count Waldstein. The form
is remarkable. A first movement, full of light and
colour, and the romantic <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Molto Adagio</i> forming
an introduction to the final Rondo with its magnificent
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coda</i>. Beethoven originally intended the
famous <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante in F</i> for the slow movement of
this Sonata, but finally discarded it in favour of
the present slow introduction. The second hymn-like
subject of the first movement does not appear
in the tonic key, either in the exposition or in the
recapitulation, but only after the final development
near the end of the piece. The simple subject of
the Rondo was the result as shown of six separate
attempts in Beethoven's note-books. The whole
meaning of it is lost unless the low C of the left
hand is taken into the phrase. It will then be seen
to have a close connection with the opening figure
of the introduction. The Rondo is often played
too fast, the full effect of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coda</i> is often lost
by the preceding Rondo being taken too fast.</p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">glissando</i> octave passage in it is very difficult
on modern pianos on account of the deeper
key fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>


<h3>22nd <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 54, in F major.</h3>

<p>This remarkable Sonata, which appeared for the
first time in April, 1806, is in two movements only&mdash;a
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tempo d'un Menuetto</i>, in full binary form
(more like a Sonata movement than a Minuet),
and a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegretto con moto</i> (somewhat Etude-like),
with a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Prestissimo</i> Coda in which the hands very
easily get tied up. This Sonata is comparatively
little known, doubtless on account of its over
topping neighbours, the <em>Waldstein</em> and the <em>Appassionata</em>.
Bulow metronomed the opening movement
at the quite moderate rate of 104 to the
crotchet. The octave <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bravura</i> subject appears there
in its full majesty. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cadenza</i> is noteworthy.</p>


<h3>23rd <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 57, in F minor.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">(Labelled <em>Appassionata</em> by the publisher Cranz).</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Assai allegro&mdash;Andante con moto with variations&mdash;Allegro
ma non troppo.</i></p>

<p>This Sonata, which was dedicated to Count
Franz von Brunswick, is perhaps the most truly
characteristic of all Beethoven's sonatas. The
usual portrait of Beethoven with the massive jaws
firmly set, the upturned eyes, the visage lined by
suffering, the head of a Titan, might be quite
appropriately placed here in the volume of the
Sonatas, rather than at the beginning; for with the
deep passionate note which sounds ceaselessly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
throughout the first movement and the immense
vitality of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>, the calm beauty of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i>
with its variations, it holds the palm amongst
all sonatas written for the clavier. Hackneyed it
certainly is, but even through the indifferent
temperaments of mere finger players, the immense
force of the ideas easily penetrates.</p>

<p>It is a superb example of the growth of Beethoven's
immense creations from two of the tiniest
of germs (a) the first three opening notes&mdash;<em>C</em>, <em>A
flat</em>, <em>F</em>&mdash;(b) the <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, <em>C</em> in the third and fourth
bars. The whole sonata grows as naturally from
these as the huge oak from the acorn. Bridge subjects,
second subjects, coda figures, the chief theme
of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i>, as also the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">impetuoso</i> subject
of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>, are all derived from these two little
germs. Lenz calls the Sonata "a volcanic eruption,
which rends the earth and shuts out the sky with
a shower of projectiles." The first movement and
the last movement have truly immense <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">codas</i>.</p>

<p>For a clue to this sonata, Beethoven told an enquirer
to read Shakespeare's <em>Tempest</em>.</p>


<h3>24th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 78, in F sharp major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio cantabile (4 bars)&mdash;Allegro ma non
troppo&mdash;Allegro vivace.</i></p>

<p>This Sonata was composed in October, 1809
(considerably later than <em>Les Adieux Sonata</em>, which
was published in July, 1811) and appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
for the first time in December, 1810. Thus an
interval of five years separates it from the <em>Sonata
Appassionata</em>. It was dedicated to the Countess
von Brunswick, and the piece was a special
favourite with the composer. A delightful feeling
of happiness pervates the whole piece, and one
cannot help feeling that this cheerful mood drew
the composer to the choice of this radiant key. The
first four bars form a sort of question to which
the succeeding <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i> supplies the answer.</p>

<p>The movements are succinct in form, almost
epigrammatic, and whilst very gracious and pleasing,
are not hefty for all sorts and conditions of
hands. The opening phrase of the Finale is very
striking, so, too, is the coda with its wonderful
disappointed cadence and its equally marvellous
finish. The intricate work of the arpeggios relates
it to the E major Sonata, Opus 109, and all the
way through it, there is a curious oscillation betwixt
major and minor modes.</p>


<h3>25th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 79, in G.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto alla tedesca&mdash;Andante&mdash;Vivace.</i></p>

<p>This is practically a Sonatina, and calls for little
mention. Some authorities regard it as an unfinished
sketch, whilst others ascribe it to a considerably
earlier date although it was clearly
completed in 1809. The term <em>Tedesca</em> means "in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the German style," and has reference to the country
dance, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ländler</i>. Beethoven employs the term only
twice in his published works&mdash;here and in the fifth
movement of the B flat quartet, Opus 130, where
he describes the movement in one of the sketches
as <em>Allemande Allegro</em>. In a Bagatelle, No. 3 of
Opus 119, he uses the term in French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A l'allemande</i>.</p>

<p>The first movement gives some good practice in
crossing the hands. The second movement might
easily be mistaken for a gondolier's song by
Mendelssohn. The third movement is a lively
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Con Moto</i> in simple Rondo form.</p>


<h3>26th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 81a, in E flat.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio&mdash;Allegro&mdash;Andante espressivo&mdash;Vivacissimamente.</i></p>

<p>Styled by Beethoven himself, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les adieux,
l'absence, et la retour</i>. (The parting, the absence,
and the return). As such it is the finest piece of
programme music ever written. It is dedicated to
his friend and patron, the Archduke Rudolph, but
it is not known definitely that it was connected
with the absence of the Archduke himself. The
general feeling seems to suggest a more tender attachment.
The music is Beethoven at his very
best, and is truly representative of his mature
period. The interrelation of the whole of the
music, its close affinity with the opening musical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
motto of three notes, under which Beethoven wrote
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lebe-wohl</i> (Fare thee well) is astounding.
Whether written in clear notes or obscured subtly,
this leading motive lies at the bottom of every
phrase. It is the generating idea, the essence of
the whole Sonata. Although we have styled it
programme music, it would be the greatest mistake,
however, to regard it as something pictorial
and definite. The idea is only used as the generating
impulse of each of the three chief movements,
and the work loses no whit (perhaps, even gains)
by being heard as a piece of absolute music. Those
interested in musical psychology will find it,
however, a most interesting study to trace the
derivation of the various phrases of the opening
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i> of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> (see bass chords), and
even of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> to one of the two tiny cellules
found in the first three bars of the introduction.
The movements are all in Sonata form. The
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> has no development section and runs into
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> without break.</p>


<h3>27th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 90, in E.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Con vivacità a sempre con sentimento ed espressione&mdash;Non
troppo presto (Rondo).</i></p>

<p>This work, completed on August 16th, 1814,
appeared for the first time in June, 1815. It is
in two movements, and is one of the first works
in which Beethoven gave bi-lingual <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tempo</i> indications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
(Italian and German), the other example
being <em>Les Adieux</em> Sonata, Opus 81. On one
occasion, in 1815, when the Englishman Neate
was discussing the meaning of music with Beethoven,
the composer admitted somewhat vaguely
that he "never worked without a picture in his
mind." Be this as it may, the composer was
always greatly enraged when other people attempted
to fix pictures to his music, as did the
publisher who gave the title "La chasse" to the
unchristened overture, Op. 115. The first movement
has a tender wistful charm and romantic
feeling; it is the very poetry of sound. The first
subject with its three themes is square-cut, exactly
24 bars in length, ending with a perfect cadence
in the tonic key. The development is closely knit,
and the overlapping phrases with their diminution
and augmentation, which bring in the return of
the first subject, are as wonderful as they are convincing.</p>

<p>Schindler relates that Beethoven, referring to
these two movements, said: "The first might
represent 'Combat between Heart and Head,'
and the second, 'Dialogue with the beloved one.'"
Be this as it may, the Rondo, judging from the
interior evidence, was written first. In many of
his sonatas the only connection apparently aimed
at between the various movements is that of right
contrast and suitable key-relationship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>


<h3>28th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 101, in A major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegretto ma non troppo&mdash;Vivace alla Marcia&mdash;Adagio
ma non troppo&mdash;Allegro risoluto.</i></p>

<p>Dedicated to Freund Dorothea Ertmann and performed
for the first time as new on February 18th,
1816; it was not published until February, 1817.
With this Sonata we reach the third period of
Beethoven's works, that in which reflection and
philosophy play such a great part. Many passages
in some of his latest works reach such a massive
spaciousness that they seem to lose all touch of
human comprehension. Beethoven was seeking
a new style, in striving after which his music became
more and more contrapuntal. One cannot
help connecting his use of the fugue in many of
his later works with this new phase. But it
was not the fugue of Bach, but one filled with
sublimity and mysticism in which he attempted
to render the spiritual force more and more
concentrated, the meaning sometimes becomes
completely dissipated in his attempt to grasp
and hold it. Such is not the case, however, with
the fugue with which this Sonata ends. It grows
out of the chief theme of the Finale and forms
the development portion in this combination of the
Fugue and Sonata form proper.</p>

<p>The martial feeling in the first movement seems
to have produced a substitute for the <em>Minuet</em> or
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> movement. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">trio</i> with its prolonged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
coda is in deep poetic vein. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Largo</i> is permeated
with profound feeling and is connected with
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> by a reminiscence of the first movement.
The whole work is entirely happy and presents an
untroubled frame of mind.</p>


<h3>29th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 106.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Scherzo&mdash;Adagio sostenuto&mdash;Fugue.</i></p>

<p>The first two movements were finished in April,
1818; the two last were composed in the summer of
that year. The Sonata was ready for publication
in March, 1819, but did not appear until September,
1819. It carried the sub-title "Sonata for the
Hammerclavier."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> It is dedicated to the staunch
friend and patron, the Archduke Rudolph, and is
the longest of all Beethoven's sonatas, being
about twice as long as the longest of the others.
The first movement (over four hundred bars in
length) is evolved from the two little germs contained
in the first two bars. There is a long bridge
passage in which derivative themes occur before
the second subject in three sections. A long development
follows and a superb return with a
powerful coda. In the three bars preceding the
return, all the "A sharps" are usually misprinted
"natural." This A sharp should be the enharmonic
of the following B flat.</p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> is fantastic in the extreme. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the playful mood of the first part it is suddenly
plunged into the inexpressible anguish of the
minor trio. A short <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i> unison phrase of eight
bars brushes this aside, a tremor on a minor ninth
preceding the happy return of the Scherzo.</p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> is one of the sublimest things in all
music. It certainly reaches heights which transcend
the limits of the piano. A remarkable bridge,
which changes mood no less than six times, forms
a sort of prelude to the final fugue which is drawn
from the opening germ of the work. It is a
struggle of giants, unbridled in its onslaught.
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fuga a tre voci, con alcune licenze</i> Beethoven
marked it, and its great licenses and amazing contortions
have puzzled many minds. The heavenly
interludes, however, transport one into the pure
air of the <em>Sanctus</em> of the Mass in D. The similarity
of the opening phrases of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i>, the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>, should be noticed. It
was by such means that Brahms later on strove to
unify the separate movements of his longer forms.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to Maximiliana Brentano.</p>

<p>Written at the age of fifty, it seems possible

vocal forms of the great <em>Mass in D</em> which
was occupying his thoughts at this time. The
rhapsodic first movement with its light and happy
figures, repeatedly broken in upon by the deeply
expressive <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> phrases; the remarkable uncouth
Scherzo with the subject in the bass and the
angelic variations, one in fugue form, and the
other a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tour de force</i> with its thrilling pedals, the
beatific return of the theme at the end, given this

1822. Here we find Beethoven in his most exalted
mood, and it is significant that whilst the main
outlines of the Sonata-form are at the foundation
of the piece, he has gone still a step farther in the
direction of welding the whole sonata into one
piece. The first, the movement of development,
is on the usual lines but is handled with great
freedom. The second movement is one of those
fast pieces, somewhat fantastic, with which
Schumann has made us familiar at a later period.
A remarkable <em>recitative</em> bridge portion follows
which leads into one of the most beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
airs ever penned by Beethoven, the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arioso Dolente</i>.
This runs into the Fugue, which is here used not
so much as a movement in itself, but a concentration
of the chief expression of the whole piece.
Vincent d'Indy compares the expression here with
that of the 15th String Quartet, Opus 132, written
four years later, which contains the Song of gratitude
to God for his goodness. In this Sonata, we
have as it were a terrible combat against misfortune,
then a return to life and hope, not in a calm pious
prayer, but in an exultant hymn of joy triumphant.</p>

<p>The subject of the final Fugue is a simplification
of the initial idea of the first movement. This
opening movement is penetrated with a great religious
calm. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> is somewhat puzzling,
but appears to be a somewhat sorrowful frolic, a
rather bitter amusement. In the Fugue, suffering
disappears; even fantastic cleverness comes to the
fore with the subject in contrary movement. Little
by little life and joy return, and with the re-establishment
of the tonic key, the piece triumphs
in an enthusiasm of good feeling. The Italian indications
to this sonata are fuller and more unusual,
and show that Beethoven was aiming at the deepest
possible expression. The use of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Una Corda</i>,
and the insertion of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arioso Dolente</i> into the
Fugue, show what a struggle Beethoven underwent
in the conquest of his feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>


<h3>32nd <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 111, in C minor.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Maestoso&mdash;Allegro con brio&mdash;Arietta.</i></p>

<p>Although the designation <em>Sonata</em> persists with
Beethoven right along throughout all his periods,
yet in this last sonata we have left the first
ones completely out of sight. The name must
be taken merely in its general sense of a piece of
high aims; or even in its literal sense, the Italian
word meaning simply <em>to play</em>. This Sonata, which
was dedicated to the Archduke Rudolph, is practically
a Prelude and Fugue, with an Air and
Variations. The introduction contains two themes,
a leonine, stormy one and a singing phrase. The
Fugue opens like a veritable thunder-storm. There
are short phrases in the major which answer to the
second subject, a brief snatch of two celestial bars,
and the agitated atmosphere again unfolds itself.
This second subject, which is a mere phrase, is
repeated in the last portion of the Fugue in the
tonic major, which brings the Fugue into line with
the Sonata form proper. The beauty of the Coda
has not been surpassed by Brahms in his sublimest
moments.</p>

<p>After the storm, a calm. Beethoven concludes
his world contribution of Sonatas with an air of
celestial happiness, varied in the most lovely
manner possible. "A voice from above," someone
has called it. The variations lap round it tenderly
like the waves caressing the sands on a beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
calm day. The first variation gently stirs the
rhythm of the theme. The second doubles the
movement, and the third redoubles, and yet the
peaceful calm is not disturbed. Into the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coda</i>
steals one of those beautiful pensive movements in
the minor key. This emerges into the return of
the theme, scintillating with heavenly radiance.
Thus Beethoven closes his Sonatas in a heavenly
peace.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">THE SONATAS FOR VIOLIN AND PIANOFORTE</h2>

<h3>1st <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 12, No. 1, in D.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro con brio&mdash;Tema con Variazioni&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p>This is the first of a set of three Sonatas published
in 1799, and dedicated to F. A. Salieri. It is
noteworthy that it was a favourite custom with
Beethoven to publish his works in sets of threes;
thus, Opus 1, Three Trios for Pianoforte, Violin
and Cello; Opus 2, Three Sonatas for Pianoforte;
Opus 9, Three Trios for Strings; Opus 10, Three
Sonatas for Pianoforte; Opus 30, Three Sonatas
for Pianoforte and Violin; Opus 31, Three Sonatas
for Pianoforte; Opus 59, Three Quartets for Strings
(dedicated to Prince Rasumovsky); and the Opus
12.</p>

<p>No. 1 of this Opus is a vivacious work of no great
depth, and the phraseology is in the Mozartian
manner. The theme is a 16-bar phrase, given out
by the piano and repeated on the violin in two
sections. The variations are four in number, the
third being in the minor, and there is a short Coda.
The Rondo is on modern lines approximating to
Sonata form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>


<h3>2nd <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 12, No. 2, in A.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro vivace&mdash;Andante più tosto Allegretto&mdash;Allegro
piacevole.</i></p>

<p>Although this Sonata offers no outstanding
point of interest, it is to be regretted that it is
not more frequently heard. There are one or two
places where the sunny sky is slightly overcast,
but on the whole, it is a work brimful of youthful
happiness. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i>, somewhat frail, is like
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>, full of fine melody, and gay with optimistic
feelings of youth.</p>


<h3>3rd <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 12, No. 3, in E flat.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro con spirito&mdash;Adagio con molto espressione&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p>The tuneful, breezy <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i> contains some
brilliant work for the piano. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> seems
hardly deep enough to carry its broad time with
dignity. The delicate Finale&mdash;short, simple, and
tuneful&mdash;is well rounded off.</p>


<h3>4th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 23, in A minor and major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto&mdash;Andante&mdash;Scherzo&mdash;Allegro molto.</i></p>

<p>This Sonata, published in 1801, and dedicated
to the Count Moritz von Fries, is one of the more
serene works of the "first-period" style. Its
charms are not readily apparent, but it is full of
interest to the serious musician. The subjects of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the opening <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i> are not very distinguished.
The composer seems to have felt this, and has
consequently introduced an unusual amount of new
matter into the development section. The gentle,
placid <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i>, with its eloquent rests, has some
unusual passages, notably the bridge (bar 33)
where a definite theme is treated fugally in three
parts. The Finale, undefined, strange and unusual,
possesses that weird note which so frequently
sounds in Schumann's pieces. The key of A
minor seems to possess the right key-colour for
this bustling, indefinite, and somewhat uneasy sort
of mood. In this direction, one calls to mind the
<em>Kreutzer Sonata</em>, with which this movement
has much in common. There are more subtle
reminiscences; the new theme in semibreves, which
plays such a great part in the middle of the Rondo,
recalls the fugal <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> of Mozart's <em>Jupiter Symphony</em>.
The powerful <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coda</i> recalls all the foregoing
moods. The movement is very valuable
from the psychological point of view, for Beethoven
was at the age of 31 years.</p>


<h3>5th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 24, in F.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Adagio molto espressivo&mdash;Scherzo&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p>This graceful and happy Sonata, also published
in 1801 and dedicated, like its predecessor, to the
Count Moritz von Fries, is the most popular in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the "early-period" style. The first movement is
full of serene happiness. The Adagio has a lovely
theme, dreamy and languorous as a summer's day.
The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> is characteristic, full of fun and
oddity; the Rondo, full of good spirits, the chief
theme being varied at each return.</p>


<h3>6th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 30, No. 1, in A.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Adagio molto espressivo&mdash;Allegretto
con variazioni.</i></p>

<p>This is the first of a set of three Sonatas dedicated
to the Kaiser Alexander I. With this Opus
the true individuality of Beethoven is manifested.
Although the opening of this work is not particularly
striking, yet the movement has a clarity of
style and delicacy of workmanship together with
distinct melodic charm. The theme of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>
is of great beauty, caressing in its tenderness. For
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>, Beethoven turns to his beloved Variations
form. This was not the original Finale
which was "lifted" in a moment of haste to form
the conclusion of the Kreutzer Sonata. Still,
one cannot deny that the present variations suit
this charming poetical sonata much better than the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> of the <em>Kreutzer</em> would have done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>


<h3>7th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 30, No. 2, in C minor.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro con brio&mdash;Adagio cantabile&mdash;Scherzo&mdash;Allegro.</i></p>

<p>This favourite work is one of the great masterpieces
of music. The first and last movements
sound the clear note of Beethoven's personality&mdash;a
king here comes to his own. The first movement
opens with a veritable quatrain of musical poetry.
The gay martial swing of the second subject is
remarkable. Stormy episodes follow, and the
development section commences with a new idea.
Conflict succeeds conflict before the serenity of the
exposition returns. The beautiful <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> flows
along with a solemn majesty, although there are
one or two short dramatic points. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i>,
bright and tuneful, somewhat naive, does not give
us the fulness of the real Beethoven which we get
in the sombre, energetic and passionate <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>.</p>


<h3>8th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 30, No. 3, in G.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro assai&mdash;Tempo di Minuetto&mdash;Allegro
vivace.</i></p>

<p>After the stormy power and the serene beauties
of the Sonata in C minor (a key which always
called forth Beethoven's best) this Sonata appears
somewhat colourless. The long-drawn <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tempo</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">di Minuetto</i> is a little tedious, whilst the first and
last movements, though vigorous and well varied
in mood, by no means give us the deep Beethoven
of the C minor Sonata. The scoring of
many of the passages is unusually thin, and reminiscent
of Haydn not at his best.</p>


<h3>9th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 47, in A.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to Rudolph Kreutzer.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio&mdash;Presto&mdash;Andante con variazioni&mdash;Presto.</i></p>

<p>Though absurdly over-estimated, perhaps on
account of Tolstoy's stupid novel, this still remains
one of the great masterpieces in music.
Commissioned by a Mulatto violinist named
Bridgetower, and written, as the original title-page
says, "in a specially brilliant style," it was
first given at 8 o'clock on a May morning in 1803
in the Augarten at Vienna, with Beethoven at the
piano and Bridgetower with the violin. The Sonata
opens with a majestic introduction, ending
on a dominant pause. Tradition has it that
Bridgetower improvised a cadenza here and that
Beethoven approved. Amongst the whirl and excitement
of the bold and vigorous opening <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i>,
the hymn-like second subject stands out with a
marvellous way. Nothing is lost of the tenderness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> in the brilliant variations
which follow it, and this is all the more wonderful
because this piece is the most virtuoso-like of all
Beethoven's chamber-music. Tenderness with
Beethoven is no maudlin sentiment, but the gentle
sympathy of a strong man. The Tarantelle-like
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> originally belonged to the Sonata of Opus
30, No. 1, A major, but, as Beethoven had been
dilatory in his commission, the time having arrived
and no <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>, he took the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> from the
earlier Sonata and wrote a new one for it later on.</p>


<h3>10th <span class="smcap">Sonata</span>, Opus 96, in G.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro moderato&mdash;Adagio espressivo&mdash;Scherzo
allegro&mdash;Poco Allegretto.</i></p>

<p>This was written in 1810 and dedicated to
Beethoven's firm friend and patron, the Archduke
Rudolph. Although not really characteristic of
the master's latest style, which does not commence
until Opus 106, yet it is the most intimate of all
the violin sonatas. It stands amongst the very
great works and is indeed in some ways superior
to the C minor. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>, calm and sublime,
is one of the most beautiful things in music. The
scoring is like that of a string quartet. The ending
dies away and creeps almost imperceptibly
into the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> through an unexpected C sharp.
Full of life and bubbling over with fun, it has a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
jolly <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">trio</i> and a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">coda</i> of its own. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>
touches every mood from gay to sad, from lively
to severe. The lovely <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> makes a re-appearance
in it, but the gay mood wins, for with a
freakish little <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i> the Sonata is brought to a
triumphant close.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 4em; font-size: 1.6em; ">THE STRING QUARTETS</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE STRING QUARTETS</h2>

<h3>1st <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 18, No. 1, in F.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to Prince Lobkovitz.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro con brio&mdash;Adagio affettuoso ed appassionato&mdash;Scherzo&mdash;Allegro.</i></p>

<p>Composed in 1800 at the age of 30, this first set
of quartets belongs to the same period as the great
C minor Symphony, No. 5. The music of No. 1
is Mozartian in type, very charming, and the
scoring is light and graceful. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> is very
beautiful, and one can feel in it the future Beethoven.
Indeed we almost arrive at maturity in the
episode in D flat in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>, where Beethoven
uses the melody which he again took up in his
ballet "The Men of Prometheus" and in his
Third Symphony.</p>


<h3>2nd <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 18, No. 2, in G. major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Adagio cantabile&mdash;Scherzo&mdash;Allegro
molto quasi Presto.</i></p>

<p>This quartet is even more like Mozart and
Haydn than No. 1, except for the fact that Beethoven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
keeps his music in rather higher registers.
The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> is not so Beethovenish as the slow
movement of No. 1, but it contains an episode
marked Allegro. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> is full of spirit, but
it is not the Beethoven in the "unbuttoned" mood
of the later works. There is some effective work
for the G string on the 1st Violin, for Paganini had
already cast his glamour over Europe.</p>


<h3>3rd <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 18, No. 3, in D.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Andante con moto&mdash;Allegro&mdash;Presto.</i></p>

<p>This beautiful quartet, composed a year later
than the first two, already points to the maturity
of the second period, especially in the first movement.
The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> opens with a lovely melody
for the 2nd Violin on the G string; restraint and
broadness in playing should be the player's aim
here. Parry refers to the fine balance of form in
this Quartet in his article in Groves' Dictionary.
The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> is here marked <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Maggiore&mdash;Minore&mdash;Maggiore</i>.
The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i> is full of Beethoven spirit
and handling, in one passage in particular, having
spaciousness, which is such a striking feature
in the final quartets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>


<h3>4th <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 18, No. 4, in C minor.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro ma non tanto&mdash;Scherzo&mdash;Menuetto&mdash;Rondo.</i></p>

<p>Written in Beethoven's favourite key, C minor,
this quartet is remarkable for its melodiousness.
It has no slow movement and contains both a
Scherzo and a Minuet, the former marked Andante
Scherzoso quasi Allegretto and opening in a Fugato
style reminiscent of the Andante of the First
Symphony. Both this and the Minuet contain
the characteristic Sforzandi, especially that on the
third beat of triple time. The Prestissimo Coda
brings the Finale to a powerful conclusion.</p>


<h3>5th <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 18, No. 5, in A.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Minuet&mdash;Air and Variations&mdash;Allegro.</i></p>

<p>This quartet is chiefly remarkable for its lovely
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> and set of variations on the beautiful
theme which has all the natural feeling of a
genuine folk-song. The first variation is <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fugato</i>;
the second has sparkling triplets for the 1st violin;
the third woodland murmurs, whilst the
cellos and violas occupy themselves with the
melody.</p>

<p>The fourth is organ-like in treatment, whilst the
final one starts on a boisterous scamper home,
which ends, however, in a melancholy, dreamy
meditation. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> is Mozartian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>


<h3>6th <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 18, No. 6, in B flat.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro con brio&mdash;Adagio ma non troppo&mdash;Scherzo&mdash;La
Malinconia&mdash;Allegretto quasi
Allegro.</i></p>

<p>This favourite quartet, composed in 1800, has
five movements; whereas the fourth quartet has
no slow movement.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the five movements seems
to suggest some sort of carefully-arranged "programme;"
but woe always overtook the man who
dared to attach a definite story to any of the music
in these pieces in Beethoven's lifetime. The
opening movement, full of vitality, and asks for
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">spiccato</i> bowing. It is very light in texture. The
first <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> is full of graceful tunefulness, somewhat
elaborate in texture, and containing many
characteristic touches of expression; so too, does
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i>. The second slow movement <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>,
entitled by Beethoven <em>La Malinconia</em> (grief), is one
of Beethoven's most moving pieces of music.
Knowing here that he was entering into new territory,
he especially marks such movements to be
played with the greatest feeling <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">più gran delicatezza</i>.
This movement runs directly into the
final <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegretto</i>, which indeed returns to it twice,
as though unable to throw off completely the bitter
taste of those sad moments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>


<h3>7th <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 59, No. 1, in F.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">No. 1 of the set dedicated to Count Rasumovsky.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Allegretto Vivace e sempre Scherzando&mdash;Adagio
molto e mesto&mdash;Thème russe con Variazioni.</i></p>

<p>This fine but difficult quartet, sometimes called
the Cello Quartet on account of the prominence
given to this instrument, was written in 1806.
The Count himself is supposed to have played the
cello, and the set of variations on the Russian song
used for the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> was a second compliment to
Beethoven's noble Russian patron. Beethoven
took his theme from the Prabst collection, 1815,
which is not now published, having been superseded
by Rimsky-Korsakoff's fine collection. The
theme is found there (No. 13) marked <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i>
and the Russian words may be translated&mdash;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 6em; ">Ah, is this my fate?<br />
And what a fate!</p>

<p>The technique and the subject matter is very much
more advanced. The first movement contains a
remarkable unison passage for the full strings,
some remarkable high work for the 1st violin and
some wonderful colour effects. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegretto</i> is
a busy, gossipy movement in B flat. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio
molto</i> is a typical Beethoven <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>. It is the
real thing. It runs into the Finale through a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and difficult cadenza for the 1st Violin over a
dominant pedal. The ending of the quartet contains
some very full effects and is almost orchestral
in style.</p>


<h3>8th <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 59, No. 2, in E minor.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro&mdash;Adagio&mdash;Allegretto&mdash;Finale.</i></p>

<p>The second quartet of the Rasumovsky set
is even more elaborate than the first. The opening
movement, though containing some dark,
passionate moods akin to the <em>Appassionata Sonata</em>,
is nevertheless happy and delicate in tone. Its
technical requirements are great. The quartet
opens with two strong chords, then a silent bar,
which the composer fills in curiously enough in
the recapitulation. The lovely long-drawn Adagio
in E major is marked by Beethoven <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">con molto di
sentimento</i> (with great feeling). Here again he is
in his new territory. It is as though he said to the
players, "Wake up! this is an entirely new kind
of music." The playful <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegretto</i> introduces
another Slav folk-song, which can be found in
Rimsky-Korsakoff's collection (No. 45). It is
sacred and majestic in tone, a song of glory to
the Creator. It forms the major <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">trio</i> portion,
which is carefully welded on to the return of the
opening minor movement. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> represents
Beethoven's very happiest mood. It starts clean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
out of the key in C major. Seldom is Beethoven
so happy as we find him here in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>, which
although written in the sharp signature throughout,
is really in the key of C major; the episodes
only and the coda only just managing to restore
the balance of E minor.</p>


<h3>9th <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 59, No. 3, in C major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Introduzione&mdash;Allegro vivace&mdash;Andante con moto&mdash;Menuetto&mdash;Allegro
molto (Fuge).</i></p>

<p>This, the third of the Rasumovsky set,
was composed in 1806. Starting clean out
of the key, a few bars of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> introduction
gradually lean towards C major. The
first movement is remarkably clear and lucid
in style and finely coloured in harmony.
Beethoven is in one of his happiest moods. The
exquisite <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> in A minor opens with a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pizzicato</i>
bass and ends in the same manner. It is a
highly finished movement. The Minuet is of the
stately dance order and appears in the tonic key
C major. The coda to it ends on the dominant
seventh, thus bringing in the remarkable spiccato
Fugue which Brahms played from memory as an
encore at a concert in Vienna in 1867. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Una
Corda</i> set of entries preserving the homogeneity
of tone and adding greatly to the effect of the intensity
of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">crescendi</i> is particularly fine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>


<h3>10th <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 74, in E flat.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Poco adagio&mdash;Allegro&mdash;Adagio ma non troppo&mdash;Presto&mdash;Allegretto
con variazione.</i></p>

<p>This remarkable quartet, composed in 1809 and
dedicated to the Prince Lobkovitz, is widely
known under the title of the Harp Quartet on account
of the remarkable pizzicato arpeggios in
the opening Allegro. A short introduction is
marked <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto voce</i>. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i> contains a brilliant
cadenza for the Violin&mdash;Beethoven's only
excursion into the virtuoso field in chamber music.
The very beautiful <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> is Beethoven at his
very best, whilst the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto Scherzo</i> is curious in
form, being arranged with varying <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tempi</i>, thus,
on the following plan:&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i> C minor, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Più
Presto-Trio</i> C major, C minor, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i> repeated,
and again the C major, finishing with the C minor.
This leads without break into a set of six variations:
the second, notable for its lovely viola
melody; and the sixth, organ-like in character over
a cello pedal-point.</p>


<h3>11th <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 95, in F minor.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro con brio&mdash;Allegretto ma non troppo&mdash;Allegro
assai vivace ma serioso&mdash;Allegretto agitato.</i></p>

<p>This quartet is dedicated to Count Zmeskal,
Beethoven's willing secretary and man of affairs.
Here in this work which stands on the border line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
between Beethoven's second and third styles, we
have the gruff and brooding Beethoven. The
somewhat short opening movement is full of intense
feeling. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegretto</i> is calm and
religious, ethereal in tone and contains a fine fugato
passage. The third movement, which takes
the place of a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i>, is dark in feeling and pervaded
with gloom. A short <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Larghetto</i> introduction
leads into the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> agitated and restless in
character, but ending with a brilliant gleam of
sunshine.</p>


<h3>12th <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 127, in E flat.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to Count Nicolas von Galitzen.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Maestoso&mdash;Allegro&mdash;Adagio&mdash;Scherzando vivace&mdash;Finale.</i></p>

<p>Although probably published before his death,
this quartet is generally classed with the posthumous
ones which represent fully Beethoven's third
style. Although all these quartets contain many
orchestral effects, yet he never exceeds the limits
of the true string quartet style. To say that
string quartet writing is only an imperfectly
filled-in sketch of orchestral idium is not correct;
otherwise, when Beethoven had four instruments
at his disposal, would he have written some of
those spacious passages for three, or even two instruments
only?</p>

<p>The opening movement has a double subject&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Maestoso</i> introduction accompanying the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i>
subject on every appearance. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i>
is dreamy in mood and has a touching <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i>
episode, also a striking excursion to E major before
the final return. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzando vivace</i>,
which must not be taken too quickly, is also a
striking example of Beethoven's characteristic
contrapuntal writing and contains a passage in
Beethoven's famous <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ritmo di tre battute</i> (Rhythm
of three bars); another instance of this occurs in
the <em>Ninth Symphony</em>. The tempo is constantly
changing throughout and the highly dramatic
music, free in style, settles down more into a
lyric and rhythmic style for the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i>, the long
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">coda</i> of which is extremely characteristic, starting
right away from the key.</p>


<h3>13th <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 130, in B flat.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Dedicated to Count Nicolas von Galitzen.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio ma non troppo&mdash;Allegro&mdash;Presto&mdash;Andante
con moto&mdash;Danza alla tedesca&mdash;Cavatina&mdash;Finale.</i></p>

<p>This quartet, written in 1825, is one of Beethoven's
longest, and contains six movements. The
opening piece carries its <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> introduction
through all the appearances of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i> subject.
The second subject is of wonderful beauty. The
development section very short. The unusual
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i> in B flat minor very succinct; is the nearest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
approach to Brahms. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> is really a
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i> treated like an <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> in form. The
third movement is cast in the rhythm of a German
country dance; the theme is varied on its re-appearance.
The famous <em>Cavatina</em> has a remarkable
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">beklemmt</i> (fear) episode and a wonderful <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bebung</i>
chord at the close. The lovely second subject of
The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> has been used by Borodin as a theme in
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> of his Second Quartet. There is a very
proper little Fugue in the development portion.
The original <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> was published separately
as Opus 133; it is a terrificly long-drawn Fugue
and is regarded as almost incomprehensible by
even the most ardent admirers of Beethoven's
third style.</p>


<h3>14th <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 131, in C sharp minor.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; ">Published in 1827.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio&mdash;Allegro molto vivace&mdash;Allegro moderato&mdash;Andante&mdash;Presto.</i></p>

<p>Although marked off in separate movements,
this quartet is practically one long continuous
piece. It opens with a mystic Fugue, organ-like
in character and contains several fine enharmonic
changes of key. At the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro molto vivace</i> the
tonality is lifted a semitone. This movement is
light in character and simple in texture, almost
Mozartian. An air with variations is approached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
by a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">recitative</i> and introduction. This is followed
by a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Presto</i>, where Beethoven appears in one of
his joking moods. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tempo</i> here alters continually,
then comes a short <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adagio</i> section, a
lamentation broken off by one of Beethoven's
gruff shrugs, and the last movement opens with a
clearly marked theme in happy mood. Strongly
contrasted portions occur from time to time, but
the work ends triumphantly.</p>


<h3>15th <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 132, in A minor.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Assai sostenuto&mdash;Allegro&mdash;Allegro ma non
tanto&mdash;Molto adagio&mdash;Andante&mdash;Alla marcia&mdash;Allegro
appassionata.</i></p>

<p>The opening movement is on the same lines as
that of the preceding quartet. Moods change constantly
and the development is of the freest kind;
there are two parts to the second subject, one a
vivacious little figure, two a short singing phrase.
The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i> in A major is in ternary form and takes
the place of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzo</i>. Then follows that
remarkable movement in the Lydian mode headed
"A convalescent's sacred song of thanksgiving
to the divinity." This interesting modal piece
was written after the composer's illness. The
variations of it alternate with the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andante</i> in D
major, thus producing striking contrasts of key
colour. The final <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegro</i> is in free Sonata form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>


<h3>16th <span class="smcap">Quartet</span>, Opus 135, in F major.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em; "><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allegretto&mdash;Vivace&mdash;Lento assai&mdash;Grave ma non
troppo tratto.</i></p>

<p>This quartet is on a much smaller scale. The
opening movement, whilst characteristic of the
third period, is easily comprehended. The subject
of the slow movement is one of Beethoven's most
beautiful melodies, and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finale</i> commences with
the famous musical motto&mdash;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 6em; ">"<em>Must it be?<br />
It must be</em>"</p>

<p>founded on a little altercation with his cook.</p>

<p>The movement is characterised by some very
perverse part-writing.</p>

<p>These final quartets present many problems,
even to the most profound students of Beethoven's
works.</p>

for the childhood of Beethoven).
Fischer, who died in 1864, was the owner of
the house where the Beethoven family lived
for two generations. He and his sister Cecilia
knew Beethoven as a boy intimately, and have
recorded their remembrances of him, which
are very valuable, on condition that they are
used with some criticism. The manuscript is
in the Beethovenhaus at Bonn. Deiters (see

<p class="ph3">TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:</p>

<p>This project is dedicated to the memory of Eduardo Suárez, who loved
Beethoven's music and this book.</p>

<p>A number of words in this book have both hyphenated and
non-hyphenated variants. The trend in the original book was to
hyphenate compound words. Therefore, for the words with both variants
present the hyphenated variant was chosen in most of the cases.</p>

<p>The list item in the Table of Contents pointing to page       93 is for a
letter to I. Moscheles and not to Sir G. Smart as it was printed
originally in the book. There is another letter to I. Moscheles on page
94 that is missing in the original. These errors have been corrected.</p>

<p>The present book was originally written in French and has
been translated into English. The Transcriber believes a translation error has been
made in the English version. The text in question in page <a
href="#Page_198">198</a> of the book reads as follows:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2em; "><em>This biography was commenced in
1866, but was interrupted by the death of the author in 1897 at Trieste,
where he was the American Consul. The work stood still till 1816,...
</em></p>

<p>For the above portion of text, the French version ("Vie de Beethoven",
Romain Rolland, Hachette, 1914, 7eme. edition, Page 148) reads as
follows:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2em; "><em>Commencé en 1866; interrompu par
la mort de l'auteur, en 1897, à Trieste, où il était consul des
États-Unis; l'ouvrage s'arrête à l'année 1816...</em></p>


<p>The Transcriber believes that the above French text should be
translated into English as:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2em; "><em>This biography was commenced in
1866, but was interrupted by the death of the author in 1897 at Trieste,
where he was the American Consul. <span style="text-decoration:
underline;">The work stops at the year 1816...</span></em></p>

<p>Obvious punctuation and other printing errors have been
corrected.</p>

<p>The book cover was modified by the Transcriber and has been added to
the public domain.</p>

<p>In the html version of this book by clicking in the tag [listen] it
is possible to listen to the sound of the music examples provided in
the book.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
