      TRANSLATOR'S NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      A new act appears for the first time in this edition and is inserted as
      Act IV&mdash;<i>Palace of Happiness</i>. It has been specially written for
      the Christmas revival of <i>The Blue Bird</i> at the Haymarket Theatre,
      where it will take the place of the Forest Scene (Act III., Scene 2). In
      the printed version, however, the Forest Scene is retained; and in this
      and all later editions the play will consist of six acts instead of five.

      knickerbockers, pale-blue jacket, white stockings, tan shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL is dressed like Gretel or Little Red Riding-hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT.&mdash;The "moon-coloured" dress in Perrault's <i>Peau d'âne;</i>
      that is to say, pale gold shot with silver, shimmering gauzes, forming a
      sort of rays, etc. Neo-Grecian or Anglo-Grecian (<i>à la</i> Walter Crane)
      or even more or less Empire style: a high waist, bare arms, etc.
      Head-dress: a sort of diadem or even a light crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY BÉRYLUNE and NEIGHBOUR BERLINGOT.&mdash;The traditional dress of
      the poor women in fairy-tales. If desired, the transformation of the Fairy
      into a princess in Act I may be omitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      DADDY TYL, MUMMY TYL, GAFFER TYL and GRANNY TYL.&mdash;The traditional
      costume of the German wood-cutters and peasants in Grimm's Tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL'S BROTHERS AND SISTERS.&mdash;Different forms of the
      Hop-o'-my-Thumb costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIME.&mdash;Traditional dress of Time: a wide black or dark-blue cloak, a
      streaming white beard, scythe and hour-glass.
    </p>

    </p>

      costume suggests that of John Bull.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT.&mdash;The costume of Puss In Boots: powdered wig, three-cornered
      hat, violet or sky-blue coat, dress-sword, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      N.B.&mdash;The heads of the DOG and the CAT should be only discreetly
      animalised.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LUXURIES.&mdash;Before the transformation: wide, heavy mantles in red
      and yellow brocade; enormous fat jewels, etc. After the transformation:
      chocolate or coffee-coloured tights, giving the impression of unadorned
      dancing-jacks.

      THE HAPPINESSES OF THE HOME.&mdash;Dresses of various colours, or, if
      preferred, costumes of peasants, shepherds, wood-cutters and so on, but

    <p>
      THE GREAT JOYS.&mdash;As stated in the text, shimmering dresses in soft
      and subtle shades: rose-awakening, water's-smile, amber-dew, blue-of-dawn,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      MATERNAL LOVE.&mdash;Dress very similar to the dress worn by Light, that
      is to say, supple and almost transparent veils, as of a Greek statue, and,
      in so far as possible, white. Pearls and other stones as rich and numerous
      as may be desired, provided that they do not break the pure and candid
      harmony of the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD.&mdash;A rich pasha's dress. An ample crimson silk or velvet gown. A
      huge turban. A scimitar. An enormous stomach, red and puffed-out cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUGAR.&mdash;A silk gown, cut like that of a eunuch in a seraglio, half
      blue and half white, to suggest the paper wrapper of a sugar-loaf.
      Eunuch's headdress.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRE.&mdash;Red tights, a vermilion cloak, with changing reflections,
      lined with gold. An aigrette of iridescent flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      WATER.&mdash;A pale-blue or bluish-green dress, with transparent
      reflections and effects of rippling or trickling gauze, Neo-Grecian or
      Anglo-Grecian style. but fuller and more voluminous than that of LIGHT.
      Head-dress of aquatic flowers and seaweed.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ANIMALS.&mdash;Popular or peasant costumes.
    </p>
    <p>

      trunks of trees. Distinctive attributes in the shape of leaves or branches
      by which they can be recognised.

    <h2>
      ACT I. <i>The Wood-cutter's Cottage</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The stage represents the interior of a wood-cutter's cottage, simple
      and rustic in appearance, but in no way poverty-stricken. A recessed
      fireplace containing the dying embers of a wood-fire. Kitchen utensils, a
      cupboard, a bread-pan, a grandfather's clock, a spinning-wheel, a
      water-tap, etc. On a table, a lighted lamp. At the foot of the cupboard,
      on either side, a</i> DOG <i>and a</i> CAT <i>lie sleeping, rolled up,
      each with his nose in his tail. Between them stands a large blue-and-white
      sugar-loaf. On the wall hangs a round cage containing a turtle-dove. At
      the back, two windows, with closed inside shutters. Under one of the
      windows, a stool. On the left is the front door, with a big latch to it.
      On the right, another door. A ladder leads up to a loft. On the right also
      are two little children's cots, at the head of which are two chains, with
      clothes carefully folded on them. When the curtain rises</i>, TYLTYL <i>and</i>
      MYTYL <i>are sound asleep in their cots</i>, MUMMY TYL <i>tucks them in,
      leans over them, watches them for a moment as they sleep and beckons to</i>
      DADDY TYL, <i>who thrusts his head through the half-open door</i>. MUMMY
      TYL <i>lays a finger on her lips, to impose silence upon him, and then
      goes out to the right, on tiptoe, after first putting out the lamp. The
      scene remains in darkness for a moment. Then a light, gradually increasing
      in intensity, filters in through the shutters. The lamp on the table
      lights again of itself, but its light is of a different colour than when</i>
      MUMMY TYL <i>extinguished it. The two</i> CHILDREN <i>appear to wake and
      sit up in bed</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Mytyl?
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Tyltyl?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Are you asleep?
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Are you?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL No; how can I be asleep when I'm talking to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Say, is this Christmas Day?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Not yet; not till to-morrow. But Father Christmas won't bring us
      anything this year....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I heard mummy say that she couldn't go to town to tell him ... But
      he will come next year....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Is next year far off?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL A good long while.... But he will come to the rich children
      to-night....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Really?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Hullo!... Mummy's forgotten to put out the lamp!... I've an
      idea!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL What?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Let's get up....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL But we mustn't....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why, there's no one about.... Do you see the shutters?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Oh, how bright they are!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL It's the lights of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL What party?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL The rich children opposite. It's the Christmas-tree. Let's open the
      shutters....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Can we?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Of course; there's no one to stop us.... Do you hear the music?...
      Let us get up....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The two</i> CHILDREN <i>get up, run to one of the windows, climb on to
      the stool and throw back the shutters. A bright light fills the room. The</i>
      CHILDREN <i>look out greedily</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL We can see everything!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>who can hardly find room on the stool</i>) I can't....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL It's snowing!... There's two carriages, with six horses each!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL There are twelve little boys getting out!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL How silly you are!... They're little girls....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL They've got knickerbockers....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What do you know?... Don't push so!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL I never touched you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>who is taking up the whole stool</i>) You're taking up all the
      room...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Why, I have no room at all!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Do be quiet! I see the tree!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL What tree?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why, the Christmas-tree!... You're looking at the wall!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL I'm looking at the wall because I've got no room....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>giving her a miserly little place on the stool</i>) There!...
      Will that do?... Now you're better off than I!... I say, what lots and
      lots of lights!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL What are those people doing who are making such a noise?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL They're the musicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Are they angry?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL No; but it's hard work.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Be quiet!... And look!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL What are those gold things there, hanging from the branches?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why, toys, to be sure!... Swords, guns, soldiers, cannons....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL And dolls; say, are there any dolls?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Dolls?... That's too silly; there's no fun in dolls....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL And what's that all round the table?....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Cakes and fruit and tarts....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL I had some once when I was little....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL So did I; it's nicer than bread, but they don't give you enough....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL They've got plenty over there.... The whole table's full.... Are
      they going to eat them?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Of course; what else would they do with them?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Why don't they eat them at once?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Because they're not hungry....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>stupefied with astonishment</i>) Not hungry?... Why not?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Well, they eat whenever they want to....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>incredulously</i>) Every day?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL They say so....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Will they eat them all?... Will they give any away?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL To whom?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL To us....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL They don't know us....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Suppose we asked them....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL We mustn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Why not?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Because it's not right.
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>clapping her hands</i>) Oh, how pretty they are!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>rapturously</i>) And how they're laughing and laughing!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL And the little ones dancing!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, yes; let's dance too!... (<i>They stamp their feet for joy on
      the stool</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Oh, what fun!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL They're getting the cakes!... They can touch them!... They're
      eating, they're eating, they're eating!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL The tiny ones, too!... They've got two, three, four apiece!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>drunk with delight</i>) Oh, how lovely!... Oh, how lovely, how
      lovely!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>counting imaginary cakes</i>) I've got twelve!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And I four times twelve!... But I'll give you some....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>A knock at the door of the cottage</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>suddenly quieted and frightened</i>) What's that?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>scared</i>) It's Daddy!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>As they hesitate before opening the door, the big latch is seen to
      rise of itself, with a grating noise; the door half opens to admit a
      little old woman dressed in green with a red hood on her head. She is
      humpbacked and lame and near-sighted; her nose and chin meet; and she
      walks bent on a stick. She is obviously a fairy</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Have you the grass here that sings or the bird that is blue?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL We have some grass, but it can't sing....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Tyltyl has a bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL But I can't give it away....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Why not?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Because it's mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY That's a reason, no doubt. Where is the bird?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>pointing to the cage</i>) In the cage....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY (<i>putting on her glasses to examine the bird</i>) I don't want
      it; it's not blue enough. You will have to go and find me the one I want.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL But I don't know where it is....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY No more do I. That's why you must look for it. I can do without
      the grass that sings, at a pinch; but I must absolutely have the blue
      bird. It's for my little girl, who is very ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What's the matter with her?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY We don't quite know; she wants to be happy....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Really?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Do you know who I am?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL You're rather like our neighbour, Madame Berlingot....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY (<i>growing suddenly angry</i>) Not a bit!... There's not the
      least likeness!... This is intolerable!... I am the Fairy Bérylune....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh! Very well....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY You will have to start at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Are you coming with us?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY I can't, because I put on the soup this morning and it always
      boils over if I leave it for more than an hour.... (<i>Pointing
      successively to the ceiling, the chimney and the window</i>) Will you go
      out this way, or that way, or that way?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>pointing timidly to the door</i>) I would rather go out that
      way....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY (<i>growing suddenly angry again</i>) That's quite impossible;
      and it's a shocking habit!... (<i>Pointing to the window</i>) We'll go out
      this way.... Well?... What are you waiting for?... Get dressed at once....
      (<i>The</i> CHILDREN <i>do as they are told and dress quickly</i>.) I'll
      help Mytyl....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL We have no shoes....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY That doesn't matter. I will give you a little magic hat. Where
      are your father and mother?....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>pointing to the door on the right</i>) They're asleep in
      there....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY And your grandpapa and grandmamma?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL They're dead....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY And your little brothers and sisters.... Have you any?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, yes; three little brothers....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL And four little sisters....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Where are they?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL They are dead, too....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Would you like to see them again?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, yes!... At once!... Show them to us!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY I haven't got them in my pocket.... But this is very lucky; you
      will see them when you go through the Land of Memory.... It's on the way
      to the Blue Bird, just on the left, past the third turning.... What were
      you doing when I knocked?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL We were playing at eating cakes?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Have you any cakes?... Where are they?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL In the house of the rich children.... Come and look, it's so
      lovely. (<i>He drags the</i> FAIRY <i>to the window</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY (<i>at the window</i>) But it's the others who are eating
      them!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes; but we can see them eat....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Aren't you cross with them?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What for?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY For eating all the cakes.... I think it's very wrong of them not
      to give you some....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Not at all; they're rich.... I say, isn't it beautiful over
      there?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY It's no more beautiful there than here.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Ugh!... It's darker here and smaller and there are no cakes....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY It's exactly the same, only you can't see....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, I can; and I have very good eyes. I can see the time on the
      church clock and daddy can't...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY (<i>suddenly angry</i>) I tell you that you can't see!... How do
      you see me?... What do I look like?... (<i>An awkward silence from</i>
      TYLTYL.) Well, answer me, will you? I want to know if you can see!... Am I
      pretty or ugly?... (<i>The silence grows more and more uncomfortable</i>.)
      Won't you answer?... Am I young or old?... Are my cheeks pink or
      yellow?... Perhaps you'll say I have a hump?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>in a conciliatory tone</i>) No, no; It's not a big one....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Oh, yes, to look at you, any one would think it enormous....
      Have I a hook nose and have I lost one of my eyes?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, no, I don't say that.... Who put it out?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY (<i>growing more and more irritated</i>). But it's not out!...
      You wretched, impudent boy!... It's much finer than the other; it's bigger
      and brighter and blue as the sky.... And my hair, do you see that?... It's
      fair as the corn in the fields, it's like virgin gold!... And I've such
      heaps and heaps of it that it weighs my head down.... It escapes on every
      side.... Do you see it on my hands? (<i>She holds out two lean wisps of
      grey hair</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, I see a little....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY (<i>indignantly</i>) A little!... Sheaves! Armfuls! Clusters!
      Waves of gold!... I know there are people who say that they don't see any;
      but you're not one of those wicked, blind people, I should hope?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, no; I can see all that isn't hidden....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY But you ought to see the rest with as little doubt!... Human
      beings are very odd!... Since the death of the fairies, they see nothing
      at all and they never suspect it.... Luckily, I always carry with me all
      that is wanted to give new light to dimmed eyes.... What am I taking out
      of my bag?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, what a dear little green hat!... What's that shining in the
      cockade?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY That's the big diamond that makes people see....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Really?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Yes; when you've got the hat on your head, you turn the diamond
      a little; from right to left, for instance, like this; do you see?... Then
      it presses a bump which nobody knows of and which opens your eyes....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Doesn't it hurt?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY On the contrary, it's enchanted.... You at once see even the
      inside of things: the soul of bread, of wine, of pepper, for instance....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Can you see the soul of sugar, too?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY (<i>suddenly cross</i>) Of course you can!... I hate unnecessary
      questions.... The soul of sugar is no more interesting than the soul of
      pepper.... There, I give you all I have to help you in your search for the
      Blue Bird. I know that the flying carpet or the ring which makes its
      wearer invisible would be more useful to you.... But I have lost the key
      of the cupboard in which I locked them.... Oh, I was almost forgetting!...
      (<i>Pointing to the diamond</i>) When you hold it like this, do you
      see?... One little turn more and you behold the past.... Another little
      turn and you behold the future.... It's curious and practical and it's
      quite noiseless....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Daddy will take it from me....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY He won't see it; no one can see it as long as it's on your
      head.... Will you try it?... (<i>She puts the little green hat on</i>
      TYLTYL'S <i>head</i>.) Now, turn the diamond.... One turn and then....
    </p>
    <p>
      (TYLTYL <i>has no sooner turned the diamond than a sudden and wonderful
      change comes over everything. The old</i> FAIRY <i>alters then and there
      into a princess of marvellous beauty; the flints of which the cottage
      walls are built light up, turn blue as sapphires, become transparent and
      gleam and sparkle like the most precious stones. The humble furniture
      takes life and becomes resplendent; the deal table assumes as grave and
      noble an air as a table made of marble; the face of the clock winks its
      eye and smiles genially, while the door that contains the pendulum opens
      and releases the Hours, which, holding one another by the hand and
      laughing merrily, begin to dance to the sound of delicious music</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>displaying a legitimate bewilderment and pointing to the Hours</i>)
      Who are all those pretty ladies?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Don't be afraid; they are the hours of your life and they are
      glad to be free and visible for a moment....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And why are the walls so bright?... Are they made of sugar or of
      precious stones?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY All stones are alike, all stones are precious; but man sees only
      a few of them....

    <p>
      (<i>While they are speaking, the scene of enchantment continues and is
      completed. The souls of the Quartern-loaves, in the form of little men in

      FIRE, <i>who, springing from the hearth in yellow and vermilion tights,
      writhes with laughter as he chases the loaves</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Who are those ugly little men?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Oh, they're nothing; they are merely the souls of the
      Quartern-loaves, who are taking advantage of the reign of truth to leave
      the pan in which they were too tightly packed....

      THE FAIRY What, you too?... Are you there still?...

      danger?...

      taps, than accompany the children in search of the bird?...
    </p>

      ALL (<i>excepting the</i> DOG <i>and</i> LIGHT) Yes, yes! Now, at once!...

      THE FAIRY (<i>to</i> LIGHT, <i>who is dreamily gazing at the wreckage of

    <p>

      THE DOG (<i>yelling with delight</i>) I too!... I too!...

      THE FAIRY That's right.... Besides, it's too late to go back; you have no
      choice now, you must all start with us.... But you, Fire, don't come near
      anybody; you, Dog, don't tease the Cat; and you, Water, hold yourself up
      and try not to run all over the place....

      SCENE I.&mdash;<i>At the</i> FAIRY'S.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>A magnificent entrance-hall in the palace of the</i> FAIRY BÉRYLUNE. <i>Columns
      of gleaming marble with gold and silver capitals, staircases, porticoes,
      balustrades, etc</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter from the back, on the right, sumptuously clad, the</i> CAT, SUGAR
      <i>and</i> FIRE. <i>They come from a room which emits rays of light; it is
      the</i> FAIRY'S <i>wardrobe. The</i> CAT <i>has donned the classic costume
      of Puss-in-boots</i>; SUGAR, <i>a silk dress, half white and half
      pale-blue; and</i> FIRE <i>wears a number of many-coloured aigrettes and a
      long vermilion mantle lined with gold. They cross the whole length of the
      hall to the front of the stage, where the</i> CAT <i>draws them up under a
      portico on the right</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT This way, I know every inch of this palace. It was left to the
      Fairy Bérylune by Bluebeard.... Let us make the most of our last minute of
      liberty, while the children and Light pay their visit to the Fairy's
      little daughter.... I have brought you here in order to discuss the
      position in which we are placed.... Are we all here?...
    </p>
    <p>
      SUGAR I see the Dog coming out of the Fairy's wardrobe....
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRE What on earth has he got on?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT He has put on the livery of one of the footmen of Cinderella's
      coach.... It was just the thing for him.... He has the soul of a
      flunkey.... But let us hide behind the balustrade.... It's strange how I
      mistrust him.... He had better not hear what I have to say to you....
    </p>
    <p>
      SUGAR It is too late.... He has discovered us.... Look, here is Water also
      coming out of the wardrobe.... Goodness me, how fine she is!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The</i> DOG <i>and</i> WATER <i>join the first group</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG (<i>frisking about</i>) There! There!... Aren't we fine I.... Just
      look at these laces and this embroidery!... It's real gold and no
      mistake!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>to</i> WATER) Is that Catskin's "colour-of-time" dress?... I
      seem to recognise it....
    </p>
    <p>
      WATER Yes, it's the one that suited me best....
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRE (<i>between his teeth</i>) She's not brought her umbrella....
    </p>
    <p>
      WATER What's that?...
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRE Nothing, nothing....
    </p>
    <p>
      WATER I thought you might be speaking of a great red I saw the other
      day....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT Come, don't let as quarrel; we have more important things to
      do.... We are only waiting for Bread; where is he?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG He was making an endless fuss about choosing his dress....
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRE Worth while, isn't it, for a fellow who looks a fool and carries an
      enormous stomach?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG At last, he decided in favour of a Turkish robe, adorned with
      gems, a scimitar and a turban....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT There he is!... He has put on Bluebeard's finest dress...
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter</i> BREAD, <i>in the costume described above. The silk robe is
      crossed tightly over his huge stomach. In one hand he holds the hilt of a
      scimitar passed through his sash and in the other the cage intended for
      the Blue Bird</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD (<i>waddling conceitedly</i>) Well?... What do you think of this?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG (<i>frisking round the</i> LOAF) How nice he looks! What a fool he
      looks! How nice he looks! How nice he looks!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>to the</i> LOAF) Are the children dressed?...
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD Yes, Master Tyltyl has put on Hop-o'-my-Thumb's blue jacket and red
      breeches; and Miss Mytyl has Gretel's frock and Cinderella's slippers....
      But the great thing was the dressing of Light!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT Why?...
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD The Fairy thought her so lovely that she did not want to dress her
      at all!... Thereupon I protested in the name of our dignity as essential
      and eminently respectable elements; and I ended by declaring that, under
      those conditions, I should refuse to be seen with her....
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRE They ought to have bought her a lampshade!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT And what answer did the Fairy make?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LOAF She hit me with her stick on my head and stomach....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT And then?...
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD I allowed myself to be convinced; but, at the last moment, Light
      decided on the moonbeam dress at the bottom of the chest with Catskin's
      treasures....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT Come, stop chattering, time presses.... Our future is at stake....
      You have heard&mdash;the Fairy has just said so&mdash;that the end of this
      journey will, at the same time, mark the end of our lives.... It is our
      business, therefore, to prolong it as much as possible and by every
      possible means.... But there is another thing: we must think of the fate
      of our race and the destiny of our children....
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD Hear, hear!... The Cat is right!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT Listen to me!... All of us here present, Animals, Things and
      Elements, possess a soul which man does not yet know. That is why we
      retain a remnant of independence; but, if he finds the Blue Bird, he will
      know all, he will see all and we shall be completely at his mercy.... This
      is what I have just learned from my old friend, Night, who is also the
      guardian of the mysteries of Life.... It is to our interest, therefore, at
      all costs to prevent the finding of that bird, even if we have to go so
      far as to endanger the lives of the children themselves....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG (<i>indignantly</i>) What's the fellow saying?... Just say that
      again, will you, to see if I heard right?...
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD Order! Order!... It's not your turn to speak!... I'm in the chair at
      this meeting....
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRE Who made you chairman?...
    </p>
    <p>
      WATER (<i>to</i> FIRE) Hold your tongue!... What are you interfering
      with?...
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRE I shall interfere where I choose.... And I want none of your
      remarks....
    </p>
    <p>
      SUGAR (<i>concilatorily</i>) Excuse me.... Do not let us quarrel.... This
      is a serious moment.... We must, above all things, decide what measures to
      adopt....
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD I quite agree with Sugar and the Cat....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG This is ridiculous!... There is Man and that's all!... We have to
      obey him and do as he tells us!... That is the one and only fact!... I
      recognise no one but him!... Hurrah for Man!... Man for ever!... In life
      or death, all for Man!... Man is God!...
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD I quite agree with the Dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>to the</i> DOG) But at least give your reasons....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG There are no reasons!... I love Man and that's enough!... If you
      do anything against him, I will throttle you first and I will go and tell
      him everything....
    </p>
    <p>
      SUGAR (<i>intervening sweetly</i>) Excuse me.... Let us not embitter the
      discussion.... From a certain point of view, you are both of you right....
      There is something to be said on both sides....
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD I quite agree with SUGAR!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT Are we not, all of us, Water, Fire you yourselves, Bread and the
      Dog, the victims of a nameless tyranny?... Do you remember the time when,
      before the coming of the despot, we wandered at liberty upon the face of
      the earth?... Fire and Water were the sole masters of the world; and see
      what they have come to!... As for us puny descendants of the great wild
      animals.... Look out!... Pretend to be doing nothing!... I see the Fairy
      and Light coming.... Light has taken sides with Man; she is our worst
      enemy.... Here they are....
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter, on the right, the</i> FAIRY, <i>in the shape of an old woman,
      and</i> LIGHT, <i>followed by</i> TYLTYL <i>and</i> MYTYL.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Well?... What is it?... What are you doing in that corner?...
      You look like conspirators.... It is time to start.... I have decided that
      Light shall be your leader.... You will obey her as you would me and I am
      giving her my wand.... The children will pay a visit to their late
      grandparents this evening.... You will remain behind; that is more
      discreet.... They will spend the evening in the bosom of their dead
      family.... Meanwhile, you will be getting ready all that is wanted for
      to-morrow's journey, which will be a long one.... Come, up, be off and
      every one to his post!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>hypocritically</i>) That is just what I was saying to them,
      madam.... I was encouraging them to do their duty bravely and
      conscientiously; unfortunately, the Dog, who kept on interrupting me....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG What's that?... Just wait a bit I...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>He is about to leap upon the</i> CAT, <i>but</i> TYLTYL <i>foreseeing
      his intention, stops with a threatening gesture</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Down, Tylô!... Take care; and, if ever I catch you again...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG My little god, you don't know, it was he who...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>threatening him</i>) Be quiet!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Come, that will do.... Let Bread hand the cage for this evening
      to Tyltyl.... It is just possible that the Blue Bird may be hidden In the
      Past, at the grandparents'.... In any case, it Is a chance which we must
      not neglect.... Well, Bread, the cage?
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD (<i>solemnly</i>) One moment, if you please, Mrs. Fairy.... (<i>Like
      an orator making a speech</i>) I call upon all of you to bear witness that
      this silver cage, which was entrusted to my care by....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY (<i>interrupting him</i>) Enough!... No speeches!... We will go
      out this way and the children that....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>rather anxiously</i>) Are we to go all alone?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL I feel hungry!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I, too!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY (<i>to</i> BREAD) Open your Turkish robe and give them a slice
      of your good stomach....
    </p>
    <p>
      (BREAD <i>opens his robe, draws his scimitar and cuts two slices out of
      his stomach and hands them to the</i> CHILDREN.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SUGAR (<i>approaching the</i> CHILDREN) Allow me at the same time to offer
      you a few sugar-sticks.... (<i>He breaks off the five fingers of his left
      hand, one by one, and presents them to the</i> CHILDREN.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL What is he doing?... He is breaking all his fingers!...
    </p>
    <p>
      SUGAR (<i>engagingly</i>) Taste them, they are capital... They're made of
      real barley-sugar....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>tasting one of the fingers</i>) Oh, how good they are!... Have
      you many of them?...
    </p>
    <p>
      SUGAR (<i>modestly</i>) Yes; as many as I want....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Does that hurt you much, when you break them off?...
    </p>
    <p>
      SUGAR Not at all.... On the contrary, it's a great advantage; they grow
      again at once and so I always have new, clean fingers....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Come, children, don't eat too much sugar.... Don't forget that
      you are to have supper presently with your grandpapa and grandmamma....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Are they here?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY You shall see them at once....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL How can we see them, when they are dead?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY How can they be dead, when they live in your memory?... Men do
      not know this secret, because they know so little; whereas you, thanks to
      the diamond, are about to see that the dead who are remembered live as
      happily as though they were not dead....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Is Light coming with us?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY No, it is more proper that this visit should be confined to the
      family.... I will wait near here, so as not to appear indiscreet.... They
      did not invite me....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Which way are we to go?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FAIRY Over there.... You are on the threshold of the Land of
      Memory.... As soon as you have turned the diamond, you will see a big tree
      with a board on it, which will show you that you are there.... But don't
      forget that you are to be back, both of you, by a quarter to nine.... It
      is extremely important.... Now mind and be punctual, for all would be lost
      if you were late.... Good-bye for the present!... (<i>Calling the</i> CAT,

    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Behind the fog.... We shall see....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL I can see nothing at all!... I can't see my feet or my hands.... (<i>Whimpering</i>)
      I'm cold!... I don't want to travel any more.... I want to go home....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Come, don't keep on crying, just like Water.... You ought to be
      ashamed of yourself.... A great big little girl like you.... Look, the fog
      is lifting already.... We shall see what's behind it....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The mist begins to move; It grows thinner and lighter, disperses,
      evaporates. Soon, in a more and more transparent light, appears, under a
      leafy vault, a cheerful little peasant's cottage, covered with creepers.
      The door and windows are open. There are bee-hives under a shed,
      flower-pots on the window-sills, a cage with a sleeping blackbird. Beside
      the door is a bench, on which an old peasant and his wife</i>, TYLTYL'S <i>grandfather
      and grandmother, are seated, both sound asleep</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>suddenly recognising them</i>) It's grandad and granny!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>clapping her hands</i>) Yes! Yes!... So it is! So it is!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>still a little distrustful</i>) Take care!... We don't know yet
      if they can stir.... Let's keep behind the tree....

    <p>
      GRANNY TYL I have a notion that our grandchildren who are still alive are
      coming to see us today....
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL They are certainly thinking of as, for I feel anyhow and I have
      pins and needles in my legs....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL I think they must be quite near, for I see tears of joy dancing
      before my eyes....
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL No, no, they are a long way off.... I still feel weak....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL I tell you they are here; I am quite strong....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL <i>and</i> MYTYL (<i>rushing up from behind the oak</i>) Here we
      are!... Here we are!... Gaffer! Granny!... It's we!... It's we!...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL There!... You see?... What did I tell you?... I was sure they
      would come to-day....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL Tyltyl!... Mytyl!... It's you!... It's she!... (<i>Trying to
      run to meet them</i>) I can't run!... I've still got the rheumatics!...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL (<i>hobbling along as fast as he can</i>) No more can I....
      That's because of my wooden leg, which I still wear instead of the one I
      broke when I fell off the big oak....

      (<i>The</i> GRANDPARENTS <i>and the</i> CHILDREN <i>exchange frantic
      embraces</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL How tall and strong you've grown, Tyltyl!
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL (<i>stroking</i> MYTYL'S <i>hair</i>) And Mytyl!... Just look
      at her.... What pretty hair, what pretty eyes!...
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL Come and kiss me again!... Come on to my lap....
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL And what about me?...
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL No, no.... Come to me first.... How are Daddy and Mummy Tyl?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Quite well, granny.... They were asleep when we went out....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL (<i>gazing at them and covering them with caresses</i>) Lord,
      how pretty they are and how nice and clean!... Was it mummy who washed
      you?... And there are no holes in your stockings!... I used to darn them
      once, you know.... Why don't you come to see us oftener?... It makes us so
      happy!... It is months and months now that you've forgotten us and that we
      have seen nobody....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL We couldn't, granny; and to-day its only because of the Fairy....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL We are always here, waiting for a visit from those who are
      alive.... They come so seldom!... The last time you were here, let me see,
      when was it?... It was on All-hallows, when the church-bells were
      ringing....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL All-hallows?... We didn't go out that day, for we both had very bad
      colds....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL No; but you thought of us....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL Well, every time you think of us, we wake up and see you
      again....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What, is it enough to...
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL But come, you know that....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL No, I didn't know....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL (<i>to</i> GAFFER TYL) It's astonishing, up there.... They
      don't know yet.... Do they never learn anything?...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL It's as in our own time.... The Living are so stupid when they
      speak of the Others....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Do you sleep all the time?...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL Yes, we get plenty of sleep, while waiting for a thought of the
      Living to come and wake us.... Ah, it is good to sleep when life is
      done.... But it is pleasant also to wake up from time to time....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL So you are not really dead?...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL What do you say?... What is he saying?... Now he's using words
      we don't understand.... Is it a new word, a new invention?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL The word "dead"?...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL Yes, that was the word.... What does it mean?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why, it means that one's no longer alive....
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL How silly they are, up there!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Is it nice here?...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL Oh, yes; not bad, not bad; and, if one could just have a
      smoke....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Aren't you allowed to smoke?...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL Yes, it's allowed; but I've broken my pipe....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL Yes, yes, all would be well, if only you would come and see us
      oftener.... Do you remember, Tyltyl?... The last time I baked you a lovely
      apple-tart.... You ate such a lot of it that you made yourself ill....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL But I haven't eaten any apple-tart since last year.... There were
      no apples this year....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL Don't talk nonsense.... Here, we have them always....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL That's different....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL What? That's different?... Why, nothing's different when we're
      able to kiss each other....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>looking first at his</i> GRANDMOTHER <i>and then at his</i>
      GRANDFATHER) You haven't changed, grandad, not a bit, not a bit.... And
      granny hasn't changed a bit either.... But you're better-looking....
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL Well, we feel all right.... We have stopped growing older....
      But you, how tall you're growing!... Yes, you're shooting up finely....
      Look, over there, on the door, is the mark of the last time.... That was
      on All-hallows.... Now then, stand up straight.... (TYLTYL <i>stands up
      against the door</i>.) Four fingers taller!... That's immense!... (MYTYL
      <i>also stands up against the door</i>.) And Mytyl, four and a half!...
      Aha, ill weeds grow apace!... How they've grown, oh, how they've grown!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>looking around him with delight</i>) Nothing is changed,
      everything is in its old place!... Only everything is prettier!... There
      is the clock with the big hand which I broke the point off....
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL And here is the soup-tureen you chipped a corner off....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And here is the hole which I made in the door, the day I found the
      gimlet....
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL Yes, you've done some damage in your time!... And here is the
      plum-tree in which you were so fond of climbing, when I wasn't looking....
      It still has its fine red plums....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL But they are finer than ever!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL And here is the old blackbird!... Does he still sing?...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The blackbird wakes and begins to sing at the top of his voice</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL You see.... As soon as one thinks of him....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>observing with amazement that the blackbird is quite blue</i>)
      But he's blue!... Why, that's the bird, the Blue Bird which I am to take
      back to the Fairy.... And you never told us that you had him here!... Oh,
      he's blue, blue, blue as a blue glass marble!... (<i>Entreatingly</i>)
      Grandad, granny, will you give him to me?...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL Yes, perhaps, perhaps.... What do you think, granny?...
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL Certainly, certainly.... What use is he to us?... He does
      nothing but sleep.... We never hear him sing....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I will put him in my cage.... I say, where is my cage?... Oh, I
      know, I left it behind the big tree.... (<i>He runs to the tree, fetches
      the cage and puts the blackbird into it</i>.) So, really, you've really
      given him to me?... How pleased the Fairy will be!... And Light too!...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL Mind you, I won't answer for the bird.... I'm afraid that he
      will never get used again to the restless life up there and that he'll
      come back here by the first wind that blows this way.... However, we shall
      see.... Leave him there, for the present, and come and look at the cow....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>noticing the hives</i>) And how are the bees getting on?
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL Oh, pretty well.... They are no longer alive, as you call it up
      there; but they work hard....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>going up to the hives</i>) Oh, yes!... I can smell the
      honey!... How heavy the hives must be!... All the flowers are so
      beautiful!... And my little dead sisters, are they here too?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL And where are my three little brothers who were buried?...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>At these words, seven little</i> CHILDREN, <i>of different sizes, like
      a set of Pan's pipes, come out of the cottage, one by one</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL Here they are, here they are!... As soon as you think of them,
      as soon as you speak of them, they are there, the darlings!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (TYLTYL <i>and</i> MYTYL <i>run to meet the</i> CHILDREN. <i>They hustle
      and hug one another and dance and whirl about and utter screams of joy</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Hullo, Pierrot!... (<i>They clutch each other by the hair</i>.) Ah,
      so we're going to fight again, as in the old days.... And Robert!... I
      say, Jean, what's become of your top?... Madeleine and Pierette and
      Pauline!... And here's Riquette!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Oh, Riquette, Riquette!... She's still crawling on all fours!...
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL Yes, she has stopped growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>noticing the little</i> DOG <i>yelping around them</i>) There's
      Kiki, whose tail I cut off with Pauline's scissors.... He hasn't changed
      either....
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL (<i>sententiously</i>) No, nothing changes here....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And Pauline still has a pimple on her nose....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL Yes, it won't go away; there's nothing to be done for it....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, how well they look, how fat and glossy they are!... What jolly
      cheeks they have!... They look well fed....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL They have been much better since they ceased living.... There's
      nothing more to fear, nobody is ever ill, one has no anxiety....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The clock inside the cottage strikes eight</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL (<i>amazed</i>) What's that?...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL I don't know, I'm sure.... It must be the clock....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL It can't be.... It never strikes....
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL Because we no longer think of the time.... Was any one thinking
      of the time?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, I was.... What is the time?...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL I'm sure I can't tell.... I've forgotten how.... It struck
      eight times, so I suppose it's what they call eight o'clock up there....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Light expects me at a quarter to nine.... It's because of the
      Fairy.... It's extremely important.... I'm off!...
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL Don't leave us like that, just as supper's ready!... Quick,
      quick, let's lay the table outside.... I've got some capital cabbage-soup
      and a beautiful plum-tart....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>They get out the table, dishes, plates, etc., and lay for supper
      outside the door, all helping</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Well, as I've got the Blue Bird.... And then it's so long since I
      tasted cabbage-soup.... Ever since I've been, travelling.... They don't
      have it at the hotels....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL There!... That didn't take long!... Sit down, children....
      Don't let us lose time, if you're in a hurry....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>They have lit the lamp and served the soup. The</i> GRANDPARENTS <i>and
      the</i> CHILDREN <i>sit down round the table, jostling and elbowing one
      another and laughing and screaming with pleasure</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>eating like a glutton</i>) How good it is!... Oh, how good it
      is!...I want some more! More!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>He brandishes his wooden spoon and noisily hits his plate with it</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL Come, come, a little more quiet.... You're just as ill-behaved
      as ever; and you'll break your plate....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>half-raising himself on his stool</i>) I want more, more!... (<i>He
      seizes the tureen, drags it toward him and upsets it and the soup, which
      trickles over the table and down over their knees and scalds them. Yells
      and screams of pain</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL There!... I told you so!...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL (<i>giving TYLTYL a loud box on the ear</i>) That's one for
      you!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>staggered for a moment, next puts his hand to his cheek with an
      expression of rapture</i>) Oh, that's just like the slaps you used to give
      me when you were alive?... Grandad, how nice it was and how good it makes
      one feel!... I must give you a kiss!...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL Very well; there's more where that came from, if you like
      them....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The clock strikes half-past eight</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>starting up</i>) Half-past eight!... (<i>He flings down his
      spoon</i>.) Mytyl, we've only just got time!...
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL Oh, I say!... Just a few minutes more!... Your house isn't on
      fire!... We see you so seldom....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL No, we can't possibly.... Light is so kind.... And I promised
      her.... Come, Mytyl, come!...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL Goodness gracious, how tiresome the Living are with all their
      business and excitement!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>taking his cage and hurriedly kissing everybody all round</i>)
      Good-bye, grandad.... Good-bye, granny.... Good-bye, brothers and sisters,
      Pierrot, Robert, Pauline, Madeleine, Riquette and you, too, Kiki.... I
      feel we mustn't stay.... Don't cry, granny; we will come back often....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL Come back every day!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, yes; we will come back as often as we can....
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANNY TYL It's our only pleasure and it's such a treat for us when your
      thoughts visit us!...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL We have no other amusements....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Quick, quick!... My cage!... My bird!...
    </p>
    <p>
      GAFFER TYL (<i>handing him the cage</i>) Here they are!... You know, I
      don't warrant him; and if he's not the right colour...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Good-bye! Good-bye!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS TYL Good-bye, Tyltyl! Good-bye, Mytyl!...
      Remember the barley-sugar!... Good-bye!... Come again!... Come again!...

      SCENE 1.&mdash;<i>The Palace of</i> NIGHT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>A large and wonderful hall of an austere, rigid, metallic and
      sepulchral magnificence, giving the impression of a Greek temple with
      columns, architraves, flagstones and ornaments of black marble, gold and
      ebony. The hall is trapezium-shaped. Basalt steps, occupying almost the
      entire width, divide it into three successive stages, which rise gradually
      toward the back. On the right and left, between the columns, are doors of
      sombre bronze. At the back, a monumental door of brass. The palace is lit
      only by a vague light that seems to emanate mainly from the brilliancy of
      the marble and the ebony. At the rise of the curtain</i>, NIGHT, <i>in the
      form of a very old woman, clad in long, black garments, is seated on the
      steps of the second stage between two children, of whom one, almost naked,
      like Cupid, is smiling in a deep sleep, while the other is standing up,
      motionless and veiled from head to foot</i>.

      Night.... I am worn out....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT What's the matter, child?... You look pale and thin and you are
      splashed with mud to your very whiskers.... Have you been fighting on the
      tiles again, in the snow and rain?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT It has nothing to do with the tiles!... It's our secret that's at
      stake!... It's the beginning of the end!... I have managed to escape for a
      moment to warn you; but I greatly fear that there is nothing to be
      done....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Why?... What has happened?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT I have told you of little Tyltyl, the woodcutter's son, and of the
      magic diamond.... Well, he is coming here to demand the Blue Bird of
      you....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT He hasn't got it yet.....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT He will have it soon, unless we perform some miracle.... This is
      how the matter stands: Light, who is guiding him and betraying us all, for
      she has placed herself entirely on Man's side, Light has learned that the
      Blue Bird, the real one, the only one that can live in the light of day,
      is hidden here, among the blue birds of the dreams that live on the rays
      of the moon and die as soon as they set eyes on the sun.... She knows that
      she is forbidden to cross the threshold of your palace, but she is sending
      the children; and, as you cannot prevent Man from opening the doors of
      your secrets, I do not know how all this will end.... In any case, if,
      unfortunately, they should lay their hands on the real Blue Bird, there
      would be nothing for us but to disappear....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Oh dear, oh dear!.... What times we live in!... I never have a
      moment's peace.... I cannot understand Man, these last few years.... What
      is he aiming at?... Must he absolutely know everything?... Already he has
      captured a third of my Mysteries, all my Terrors are afraid and dare not
      leave the house, my Ghosts have taken flight, the greater part of my
      Sicknesses are ill....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT I know, Mother Night, I know, the times are hard and we are almost
      alone in our struggle against Man.... But I hear them coming.... I see
      only one way: as they are children, we must give them such a fright that
      they will not dare to persist or to open the great door at the back,
      behind which they would find the Birds of the Moon.... The secrets of the
      other caverns will be enough to distract their attention and terrify
      them....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT (<i>listening to a sound outside</i>) What do I hear?... Are there
      many of them?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT It is nothing; it is our friends, Bread and Sugar; Water is not
      very well and Fire could not come, because he is related to Light.... The
      Dog is the only one who is not on our side; but it is never possible to
      keep him away....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Enter timidly, on the right, in the foreground, TYLTYL, MYTYL, BREAD,
      SUGAR and the DOG</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>rushing up to TYLTYL</i>) This way, little master, this
      way.... I have told Night, who is delighted to see you.... You must
      forgive her, she is a little indisposed; that is why she was not able to
      come to meet you....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Good-day, Mrs. Night....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT (<i>in an offended voice</i>) Good-day?... I am not used to that....
      You might say, Good-night, or, at least. Good-evening....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>mortified</i>) I beg your pardon, ma'am....I did not know....(<i>Pointing
      to the two</i> CHILDREN.) Are those your two little boys?... They are very
      nice....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT This is Sleep....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why is he so fat?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT That is because he sleeps well....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And the other, hiding himself?... Why does he veil his face?...Is
      he ill?... What is his name?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT That is Sleep's sister.... It is better not to mention her name....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Because her name is not pleasant to hear.... But let us talk of
      something else.... The Cat tells me that you have come here to look for
      the Blue Bird....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, ma'am, if you will allow me.... Will you tell me where he
      is?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT I don't know, dear.... All I can say is that he is not here.... I
      have never seen him....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, yes.... Light told me that he was here; and Light knows what
      she is saying.... Will you hand me your keys?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT But you must understand, dear, that I cannot give my keys like that
      to the first comer.... I have the keeping of all Nature's secrets and I am
      absolutely forbidden to deliver them to anybody, especially to a child....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL You have no right to refuse them to Man when he asks you for
      them....I know that....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Who told you?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Light....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Light again! Always Light!... How dare she interfere, how dare
      she?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG Shall I take them from her by force, my little god?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Hold your tongue, keep quiet and try to behave.... (<i>To</i>NIGHT)
      Come, madam, give me your keys, please....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Have you the sign, at least?... Where is it?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>touching his hat</i>) Behold the Diamond!...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT (<i>resigning herself to the inevitable</i>) Well, then... Here is
      the key that opens all the doors of the hall.... Look to yourself if you
      meet with a misfortune.... I will not be responsible....
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD (<i>very anxiously</i>) Is it dangerous?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Dangerous?... I will go so far as to say that I myself do not know
      what I shall do when certain of those bronze doors open upon the abyss....
      All around the hall, in each of those basalt caves, are all the evils, all
      the plagues, all the sicknesses, all the terrors, all the catastrophes,
      all the mysteries that have afflicted life since the beginning of the
      world.... I have had trouble enough to Imprison them there with the aid of
      Destiny; and it is not without difficulty, I assure you, that I keep some
      little order among those undisciplined characters.... You have seen what
      happens when one of them escapes and shows itself on earth....
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD My great age, my experience and my devotion make me the natural
      protector of these two children; therefore, Mrs. Night, permit me to ask
      you a question....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Certainly....
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD In case of danger, which is the way of escape?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT There is no way of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>taking the key and climbing the first steps</i>) Let us begin
      here.... What is behind this bronze door?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT I think it is the Ghosts.... It is long since I opened the door and
      since they came out....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>placing the key in the lock</i>) I will see.... (<i>To</i>
      BREAD) Have you the cage for the Blue Bird?...
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD (<i>with chattering teeth</i>) I'm not frightened, but don't you
      think it would be better not to open the door, but to peep through the
      keyhole?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I don't want your advice....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>suddenly beginning to cry</i>) I am frightened!... Where is
      Sugar?... I want to go home!...
    </p>
    <p>
      SUGAR (<i>eagerly, obsequiously</i>) Here I am, miss, here I am.... Don't
      cry, I will break off one of my fingers so that you may have a
      sugar-stick....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Enough of this!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>He turns the key and cautiously opens the door. Forthwith, five or six</i>
      GHOSTS <i>of strange and different forms escape and disperse on every side</i>.
      MYTYL <i>gives a scream of fright</i>, BREAD, <i>terrified, throws away
      the cage and goes and hides at the back of the hall, while</i> NIGHT, <i>running
      after the</i> GHOSTS, <i>cries out to</i> TYLTYL.)
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Quick! Quick!... Shut the door!... They will all escape and we
      should never be able to catch them again!... They have felt bored in
      there, ever since Man ceased to take them seriously.... (<i>She runs after
      the</i> GHOSTS <i>and endeavours, with the aid of a whip formed of snakes,
      to drive them back to the door of their prison</i>.) Help me!... Here!...
      Here!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>to the</i> DOG) Help her, Tylô, at them!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG (<i>leaping up and barking</i>) Yes, yes, yes!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And Bread, where's Bread?...
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD (<i>at the back of the hall</i>) Here.... I am near the door to
      prevent them from going out....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>One of the</i> GHOSTS <i>moves in that direction and he rushes away at
      full speed, uttering yells of terror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT (<i>to three</i> GHOSTS <i>whom she has seized by the neck</i>) This
      way, you!... (<i>To</i> TYLTYL) Open the door a little.... (<i>She pushes
      the</i> GHOSTS <i>into the cave</i>.) There, that's it.... (<i>The</i> DOG
      <i>brings up two more</i>.) And these two.... Come, quick, in with you!...
      You know you're only allowed out on All-hallows....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>She closes the door.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>going to another door</i>) What's behind this one?....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT What is the good?...I have already told you the Blue Bird has never
      been here.... However, as you please.... Open the doors if you like....
      It's the Sicknesses....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>with the key in the lock</i>.) Must I be careful in opening?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT No, it is not worth while.... They are very quiet, the poor little
      things.... They are not happy.... Man, for some time, has been waging such
      a determined war upon them!... Especially since the discovery of the
      microbes.... Open, you will see....
    </p>
    <p>
      (TYLTYL <i>opens the door quite wide. Nothing appears</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Don't they come out?
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT I told you they are almost all poorly and very much discouraged....
      The doctors are so unkind to them.... Go in for a moment and see for
      yourself....
    </p>
    <p>
      (TYLTYL <i>enters the cavern and comes out again immediately</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL The Blue Bird is not there.... They look very ill, those Sicknesses
      of yours.... They did not even lift their heads.... (<i>One little
      Sickness in slippers, a dressing-gown and a cotton nightcap escapes from
      the cavern and begins to frisk about the hall</i>.) Look!... There's a
      little one escaping.... Which one is it?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT It's nothing, one of the smallest; it's Cold-in-the-Head.... It is
      one of those which are least persecuted and which enjoy the best
      health.... (<i>Calling to</i> COLD-IN-THE-HEAD) Come here, dear....It's
      too soon yet; you must wait for the winter.... (COLD-IN-THE-HEAD, <i>sneezing,
      coughing and blowing its nose, returns to the cavern and</i> TYLTYL <i>shuts
      the door</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>going to the next door</i>) Let us look at this one..... What
      is in here?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Take care!... It is the Wars.... They are more terrible and powerful
      than ever.... Heaven knows what would happen if one of them escaped!...
      Fortunately, they are rather heavy and slow-moving.... But we must stand
      ready to push back the door, all of us together, while you take a rapid
      glance into the cavern....
    </p>
    <p>
      (TYLTYL, <i>with a thousand precautions, opens the door ajar so that there
      is only a little gap to which he can put his eye. He at once doubles his
      back against the door, shouting</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Quick! Quick!... Push with all your might!... They have seen me!...
      They are all coming!... They are breaking down the door!...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Come, all together!... Push hard!... Bread, what are you doing?...
      Push, all of you!... How strong they are!... Ah, that's it!... They are
      giving way!... It was high time!... Did you see them?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, yes!... They are huge and awful!... I don't think that they
      have the Blue Bird....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT You may be sure they haven't.... If they had, they would eat him at
      once.... Well, have you had enough of it?... You see there is nothing to
      be done....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I must see everything.... Light said so....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Light said so!... It's an easy thing to say when one's afraid and
      stays at home....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Let us go to the next.... What is in here?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT This is where I lock up the Shades and the Terrors....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Can I open the door?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Certainly.... They are pretty quiet; they are like the
      Sicknesses....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>half-opening the door, with a certain mistrustfulness, and
      taking a look into the cavern</i>) Are they not there?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT (<i>looking into the cavern in her turn</i>) Well, Shades, what are
      you doing?... Come out for a moment and stretch your legs; it will do you
      good.... And the Terrors also.... There is nothing to be afraid of.... (<i>A
      few</i> SHADES <i>and a few</i> TERRORS, <i>in the shape of women,
      shrouded, the former in black veils and the latter in greenish veils,
      piteously venture to take a few steps outside the cavern; and then, upon a
      movement of</i> TYLTYL'S, <i>hastily run back again</i>.) Come, don't be
      afraid.... It's only a child; he won't hurt you.... (<i>To</i> TYLTYL)
      They have become extremely timid, except the great ones, those whom you
      see at the back....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>looking into the depths of the cave</i>) Oh, how terrifying
      they are!...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT They are chained up.... They are the only ones that are not afraid
      of Man.... But shut the door, lest they should grow angry....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>going to the next door</i>) I say!... This is a darker one....
      What is here?
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT There are several Mysteries behind this one.... If you are
      absolutely bent upon it, you may open it too.... But don't go in.... Be
      very cautious and let us get ready to push back the door, as we did with
      the Wars....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>half-opening the door; with unparalleled precautions and
      passing his head fearsomely through the aperture</i>) Oh!... How cold!...
      My eyes are smarting!... Shut it quickly!... Push, oh, push! They are
      pushing against us!... (NIGHT, <i>the</i> DOG, <i>the</i> CAT <i>and</i>
      SUGAR <i>push back the door</i>.) Oh, I saw!...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT What?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>upset</i>) I don't know, it was awful!... They were all seated
      like monsters without eyes.... Who was the giant who tried to seize me?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT It was probably Silence; he has charge of this door.... It appears
      to have been alarming?... You are quite pale still and trembling all
      over....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, I would never have believed.... I had never seen.... And my
      hands are frozen....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT It will be worse presently if you go on....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>going to the next door</i>) And this one?... Is this terrible
      also?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT No; there is a little of everything here.... It is where I keep the
      unemployed Stars, my personal Perfumes, a few Glimmers that belong to me,
      such as Will-o'-the-Wisps, Glow-worms and Fireflies, also the Dew, the
      Song of the Nightingales and so on....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Just so, the Stars, the Song of the Nightingales.... This must be
      the door....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Open it, if you like; there Is nothing very bad inside....
    </p>
    <p>
      (TYLTYL <i>throws the door wide open. The</i> STARS, <i>in the shape of
      beautiful young girls veiled in many-coloured radiancy, escape from their
      prison, disperse over the hall and form graceful groups on the steps and
      around the columns, bathed in a sort of luminous penumbra. The</i>
      PERFUMES OF THE NIGHT, <i>who are almost invisible, the</i>
      WILL-O'-THE-WISPS, <i>the</i> FIREFLIES <i>and the transparent</i> DEW <i>join
      them, while the</i> SONG OF THE NIGHTINGALES <i>streams from the cavern
      and floods the Palace of</i> NIGHT.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>clapping her hands with delight</i>) Oh, what pretty ladies!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And how well they dance!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL And how sweet they smell!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And how beautifully they sing!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL What are those, whom one can hardly see?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Those are the Perfumes of my Shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And those others, over there, in spun glass?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT They are the Dew of the plains and forests.... But enough!... They
      would never have done.... It is the devil's own business to get them back,
      once they begin to dance.... (<i>Clapping her hands together</i>.) Now
      then, Stars, quick!... This is not the time for dancing.... The sky is
      overcast and heavily clouded.... Come, quick, in with you, or I will go
      and fetch a ray of sunlight!... (<i>The</i> STARS, PERFUMES, <i>etc., take
      to flight in dismay and rush back into the cavern; and the door is closed
      upon them. At the same time, the song of the</i> NIGHTINGALE <i>ceases</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>going to the door at the back</i>) Here is the great middle
      door....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT (<i>gravely</i>) Do not open that one...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why not?....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Because it's not allowed....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Then it's here that the Blue Bird is hidden; Light told me so....
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT (<i>maternally</i>) Listen to me, child ... I have been kind and
      indulgent ... I have done for you what I have never done for any one
      before ... I have given up all my secrets to you.... I like you, I feel
      pity for your youth and innocence and I am speaking to you as a mother....
      Listen to me, my child, and believe me; relinquish your quest, go no
      further, do not tempt fate, do not open that door....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>a little shaken</i>) But why?...
    </p>
    <p>
      NIGHT Because I do not wish you to be lost.... Because not one of those,
      do you hear, not one of those who have opened it, were it but by a hair's
      breadth, has ever returned alive to the light of day.... Because every
      awful thing imaginable, because all the terrors, all the horrors of which
      men speak on earth are as nothing compared with the most harmless of those
      which assail a man from the moment when his eye lights upon the first
      threats of the abyss to which no one dares give a name.... So much so that
      I myself, if you are bent, in spite of everything, upon touching that
      door, will ask you to wait until I have sought safety in my windowless
      tower... Now it is for you to know, for you to reflect....
    </p>
    <p>
      (MYTYL, <i>all in tears, utters cries of inarticulate terror and tries to
      drag</i> TYLTYL <i>away</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD (<i>with chattering teeth</i>) Don't do it, master dear!... (<i>Flinging
      himself on his knees</i>) Take pity on us!... I implore you on my
      knees.... You see that Night is right....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT You are sacrificing the lives of all of us....

      THE CAT (<i>bowing to the trees in turn</i>) To all the trees here
      present, greeting!....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE TREES (<i>murmuring in their leaves</i>) Greeting!....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT This is a great day, a day of days!.... Our enemy is coming to set
      free your energies and to deliver himself into your hands..... It is
      Tyltyl, the son of the wood-cutter, who has done you so much harm.... He
      is seeking the Blue Bird, whom you have kept hidden from Man since the
      beginning of the world and who alone knows our secret.... (<i>A murmuring
      in the leaves</i>.) What do you say?... Ah, it's the Poplar!... Yes, he
      possesses a diamond which has the virtue of setting free our spirits for a
      moment; he can compel us to hand over the Blue Bird and thenceforth we
      shall be definitely at Man's mercy.... (<i>A murmuring in the leaves</i>.)
      Who is speaking?... Ah, the Oak!... How are you?... (<i>A murmuring in the
      leaves of the</i> OAK.) Still got your cold?... Does the Liquorice no
      longer look after you?... Can't you throw off your rheumatism?... Believe
      me, that's because of the moss; you put too much of it on your feet.... Is
      the Blue Bird still with you?... (<i>A murmuring in the leaves of the</i>
      OAK.) I beg your pardon?... Yes, there is no room for hesitation; we must
      take the opportunity; he must he done away with.... (<i>A murmuring in the
      leaves</i>.) I didn't quite catch.... Oh, yes, he is with his little
      sister; she must die, too.... (<i>A murmuring in the leaves</i>.) Yes,
      they have the Dog with them; there is no keeping him away.... (<i>A
      murmuring in the leaves</i>.) What did you say?... Bribe him?...
      Impossible.... I have tried everything.... (<i>A murmuring in the leaves</i>.)
      Ah, is that you, Fir-Tree?... Yes, get four planks ready.... Yes, there
      are Fire, Sugar, Water and Bread besides.... They are all with us, except
      Bread, who is rather doubtful.... Light alone is on Man's side; but she
      won't come.... I made the children believe that they ought to steal away
      while she was asleep.... There never was such an opportunity.... (<i>A
      murmuring in the leaves</i>.) Ah, that's the Beech's voice!... Yes, you
      are right; we must inform the animals.... Has the Rabbit got his drum?...
      Is he with you?... Good, let him beat the troop at once.... Here they
      are!...

      THE CAT (<i>obsequiously, eagerly, mealy-mouthed, rushing to meet the</i>
      CHILDREN) Ah, there you are, my little master!... How well you look and
      how pretty, this evening!.... I went before you to announce your
      arrival.... All Is going well. We shall have the Blue Bird to-night, I am
      sure.... I have just sent the Rabbit to beat the troop in order to convoke
      the principal animals of the country.... You can hear them already among
      the foliage.... Listen!... They are a little shy and dare not come
      near.... (<i>The sounds are heard of different animals, such as cows,
      pigs, horses, donkeys, etc. The</i> CAT, <i>aside, to</i> TYLTYL, <i>taking
      him apart</i>) But why have you brought the Dog?... I have told you he is
      on the worst terms with everybody, even the trees.... I fear that his
      odious presence will spoil everything....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I could not get rid of him.... (<i>To the</i> DOG, <i>threatening
      him</i>) Go away, you ugly thing!...

    <p>
      THE DOG I sha'n't say a word.... I shall follow you at a distance.... They
      sha'n't see me.... Shall I beg?...

    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>aside, to</i> TYLTYL) Do you allow this disobedience?... Hit
      him on the nose with your stick; he is really unbearable!...

    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>beating the</i> DOG) There, that will teach you to be more

    </p>
    <p>

      THE DOG (<i>leaping up and almost upsetting</i> MYTYL, <i>whom he
      overwhelms with hurried and enthusiastic kisses</i>) Oh, the dear little
      girl!... How beautiful she is!... How good she is!... How beautiful she
      is, how sweet she is!...I must kiss her!... Once more, once more, once
      more!...

      gently!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (TYLTYL <i>turns the Diamond. A long-drawn-out rustling shakes the leaves
      and branches. The oldest and most stately trunks open to make way for the
      soul which each of them contains. The appearance of these souls differs
      according to the appearance and the character of the trees which they
      represent. The soul of the</i> ELM, <i>for instance, is a sort of pursy,
      pot-bellied, crabbed gnome; the</i> LIME-TREE <i>is placid, familiar and
      jovial; the</i> BEECH, <i>elegant and agile; the</i> BIRCH, <i>white,
      reserved and restless; the</i> WILLOW, <i>stunted, dishevelled and
      plaintive; the</i> FIR-TREE, <i>tall, lean and taciturn; the</i> CYPRESS,
      <i>tragic; the</i> CHESTNUT-TREE, <i>pretentious and rather dandified; the</i>
      POPLAR, <i>sprightly, cumbersome, talkative. Some emerge slowly from their
      trunks, torpidly stretching themselves, as though they had been imprisoned
      or asleep for ages; others leap out actively, eagerly; and all come and
      stand in a circle round the two</i> CHILDREN, <i>while keeping as near as
      they can to the tree in which they were born</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE POPLAR (<i>running up first and screaming at the top of his voice</i>)
      Men?... Little men!... We shall be able to talk to them!... We've done
      with silence!... Done with it!... Where do they come from?... Who are
      they?... What are they?... (<i>To the</i> LIME-TREE, <i>who comes forward
      quietly smoking his pipe</i>) Do you know them, Daddy Lime-Tree?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LIME-TREE I do not remember ever having seen them....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE POPLAR Oh, yes, you must have!... You know all the men; you're always
      hanging about their houses....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LIME-TREE (<i>examining the</i> CHILDREN) No, I assure you.... I don't
      know them.... They are too young still.... I only know the lovers who come
      to see me by moonlight and the topers who drink their beer under my
      branches....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHESTNUT-TREE (<i>affectedly adjusting his eyeglass</i>) Who are
      these?... Are they poor people from the country?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE POPLAR Oh, as for you, Mr. Chestnut-Tree, ever since you have refused
      to show yourself except in the streets of the big towns...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE WILLOW (<i>hobbling along in a pair of wooden shoes</i>) Oh dear, oh
      dear!... They have come to cut off my head and arms again for fagots!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE POPLAR Silence!... Here is the Oak leaving his palace!... He looks far
      from well this evening.... Don't you think he is growing very old?... What
      can his age be?... The Fir-tree says he is four thousand; but I am sure
      that he exaggerates.... Listen; he will tell us all about it....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The</i> OAK <i>comes slowly forward. He is fabulously old, crowned
      with mistletoe and clad in a long green gown edged with moss and lichen.
      He is blind; his white beard streams in the wind. He leans with one hand
      on a knotty stick and with the other on a young</i> OAKLING, <i>who serves
      as his guide. The Blue Bird is perched on his shoulder. At his approach,
      the other trees draw themselves up in a row and bow respectfully</i>.)
    </p>

      TYLTYL He has the Blue Bird!... Quick! Quick!... Here!... Give it to

      THE TREES Silence!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>to</i> TYLTYL) Take of your hat. It's the Oak!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK (<i>to</i> TYLTYL) Who are you?....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I am Tyltyl, sir.... When can I have the Blue Bird?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK Tyltyl, the wood-cutter's son?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, sir....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK Your father has done us much harm.... In my family alone, he has
      put to death six hundred of my sons, four hundred and seventy-five uncles
      and aunts, twelve hundred cousins of both sexes, three hundred and eighty
      daughters-in-law, and twelve thousand great-grandsons!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I know nothing about it, sir.... He did not do it on purpose....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK What have you come here for; and why have you made our souls leave
      their abodes?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I beg your pardon, sir, for disturbing you.... The Cat said that
      you would tell us where the Blue Bird was....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK Yes, I know that you are looking for the Blue Bird, that is to
      say, the great secret of things and of happiness, so that Man may make our
      servitude still harder....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, no, sir; it is for the Fairy Bérylune's little girl, who is
      very ill....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK (<i>laying silence upon him with a gesture</i>) Enough!... I do
      not hear the Animals.... Where are they?... All this concerns them as much
      as us.... We, the Trees, must not assume the responsibility alone for the
      grave measures that have become necessary.... On the day when MAN hears
      that we have done what we are about to do, there will be terrible
      reprisals..... It is right, therefore, that our agreement should be
      unanimous, so that our silence may be the same....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIR-TREE (<i>looking over the top of the other trees</i>) The Animals
      are coming.... They are following the Rabbit.... Here are the souls of the
      Horse, the Bull, the Ox, the Cow, the Wolf, the Sheep, the Pig, the Cock,
      the Goat, the Ass, and the Bear....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Enter the souls of the</i> ANIMALS, <i>who, as the</i> FIR-TREE <i>utters
      their names, come forward and sit down among the trees, with the exception
      of the soul of the</i> GOAT, <i>who roams to and fro, and of the</i> PIG,
      <i>who snuffles among the roots</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK Are all here present?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE RABBIT The Hen could not leave her eggs, the Hare is out on a run, the
      Stag has a pain in his horns, the Fox is ill&mdash;here is the doctor's
      certificate&mdash;the Goose did not understand and the Turkey flew into a
      passion....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK These abstentions are most regrettable.... However, we have a
      quorum.... You know, my brothers, the nature of our business. The child
      you see before you, thanks to a talisman stolen from the powers of Earth,
      is able to take possession of the Blue Bird and thus to snatch from us the
      secret which we have kept since the origin of life.... Now we know enough
      of Man to entertain no doubt as to the fate which he reserves for us once
      he is in possession of this secret. That is why it seems to me that any
      hesitation would be both foolish and criminal.... It is a serious moment;
      the child must be done away with before it is too late....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What is he saying?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG (<i>prowling round the</i> OAK <i>and showing his fangs</i>) Do
      you see my teeth, you old cripple?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BEECH (<i>indignantly</i>) He is insulting the Oak!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK Is that the Dog?... Drive him out! We must suffer no traitors
      among us!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>aside, to</i> TYLTYL) Send the Dog away.... It's a
      misunderstanding.... Leave it to me; I will arrange things.... But send
      him away as quick as you can....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>to the</i> DOG) Will you be off!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG Do let me worry the gouty old beggar's moss slippers!.... It will
      be such a joke!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Hold your tongue!... And be off with you!... Be off, you ugly
      brute!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG All right, all right, I'm going.... I'll come back when you want
      me....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>aside, to</i> TYLTYL) It would be a good thing to chain him
      up, or he will commit some folly; the Trees will be angry and all will end
      badly....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What can I do?... I have lost his leash....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT Here's the Ivy just coming along with strong bonds....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG (<i>growling</i>) I'll come back, I'll come back!... Ugh!
      Goutytoes! Timbertoes!... Pack of old stunted growths, pack of old
      roots!... It's the Cat who's at the bottom of all this!... I'll be even
      with him!... What have you been whispering about, you sneak, you tiger,
      you Judas!... Wow, wow, wow!....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT You see, he insults everybody....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, he is unbearable and one can't hear one's self speak.... Mr.
      Ivy, will you chain him up, please?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE IVY (<i>timorously going up to the</i> DOG) Won't he bite?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG (<i>growling</i>) On the contrary, on the contrary!... He's going

      THE DOG (<i>growling between his teeth, while the</i> IVY <i>binds him</i>)
      Ball of twine I... Hunk of yarn!... Hangman's rope I... Calves' leash!...
      Look, my little god I ... He's cutting my paws!... He's choking me!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I don't care!... It's your own fault.... Hold your tongue; be
      quiet; you're unbearable!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG You're wrong, for all that.... They mean mischief.... Take care,
      my little god!... He's closing my mouth!... I can't speak!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE IVY (<i>who has tied up the</i> DOG <i>like a parcel</i>) Where shall
      we put him?... I've muzzled him finely.... He can't utter a word....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK Fasten him tight down there behind my trunk; to my big root.... We
      will decide later what had best be done with him....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The</i> IVY <i>and the</i> POPLAR <i>carry the</i> DOG <i>behind the</i>
      OAK'S <i>trunk</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK Is that done?... Well, now that we are rid of this inconvenient
      witness, of this renegade, let us deliberate in accordance with justice
      and truth.... I will not conceal from you the deep and painful nature of
      my emotion.... This is the first time that it is given to us to judge Man
      and make him feel our power.... I do not think that, after the harm which
      he has done us, after the monstrous injustice which we have suffered,
      there can remain the least doubt as to the sentence that awaits him....
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL THE TREES and ALL THE ANIMALS No! No! No!... No doubt at all!...
      Hanging!... Death!... The injustice has been too great!... The abuse too
      wicked!... It has lasted too long!... Crush him!... Eat him!... At
      once!... Here and now!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>to the</i> CAT) What is the matter with them?... Are they
      displeased?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT Don't be alarmed.... They are a little annoyed because Spring is
      late.... Leave it to me; I will settle it all....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK This unanimity was inevitable.... We must now decide, in order to
      avoid reprisals, which form of execution will be the most practical, the
      easiest, the quickest and the safest, which will leave the fewest accusing
      traces when Man finds the little bodies in the forest....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What is all this about?... What is he driving at?... I am getting
      tired of this.... He has got the Blue Bird; let him hand it over....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BULL (<i>coming forward</i>) The most practical and the surest way is
      a good butt with the horns in the pit of the stomach.... Shall I go at
      him?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK Who speaks?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT It's the Bull.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE COW It would be better to keep quiet.... I won't meddle with it.... I
      have all the grass to browse in the field which you can see down there in
      the blue light of the moon.... I have quite enough to do....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OX I also.... However, I agree to everything beforehand....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BEECH I can offer my highest branch to hang them on....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE IVY And I the slip-knot....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIR-TREE And I the four planks for their little coffin....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CYPRESS And I a perpetual grant of a tomb....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE WILLOW The simplest way would be to drown them in one of my rivers....
      I will take charge of that....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LIME-TREE (<i>in a conciliatory tone</i>) Come, come.... Is it really
      necessary to go to such extremities?... They are very young.... We could
      quite simply prevent them from doing any harm by keeping them prisoners in
      an enclosure which I will undertake to form by planting myself all
      around....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK Who speaks?... I seem to recognise the honeyed accents of the
      Lime-tree....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIR-TREE Yes, it's he....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK So there is a renegade among us, as among the Animals?... Hitherto
      we have only had to deplore the disloyalty of the Fruit-trees; but they
      are not real trees....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE PIG (<i>rolling his small eyes gluttonously</i>) I think we should
      first eat the little girl.... She ought to be very tender....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What's he saying?... Just wait a bit, you...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT I don't know what is the matter with them; but things are
      beginning to look badly....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK Silence!... What we have to decide is which of us shall have the
      honour of striking the first blow, who shall ward off from, our tops the
      greatest danger that has threatened us since the birth of Man....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIR-TREE That honour falls to you, our king and our patriarch....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK Is that the Fir-tree speaking?... Alas, I am too old!... I am
      blind and infirm and my numbed arms no longer obey me.... No, to you,
      brother, ever green, ever upright, to you, who have witnessed the birth of
      most of these trees, to you be the glory, in default of myself, of the
      noble act of our deliverance....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIR-TREE I thank you, venerable father.... But as I shall, in any
      case, have the honour of burying the two victims, I should be afraid of
      arousing the just jealousy of my colleagues; and I think that, next to
      ourselves, the oldest and the worthiest and the one that owns the best
      club is the Beech....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BEECH You know I am worm-eaten and my club is no longer to be relied
      upon.... But the Elm and the Cypress have powerful weapons....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ELM I should be only too pleased; but I can hardly stand upright.... A
      mole twisted my great toe last night....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CYPRESS As for me, I am ready.... But, like my brother, the Fir-tree,
      I shall have, if not the privilege of burying them, at least the advantage
      of weeping over their tomb.... It would be an unlawful plurality of
      offices.... Ask the Poplar....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE POPLAR Me?... Are you serious?... Why, my wood is more tender than the
      flesh of a child!... And, besides, I don't know what's the matter with
      me.... I am shivering with fever.... Just look at my leaves.... I must
      have caught cold at sunrise this morning....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK (<i>bursting out with indignation</i>) You are afraid of Man!...
      Even those unprotected and unarmed little children inspire you with the
      mysterious terror which has always made us the slaves that we are!...
      Enough of this! Things being as they are and the opportunity unequalled, I
      shall go forth alone, old, crippled, trembling, blind as I am, against the
      hereditary enemy!... Where is he?...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Groping with his stick, he moves towards</i> TYLTYL.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>taking his knife from his pocket</i>) Is it me he's after, that
      old one, with his big stick?...
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL THE TREES (<i>uttering a cry of alarm at the sight of the knife, they
      step in between and hold back the</i> OAK) The knife!... Take care!... The
      knife!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OAK (<i>struggling</i>) Let me be!... What does it matter?... The
      knife or the axe!... Who's holding me back?... What! Are you all here?...
      What! You all want to.... (<i>Flinging down his</i> <i>stick</i>) Well, so
      be it!... Shame upon us!... Let the Animals deliver us!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BULL That's right!... I'll see to It!... And with one blow of the
      horns!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OX <i>and</i> THE COW (<i>holding him back by the tail</i>) What are
      you doing?... Don't be a fool!... It's a bad business!... It will end
      badly.... It is we who will pay for it.... Do let be.... It's the wild
      animals' business....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BULL No, no!... It's my business!... Wait and see!... Look here, hold
      me back or there will be an accident!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>to</i> MYTYL, <i>who is uttering piercing screams</i>) Don't be
      afraid!... Stand behind me.... I have my knife....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE COCK He has plenty of pluck, the little chap!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL So you've made up your minds, it's me you're going for?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ASS Why, of course, my little man; you've taken long enough to see
      it!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE PIG You can say your prayers; your last hour has come.... But don't
      hide the little girl.... I want to feast my eyes on her.... I'm going to
      eat her first....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What have I done to you?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SHEEP Nothing at all, my little man.... Eaten my little brother, my
      two sisters, my three uncles, my aunt, my grandpapa and my grandmamma....
      Wait, wait, when you're down, you shall see that I have teeth also....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ASS And I hoofs!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HORSE (<i>haughtily pawing the ground</i>) You shall see what you
      shall see!... Would you rather that I tore you with my teeth or knocked
      you down with a kick?... (<i>He moves ostentatiously towards</i> TYLTYL,
      <i>who faces him and raises his knife. Suddenly the</i> HORSE, <i>seized
      with panic, turns and rushes away</i>.) Ah, no!... That's not fair!...
      That's against the rules!.... He's defending himself!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE COCK (<i>unable to hide his admiration</i>) I don't care, the little
      chap's full of grit!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE PIG (<i>to the</i> BEAR <i>and the</i> WOLF) Let us all rush on them
      together.... I will support you from the rear.... We will throw them down
      and share the little girl when she is on the ground....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE WOLF Divert their attention in front.... I am going to make a turning
      movement....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>He goes round</i> TYLTYL, <i>whom he attacks from behind and half
      overthrows</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL You brute!... (<i>He raises himself on one knee brandishing his
      knife and doing his best to cover his little sister, who utters yells of
      distress. Seeing him half overturned, all the</i> ANIMALS <i>and</i> TREES
      <i>come up and try to hit him</i>. TYLTYL <i>calls distractedly for
      assistance</i>.) Help! Help!... Tylô! Tylô!... Where is the Cat?...
      Tylô!... Tylette! Tylette!... Come! Come!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>hypocritically, holding aloof</i>) I can't come.... I have
      sprained my paw....

      TYLTYL (<i>warding of the blows and defending himself as best he can</i>)
      Help!... Tylô! Tylô!... I can't hold out!... There are too many of
      them!... The Bear! The Pig! The Donkey! The Ass! The Fir-tree! The
      Beech!... Tylô! Tylô! Tylô!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Dragging his broken bonds after him, the</i> DOG <i>leaps from behind
      the trunk of the</i> OAK <i>and, elbowing his way through</i> TREES <i>and</i>

      THE DOG (<i>distributing great bites</i>) Here! Here, my little god!...
      Don't be afraid! Have at them!... I know how to use my teeth!... Here,
      there's one for you, Bear, in your fat hams!... Now then, who wants some
      more?... Here, that's for the Pig and that's for the Horse and that's for
      the Bull's tail!... There, I've torn the Beech's trousers and the Oak's
      petticoat!... The Fir-tree's making tracks!... Whew, it's warm work!...

      together!... This time, it's the Wolf!...

      against all of you!... Never! Never!... True to the gods, to the best, to
      the greatest!... (<i>To</i> TYLTYL) Take care, here's the Bear!... Beware
      of the Bull!... I'll jump at his throat.... Ow!... That's a kick.... The
      Ass has broken two of my teeth....

    <p>
      TYLTYL I'm done for, Tylô!... Ah!... That was a blow from the Elm....
      Look, my hand's bleeding.... That's the Wolf or the Pig....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG Wait, my little god.... Let me kiss you.... There, a good lick....
      That will do you good.... Keep behind me.... They dare not come again....
      Yes, though.... Here they are coming back!... This time, it's serious!....
      We must stand firm!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>dropping to the ground</i>) No, I can hold out no longer!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG (<i>listening</i>) They are coming!... I hear them, I scent
      them!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Where?... Who?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG There! There!... It's Light!... She has found us!... Saved, my

      They're retreating!... They're afraid!...

      LIGHT What is it?... What has happened?... But, my poor boy, didn't you
      know?... Turn the diamond!... They will return into silence and obscurity;

    <p>
      (TYLTYL <i>turns the diamond. Immediately, the souls of all the</i> TREES

    <p>
      TYLTYL Where are they?... What was the matter with them?... Were they
      mad?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT No, they are always like that; but we do not know it because we do
      not see it.... I told you so before; it is dangerous to wake them when I
      am not there....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>wiping his knife</i>) Well, but for the Dog and if I had not
      had my knife!... I would never have believed that they were so wicked!...

      broken!...

      was a tough fight!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>appearing from behind a thicket, limping</i>) I should think
      so!... The Ox caught me a blow with his horns in the stomach.... You can't
      see the marks, but it's very painful.... And the Oak broke my paw....

    <p>
      THE DOG I should like to know which one....

      THE CAT (<i>hypocritically</i>) Mummy dear, I was wounded at the first,
      while attacking that horrid Pig, who wanted to eat you.... And then the

    <p>
      (<i>Enter</i> TYLTYL, MYTYL, LIGHT, <i>the</i> DOG, <i>the</i> CAT, BREAD,
      FIRE, SUGAR, WATER <i>and</i> MILK.)
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT I believe we have the Blue Bird this time. I ought to have thought
      of it before. But the idea came to me, like a ray from the sky, this
      morning only, when I recovered my strengthen the dawn.... We are at the
      entrance to the enchanted palaces where all men's Joys, all men's
      Happinesses are gathered together in the charge of Fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Are there many of them? Shall we have any? Are they little?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Some are little and some are great; some are coarse and some are
      delicate; some are very beautiful and others not so pleasant to look
      upon.... But the ugliest were expelled from the garden some time ago and
      took refuge with the Miseries. For we must not forget that the Miseries
      inhabit an adjoining cave, which communicates with the Garden of Happiness
      and is separated from it only by a sort of vapour or fine veil, lifted at
      every moment by the winds that blow from the heights of Justice or from
      the depths of Eternity.... What we have now to do is to organise ourselves
      and take certain precautions. Generally, the Joys are very good; but,
      still, there are some of them that are more dangerous and treacherous than
      the greatest Miseries.
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD I have an idea! If they are dangerous and treacherous, would it not
      be better for us all to wait at the door, so that we may lend a hand to
      the children should they be obliged to fly?....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG Not at all! Not at all! I mean to go everywhere with my little
      gods! Let those who are afraid remain at the door! We have no need (<i>looking
      at</i> BREAD) of cowards (<i>looking at the</i> CAT) or traitors!...
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRE I'm going!... I hear it's great fun!... They dance all the time....
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD Do they have any eating as well?
    </p>
    <p>
      WATER (<i>moaning</i>) I have never known the smallest Happiness!... I
      should like to see some at last!....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Hold your tongues! Who asked your opinions?... This is what I have
      decided: the Dog, Bread and Sugar shall go with the children. Water shall
      stay outside, because she is too cold, and Fire, because he is too
      turbulent. I strongly urge Milk to remain at the door, because he is so
      impressionable. As for the Cat, he can do as he likes.....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT I shall take the opportunity of calling on the chief Miseries of
      my acquaintance, who live next door to the Joys....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And you, Light? Aren't you coming?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT I cannot go into the Joys like this: most of them cannot endure me.
      But I have here the thick veil with which I cover myself when I visit
      happy people.... (<i>She unfolds a long veil and wraps herself in it
      carefully</i>.) Not a ray of my you! must startle them, for there are many
      Happinesses that are afraid and are not happy.... There... like this, even
      the ugliest and coarsest of them will have nothing to fear....

      SCENE 2.&mdash;<i>The Palace of Happiness</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>When the curtain of clouds opens, the stage represents, in the
      forefront of the palace, a sort of hall formed of tall marble columns,
      between which hang heavy purple draperies, supported by golden ropes and
      concealing all the background. The architecture suggests the most sensual
      and sumptuous moments of the Venetian or Flemish Renascence, as seen in
      the pictures of Veronese or Rubens, with garlands, horns of plenty,
      fringes, vases, statues, gildings, lavishly distributed on every side. In
      the middle stands a massive and marvellous table of jasper and
      silver-gilt, laden with candlesticks, glass, gold and silver plate and
      fabulous viands. Around the table, the biggest luxuries of the Earth sit
      eating, drinking, shouting, singing, tossing and lolling about or sleeping
      among the haunches of venison, the miraculous fruits, the overturned jars
      and ewers. They are enormously, incredibly fat and red in the face,
      covered with velvet and brocade, crowned with gold and pearls and precious
      stones. Beautiful female slaves incessantly bring decorated dishes and
      foaming beverages. Vulgar, blatantly hilarious music, in which the brasses
      predominate. The stage is bathed in a red and heavy light</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (TYLTYL, MYTYL, <i>the</i> DOG, BREAD <i>and</i> SUGAR <i>are a little
      awestruck at first end crowd round</i> LIGHT <i>in the foreground, to the
      right. The</i> CAT, <i>without a word, walks to the background, also to
      the right, lifts a dark curtain and disappears</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Who are those fat gentlemen enjoying themselves and eating such a
      lot of good things?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT They are the biggest Luxuries of the Earth, the ones that can be
      seen with the naked eye. It is possible, though not very likely, that the
      Blue Bird may have strayed among them for a moment. That is why you must
      not turn the diamond yet. For form's sake, we will begin by searching this
      part of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Can we go up to them?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Certainly. They are not ill-natured, although they are vulgar and
      usually rather ill-bred.
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL What beautiful cakes they have!....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG And such game! And sausages! And legs of lamb and calves'
      liver!... There is nothing nicer or lovelier in the world than liver!...
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD Except quartern-loaves made of fine white flour! They have splendid
      ones!... How lovely they are! How lovely they are!...
    </p>
    <p>
      SUGAR I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon, I beg a thousand pardons....
      Allow me, allow me.... I would not like to hurt anybody's feelings; but
      are you not forgetting the sweetmeats, which form the glory of that table
      and which, if I may say so, surpass in grandeur and magnificence all that
      exists in this hall, or perhaps anywhere else?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL How pleased and happy they look!... And they are shouting! And
      laughing! And singing!... I believe they have seen us....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>A dozen of the biggest</i> LUXURIES <i>have risen from table and now,
      holding their stomachs in their hands, advance laboriously towards the</i>
      CHILDREN.)
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Have no fear, they are very affable.... They will probably invite
      you to dinner.... Do not accept, do not accept anything, lest you should
      forget your mission....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What? Not even a tiny cake? They look so good, so fresh, so well
      iced with sugar, covered with candied fruits and brimming over with
      cream!...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT They are dangerous and would break your will. A man should know how
      to sacrifice something to the duty he is performing. Refuse politely, but
      firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BIGGEST OF THE LUXURIES (<i>holding out his hand to</i> TYLTYL) How do
      you do, Tyltyl?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>surprised</i>) Why, do you know me?... Who are you?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LUXURY I am the biggest of the Luxuries, the Luxury of Being Rich; and
      I come, in the name of my brothers, to beg you and your family to honour
      our endless repast with your presence. You will find yourself surrounded
      by all that is best among the real, big Luxuries of this Earth. Allow me
      to introduce to you the chief of them. Here is my son-in-law, the Luxury
      of Being a Landowner, who has a stomach shaped like a pear. This is the
      Luxury of Satisfied Vanity, who has such a nice, puffy face, (<i>The</i>
      LUXURY OF SATISFIED VANITY <i>gives a patronising nod</i>.) These are the
      Luxury of Drinking when you are not Thirsty and the Luxury of Eating when
      you are not Hungry: they are twins and their legs are made of macaroni. (<i>They
      bow, staggering</i>.) Here are the Luxury of Knowing Nothing, who is as
      deaf as a post, and the Luxury of Understanding Nothing, who is as blind
      as a bat. Here are the Luxury of Doing Nothing and the Luxury of Sleeping
      more than Necessary: their hands are made of bread-crumb and their eyes of
      peach-jelly. Lastly, here is Fat Laughter: his mouth is split from ear to
      ear and he is irresistible....
    </p>
    <p>
      (FAT LAUGHTER <i>bows, writhing and holding his sides</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>pointing to a</i> LUXURY <i>who is standing a little on one
      side</i>) And who is that one, who dares not come up to us and who is
      turning his back?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LUXURY OF BEING RICH Do not ask about him: he is a little awkward and
      is not fit to be introduced to children.... (<i>Seizing</i> TYLTYL'S <i>hands</i>)
      But come along! They are beginning the banquet all over again.... It is
      the twelfth time since this morning. We are only waiting for you.... Do
      you hear all the revellers calling and shouting for you?... I cannot
      introduce you to all of them, there are so many of them.... (<i>Offering
      his arm to the two children</i>) Allow me to lead you to the two seats of
      honour....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL No, thank you very much, Mr. Luxury.... I am so sorry.... I can't
      come for the moment.... We are in a great hurry, we are looking for the
      Blue Bird. You don't happen to know, I suppose, where he is hiding?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LUXURY The Blue Bird?... Wait a bit.... Yes, I remember.... Some one
      was telling me about him the other day.... He is a bird, that is not good
      to eat, I believe.... At any rate, he has never figured on our table....
      That means that we have a poor opinion of him. But don't trouble; we have
      much better things.... You shall share our life, you shall see all that we
      do....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What do you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LUXURY Why, we occupy ourselves incessantly in doing nothing.... We
      never have a moment's rest.... We have to drink, we have to eat, we have
      to sleep. It's most engrossing....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Is it amusing?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LUXURY Why, yes.... It needs must be; it's all there is on this
      Earth....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Do you think so?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LUXURY (<i>pointing to</i> LIGHT, <i>aside, to</i> TYLTYL) Who is that
      ill-bred young person?...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>During the whole of the preceding conversation a crowd of</i> LUXURIES
      <i>of the second order have been busying themselves with the</i> DOG,
      SUGAR <i>and</i> BREAD <i>and have dragged them to the orgie</i>. TYLTYL
      <i>suddenly sees them seated fraternally at the table with their hosts,
      eating, drinking and flinging themselves about wildly</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why, look, Light!... They are sitting at the table!...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Call them back, or this will have a bad end!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Tylô!... Here, Tylô!... Come here at once, will you? Do you
      hear?... And you too, Sugar and Bread, who told you to leave me?... What
      are you doing there, without permission?
    </p>
    <p>
      BREAD (<i>speaking with his mouth full</i>) Can't you keep a civil tongue
      in your mouth?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What? Is Bread daring to be impertinent?... Why, what's come over
      you?... And you, Tylô?... Is that the way you obey? Now then, come here,
      on your knees, on your knees!... And look sharp!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG (<i>muttering, from the end of the table</i>) When I'm eating, I'm
      at home to nobody and I hear nothing....
    </p>
    <p>
      SUGAR (<i>honey-mouthed</i>) Pardon us, we could not possibly leave such
      charming hosts so abruptly: they would be offended....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LUXURY You see!... They are setting you an example.... Come, we are
      waiting for you.... We won't hear of a refusal.... We shall have to resort
      to a gentle violence.... Come, you Luxuries, help me!... Let us push them
      to the table by force, so that they may be happy in spite of
      themselves!... (<i>All the</i> LUXURIES, <i>uttering cries of joy and
      skipping about as nimbly as they are able, drag the</i> CHILDREN, <i>who
      struggle, while</i> FAT LAUGHTER <i>seizes</i> LIGHT <i>vigorously round
      the waist</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Turn the diamond, it is time!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (TYLTYL <i>obeys</i> LIGHT'S <i>order. Forthwith, the stage is lit up with
      an ineffably pure, divinely roseate, harmonious and ethereal brightness.
      The heavy ornaments in the foreground, the thick red hangings become
      unfastened and disappear, revealing an immense and magnificent hall, a
      sort of cathedral of gladness and serenity, tall, innocent and almost
      transparent, whose endless fabric rests upon innumerous long and slender,
      limpid and blissful columns, suggesting the architecture of the Palladian
      churches or certain drawings by Carpaccio, notably the "Presentation of
      the Virgin" in the Uffizi Gallery. The table of the orgie melts away
      without leaving a trace; the velvets, the brocades, the garlands of the</i>
      LUXURIES <i>rise before the luminous gust that invades the temple tear
      asunder and fall, together with the grinning masks, at the feet of the
      astounded revellers. These become visibly deflated, like burst bladders,
      exchange glances, blink their eyes in the unknown rays that hurt them;
      and, seeing themselves at last as they really are, that is to say, naked,
      hideous, flabby and lamentable, they begin to utter yells of shame and
      dismay, amid which those of</i> FAT LAUGHTER <i>are clearly
      distinguishable above all the rest. The</i> LUXURY OF UNDERSTANDING
      NOTHING <i>alone remains perfectly calm, while his friends rush about
      madly, trying to flee, to hide themselves in corners which they hope to
      find dark. But there is not a shadow left in the dazzling room. And so the
      majority, in their despair, decide to pass through the threatening curtain
      which, in an angle on the right, closes the vault of the Cave of Miseries.
      Each time that one of them, in his panic, raises a skirt of the curtain, a
      storm of oaths, imprecations and maledictions is heard to issue from the
      hollow depths of the cave. As for the</i> DOG, BREAD <i>and</i> SUGAR, <i>they
      hang their heads, join the group of the</i> CHILDREN <i>and hide behind
      them very sheepishly</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>watching the</i> LUXURIES <i>flying</i>) Goodness, how ugly
      they are!... Where are they going?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT I really believe that they have lost their heads.... They are going
      to take refuge with the Miseries, where I very much fear that they will be
      kept for good....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>looking around him, wonder-struck</i>) Oh, what a beautiful
      hall, what a beautiful hall!... Where are we?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT We have not moved: it is your eyes that see differently.... We now
      behold the truth of things; and we shall perceive the soul of the Joys
      that endure the brightness of the diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL How beautiful it is!... And what lovely weather!... It is just like
      midsummer.... Hullo! It looks as though people were coming to talk to
      us....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The halls begin to fill with angel forms that seem to be emerging from
      a long slumber and glide harmoniously between the columns. They are clad
      in shimmering dresses, of soft and subtle shades; rose-awakening,
      water's-smile, amber-dew, blue-of-dawn, etc</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Here come some amiable and curious Joys who will direct us....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Do you know them?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Yes, I know them all; I often come to them, without their knowing
      who I am....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, what a lot of them there are!... They are crowding from every
      side!
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT There were many more of them once. The Luxuries have done them great
      harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL No matter, there are a good few of them left....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT You will see plenty of others, as the influence of the diamond
      spreads through the halls.... There are many more Happinesses on Earth
      than people think; but the generality of men do not discover them....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Here are some little ones: let us run and meet them....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT It is unnecessary: those which interest us will pass this way. We
      have no time to make the acquaintance of all the rest....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>A troop of little</i> HAPPINESSES, <i>frisking and bursting with
      laughter, run up from the back of the halls and dance round the</i>
      CHILDREN <i>in a ring</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL How pretty, how very pretty they are!... Where do they come from,
      who are they?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT They are the Children's Happinesses....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Can one speak to them?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT It would be no use. They sing, they dance, they laugh, but they do
      not talk yet....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>skipping about</i>) How do you do? How do you do?... Oh, look
      at that fat one laughing!... What pretty cheeks they have, what pretty
      frocks they have!... Are they all rich here?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Why, no, here, as everywhere, there are many more poor than rich....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Where are the poor ones?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT You can't distinguish them.... A Child's Happiness is always arrayed
      in all that is most beautiful in Heaven and upon Earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>unable to restrain himself</i>) I should like to dance with
      them....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT It is absolutely impossible, we have no time.... I see that they
      have not the Blue Bird.... Besides, they are in a hurry: you see, they
      have already passed.... They too have no time to waste, for childhood is
      very short....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Another troop of</i> HAPPINESSES, <i>a little taller than the last,
      rush into the hall, singing at the top of their voice, "There they are!
      There they are! They see us! They see us!" and, dance a merry fling around
      the</i> CHILDREN, <i>at the end of which the one who appears to be the
      chief of the little band goes up to</i> TYLTYL <i>with hand outstretched</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS How do you do, Tyltyl?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Another one who knows me!... (<i>To</i> LIGHT) I am getting known
      wherever I go!... (<i>To the</i> HAPPINESS) Who are you?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS Don't you recognise me?... I'll wager that you don't
      recognise any one here!
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>a little embarrassed</i>) Why, no.... I don't know.... I don't
      remember seeing any of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS There, do you hear?... I was sure of it!... He has never
      seen us!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>All the other</i> HAPPINESSES <i>burst out laughing</i>) Why, my dear
      Tyltyl, we are the only things you do know!... We are always around
      you!... We eat, drink, wake up, breathe and live with you!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, yes, just so, I know, I remember.... But I should like to know
      what your names are....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS I can see that you know nothing.... I am the chief of the
      Happinesses of your home; and all these are the other Happinesses that
      live there....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Then there are Happinesses in my home?
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>All the</i> HAPPINESSES <i>burst out laughing</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS You heard him!... Are there Happinesses in his home!... Why,
      you little wretch, it is crammed with Happinesses in every nook and
      cranny!... We laugh, we sing, we create enough joy to knock down the walls
      and lift the roof; but, do what we may, you see nothing and you hear
      nothing.... I hope that, in future, you will be a little more sensible....
      Meantime, you shall shake hands with the more noteworthy of us.... Then,
      when you reach home again, you will recognise them more easily and, at the
      end of a fine day, you will know how to encourage them with a smile, to
      thank them with a pleasant word, for they really do all they can to make
      your life easy and delightful.... Let me introduce myself first: the
      Happiness of Being Well, at your service.... I am not the prettiest, but I
      am the most important. Will you know me again?... This is the Happiness of
      Pure Air, who is almost transparent.... Here is the Happiness of Loving
      one's Parents, who is clad in grey and always a little sad, because no one
      ever looks at him.... Here are the Happiness of the Blue Sky, who, of
      course, is dressed in blue, and the Happiness of the Forest, who, also of
      course, is clad in green: you will see him every time you go to the
      window.... Here, again, is the good Happiness of Sunny Hours, who is
      diamond-coloured, and this is the Happiness of Spring, who is bright
      emerald....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And are you as fine as that every day?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS OF BEING WELL Why, yes, it is Sunday every day, in every
      house, when people open their eyes.... And then, when evening comes, here
      is the Happiness of the Sunsets, who is grander than all the kings in the
      world and who is followed by the Happiness of Seeing the Stars Rise, who
      is gilded like a god of old.... Then, when the weather breaks, here are
      the Happiness of the Rain, who is covered with pearls, and the Happiness
      of the Winter Fire, who opens his beautiful purple mantle to frozen
      hands.... And I have not mentioned the best among us, because he is nearly
      a brother of the great limpid Joys whom you will see presently: his name
      is the Happiness of Innocent Thoughts, and he is the brightest of as
      all.... And then here are.... But really there are too many of them!... We
      should never have done; and I must first send word to the Great Joys, who
      are right at the back, near the gates of Heaven, and who have not yet
      heard of your arrival.... I will send the Happiness of Running Barefoot in
      the Dew, who is the nimblest of us.... (<i>To the</i> HAPPINESS OF RUNNING
      BAREFOOT IN THE DEW, <i>who comes forward capering</i>) Off you go!...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT (<i>to</i> TYLTYL) In the meantime, you might enquire about the Blue
      Bird. It is just possible that the chief Happiness of your home knows
      where he is....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Where Is he?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS He doesn't know where the Blue Bird is!... (<i>All the</i>
      HAPPINESSES OF THE HOME <i>burst out laughing</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>vexed</i>) No, I do not know.... There's nothing to laugh
      at.... (<i>Fresh bursts of laughter</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS Come, don't be angry... and let us be serious.... He doesn't
      know: well, what do you expect? He is no more absurd than the majority of
      men.... But little Happiness of Running Barefoot in the Dew has told the
      Great Joys and they are coming towards us....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Tall and beautiful angelic figures, clad in shimmering dresses, come
      slowly forward</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL How beautiful they are!... Why are they not laughing?... Are they
      not happy?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT It is not when one laughs that one is really happy....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Who are they?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS They are the Great Joys....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Do you know their names?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS Of course; we often play with them.... Here, first of all,
      before the others, is the Great Joy of Being Just, who smiles each time an
      injustice is repaired. I am too young: I have never seen her smile yet.
      Behind her is the Joy of Being Good, who is the happiest, but the saddest;
      and it is very difficult to keep her from going to the Miseries, whom she
      would like to console; for, if she left us, we should be almost as
      miserable as the Miseries themselves. On the right is the Joy of Fame,
      next to the Joy of Thinking. After her comes the Joy of Understanding, who
      is always looking for her brother, the Luxury of Understanding Nothing....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL But I have seen her brother!... He went to the Miseries with the
      Big Luxuries....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS I was certain of it.... He has turned out badly; keeping
      evil company has corrupted him entirely.... But do not speak of it to his
      sister. She would want to go and look for him and we should lose one of
      our most beautiful Joys.... Here, among the greatest Joys, is the Joy of
      Seeing what is Beautiful, who daily adds a few rays to the light that
      reigns amongst us....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And there, far away, far away, in the golden clouds, the one whom I
      can hardly see when I stand as high as I can on tip-toe?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS That is the Great Joy of Loving.... But, do what you will,
      you are ever so much too small to see her altogether....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And over there, right at the back, those who are veiled and who do
      not come near?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS Those are the Joys whom men do not yet know....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What do the others want with us?... Why are they standing aside?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS It is before a new Joy who is arriving, perhaps the purest
      that we have here....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Who is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE HAPPINESS Don't you recognise her yet?... But take a better look at
      her, open your two eyes down to the very heart of your soul!... She has
      seen you, she has seen you!... She runs up to you, holding out her
      arms!... It is your mother's Joy, it is the peerless Joy of Maternal
      Love!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The other</i> JOYS, <i>who have run up from every side, acclaim the</i>
      JOY OF MATERNAL LOVE <i>with their cheers and then fall back before her in
      silence</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JOY OF MATERNAL LOVE Tyltyl! And Mytyl!... What, do I find you
      here?... I never expected it!... I was very lonely at home; and here are
      you two climbing to that Heaven where the souls of all mothers beam with
      joy!... But first kisses, heaps and heaps of kisses!... Into my arms, the
      two of you; there is nothing on earth that gives greater happiness!...
      Tyltyl, aren't you laughing?... Nor you either, Mytyl?... Don't you know
      your mother's love when you see it?... Why, look at me: are these not my
      eyes, my lips, my arms?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, yes, I recognise them, but I did not know.... You are like
      Mummy, but you are much prettier....
    </p>
    <p>
      MATERNAL LOVE Why, of course, I have stopped growing old.... And every day
      brings me fresh strength and youth and happiness.... Each of your smiles
      makes me younger by a year.... At home, that does not show; but here
      everything is seen and it is the truth....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>wonder-struck, gazing at her and kissing her by turns</i>) And
      that beautiful dress of yours: what is it made of?... Is it silk, silver
      or pearls?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MATERNAL LOVE No, it is made of kisses and caresses and loving looks....
      Each kiss you give me adds a ray of moon-light or sunshine to it....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL How funny, I should never have thought that you were so rich!...
      Where used you to hide it?... Was it in the cupboard of which Daddy has
      the key?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MATERNAL LOVE No, no, I always wear it, but people do not see it, because
      people see nothing when their eyes are closed.... All mothers are rich
      when they love their children.... There are no poor mothers, no ugly ones,
      no old ones. Their love is always the most beautiful of the Joys.... And,
      when they seem most sad, it needs but a kiss which they receive or give to
      turn all their tears into stars in the depths of their eyes....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>looking at her with astonishment</i>) Why, yes, it's true, your
      eyes are filled with stars.... And they are really your eyes, only they
      are much more beautiful.... And this is your hand too, with the little
      ring on it.... It even has the burn which you gave it one evening when
      lighting the lamp.... But it is much whiter; and how delicate the skin
      is!... There seems to be light flowing through it.... Doesn't it do any
      work like the one at home?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MATERNAL LOVE Why yes, it is the very same: did you never see that it
      becomes quite white and fills with light the moment it fondles you?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL It's wonderful, Mummy: you have the same voice also; but you speak
      much better than you do at home....
    </p>
    <p>
      MATERNAL LOVE At home, one has too much to do and there is no time.... But
      what one does not say one hears all the same.... Now that you have seen
      me, will you know me again, in my torn dress, when you go back to the
      cottage tomorrow?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I don't want to go back.... As you are here, I want to stay also,
      as long as you remain....
    </p>
    <p>
      MATERNAL LOVE But it's just the same thing: I am down below, we are all
      down below.... You have come up here only to realise and to learn, once
      and for all, how to see me when you see me down below.... Do you
      understand, Tyltyl dear?... You believe yourself in Heaven; but Heaven is
      wherever you and I kiss each other.... There are not two mothers; and you
      have no other.... Every child has only one; and it is always the same one
      and always the most beautiful; but you have to know her and to know how to
      look.... But how did you manage to come up here and to find a road for
      which men have been seeking ever since they began to dwell upon the
      Earth?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>pointing to</i> LIGHT, <i>who, discreetly, has drawn a little
      to one side</i>) She brought me....
    </p>
    <p>
      MATERNAL LOVE Who is she?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Light....
    </p>
    <p>
      MATERNAL LOVE I have never seen her.... I was told that she was very fond
      of you both and very kind.... But why does she hide herself?... Does she
      never show her face?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, yes, but she is afraid that the Joys might be frightened if
      they saw too clearly....
    </p>
    <p>
      MATERNAL LOVE But doesn't she know that we are waiting only for her! (<i>Calling
      the other</i> GREAT JOYS) Come, come, sisters! Come quickly, all of you!
      Light has come to visit us at last!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>A stir among the</i> GREAT JOYS, <i>who draw nearer, with cries of
      "Light is here!... Light! Light!</i>...")
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JOY OF UNDERSTANDING (<i>thrusting all the others aside, to come and
      embrace</i> LIGHT) You are Light and we did not know it!... And we have
      been waiting for you for years and years and years!... Do you recognise
      me?... I am the Joy of Understanding, who have been seeking you for so
      long!... We are very happy, but we cannot see beyond ourselves....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JOY OF BEING JUST (<i>embracing</i> LIGHT <i>in her turn</i>) Do you
      recognise me?... I am the Joy of Being Just, who have besought you so
      long.... We are very happy, but we cannot see beyond our shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JOY OF SEEING WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL (<i>also embracing</i> LIGHT) Do you
      recognise me?... I am the Joy of Seeing what is Beautiful, who have loved
      you so dearly.... We are very happy, but we cannot see beyond our
      dreams....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JOY OF UNDERSTANDING Come, sister, come, do not keep us waiting any
      longer.... We are strong enough, we are pure enough.... Put aside those
      veils which still conceal from us the last truths and the last
      happinesses.... See, all my sisters are kneeling at your feet.... You are
      our queen and our reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT (<i>drawing her veils closer</i>) Sisters, my beautiful sisters, I
      am obeying my Master.... The hour is not yet come; it will strike,
      perhaps, and I shall return without fear and without shadow.... Farewell,
      rise and let us kiss once more, like sisters lost and found, while waiting
      for the day that will soon appear....
    </p>
    <p>
      MATERNAL LOVE (<i>embracing</i> LIGHT) You have been very good to my poor
      little ones....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT I shall always be good to those who love one another....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JOY OF UNDERSTANDING (<i>going up to</i> LIGHT) Let the last kiss be
      laid upon my forehead....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>They exchange a long kiss; and, when they separate and raise their
      heads, tears are seen to stand in their eyes</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>surprised</i>) Why are you crying?... (<i>Looking at the other</i>
      JOYS) I say! You're crying too!... But why have all of you tears in your
      eyes?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Hush, dear....

      SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Before the Curtain</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Enter</i> TYLTYL, MYTYL, LIGHT, <i>the</i> DOG, <i>the</i> CAT, BREAD,
      FIRE, SUGAR, WATER <i>and</i> MILK.
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT I have received a note from the Fairy Bérylune telling me that the
      Blue Bird is probably here.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Where?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Here, in the graveyard behind that wall.... It appears that one of
      the dead in the graveyard is hiding it in his tomb.... We must find out
      which one it is.... We shall have to pass them under review....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Under review?... How is that done?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT It is very simple: at midnight, so as not to disturb them too
      greatly, you will turn the diamond. We shall see them come out of the
      ground; or else we shall see those who do not come out lying in their
      tombs....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Will they not be angry?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Not at all; they will not even know.... They do not like being
      disturbed, but, as it is their custom, in any case, to come out at
      midnight, that will not inconvenience them....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why are Bread, Sugar and Milk so pale and why do they say
      nothing?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MILK (<i>staggering</i>) I feel I am going to turn....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT (<i>aside to TYLTYL</i>) Do not mind them.... They are afraid of the
      dead....
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRE (<i>frisking about</i>) I'm not afraid of them!... I am used to
      burning them.... Time was when I burnt them all; that was much more
      amusing than nowadays ...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And why Is Tylô trembling?... Is he afraid, too?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG I?... I'm not trembling!... I am never afraid; but if you went
      away, I should go too....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And has the Cat nothing to say?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>mysteriously</i>) I know what's what....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>to LIGHT</i>) Are you coming with us?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT No; it is better that I should remain at the gate of the graveyard
      with the Things and the Animals.... Some of them would be too frightened
      and I fear that the others would misbehave.... Fire, in particular, would
      want to burn the dead, as of old; and that is no longer done.... I shall
      leave you alone with Mytyl....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And may not Tylô stay with us?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG Yes, yes, I shall stay; I shall stay here I... I want to stay with
      my little god!...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT It is impossible.... The Fairy gave formal orders; besides, there is
      nothing to fear....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG Very well, very well, it makes no difference. If they are vicious,
      my little god, all you have to do Is this ... (<i>he whistles</i>) and you
      shall see.... It will be just as in the forest: Wow! Wow! Wow!...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Come, good-bye, dear children ... I shall not be far away.... (<i>She
      kisses the</i> CHILDREN.) Those who love me and whom I love always find me
      again.... (<i>To the</i> THINGS <i>and the</i> ANIMALS) This way, all of
      you....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>She goes out with the</i> THINGS <i>and the</i> ANIMALS. <i>The</i>
      CHILDREN <i>remain alone in the middle of the stage. The curtain, opens
      and discloses the next scene</i>.)

      SCENE 2.&mdash;<i>The Graveyard</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>It is night. The moon is shining on a country graveyard.. Numerous
      tombstones, grassy mounds, wooden crosses, stone slabs, etc</i>. TYLTYL <i>and</i>
      MYTYL <i>are standing by a short stone pillar</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL I am frightened!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>not too much at his ease</i>) I am never frightened....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL I say, are the dead wicked?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why, no, they're not alive!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Have you ever seen one?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, once, long ago, when I was very young....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL What was it like, say?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Quite white, very still and very cold and it didn't talk....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Are we going to see them, say?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why, of course, Light said so....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Where are they?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Here, under the grass or under those big stones....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Are they there all the year round?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>pointing to the slabs</i>) Are those the doors of their
      houses?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Do they go out when it's fine?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL They can only go out at night....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Why?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Because they are in their shirts....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Do they go out also when it rains?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL When it rains, they stay at home....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Is it nice in their homes, say?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL They say it's very cramped....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Have they any little children?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why, yes; they have all those that die....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL And what do they live on?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL They eat roots....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Shall we see them?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Of course; we see everything when I turn the diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL And what will they say?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL They will say nothing, as they don't talk....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Why don't they talk?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Because they have nothing to say....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Why have they nothing to say?...

    <p>
      TYLTYL You're a nuisance....

    <p>
      (<i>A pause</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL When will you turn the diamond?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL You heard Light say that I was to wait until midnight, because that
      disturbs them less....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Why does that disturb them less?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Because that is when they go out to take the air....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Is it not midnight yet?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Do you see the church clock?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Yes, I can even see the small hand....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Well, midnight is just going to strike.... There!... Do you
      hear?...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The clock strikes twelve</i>)

    <p>
      TYLTYL Not now.... I am going to turn the diamond....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL No, no!... Don't!... I want to go away!... I am so frightened,
      little brother!... I am terribly frightened!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL But there is no danger....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL I don't want to see the dead!... I don't want to see them!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Very well, you shall not see them; shut your eyes....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>clinging to</i> TYLTYL'S <i>clothes</i>) Tyltyl, I can't
      stay!... No, I can't possibly!... They are going to come out of the
      ground!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Don't tremble like that.... They will only come out for a
      moment....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL But you're trembling, too!... They will be awful!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL It is time, the hour is passing....

      efflorescence at first frail and timid, like steam; then white and
      virginal and more and more tufty, more and more tall and plentiful and

      transforms the graveyard into a sort of fairy-like and nuptial garden,
      over which rise the first rays of the dawn. The dew glitters, the flowers
      open their blooms, the wind murmurs in the leaves, the bees hum, the birds
      wake and flood the air with the first raptures of their hymns to the sun
      and to life. Stunned and dazzled,</i> TYLTYL <i>and</i> MYTYL, <i>holding

      SCENE 3.&mdash;<i>The Kingdom of the Future</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The immense halls of the Azure Palace, where the children wait that are
      yet to be born. Infinite perspectives of sapphire columns supporting
      turquoise vaults. Everything, from the light and the lapis-lazuli
      flagstones to the shimmering background into which the last arches run and
      disappear, everything, down to the smallest objects, is of an unreal,
      intense, fairy-like blue. Only the plinths and capitals of the columns,
      the key-stones, a few seats and circular benches are of white marble or
      alabaster. To the right, between the columns, are great opalescent doors.
      These doors, which</i> TIME <i>will throw back towards the end of the
      scene, open upon actual life and the quays of the Dawn. Everywhere,
      harmoniously peopling the hall, is a crowd of</i> CHILDREN <i>robed in
      long azure garments. Some are playing, others strolling to and fro, others
      talking or dreaming; many are asleep, many also are working, between the
      colonnades, at future inventions; and their tools, their instruments, the
      apparatus which they are constructing, the plants, flowers and fruit which
      they are cultivating or plucking are of the same supernatural and luminous
      blue as the general atmosphere of the Palace. Figures of a taller stature,
      clad in a paler and more diaphanous azure, figures of a sovereign and
      silent beauty move among the</i> CHILDREN <i>and would seem to be angels.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter on the left, as though by stealth, gliding between the columns in
      the foreground<i>, TYLTYL, MYTYL </i>and<i> LIGHT. Their arrival causes a
      certain movement among the</i> BLUE CHILDREN, <i>who come running up on
      every hand, form a group around the unwonted visitors and gaze upon them
      with curiosity</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Where are Sugar, the Cat and Bread?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT They cannot enter here; they would know the future and would not
      obey....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And the Dog?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT It is not well, either, that he should know what awaits him in the
      course of the ages....I have locked them all up in the vaults of the
      church....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Where are we?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT We are in the Kingdom of the Future, in the midst of the children
      who are not yet born. As the diamond allows us to see clearly in this
      region which is hidden from men, we shall very probably find the Blue Bird
      here....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Certainly the bird will be blue, since everything here is blue....(<i>Looking
      all around him</i>.) Heaven, how beautiful it all is!...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Look at the children running up....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Are they angry?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Not at all....You can see, they are smiling, but they are
      surprised....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BLUE CHILDREN (<i>running up in ever-increasing numbers</i>) Live
      children!...Come and look at the little live children!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why do they call us the little live children?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Because they themselves are not alive yet....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What are they doing, then?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT They are awaiting the hour of their birth....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL The hour of their birth?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Yes; it is from here that all the children come who are born upon
      our earth. Each awaits his day.... When the fathers and mothers want
      children, the great doors which you see there, on the right, are opened
      and the little ones go down....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What a, lot there are! What a lot there are!...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT There are many more.... We do not see them all.... There are thirty
      thousand halls like this, all full of them.... Just think, there are
      enough to last to the end of the world!... No one could count them....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And those tall blue persons, who are they?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT No one exactly knows.... They are believed to be guardians.... I
      have heard that they will come upon earth after men.... But we are not
      allowed to ask them....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why not?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Because it is the earth's secret....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And may one talk to the others, the little ones?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Certainly; you must make friends.... Look, there is one who is more
      curious than the rest.... Go up to him, speak to him....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What shall I say to him?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Whatever you like, as you would to a little playfellow....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Can I shake hands with him?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Of course, he won't hurt you.... But come, don't look so
      constrained.... I will leave you alone, you will be more at ease by
      yourselves.... Besides, I want to speak to the tall blue person....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>going up to the</i> BLUE CHILD <i>and holding out his hand</i>)
      How do you do?... (<i>Touching the</i> CHILD'S <i>blue dress with his
      finger</i>.) What's that?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD (<i>gravely touching</i> TYLTYL'S <i>hat</i>) And that?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL That?... That is my hat.... Have you no hat?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD No; what is it for?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL It's to say How-do-you-do with.... And then for when it rains or
      when it's cold....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD What does that mean, when it's cold?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL When you shiver like this: brrrr! brrrr!... When you blow into your
      hands and go like this with your arms....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>He vigorously beats his arms across his chest</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD Is it cold on earth?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, sometimes, in the winter, when there is no fire....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD Why is there no fire?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Because it's expensive and it costs money to buy wood....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD What is money?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL It's what you pay with....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD Oh....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Some people have money and others have none....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD Why not?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Because they are not rich.... Are you rich?... How old are you?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD I am going to be born soon.... I shall be born in twelve
      years.... Is it nice to be born?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, yes!... It's great fun!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD How did you manage?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I can't remember.... It is so long ago!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD They say it's lovely, the earth and the live people!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, it's not bad.... There are birds and cakes and toys.... Some
      have them all; but those who have none can look at them....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD They tell us that the mothers stand waiting at the door.... They
      are good, aren't they?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, yes!... They are better than anything in the world!... And the
      grannies too; but they die too soon....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD They die?... What is that?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL They go away one evening and do not come back....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD Why?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL How can one tell?... Perhaps because they feel sad....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD Has yours gone?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL My grandmamma?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD Your mamma or your grandmamma, I don't know....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, but it's not the same thing!... The grannies go first; that's
      sad enough.... Mine was very kind to me....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD What is the matter with your eyes?.... Are they making
      pearls?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL No; it's not pearls....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD What is it, then?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL It's nothing; it's all that blue, which dazzles me a little....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD What is that called?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD There, that, falling down....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Nothing, it is a little water....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD Does it come from the eyes?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, sometimes, when one cries....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD What does that mean, crying?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I have not been crying; it is the fault of that blue... But if I
      had cried, it would be the same thing....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD Does one often cry?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Not little boys, but little girls do.... Don't you cry here?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD No; I don't know how....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Well, you will learn.... What are you playing with, those great
      blue wings?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD These?... That's for the invention which I shall make on
      earth....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What invention?... Have you invented something?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD Why, yes; haven't you heard?... When I am on earth, I shall have
      to invent the thing that gives happiness....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Is it good to eat?... Does it make a noise?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD No; you hear nothing....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL That's a pity....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD I work at it every day.... It is almost finished.... Would you
      like to see it?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Very much.... Where is it?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD There, you can see it from here, between those two columns....
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER BLUE CHILD (<i>coming up to</i> TYLTYL <i>and plucking his sleeve</i>)
      Would you like to see mine, say?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, what is it?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SECOND CHILD The thirty-three remedies for prolonging life.... There,
      in those blue phials....
    </p>
    <p>
      A THIRD CHILD (<i>stepping out from the crowd</i>) I will show you a light
      which nobody knows of!... (<i>He lights himself up entirely with an
      extraordinary flame</i>.) It's rather curious, isn't it?...
    </p>
    <p>
      A FOURTH CHILD (<i>pulling</i> TYLTYL'S <i>arm</i>) Do come and look at my
      machine which flies in the air like a bird without wings!...
    </p>
    <p>
      A FIFTH CHILD No, no; mine first! It discovers the treasures hidden in the
      moon!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BLUE CHILDREN (<i>crowding round</i> TYLTYL <i>and</i> MYTYL <i>and
      all crying together</i>) No, no, come and see mine!... No, mine is much
      finer!... Mine is a wonderful invention!... Mine is made of sugar!... His
      is no good!... He stole the idea from me!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Amid these disordered exclamations, the</i> LIVE CHILDREN <i>are
      dragged towards the blue workshops, where each of the inventors sets his
      ideal machine going. There ensues a cerulean whirl of wheels, disks,
      flywheels, driving-wheels, pulleys, straps and strange and as yet unnamed
      objects shrouded in the bluey mists of the unreal. A crowd of odd and
      mysterious mechanisms dart forth and hover under the vaults or crawl at
      the foot of the columns, while</i> CHILDREN <i>unfold charts and plans,
      open books, uncover azure statues and bring enormous flowers and gigantic
      fruits that seem formed of sapphires and turquoises</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A LITTLE BLUE CHILD (<i>bending under the weight of some colossal blue
      daisies</i>) Look at my flowers!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What are they?... I don't know them....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LITTLE BLUE CHILD They are daisies!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Impossible!... They are as big as tables!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LITTLE BLUE CHILD And they smell so good!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>smelling them</i>) Wonderful!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LITTLE BLUE CHILD They will grow like that when I am on earth....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL When will that be?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LITTLE BLUE CHILD In fifty-three years, four months and nine days....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Two</i> BLUE CHILDREN <i>arrive, carrying, like a lustre hanging on a
      pole, an incredible bunch of grapes, each larger than a pear</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ONE OF THE CHILDREN (<i>carrying the grapes</i>) What do you say to my
      fruits?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL A bunch of pears!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD No, they are grapes!... They will all be like that when I am
      thirty.... I have found the way....
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER CHILD (<i>staggering under a basket of blue apples the size of
      melons</i>) And mine!... Look at my apples!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL But those are melons!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD No, no!... They are my apples and they are not the finest at
      that!... They will all be alike when I am alive.... I have discovered the
      system!...
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER CHILD (<i>wheeling a blue barrow with blue melons bigger than
      pumpkins</i>) What do you say to my little melons?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL But they are pumpkins!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD WITH THE MELONS When I come on earth, the melons will be
      splendid!... I shall be the gardener of the King of the Three Planets....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL The King of the Three Planets?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD WITH THE MELONS The great king who for thirty-five years will
      bring happiness to the Earth, Mars and the Moon.... You can see him from
      here....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Where is he?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD WITH THE MELONS There, the little boy sleeping at the foot of
      that column.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL On the left?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD WITH THE MELONS No, on the right.... The one on the left is the
      child who will bring pure joy to the globe....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL How?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD (<i>the one that first talked to</i> TYLTYL) By means of ideas
      which people have not yet had....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And the other, that little fat one with his fingers to his nose,
      what will he do?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD He is to discover the fire that will warm the earth when the sun
      is paler than now....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And the two holding each other by the hand and always kissing; are
      they brother and sister?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD No; they are very comical....They are the Lovers....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What is that?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD I don't know.... Time calls them that, to make fun of them....
      They spend the day looking into each other's eyes, kissing and bidding
      each other farewell....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD It seems that they will not be able to leave together...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And the little pink one, who looks so serious and is sucking his
      thumb, what is he?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD It appears that he is to wipe out injustice from the earth....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD They say it's a tremendous work....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And the little red-haired one, who walks as if he did not see where
      he was going, is he blind?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD Not yet; but he will become so....Look at him well; it seems
      that he is to conquer Death....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What does that mean?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD I don't exactly know; but they say it's a great thing....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>pointing to a crowd of</i> CHILDREN <i>sleeping at the foot of
      the columns, on the steps, the benches, etc</i>.) And all those asleep,
      what a number of them there are asleep!... Do they do nothing?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD They are thinking of something....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Of what?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD They do not know yet; but they must take something with them to
      earth; we are not allowed to go from here empty-handed....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Who says so?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD Time, who stands at the door.... You will see when he opens
      it.... He is very tiresome....
    </p>
    <p>
      A CHILD (<i>running up from the back of the hall and elbowing his way
      through the crowd</i>) How are you, TYLTYL?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Hullo!... How does he know my name?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD (<i>who has just run up and who now kisses</i> TYLTYL <i>and</i>
      MYTYL <i>effusively</i>.) How are you?... All right?... Come, give me a
      kiss, and you too, Mytyl. It's not surprising that I should know your
      name, seeing that I shall be your brother.... They have only just told me
      that you were here.... I was right at the other end of the hall, packing
      up my ideas.... Tell mummy that I am ready....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What?... Are you coming to us?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD Certainly, next year, on Palm Sunday.... Don't tease me too much
      when I am little.... I am very glad to have kissed you both beforehand....
      Tell daddy to mend the cradle.... Is it comfortable in our home?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Not bad.... And mummy is so kind!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD And the food?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL That depends.... We even have cakes sometimes, don't we, Mytyl?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL On New Year's Day and the fourteenth of July.... Mummy makes
      them....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What have you got in that bag?... Are you bringing us something?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD I am bringing three illnesses: scarlatina, whooping-cough and
      measles....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, that's all, is it?... And, after that, what will you do?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD After that?... I shall leave you....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL It will hardly be worth while coming!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD We can't pick and choose!...

      is heard to rise and swell; it seems to emanate from the columns and the
      opal doors, which are irradiated by a brighter light than before</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What is that?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD That's Time!... He is going to open the gates!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>A great change comes over the crowd of</i> BLUE CHILDREN, <i>Most of
      them leave their machines and their labours, numbers of sleepers awake and
      all turn their eyes towards the opal doors and go nearer to them</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT (<i>joining</i> TYLTYL) Let us try to hide behind the columns.... It
      will not do for Time to discover us....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Where does that noise come from?...
    </p>
    <p>
      A CHILD It is the Dawn rising.... This is the hour when the children who
      are to be born to-day go down to earth....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL How will they go down?... Are there ladders?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD You shall see.... Time is drawing the bolts....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Who is Time?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD An old man who comes to call those who are going....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Is he wicked?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD No; but he hears nothing.... Beg as they may, if it's not their
      turn, he pushes back all those who try to go....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Are they glad to go?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD We are sorry when we are left behind, but we are sad when we
      go.... There! There!... He is opening the doors!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The great opalescent doors turn slowly on their hinges. The sounds of
      the earth are heard like a distant music. A red and green light penetrates
      into the hall</i>; TIME, <i>a tall old man with a streaming beard, armed
      with his scythe and hourglass, appears upon the threshold; and the
      spectator perceives the extremity of the white and gold sails of a galley
      moored to a sort of quay, formed by the rosy mists of the Dawn</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TIME (<i>on the threshold</i>) Are they ready whose hour has struck?...
    </p>
    <p>
      BLUE CHILDREN (<i>elbowing their way and running up from all sides</i>)
      Here we are!... Here we are!... Here we are!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TIME (<i>in a gruff voice to the</i> CHILDREN <i>defiling before him to go
      out</i>) One at a time!... Once again, there are many more of you than are
      wanted!... It's always the same thing!... You can't deceive me!...(<i>Pushing
      back a</i> CHILD.) It's not your turn!... Go back and wait till
      to-morrow.... Nor you either; go in and return in ten years.... A
      thirteenth shepherd?... There are only twelve wanted; there is no need for
      more; the days of Theocritus and Virgil are past.... More doctors?...
      There are too many already; they are grumbling about it on earth.... And
      where are the engineers?... They want an honest man, only one, as a
      phenomenon.... Where is the honest man?... Is it you?... (THE CHILD <i>nods
      yes</i>.) You appear to me to be a very poor specimen!... Hallo, you, over
      there, not so fast, not so fast!... And you, what are you bringing?...
      Nothing at all, empty-handed?... Then you can't go through.... Prepare
      something, a great crime, if you like, or a fine sickness, I don't care
      ... but you mast have something.... (<i>Catching sight of a little</i>
      CHILD <i>whom the others are pushing forward, while he resists with all
      his strength</i>.) Well, what's the matter with you?... You know that the
      hour has come.... They want a hero to fight against injustice; you're the
      one: you most start....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BLUE CHILDREN He doesn't want to, sir....
    </p>
    <p>
      TIME What?... He doesn't want to?... Where does the little monster think
      he is?... No objections, we have no time to spare....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD (<i>who is being pushed</i>) No, no!...I don't want to go!... I
      would rather not be born!... I would rather stay here!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TIME That is not the question.... When the hour comes, it comes!... Now
      then, quick, forward!...
    </p>
    <p>
      A CHILD (<i>stepping forward</i>) Oh, let me pass!... I will go and take
      his place!... They say that my parents are old and have been waiting for
      me so long!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TIME None of that!... You will start at your proper hour, at your proper
      time.... We should never be done if we listened to you.... One wants to
      go, another refuses; it's too soon or it's too late.... (<i>Pushing back
      some</i> CHILDREN <i>who have encroached upon the threshold</i>.) Not so
      near, you children!... Back, you inquisitive ones!... Those who are not
      starting have no business outside.... You are in a hurry now; later, when
      your turn comes, you will be frightened and hang back.... Look, there are
      four who are trembling like leaves.... (<i>To a</i> CHILD <i>who, on the
      point of crossing the threshold, suddenly goes back</i>.) Well, what is
      it?... What's the matter?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHILD I have forgotten the box containing the two crimes which I shall
      have to commit....

    <p>
      ANOTHER CHILD And I the little pot with my idea for enlightening the
      crowd....

    <p>
      TIME Run quick and fetch them!... We have only six hundred and twelve
      seconds left.... The galley of the Dawn is already flapping her sails to
      show that she is waiting.... You will come too late and you won't be
      born!... Come, quick, on board with you!... (<i>Laying hold of a</i> CHILD
      <i>who tries to pass between his legs to reach the quay</i>.) Oh, no, not
      you!... This is the third time you've tried to be born before your
      turn.... Don't let me catch you at it again, or you can wait forever with
      my sister Eternity; and you know that it's not amusing there!... But come,
      are we ready?... Is every one at his post?... (<i>Surveying the</i>
      CHILDREN <i>standing on the quay or already seated In the galley</i>.)
      There is still one missing.... It is no use his hiding, I see him in the
      crowd.... You can't deceive me!... Come on, you, the little fellow whom
      they call the Lover, say good-bye to your sweetheart....
    </p>
    <p>

      their faces livid with despair, go up to</i> TIME <i>and kneel at his feet</i>.)

    <p>
      THE FIRST CHILD Mr. Time, let me stay behind with her!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SECOND CHILD Mr. Time, let me go with him!...

    <p>
      TIME Impossible!... We have only three hundred and ninety-four seconds

    <p>

    <p>
      THE SECOND CHILD (<i>beseechingly</i>) Mr. Time, I shall come too late!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIRST CHILD I shall be gone before she comes down!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SECOND CHILD I shall never see him again!...

    <p>
      THE FIRST CHILD (<i>struggling</i>) No, no, no!... She, too!...

      THE SECOND CHILD (<i>clinging to the clothes of the</i> FIRST) Leave him
      with me!... Leave him!...

    <p>
      TIME Come, come, he is not going to die, but to live!... (<i>Dragging away
      the</i> FIRST CHILD.) Come along!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SECOND CHILD (<i>stretching her arms out frantically to the</i> CHILD
      <i>that is being carried off</i>) A sign!... A sign!... Tell me how to
      find you!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIRST CHILD I shall always love you!...
    </p>
    <p>

      (<i>Last and violent movements among the</i> CHILDREN <i>departing and

    </p>
    <p>
      THE BLUE CHILDREN Good-bye, Pierre!... Good-bye, Jean!... Have you all you
      want?... Announce my idea!... Have you got the new turnscrew?... Mind you
      speak of my melons!... Have you forgotten nothing?... Try to know me again
      I... I shall find you!... Don't lose your ideas!... Don't lean too far
      into space!... Send me your news!... They say one can't... Oh, try, do
      try!... Try to tell us if it's nice!... I will come to meet you I... I
      shall be born on a throne!...

      anchor's raised!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The sails of the galley pass and disappear. The voices of the</i>
      CHILDREN <i>in the galley are heard in the distance</i>: "The Earth! The
      Earth!... I can see it!... How beautiful it is!... How bright it is!...
      How big it is!"... <i>Then, as though issuing from the depths of the
      abyss, an extremely distant song of gladness and expectation</i>.)

    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>to</i> LIGHT) What is that?... It is not they singing.... It
      sounds like other voices....

      LIGHT Yes, it is the song of the mothers coming out to meet them....

      <i>The stage represents a wall with a small door. It is the break of day</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Enter</i> TYLTYL, MYTYL, LIGHT, BREAD, WATER, SUGAR, FIRE <i>and</i>
      MILK) You would never guess where we are....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Well, no, Light, because I don't know....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Don't you recognise that wall and that little door?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL It is a red wall and a little green door.
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT And doesn't that remind you of anything?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL It reminds me that Time shewed us the door....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT How odd people are when they dream.... They do not recognise their
      own hands....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Who is dreaming?... Am I?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Perhaps it's myself.... Who can tell?... However, this wall contains
      a house which you have seen more than once since you were born....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL A house which I have seen more than once since I was born?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Why yes, sleepy-head!... It is the house which we left one evening,
      just a year ago, to a day....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Just a year ago?... Why, then....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Come, come!... Don't open great eyes like sapphire caves.... It's
      the dear old house of your father and mother....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>going up to the door</i>) But I think.... Yes, really.... It
      seems to me.... This little door.... I recognise the wooden pin.... Are
      they in there?... Are we near mummy?... I want to go in at once.... I want
      to kiss her at once!...
    </p>

      start.... Besides, the door will not open till the hour strikes....

      TYLTYL But I haven't got the Blue Bird!... The one of the Land of Memory
      turned quite black, the one of the Future turned quite pink, the Night's
      are dead and I could not catch the one in the Forest.... Is it my fault if
      they change colour, or die, or escape?... Will the Fairy be angry and what
      will she say?...
    </p>

    <p>
      (<i>The</i> CAT <i>is heard to utter shrill cries</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>alarmed</i>) It's Tylette crying!... He is being hurt!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Enter the</i> CAT, <i>running, his hair on end and dishevelled, his
      clothes torn, holding his handkerchief to his cheek, as though he had the
      toothache. He utters angry groans and is closely pursued by the</i> DOG,
      <i>who overwhelms him with bites, blows and kicks</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG (<i>beating the</i> CAT) There!... Have you had enough?... Do you
      want any more?... There! There! There!...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT, TYLTYL and MYTYL (<i>rushing forward to part them</i>) Tylô!... Are
      you mad?... Well, I never!... Down!... Stop that, will you?... How dare
      you?... Wait, wait!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>They part the</i> DOG <i>and the</i> CAT <i>by main force</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT What is it?... What has happened?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>blubbering and wiping his eyes</i>) It's the Dog, Mrs.
      Light.... He insulted me, he put tin tacks in my food, he pulled my tail,
      he beat me; and I had done nothing, nothing, nothing at all!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG (<i>mimicking him</i>) Nothing, nothing, nothing at all!... (<i>In
      an undertone, with a mocking grimace</i>) Never mind, you've had some,
      you've had some and you're going to have some more!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>pressing the</i> CAT <i>in her arms</i>) My poor Tylette, where
      has he hurt you?... Tell me.... I shall cry too....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT (<i>to the</i> DOG, <i>severely</i>) Your conduct is all the more,
      unworthy since you have chosen for this disgraceful exhibition the already
      most painful moment when we are about to part from these poor children....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG (<i>suddenly sobered</i>) To part from these poor children?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Yes; the hour which you know of is at hand.... We are going to
      return to silence.... We shall no longer be able to speak to them....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOG (<i>suddenly uttering real howls of despair and flinging himself
      upon the</i> CHILDREN, <i>whom he loads with violent and tumultuous
      caresses</i>.) No! No!... I refuse!... I refuse!... I shall always
      talk!... You will understand me now, will you not, my little god?... Yes!
      Yes! Yes!... And we shall tell each other everything, everything,
      everything!... And I shall be very good.... And I shall learn to read and
      write and play dominoes!... And I shall always be very clean.... And I
      shall never steal anything in the kitchen again.... Shall I do a wonderful
      trick for you?... Would you like me to kiss the Cat?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL (<i>to the</i> CAT) And you, Tylette?... Have you nothing to say to
      us?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAT (<i>in an affected and enigmatic tone</i>) I love you both as much
      as you deserve....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Now let me, in my turn, children, give you a last kiss....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL and MYTYL (<i>hanging on to</i> LIGHT'S <i>dress</i>) No, no, no,
      Light!... Stay here with us!... Daddy won't mind.... We will tell mummy
      how kind you have been....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Alas! I cannot!... This door is closed to us and I must leave
      you....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Where will you go all alone?...
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Not very far, my children; over there, to the Land of the Silence of
      Things....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL No, no; I won't have you go.... We will go with you.... I shall
      tell mummy....
    </p>
    <p>
      LIGHT Do not cry, my dear little ones.... I have not a voice like Water; I
      have only my brightness, which Man does not understand.... But I watch
      over him to the end of his days.... Never forget that I am speaking to you
      in every spreading moonbeam, in every twinkling star, in every dawn that
      rises, in every lamp that is lit, in every good and bright thought of your
      soul.... (<i>Eight o'clock strikes behind the wall</i>.) Listen!... The
      hour is striking!... Good-bye!... The door is opening!... In with you, in
      with you!...

    <p>
      <i>The same setting as in</i> ACT I, <i>but the objects, the walls and the

      smiling. The daylight penetrates gaily through the chinks of the closed

      <i>Enter</i> MUMMY TYL
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL (<i>in a cheerfully scolding voice</i>) Up, come, get up, you
      little lazybones!... Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?... It has struck
      eight and the sun is high above the trees!... Lord, how they sleep, how
      they sleep!... (<i>She leans over and kisses the</i> CHILDREN.) They are
      quite rosy.... Tyltyl smells of lavender and Mytyl of
      lilies-of-the-valley.... (<i>Kissing them again</i>) What sweet things
      children are!... Still, they can't go on sleeping till midday.... I
      mustn't let them grow up idle.... And, besides, I have heard that it's not
      very healthy.... (<i>Gently shaking</i> TYLTYL) Wake up, wake up,
      Tyltyl....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>waking up</i>) What?... Light?... Where is she?... No, no,
      don't go away....
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Light?... Why, of course it's light... Has been for ever so
      long.... It's as bright as noonday, though the shutters are closed....
      Wait a bit till I open them.... (<i>She pushes back the shutters and the
      dazzling daylight invades the room</i>.) There! See!... What's the matter
      with you?... You look quite blinded....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>rubbing his eyes</i>) Mummy, mummy!... It's you!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Why, of course, it's I.... Who did you think it was?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL It's you.... Yes, yes, it's you!....
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Yes, yes, it's I.... I haven't changed my face since last
      night.... Why do you stare at me in that wonderstruck way?... Is my nose
      turned upside down, by any chance?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Oh, how nice it is to see you again!... It's so long, so long
      ago!... I must kiss you at once.... Again! Again! Again!... And how
      comfortable my bed is!... I am back at home!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL What's the matter?... Why don't you wake up?... Don't tell me
      you're ill.... Let me see, show me your tongue.... Come, get up and
      dress....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Hullo, I've got my shirt on!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Of course you have.... Put on your breeches and your little
      jacket.... There they are, on the chair....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Is that what I did on the journey?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL What journey?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why, last year....
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Last year?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why, yes!...At Christmas, when I went away....
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL When you went away?... You haven't left the room.... I put you
      to bed last night, and here you are this morning.... Have you dreamed all
      that?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL But you don't understand!... It was last year, when I went away
      with Mytyl, the Fairy, Light&mdash;how nice Light is!&mdash;Bread, Sugar,
      Water, Fire: they did nothing but quarrel!... You're not angry with me?...
      Did you feel very sad?... And what did daddy say?... I could not refuse...
      I left a note to explain....
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL What are you talking about?... For sure, either you're ill or
      else you're still asleep.... (<i>She gives him a friendly shake</i>.)
      There, wake up.... There, is that better?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL But, mummy, I assure you.... It's you that's still asleep....
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL What! Still asleep, am I?... Why? I've been up since six
      o'clock.... I've finished all the cleaning and lit the fire....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL But ask Mytyl if it's not true.... Oh, we have had such
      adventures!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Why Mytyl?... What do you mean?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL She was with me.... We saw grandad and granny....
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL (<i>more and more bewildered</i>) Grandad and granny?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, in the Land of Memory.... It was on our way.... They are dead,
      but they are quite well.... Granny made us a lovely plum-tart.... And then
      the little brothers&mdash;Robert, Jean and his top&mdash;and Madeleine and
      Pierrette and Pauline and Riquette, too....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL Riquette still goes about on all fours!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL And Pauline still has a pimple on her nose....
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Have you found the key of the cupboard where daddy hides his
      brandy bottle?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Does daddy hide a brandy bottle?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Certainly. One has to hide everything when one has little
      meddlesome good-for-nothings like you.... But come, out with it, confess
      that you took it.... I would rather it was that.... I sha'n't tell
      daddy.... I sha'n't beat you....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL But, mummy, I don't know where it is....
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Just walk in front of me, so that I may see if you can walk
      straight.... (TYLTYL <i>does so</i>) No, it's not that.... Dear heaven,
      what is the matter with them?... I shall lose them too, as I lost the
      others!... (<i>Suddenly mad with alarm, she calls out</i>) Daddy Tyl!...
      Come, quick! The children are ill!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Enter</i> DADDY TYL, <i>very calmly, with an axe in his hand</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      DADDY TYL What is it?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL and MYTYL (<i>running up gaily to kiss their father</i>) Hullo,
      daddy!... It's daddy!... Good-morning, daddy!... Have you had plenty of
      work this year?...
    </p>
    <p>
      DADDY TYL Well, what's the matter?... They don't look ill; they look very
      well....
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL (<i>weeping</i>) You can't trust their looks.... It will be as
      with the others.... They looked quite well also to the end; and then God
      took them.... I don't know what's the matter with them.... I put them to
      bed quite quietly last night; and this morning, when they woke up,
      everything was wrong.... They don't know what they're saying; they talk
      about a journey.... They have seen Light and grandad and granny, who are
      dead, but who are quite well....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL But grandad still has his wooden leg....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL And granny her rheumatics....
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Do you hear?... Run and fetch the doctor!...
    </p>
    <p>
      DADDY TYL Why, no, no.... They are not dead yet.... Come, let us look into
      this.... (<i>A knock at the front door</i>.) Come in!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Enter</i> NEIGHBOUR BERLINGOT, <i>a little old woman resembling the</i>
      FAIRY <i>in</i> ACT I <i>and leaning on a stick</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE NEIGHBOUR Good-morning and a Merry Christmas to you all!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL It's the Fairy Bérylune!...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE NEIGHBOUR I have come to ask for a bit of fire for my Christmas
      stew.... It's very chilly this morning.... Good-morning, children, how are
      you?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Fairy Bérylune, I could not find the Blue Bird....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE NEIGHBOUR What is he saying?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Don't ask me, Madame Berlingot.... They don't know what they are
      saying.... They have been like that since they woke up.... They must have
      eaten something that wasn't good....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE NEIGHBOUR Why, Tyltyl, don't you remember Goody Berlingot, your
      Neighbour Berlingot?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why, yes, ma'am.... You are the Fairy Bérylune.... You're not angry
      with us?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE NEIGHBOUR Béry... what? Goodness gracious me!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Bérylune.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE NEIGHBOUR Berlingot, you mean Berlingot....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Bérylune or Berlingot, as you please, ma'am.... But Mytyl knows....
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL That's the worst of it, that Mytyl also....
    </p>
    <p>
      DADDY TYL Pooh, pooh!... That will soon go; I will give them a smack or
      two....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE NEIGHBOUR Don't; It's not worth while.... I know all about it; it's
      only a little fit of dreaming.... They must have slept in the
      moonbeams.... My little girl, who is very ill, is often like that....
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL By the way, how is your little girl?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE NEIGHBOUR Only so-so.... She can't get up.... The doctor says that
      it's her nerves.... I know what would cure her, for all that. She was
      asking me for it only this morning, for her Christmas box; it's a notion
      she has...
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Yes, I know; it's Tyltyl's bird.... Well, Tyltyl, aren't you
      going to give it at last to that poor little thing?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL What, mummy?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Your bird.... It's no use to you.... You don't even look at it
      now.... And she has been dying to have it for ever so long!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Hullo, that's true, my bird!... Where is he?... Oh, there's the
      cage!... Mytyl, do you see the cage?... It's the one which Bread
      carried.... Yes, yes, it's the same one, but there's only one bird in
      it.... Has he eaten the other, I wonder?... Hullo, why, he's blue!... But
      it's my turtle-dove!... But he's much bluer than when I went away!... Why,
      that's the blue bird we were looking for!... We went so far and he was
      here all the time!... Oh, but it's wonderful!... Mytyl, do you see the
      bird? What would Light say?... I will take down the cage.... (<i>He climbs
      on a chair and takes down the cage and carries it to the</i> NEIGHBOUR.)
      There, Madame Berlingot, there you are.... He's not quite blue yet, but
      that will come, you shall see!... Take him off quick to your little
      girl....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE NEIGHBOUR Really?... Do you mean it?... Do you give it me like that,
      straight away and for nothing?... Lord, how happy she will be!... (<i>Kissing</i>
      TYLTYL) I must give you a kiss!... I fly!... I fly!...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, yes; be quick.... Some of them change their colour....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE NEIGHBOUR I will come back to tell you what she says....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>She goes out</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>after taking a long look around him</i>) Daddy, mummy, what
      have you done to the house?... It's just as it was, but it's much
      prettier....
    </p>
    <p>
      DADDY TYL How do you mean, it's prettier?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Why, yes, everything has been painted and made to look new,
      everything is clean and polished.... It was not like that last year....
    </p>
    <p>
      DADDY TYL Last year?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>going to the window</i>) And look at the forest!... How big and
      fine it is!... One would think it was new!... How happy I feel here!... (<i>Going
      to the bread-pan and opening it</i>) Where's Bread?.... I say, the loaves
      are very quiet.... And then here's Tylô!... Hullo, Tylô, Tylô!... Ah, you
      had a fine fight!... Do you remember, in the forest?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL And Tylette.... He knows me, but he has stopped talking....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Mr. Bread.... (<i>Feeling his forehead</i>) Hullo, the diamond's
      gone!... Who's taken my little green hat?... Never mind; I don't want it
      any more.... Ah, Fire!... He's a good one!... He crackles and laughs to
      make Water angry.... (<i>Running to the tap</i>) And Water?...
      Good-morning, Water!... What does she say?... She still talks, but I don't
      understand her as well as I did....
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL I don't see Sugar....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Lord, how happy I am, happy, happy, happy!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL So am I, so am I!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL What are you spinning round for like that?....
    </p>
    <p>
      DADDY TYL Don't mind them and don't distress yourself.... They are playing
      at being happy....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I liked Light best of all.... Where's her lamp?... Can we light
      it?... (<i>Looking round him again</i>.) Goodness me, how lovely it all is
      and how glad I feel!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Why?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I don't know, mummy....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>A knock at the front-door</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      DADDY TYL Come in, come in!...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Enter the</i> NEIGHBOUR, <i>holding by the hand a little girl of a
      fair and wonderful beauty, who carries</i> TYLTYL'S <i>dove pressed in her
      arms</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE NEIGHBOUR Do you see the miracle?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Impossible!... Can she walk?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE NEIGHBOUR Can she walk?... She can run, she can dance, she can fly!...
      When she saw the bird, she jumped, just like that, with one bound, to the
      window, to see by the light if it was really Tyltyl's dove.... And then,
      whoosh!... Out into the street, like an angel!... It was as much as I
      could do to keep pace with her....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL (<i>going up to her, wonderstruck</i>) Oh, how like Light she
      is!...
    </p>
    <p>
      MYTYL She is much smaller....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Yes, indeed!... But she will grow bigger....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE NEIGHBOUR What are they saying?... Haven't they got over it yet?...
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL They are better, they are mending.... It will be all right when
      they have had their breakfasts....

      Come along, child, come and thank Tyltyl....
    </p>
    <p>
      (TYLTYL, <i>suddenly frightened, takes a step back</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MUMMY TYL Well, Tyltyl, what's the matter?.... Are you afraid of the
      little girl?... Come, give her a kiss, a good big kiss.... No, a better
      one than that.... You're not so shy as a rule!... Another one!... But
      what's the matter with you?... You look as if you were going to cry....
    </p>
    <p>
      (TYLTYL, <i>after kissing the</i> LITTLE GIRL <i>rather awkwardly, stands
      before her for a moment and the two children look at each other without
      speaking; then</i> TYLTYL <i>strokes the dove's head</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Is he blue enough?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LITTLE GIRL Yes, I am so pleased with him....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL I have seen bluer ones.... But those which are quite blue, you
      know, do what you will, you can't catch them....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LITTLE GIRL That doesn't matter; he's lovely....
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Has he had anything to eat?...
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LITTLE GIRL Not yet.... What does he eat?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Anything: corn, bread, Indian corn, grasshoppers....
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LITTLE GIRL How does he eat, say?...
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL With his beak. You'll see, I will show you....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>He moves in order to take the bird from the</i> LITTLE GIRL'S <i>hands.
      She resists instinctively; and, taking advantage of the hesitation of
      their movements, the</i> DOVE <i>escapes and flies away</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE LITTLE GIRL (<i>with a cry of despair</i>) Mother!... He is gone!... (<i>She
      bursts into sobs</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYLTYL Never mind.... Don't cry.... I will catch him again.... (<i>Stepping
      to the front of the stage and addressing the audience</i>.) If any of you
      should find him, would you be so very kind as to give him back to us?...
      We need him for our happiness, later on....

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
