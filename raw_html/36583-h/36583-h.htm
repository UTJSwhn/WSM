<h2>HANIA.</h2>

<h3>PROLOGUE.</h3>

<h3>THE OLD SERVANT.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">BESIDES old managers, overseers, and foresters there
is another type of man which is disappearing
more and more from the face of the earth,&mdash;the old
servant.</p>

<p>During my childhood, as I remember, my parents were
served by one of those mammoths. After those mammoths
there will soon be only bones in old cemeteries,
in strata thickly covered with oblivion; from time to
time investigators will dig them out. This old servant
was called Mikolai Suhovolski; he was a noble from the
noble village of Suha Vola, which he mentioned often in
his stories. He came to my father from my grandfather
of sacred memory, with whom he was an orderly in the
time of the Napoleonic wars. He did not himself remember
accurately when he began service with my
grandfather; when he was asked for the date, he took
snuff, and answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I was then without mustaches, and the colonel,
God light his soul, was still very young."</p>

<p>In the house of my parents he fulfilled the most
varied duties: he was butler; he was body-servant; in
summer he went to the harvest fields in the r&ocirc;le of overseer,
<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
in winter to the threshing; he kept the keys of the
vodka room, the cellar, the granary; he wound up the
clocks; but above all he kept the house in order.</p>

<p>I do not remember this man otherwise than scolding.
He scolded my father, he scolded my mother; I feared
him as fire, though I liked him. In the kitchen he
worked off a whole breviary on the cook, he pulled the
pantry boys by the ears through the house, and never
was he content with anything. Whenever he got tipsy,
which happened once a week, all avoided him, not because
he permitted himself to have words with his
master or mistress, but because whenever he fastened on
any one, he followed that person all day, nagging and
scolding without end.</p>

<p>During dinner, he stood behind my father's chair, and,
though he did not serve, he watched the man who served,
and poisoned life for him with a most particular passion.</p>

<p>"Take care, take care!" muttered he, "or I will take
care of thee. Look at him! he cannot serve quickly,
but drags his legs after him, like an old cow on the
march. Take care again! He does not hear that his
master is calling. Change her plate for the lady. Why
art thou gaping? Why? Look at him! look at him!"</p>

<p>He interfered in conversation carried on at table, and
opposed everything always. Frequently it happened
that my father would turn during dinner and say to
him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mikolai, tell Mateush after dinner to harness the
horses; we will drive to such and such a place."</p>

<p>"Drive! why not drive? Oi yei! But are not horses
for driving? Let the poor horses break their legs on
such a road. If there is a visit to be made, it must be
made. Of course their lordships are free; do I prevent
them? I do not prevent. Why not visit? The accounts
<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
can wait, and the threshing can wait. The visit
is more urgent."</p>

<p>"It is a torment with this Mikolai!" shouted my
father sometimes, made impatient.</p>

<p>But Mikolai began again,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do I say that I am not stupid? I know that I am
stupid. The manager has gone to pay court to the
priest's housekeeper in Nyevodov, and why shouldn't
masters go on visits? Is a visit less important than
paying court to a housekeeper? If 'tis permitted to the
servant to go, it is permitted to the master."</p>

<p>And thus it went on in a circle without means of
stopping the old grumbler.</p>

<p>We, that is, I and my younger brother, feared him, as
I have said, almost more than our tutor Father Ludvik,
and surely more than our parents. He was more polite
toward my sisters. He said "Panienka"
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> to each of
them, though they were younger than we; but to us he
said "thou" without ceremony. For me he had a
special charm: he always carried gun caps in his pocket.
It happened often that after lessons I would slip into
the pantry, smile as nicely as I could, be as friendly as
possible, and say timidly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mikolai! A good day to Mikolai. Will Mikolai
clean pistols to-day?"</p>

<p>"What does Henryk want here? I'll get ready a
dish-cloth, that is all."</p>

<p>Then he would mock me, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Mikolai! Mikolai!' When gun caps are wanted,
Mikolai is good, and when not, let the wolves eat him.
Thou wouldst do better to study; thou'lt never gain
wit from shooting."</p>

<p>"I have finished my lessons," said I, half crying.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
"Finished his lessons! Hum! finished. He is
studying and studying, but his head is like an empty
canister. I won't give caps, and that's the end of
it." (While talking, he searched through his pockets.)
"But if the cap goes into his eye, Mikolai will catch it.
Who is to blame? Mikolai. Who let the boy shoot?
Mikolai."</p>

<p>Scolding in this fashion, he went to my father's
room, took down the pistols, blew the dust off them,
declared a hundred times more that all this was not
worth a deuce; then he lighted a candle, put a cap on
the nipple of the pistol, and let me aim. Meanwhile I
had often to bear heavy crosses.</p>

<p>"How the boy holds the pistol!" said he. "Hum!
like a barber. How couldst thou quench a candle, unless
as an old man quenches it in church? Thou shouldst be
a priest to repeat Hail Marys, and not be a soldier."</p>

<p>In his own way he taught us his military art of other
days. Often after dinner I and my brother learned to
march under his eye, and with us marched Father Ludvik,
who marched very ridiculously.</p>

<p>Then Mikolai looked at him with a frown, and, though
he feared the priest more than any one, he could not restrain
himself.</p>

<p>"Hei!" said he, "but his grace marches just like an
old cow."</p>

<p>I, as the elder, was oftener under his command, so
I suffered most. But when I was sent to school old
Mikolai cried as if the greatest misfortune had happened.
My father and mother said that he became more peevish,
and annoyed them two weeks.</p>

<p>"They took the child and carried him away," said he.
"And if he dies! Uu! u! But what does he want of
schools? Isn't he the heir? Will he study Latin?
<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
They want to turn him into a Solomon. What folly!
The child has gone off, gone off, and crawl, thou old man,
into corners and look for what thou hast not lost. The
deuce knows why 'tis done."</p>

<p>I remember when I came home for the first holidays.
All in the house were sleeping yet. It was just dawning;
the morning was cold and snowy. The squeaking of the
well-sweep in the farm-yard and the barking of dogs interrupted
the silence. The blinds of the house were
closed, but the windows in the kitchen were gleaming
with a bright light which gave a rosy color to the snow
near the wall. I had come home tired and gloomy with
fear in my soul, since the first rank which I had received
was nothing in particular. This happened because I was
helpless till I had found my place, till I had grown accustomed
to routine and school discipline. I feared my
father; I feared the severe, silent face of the priest, who
had brought me from Warsaw. There was no consolation
from any side. At last I saw the door of the kitchen
open and old Mikolai, with his nose red from cold, wading
through the snow with pots of steaming cream on
a tray. When he saw me he cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, golden Panich! my dearest!"</p>

<p>And then he put down the tray quickly, turned over both
pots, caught me around the neck and began to press and
kiss me. Thenceforward he always called me Panich.</p>

<p>For two entire weeks after that he could not forgive
me that cream: "A man is carrying cream for himself
quietly, and the boy comes along. He picked out his
hour accurately," etc.</p>

<p>My father was going to flog me, or at least he promised
to do so, because of the two moderate marks which I had
brought, one for penmanship, the other for German; but
my tears and promises of improvement on one hand, the
<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
intercession of my dear mother on the other, and finally,
the troubles raised by Mikolai, prevented it. Mikolai did
not know what kind of creature penmanship was, and
to punish one for German&mdash;that he would not even
listen to.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "is the boy a Lutheran, or some
Schwab? Did the lord colonel know how to speak
German? or does the lord himself [here he turned to
my father] know how to speak it? We met the Germans
at&mdash; What is the name of the place? At Leipzig,
and the devil knows wherever we attacked them we
didn't talk German, but they showed us their backs
right away."</p>

<p>Old Mikolai had one more peculiarity: he spoke
rarely of his former expeditions, but when in moments of
special good humor he did so, he lied as if possessed. He
did not do this through bad faith; in his old head perhaps
facts were mixed up, and grew to fantastic proportions.
Whatever military exploits he had heard of during youth
he appropriated to himself and my grandfather, his colonel.
And he believed sacredly all that he said.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the barn, while overseeing peasants
working out their dues in threshing wheat, he would begin
to narrate; the men would stop work, and, resting on
their flails, listen with lips open in wonderment. Then
he would notice them and shout,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why do ye turn mouths on me as big as cannon?"</p>

<p>And again was heard,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lupu! Tsupu! Lupu! Tsupu!"</p>

<p>The sound of flails was heard for some time on the
straw, but after a while Mikolai would begin again,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My son writes me that he has just been made general
by the Queen of Palmyra. He has a good place there, high
pay, but there are terrible frosts in that country&mdash;" etc.
<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
</p>

<p>I may mention that the old man had no success with
his children. He had a son, it is true, but a great good-for-nothing,
who, when he grew up, made Lord knows
what trouble; finally he went into the world and disappeared
without trace; and Mikolai's daughter, in her
time a wonder of a girl, was giddy with all the officials,
as many as there were in the village, and finally died,
after giving the world a daughter. That daughter was
called Hania. She was about my age, beautiful, but
delicate. I remember that often we played soldier.
Hania was the drummer, but a nettle to our enemies.
She was good and mild as an angel. A grievous fate
awaited her in the world, but those are memories which
do not concern us at present.</p>

<p>I return to the old man's narratives. Once I heard
him tell how on a time the horses of the Uhlans stampeded
in Mariampol. Eighteen thousand of them rushed
in through the gates of Warsaw. "How many people
they trampled to death," said he, "what a day of judgment
there was till they were caught, it is easy to imagine."
Another time he told, not in the barn, however,
but to us all in the mansion, the following,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did we fight well? Why shouldn't we fight well? I
remember once there was war with the Austrians; I was
standing in the rank, in the rank, I say, and up to me
rides the commander-in-chief, as if to give a message from
the Austrians, that is, from the opposite side. 'Ei, thou
Suhovolski,' said he, 'I know thee! If we could only
catch thee we should finish the whole war.'"</p>

<p>"But didn't he say anything about the colonel?"
asked my father.</p>

<p>"Of course! for he said expressly, 'thee and the
colonel.'"</p>

<p>Father Ludvik got impatient and said,
<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"But thou, Mikolai, tellest lies as if thou wert getting
special pay for them."</p>

<p>The old man frowned and would have retorted; but he
feared Father Ludvik and respected him, so he said nothing;
but after a while, wishing somehow to straighten the
affair, he continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Father Seklutski, our chaplain, told me the same.
Once when I got a bayonet thrust from the Austrians
under the twelfth, I meant to say the fifth rib, I was in a
bad state. Ha! thought I, it is necessary to die, so I
confessed all my sins to the Lord God Almighty before
Father Seklutski. Father Seklutski listened and listened;
at last he said, 'Fear God, Mikolai, thou hast told
me all the lies thou knowest.' And I said: 'Maybe, for
I don't remember any more.'"</p>

<p>"And they cured thee?"</p>

<p>"Cured! How could they cure me? I cured myself.
I mixed right away two charges of powder in a quart of
vodka and swallowed it for the night. Next morning I
woke up as sound as a fish."</p>

<p>I should have heard more of these narratives and
recorded them, but Father Ludvik, I know not why, forbade
Mikolai "to turn my head," as he declared, "completely."
Poor Father Ludvik, as a priest and a quiet
village dweller, did not know first, that every youth
whom a storm casts out of his quiet, native corner
into the wide arena of the world must have his head
turned more than once, and second, that it is not old
servants and their narratives that turn them, but some
one else.</p>

<p>For that matter the influence of Mikolai on us could
not be harmful; on the contrary, the old man watched
over us and our conduct very carefully and sternly.
He was a conscientious man in the full sense of that
<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
word. From his military days one fine characteristic
remained with him: conscientiousness and accuracy in
carrying out orders.</p>

<p>One winter, as I remember, the wolves inflicted enormous
damage; they grew so bold that in the night a few of them
came to the village, and then some tens of them. My
father, a born hunter, wanted to arrange a great hunt;
but since he was anxious that the command of it should
be taken by our neighbor, Pan Ustrytski, a renowned
destroyer of wolves, he wrote a letter to him, and calling
Mikolai said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My tenant is going to the town; let Mikolai go with
him, get out on the road near Ustrytsi, and give this letter
to Pan Ustrytski. But it is necessary to bring me an
answer. Do not come back without an answer."</p>

<p>Mikolai took the letter, got in with the tenant, and they
drove off. In the evening the tenant returned; Mikolai
was not with him. My father thought that perhaps he
would spend the night in Ustrytsi and return in the
morning. A day passed, no Mikolai; a second day passed,
nothing of him; a third, no sign of him. There was
lamentation in the house. My father, fearing that wolves
had attacked him on the way home, sent people to search
for the man. They searched, but not a trace could
they find. They sent to Ustrytsi. In Ustrytsi it was said
that he had been there, had not found Pan Ustrytski; that
he had inquired where he was, then borrowed four rubles
from the lackey and gone, it was unknown whither.
What can all this mean? thought we.</p>

<p>Next day messengers came from other villages with information
that they had not found him anywhere. We
had begun to mourn for him when on the sixth evening
my father, who was making dispositions in the chancery,
heard all at once, outside the door, the wiping of feet,
<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
and hawking and grumbling in a low voice, by which he
recognized Mikolai immediately.</p>

<p>In fact, it was Mikolai, chilled through, tired, thin,
with icicles hanging from his mustaches, almost unlike
himself.</p>

<p>"Mikolai! But fear God! what hast thou been doing
all this time?"</p>

<p>"What have I been doing, what have I been doing?"
muttered Mikolai. "What was I to do? I did not find
Pan Ustrytski at home, I went to Bzin. In Bzin they
told me, deuce take it, that Pan Ustrytski had gone to
Karalovka. I went there too. He had gone from Karalovka,
also. But isn't he free to warm strange corners?
Isn't he a lord? Besides, he does not travel on foot.
'Very well,' said I, and from Karalovka I went to the
capital, for they said that he was in the district capital.
And what business had he in the capital, was he the
mayor? He went to the government town. Was I to
return? I went to the government town and gave him
the letter."</p>

<p>"Well, did he give thee an answer?"</p>

<p>"He did, and he didn't. He gave it, but he laughed
so that I could see his back teeth. 'Thy lord,' said he,
asks me to a hunt on Thursday, and thou givest me this
letter on the following Monday. The hunt is over now.'
And he laughed again. Here is the letter. Why shouldn't
he laugh?"</p>

<p>"But what hast thou eaten all this time?"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it if I haven't eaten anything since
yesterday? Do I suffer hunger here? Or are the spoons
stingy of food with me? If I haven't eaten, I shall
eat."</p>

<p>After that no one gave unconditional commands to
Mikolai, but as often as he was sent anywhere we told
<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
him what to do in case he did not find the person at
home.</p>

<p>Some months later Mikolai went to a fair at a neighboring
town to buy horses, for he knew horses perfectly.
In the evening the manager came to say that Mikolai
had brought the horses, but had come back beaten and
was ashamed to appear. My father went immediately to
Mikolai,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is the matter with thee, Mikolai?"</p>

<p>"I had a fight!" he blurted out briefly.</p>

<p>"Be ashamed, old man. Thou wilt pick quarrels in a
market? Thou hast no sense. Old, but a fool! Dost
thou know that I would discharge another man for such
a trick? Be ashamed. It must be that thou wert drunk.
So thou art spoiling my people, instead of giving an
example."</p>

<p>My father was really angry, and when he was angry
he did not trifle. But this was the wonder, that Mikolai,
who on such occasions did not forget the tongue in his
mouth, was as silent as a log this time. Evidently the
old man had grown stubborn. Others asked him in
vain how it had happened and what was the question.
He merely snorted at one, and said not a word to the
other.</p>

<p>But they had annoyed him in earnest. Next morning
he was so sick that we had to send for the doctor. The
doctor was the first man to explain the affair. A week
before my father had quarrelled with his overseer; the
man ran away on the following day. He betook himself
to a certain Pan Zoll, a German, a great enemy of my
father, and took service. At the fair were Pan Zoll, our
former overseer, and Pan Zoll's servants, who had driven
fat cattle to the fair to be sold.</p>

<p>Pan Zoll saw Mikolai first; he approached his wagon
<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
and fell to abusing my father. Mikolai called him a
traitor, and when Pan Zoll uttered new outrages against
my father, Mikolai retorted with the handle of his whip.
Then the overseer and Zoll's servants rushed at Mikolai
and beat him till he was bloody.</p>

<p>When my father heard this story tears came to his eyes.
He could not forgive himself for having scolded Mikolai,
who had been silent about the whole affair purposely.</p>

<p>When Mikolai recovered my father went to reproach
him. The old man at first would not confess anything,
and grumbled according to his habit; but afterward he
grew tender, and he and my father cried like two beavers.
Next my father challenged Zoll for the affair, and a duel
was fought which that German remembered for many
a day.</p>

<p>But had it not been for the doctor, Mikolai's devotion
would have remained unknown. Mikolai had hated that
doctor for a long time. The cause was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I had a beautiful and youthful aunt, my father's sister,
who lived with us. I loved her greatly, for she was as
good as she was beautiful, and it did not astonish me
that all loved her, and among others the doctor, a man
who was young, wise, and exceedingly respected in that
whole region. At first Mikolai liked the doctor, said
that he was a clever fellow and rode well; but when the
doctor began to visit us with evident intentions regarding
Aunt Marynia, Mikolai's feelings toward him changed
beyond recognition. He began to be polite, but cold to
him as to a man utterly strange. Formerly he would
scold even him. When on some occasion he had sat too
long with us, Mikolai when preparing him for the road
grumbled: "What is the good of knocking around in the
night? That serves nothing. Has any one ever seen the
like!" Now he ceased to scold, and was as silent as if
<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
turned to stone. The honest doctor understood soon
what it meant, and, though he smiled kindly as before at
the old man, still, I think that in his soul it must have
annoyed him.</p>

<p>Happily for the young Esculapius Aunt Marynia cherished
for him feelings directly opposite those of Mikolai.
On a certain evening, when the moon was lighting the
hall very nicely, the odor of jasmine came in through the
open window. Aunt Marynia was singing at the piano
"Io questa notte sogno." Doctor Stanislav approached
and asked in a quivering voice, if she thought that he
could live without her. Evidently aunt expressed her
doubts on this subject; then followed mutual vows, the
calling of the moon to witness, and all things of that sort,
which are done usually in such cases.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Mikolai came in just that moment to
call them to tea. When he saw what was happening, he
ran at once to my father, and since my father was not
at the house, for he was walking around the buildings of
the estate, he went to my mother, who with her usual
kindly smile prayed him not to interfere in the matter.</p>

<p>The confused Mikolai was silent, gnawing himself
internally during the rest of the evening; but when my
father before going to bed went once more to the chancery
to write some letters, Mikolai followed him, and stopping
at the door began to cough significantly and knock his
feet together.</p>

<p>"What does Mikolai wish?" asked my father.</p>

<p>"But that&mdash;What do they call it?&mdash;I wanted to
ask if it is true that our young lady is going to take&mdash;a
wife&mdash;I wanted to say going to take a husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What of it?"</p>

<p>"But it cannot be true that the young lady is going to
marry that&mdash;barber?"
<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
</p>

<p>"What barber? Has Mikolai gone mad?&mdash; And must
he push in his three coppers everywhere?"</p>

<p>"But the young lady, is she not our young lady; is
she not the daughter of the lord colonel? The lord
colonel would never have permitted this. Is not the
young lady worthy of an heir and a lord of lords?
But the doctor, with permission, who is he? The young
lady will expose herself to the ridicule of people."</p>

<p>"The doctor is a wise man."</p>

<p>"Wise or not wise, is it few doctors that I have seen?
They used to go through the camp and circle around in
the army staff; but when it came to anything, a battle,
for instance, they were not there. Didn't the lord
colonel call them 'lancet fellows'? While a man is well
the doctor won't touch him, but when he is lying half
alive, then the doctor will go at him with his lancet. It
is no trick to cut up a man when he cannot defend himself,
for he has nothing in his hand. But try to cut him when
he is well, and has a gun. Oi yei! A great thing to go
over people's bones with a knife! There is no good in
that! But the lord colonel would rise out of his grave if
he knew of this. What kind of a soldier is a doctor?
Or is such a man an heir? This cannot be! The young
lady will not marry him. That's not according to command.
Who is he to aspire to the young lady?"</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Mikolai the doctor not only aspired
to the young lady, but even got her. Half a year later
the wedding took place, and the colonel's daughter,
covered with floods of her relatives' tears, and tears of
the house-servants in general, but of Mikolai in particular,
went away to share the fate of the doctor.</p>

<p>Mikolai did not cherish any feeling of offence against
her, for he could not, since he loved her so much; but he
would not forgive the doctor. He hardly ever mentioned
<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
his name, and in general tried not to speak of him. I
may say in passing that Aunt Marynia was most happy
with Doctor Stanislav.</p>

<p>After a year God gave them a beautiful boy, after
another year a girl, and so on in turn, as if it had been
written down. Mikolai loved those children as his own;
he carried them in his arms, fondled them, kissed them,
but that there was a certain vexation in his heart because
of the <i>m&eacute;salliance</i> of Aunt Marynia I noticed more than
once.</p>

<p>We had assembled one Christmas eve, when suddenly
the rumble of a carriage was heard on the road. We
always looked for a number of relatives, therefore my
father said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let Mikolai look out and see who is coming."</p>

<p>Mikolai went out, and returned soon with delight in
his face.</p>

<p>"The young lady is coming!" cried he, from a distance.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" inquired my father, though he knew
whom Mikolai meant.</p>

<p>"The young lady."</p>

<p>"What young lady?"</p>

<p>"Our young lady."</p>

<p>She was a sight, that young lady, when she came into
the room with three children. A pretty young lady! But
the old man in his fashion called her "the young lady"
and nothing else.</p>

<p>At last his repugnance to Doctor Stanislav came to an
end. Hania fell terribly ill of typhus. That for me too
was a great affliction, since Hania was about my age and
my only playmate, and I loved her almost as a sister.
Doctor Stanislav hardly left her room for three days. The
old man, who loved Hania with all the strength of his soul,
went around during the time of her illness as if poisoned;
<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
he neither ate nor drank, he just sat at the door of her
room. To her bed no one was permitted to go except my
mother. The old man chewed the hard iron pain which
was tearing his breast. His was a soul of strong temper,
as well for bodily toil as for blows of misfortune; still it
almost bent under the weight of despair near the bed of
that single grandchild. At last, after many days of
mortal fear, Doctor Stanislav opened the door of the sick
girl's room quietly, and with a face beaming with happiness,
whispered to those waiting his sentence in the next
room, one little phrase: "Saved." The old man could
not endure; he bellowed like a bison and threw himself
at the doctor's feet, merely repeating with sobs: "Benefactor,
my benefactor!"</p>

<p>Hania recovered quickly. After that it was clear that
Doctor Stanislav had become an eye in the old man's
head.</p>

<p>"A clever man!" repeated he, stroking his mustaches,
"a clever man. And sits well on horseback. Without
him, Hania&mdash; Oh! I will not even mention it&mdash; A
charm on a dog!"</p>

<p>In a year or so after this event the old man began
to fail. His straight and powerful figure bent. He became
very decrepit, he ceased to grumble and lie. At
last, when he had reached almost ninety years he became
perfectly childish. All he did was to make snares for
birds; he kept a number of birds in his room, especially
titmice.</p>

<p>Some days before death he did not recognize people;
but on the very day of his decease the dying lamp of his
mind gleamed up once more with bright light. I remember
this because my parents were abroad then, for my
mother's health. On a certain evening I was sitting
before the fire with my younger brother, Kazio, and the
<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
priest, who had also grown old. The winter wind with
clouds of snow was striking at the window. Father
Ludvik was praying; I, with Kazio's help, was preparing
weapons for the morrow's hunt on fresh snow. All at
once they told us that old Mikolai was dying. Father
Ludvik went immediately to the domestic chapel for the
sacrament. I hurried with all speed to the old man.
He was lying on the bed, very pale, yellow, and almost
stiffening, but calm and with presence of mind.</p>

<p>That bald head was beautiful, adorned with two scars:
the head of an old soldier and an honest man. The
candle cast a funereal gleam on the walls of the room.
In the corners chirped tame titmice. With one hand
the old man pressed the crucifix to his breast; his other
was held by Hania, who was as pale as a lily, and she
covered it with kisses.</p>

<p>Father Ludvik came in and the confession began; then
the dying man asked for me.</p>

<p>"My master is not here, nor my beloved mistress,"
whispered he, "therefore it is grievous for me to die.
But you, my golden Panich, the heir&mdash;be a guardian to
this orphan&mdash;God will reward you. Be not angry&mdash; If
I have offended&mdash;forgive me. I was bitter, but I
was faithful."</p>

<p>Roused again suddenly he called in a strange voice, and
in haste, as if breath failed him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pan!&mdash;Heir!&mdash;my orphan!&mdash;O God&mdash;into Thy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hands I commend the soul of this valiant soldier,
this faithful servant and honest man!" said Father
Ludvik, solemnly.</p>

<p>The old man was no longer alive.</p>

<p>We knelt down, and the priest began to repeat prayers
for the dead, aloud.</p>

<p>Nearly twenty years have passed since that time.
<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
On the tomb of the honest servant the heather of the
cemetery has grown vigorously.</p>

<p>Gloomy times came. A storm swept away the sacred
and quiet fire of my village. To-day Father Ludvik is in
the grave, Aunt Marynia is in the grave; I earn with
the pen my bitter daily bread, and Hania&mdash;</p>

<p>Hei! tears are flowing!</p>

<h2>HANIA.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">WHEN old Mikolai on his death-bed left Hania to
my guardianship and conscience, I was sixteen
years of age; she was younger by almost a year, and was
also just emerging from childhood.</p>

<p>I had to lead her from the bed of her dead grandfather
almost by force, and we both went to my father's domestic
chapel. The doors of the chapel were open, and
before the old Byzantine image of the Mother of God two
candles were burning. The gleam of these lighted but
faintly the darkness on the altar. We knelt down, one
at the side of the other. She, broken by sorrow, wearied
by sobbing, sleeplessness, and grief, rested her poor little
head on my arm, and so we remained there in silence.
The hour was late; in the hall adjoining the chapel, the
cuckoo called hoarsely on the old Dantiz clock the second
hour after midnight. Deep silence everywhere, broken
only by the painful sighs of Hania, and by the distant
sound of the snow-bearing wind, which at times shook
the leaden window-sash in the chapel. I did not dare to
speak one word of solace; I merely drew her toward me,
as her guardian, or her elder brother. But I could not
pray; a thousand impressions and feelings shook my heart
and head, various images swept before my eyes, but gradually
out of that whirlpool one thought and one feeling
emerged,&mdash;namely, that this pale face with closed eyes,
<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
this defenceless, poor little creature resting on my arm,
had become to me now a dear sister for whose sake I
would give my life, and for whose sake, should the need
come, I would throw down the gauntlet to the whole
world.</p>

<p>My brother, Kazio, appeared now and knelt down
behind us, next Father Ludvik and a few of the servants.
We said our evening prayers, according to daily
custom: Father Ludvik read the prayers aloud, we repeated
them, or answered the litany; the dark face of the
Mother of God, with two sabre-cuts on her cheek, looked
at us kindly. She seemed to take part in our family
cares and afflictions, in our happiness or misfortune, and
bless all who were assembled at her feet.</p>

<p>During prayers, when Father Ludvik began to commemorate
the dead, for whom we repeated usually "Eternal
rest," and connected with them the name of Mikolai,
Hania sobbed aloud again; and I made a vow in my soul,
that I would accomplish sacredly the duties which the
deceased had imposed on me, even had I to accomplish
them at the cost of the greatest sacrifice.</p>

<p>This was the vow of a young enthusiast who did not
understand yet either the possible greatness of the sacrifices
or the responsibility, but who was not without
noble impulses and sensitive transports of soul.</p>

<p>After evening prayer we parted to go to rest. On the
old housekeeper, Vengrosia, I imposed the duty of conducting
Hania to the chamber which she was to occupy
in future,&mdash;not to the wardrobe chamber, as hitherto,&mdash;and
to stay the whole night with her. Kissing the
orphan affectionately, I went to the business house, where
I, Kazio, and Father Ludvik had rooms, and which in the
main house we called the station. I undressed and lay
down in bed. In spite of my grief for Mikolai, whom I
<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
had loved sincerely, I felt proud and almost happy in
my r&ocirc;le of guardian. It raised me in my own eyes, that
I, a boy of sixteen, was to be the support of a weak and
helpless being. I felt full grown. "Thou wert not mistaken,
thou honest old soldier," thought I, "in thy young
lord and the heir; in good hands hast thou placed the
future of thy grandchild, and thou mayst rest quietly
in thy grave."</p>

<p>In truth, I was at peace touching Hania's future.
The thought that she would grow up in time, and
that I should have to give her in marriage, did not
come to my head then. I thought that she would stay
with me always, surrounded with attention as a sister,
beloved as a sister, sad perhaps, but in peace. According
to ancient custom the first son received more than five
times as much property as younger members of the
family. The younger sons and daughters on their part
respected this custom, and never rebelled against it.
Though in our family there was no legal primogeniture,
I was the first son of the family, and therefore the
greater part of the property would be mine; hence,
though only a student yet, I looked on the property as
my own. My father was among the richest proprietors
of that region. Our family was not distinguished, it is
true, by the wealth of magnates, but by that large oldtime
nobility-wealth which gave bread to be waded
through; a calm life and plenty in the native nest until
death. I was to be comparatively wealthy, hence I looked
with calmness both on my future and Hania's, knowing
that whatever fate was awaiting her she would always
find refuge and support with me whenever she needed
them.</p>

<p>I fell asleep with these thoughts. On the following
morning I began to give effect to the guardianship. But
<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
in what a ridiculous and childish manner I did it! Still
when I recall the whole matter to-day I cannot resist a
certain feeling of tenderness.</p>

<p>When Kazio and I came to breakfast we found at table
Father Ludvik, Madame d'Yves, our governess, and also
my two little sisters, who were sitting on high cane chairs
as usual, swinging their feet and prattling joyously.</p>

<p>I sat down with uncommon dignity in my father's
arm-chair, and casting the eye of a dictator on the
table I turned to the serving lad and said in a sharp,
commanding tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bring a plate for Panna Hania."</p>

<p>The word "Panna" I emphasized purposely. This had
never happened before. Hania ate usually in the wardrobe
chamber, for though my mother wished her to sit
with us, old Mikolai would never permit it, saying:
"What good in that? Let her have respect for lordship.
What more does she need?" Now I introduced a new
custom. The honest Father Ludvik smiled, covering his
smile with a pinch of snuff and a silk handkerchief;
Pani d'Yves made a grimace, for in spite of her good
heart, she was an inveterate aristocrat, being a descendant
of an ancient noble family of France. The serving
boy, Franek, opened his mouth widely and gazed at me
with astonishment.</p>

<p>"A plate for Panna Hania! Hast thou heard?" repeated
I.</p>

<p>"I obey, great mighty lord," answered Franek, who
was impressed evidently by the tone in which I spoke.</p>

<p>To-day I confess that the great mighty lord was
barely able to suppress the smile of satisfaction called
to his lips by that title, given him for the first time in
life. Dignity, however, did not permit the great mighty
lord to smile.
<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
</p>

<p>Meanwhile the plate was ready. In a moment the door
opened and Hania entered, dressed in a black robe, which
the maid-servant and housekeeper had prepared for her
during the night. She was pale, with traces of tears in
her eyes; her long golden tresses flowed down over her
dress and ended in ribbons of black crape entwined
among the strands of hair.</p>

<p>I rose, and hastening to the orphan conducted her to
the table. My efforts and all that splendor seemed to
embarrass her, confusing and tormenting the child; but
I did not understand then that in time of grief a quiet,
lonely, uninhabited corner with rest are worth more
than the noisy ovations of friends, even if they come
from the kindest heart. So in best faith I was tormenting
Hania with my guardianship, thinking that I was
carrying out my task perfectly. Hania was silent, and
only from time to time did she answer my questions as
to what she would eat and drink.</p>

<p>"Nothing, I beg the favor of the lord's son."</p>

<p>I was pained by that "I beg the favor of the lord's
son," all the more, that Hania had been more confidential
with me and had called me simply Panich (lord's son).
But just the r&ocirc;le which I had played since yesterday,
and the changed relations in which I had placed her,
made Hania more timid and submissive.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast I took her aside.</p>

<p>"Hania, remember that hereafter thou art my sister.
Never say to me, 'I beg the favor of the lord's son.'"</p>

<p>"I will not; I beg the fa&mdash;I will not, Panich."</p>

<p>I was in a strange position. I walked through the
room with her, and did not know what to say. Gladly
would I have consoled her, but to do that I should have
to mention Mikolai and his death of the day before; that
would have brought Hania to tears, and would have
<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
been merely a renewal of her suffering. So I finished
with this, that we sat down on a low sofa at the end of
the room, the child rested her head on my shoulder, and
I began to stroke her golden hair.</p>

<p>She nestled up to me really as to a brother, and perhaps
that sweet feeling of trust which rose in her heart
called fresh tears to her eyes. She wept bitterly; I consoled
her as best I could.</p>

<p>"Thou art weeping again, Hania," said I. "Thy grandfather
is in heaven, and I shall try&mdash;"</p>

<p>I could not continue, for tears gathered in my eyes.</p>

<p>"Panich, may I go to grandfather?" whispered she.</p>

<p>I knew that the coffin had been brought, and that just
in that moment they were placing Mikolai's corpse in it.
I did not wish Hania to approach the body till all had
been arranged. I went alone.</p>

<p>On the way I met Pani d'Yves, whom I begged to
wait for me, as I wished to speak with her a moment.
After I had given final orders touching the burial, and
had prayed before the remains of Mikolai, I returned to
the French woman, and after a few introductory words
asked her if in a certain time, when the first weeks of
mourning had passed, she would give Hania lessons in
French and music.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Henri," answered Pani d'Yves, who evidently
was angry because I was ordering everything, like
a gray goose in the sky, "I would most willingly, for I
love that maiden much; but I do not know whether it
lies within the designs of your parents, as also I do not
know whether they will consent to the position which
you are trying, of your own will, to give this little girl in
your family. Not too much zeal, Monsieur Henri."</p>

<p>"She is under my guardianship," said I, haughtily, "and
I am answerable for her."
<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
</p>

<p>"But I am not under your guardianship, therefore you
will permit me to wait till your parents return."</p>

<p>The French woman's resistance angered me, but I succeeded
incomparably better with Father Ludvik. The
honest priest, who earlier had been teaching Hania, not
only favored her further and broader education, but
moreover praised me for my zeal.</p>

<p>"I see," said he, "that thou art putting thyself sincerely
to thy task, though thou art young and a child
yet. This is to thy praise; only remember to be as
persistent as thou art zealous."</p>

<p>And I saw that the priest was satisfied with me. The
r&ocirc;le of lord of the house, which I had taken, amused
rather than angered him. The old man saw that there
was much childishness in my conduct, but that the
motives were honest; hence he was proud of me, and
gratified that the seed which he had cast into my soul
had not been lost. Moreover, the old priest loved me
greatly. As to me, on approaching manhood I won him
as much as I had feared him during childhood. He had
a weakness for me, hence he let himself be led. Hania
too he loved, and he was glad to improve her condition
in so far as it lay in his power. From him, therefore, I
met not the least opposition.</p>

<p>Pani d'Yves had really a good heart, and also met
Hania with tenderness, though she was a little angry
with me. Indeed, the orphan had no cause to complain
of the lack of loving hearts. Our servants began to
treat her differently, not as an associate, but as a young
lady. The will of the first son in the family, even if a
child, was greatly respected among us. This my father
exacted. From the will of the first son there was a right
of appeal to the old lord and lady, but no one dared to
oppose this will without being authorized. It was also
<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
not in order to address the first son otherwise than as
"Panich" (lord's son) from his earliest years. The servants,
as well as the younger members of the family, were
trained in respect for the Panich, and this respect remained
with him during life. "The family is upheld
by this," said my father; and in fact because of this
respect the voluntary constitution of the family, by
virtue of which the eldest son had more property than
the younger, was kept up from of old, though not resting
on law. That was a family tradition, passing from
generation to generation. People were accustomed to
look on me as their future lord; and even old Mikolai,
to whom everything was permitted, and who alone called
me by name, could not resist this feeling to a certain
extent.</p>

<p>My mother had a medicine room in the house, and
visited the sick herself. In time of cholera she passed
whole nights in cottages in company with the doctor,
exposing herself to death; but my father, who trembled
for her, did not prohibit her, repeating, "Duty, duty."
Moreover, my father himself, though exacting, gave
assistance. More than once he remitted arrears of labor;
notwithstanding his innate impulsiveness, he forgave
faults easily; frequently he paid debts for villagers,
conducted weddings, was godfather to children; he commanded
us to respect the peasants; to old tenants he answered
with his hat,&mdash;nay, more, he called for their advice
frequently. It is not possible to tell how attached the
peasants were to our whole family; of this they gave
convincing proofs afterward.</p>

<p>I mention these things, first, to show exactly how we
live and lived; second, to show that in making Hania a
lady I did not meet much difficulty. The greatest passive
resistance I met in herself, for the child was too
<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
timid, and reared in excessive respect for the "lordships"
by Mikolai himself, to be reconciled easily with
her fate.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">MIKOLAI'S funeral took place three days after his
death. Our neighbors appeared in rather large
numbers, wishing to honor the memory of the old man,
who, though a servant, was respected and loved universally.
We buried him in our family vault, and his coffin
was placed near the coffin of my grandfather, the colonel.
During the ceremony I did not leave Hania for an instant.
She had come with me in the sleigh, and I wished
that she should return with me; but Father Ludvik sent
me to invite the neighbors from the cemetery to our
house to warm and strengthen themselves. Meanwhile
my comrade and friend, Mirza Selim Davidovich, occupied
himself with Hania. He was the son of Mirza
Davidovich, a neighbor of my father; he was of Tartar
origin and a Mohammedan, but his ancestors had lived
in our neighborhood from remote times and enjoyed
citizenship and nobility. I had to sit with the Ustrytskis;
Hania went with Pani d'Yves and Selim to another
sleigh. I saw the honest young fellow cover her with
his own fur, then take the reins from the driver and
shout at the horses; they flew on like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>On returning to the house Hania went to weep in her
grandfather's chamber. I could not hurry after her, for
I had to receive the guests in company with Father
Ludvik.</p>

<p>Finally all went away except Selim; he was to pass
with us the rest of the Christmas holidays, study with
<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
me a little,&mdash;for we were both in the seventh class, and
the examination of <i>maturitas</i> was waiting for us,&mdash;but
still more to ride, to shoot at a mark with pistols, to
fence and to hunt, occupations which we both much
preferred to translating the Annals of Tacitus or the
Cyropedaia of Xenophon.</p>

<p>This Selim was a joyous fellow, a rogue and very mischievous;
passionate as a spark, but sympathetic in the
highest degree. All in the house loved him greatly
except my father, who was angry because the young
Tartar shot and fenced better than I. But Pani d'Yves
lost her head over him because he spoke French like a
Parisian. His mouth was never shut; he retailed gossip
and witticisms, and amused the French woman better
than any of us.</p>

<p>Father Ludvik had some hope of converting him to
the Catholic faith, all the more since the boy jested sometimes
about Mohammed, and would beyond doubt have
rejected the Koran had it not been that he feared his
father, who, out of respect for family traditions, held with
both hands to Mohammed, considering that as a noble
of long standing he preferred to be an oldtime Mohammedan
to a newly made Catholic. Old Davidovich, however,
had no other Turkish or Tartar sympathies. His
ancestors had settled in Lithuania during the time,
perhaps, of Vitold. That was, moreover, a very wealthy
nobility, living from of old in the same place. The
property which they possessed had been given by Yan
Sobieski to Mirza Davidovich, a colonel of light horse,
who performed wonders at Vienna, and whose portrait
was hanging then in Horeli.</p>

<p>I remember that portrait as making a wonderful impression
on me. The colonel was a terrible person; his
face was written over by God knows what sabres, as if
<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
with mystic letters of the Koran. He had a swarthy
complexion, prominent cheek-bones, slanting eyes with
a wonderfully gloomy glitter; they had this peculiarity,
that they looked at you out of the portrait always,
whether you stood straight in front or at either side.</p>

<p>But my comrade, Selim, resembled his ancestors in
nothing. His mother, whom old Davidovich married
in the Crimea, was not a Tartar,&mdash;she came from the
Caucasus. I did not remember her, but people said that
she was a beauty of beauties, and that young Selim
resembled her as much as one drop of water resembles
another.</p>

<p>Ah! he was a wonderful fellow, that Selim! His
eyes had a scarcely discernible slant; they were not
Tartar eyes, though, but the great, dark, pensive, moist
eyes for which Georgian women have gained such renown.
Eyes with such inexpressible sweetness when
calm I had never seen in life, and shall never see
again. He had regular features, as noble as if they had
come from the chisel of a sculptor, a dark but delicate
complexion, lips a trifle full, but red as raspberries, a
sweet smile, and teeth like pearls.</p>

<p>When Selim was fighting with a comrade, for example,
and this happened often enough, his sweetness vanished
like a deceptive nightmare: he became almost terrible;
his eyes seemed to swell out slantingly and gleam like
the eyes of a wolf; the veins in his face distended; his
complexion grew dark; and for a moment the real Tartar
was roused in him, just such a Tartar as those with
whom our ancestors went dancing. This transformation
was short-lived. After a while Selim wept, begged pardon,
kissed, and was forgiven usually. He had the best
of hearts and a great inclination to noble impulses. He
was heedless, however, somewhat frivolous, and a frolicker
<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
of unrestrained temperament. He rode, shot, and fenced
like a master; he had medium success in learning, for
in spite of great gifts he was rather lazy. We loved each
other like brothers, quarrelled frequently, made peace as
often, and our friendship continued unbroken. In vacation
and on all holidays either I spent half the time in
Horeli, or he with us.</p>

<p>And now on his return from Mikolai's funeral, Selim
was to stay with us to the end of the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>When the guests took leave after dinner, it was perhaps
four o'clock in the afternoon. The short winter
day was near its end; the great evening twilight looked
in through the windows; on trees standing near the
house, and hidden with snow covered with a ruddy
gleam, the crows began to caw and flutter. Through the
windows we could see whole flocks of them flying across
the pond from the forest and floating in the evening
light. In the room to which we passed after dinner,
silence prevailed. Pani d'Yves went to her chamber to
tell fortunes by cards, as her habit was; Father Ludvik
walked up and down the room and took snuff; my two
little sisters, butting heads, tangled each other's golden
curls; Hania, Selim, and I were sitting under the window,
on a sofa, looking at the pond on the garden side,
on the forest beyond the pond, and on the vanishing daylight.</p>

<p>Soon it became entirely dark. Father Ludvik went
out to evening prayers; one of my little sisters chased
the other to an adjoining room; we were left alone.
Selim had begun to say something when Hania pushed
up to me all at once and whispered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Panich, something terrifies me. I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Fear not, Haniulka," answered I, drawing her toward
me. "Nestle up to me, this way. Whilst thou art near
<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
me, nothing evil can happen to thee. See, I am not
afraid of anything, and I shall always be able to protect
thee."</p>

<p>That was not true, for whether because of the gloom
which filled the hall, or Hania's words, or the recent
death of Mikolai, I, too, was under some strange
impression.</p>

<p>"Perhaps thou wilt ask to have a light brought?"
said I.</p>

<p>"Yes, Panich."</p>

<p>"Selim, ask Franek to bring a light."</p>

<p>Selim sprang from the sofa, and soon we heard an
uncommon trampling and noise outside the door. The
door opened with a slam; in rushed Franek like a whirlwind,
and behind, grasping his arm, was Selim. Franek
had a stupid and terrified face, for Selim, holding the
boy by the shoulder, was spinning him like a top and
turning round with him. Advancing with that motion
to the sofa, Selim halted, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thy lord commands thee to bring a light, for the
young lady is afraid. Dost wish to bring the light, or
shall I twist thy head off?"</p>

<p>Franek went for the lamp and returned with it in a
moment; but it seemed that the light injured Hania's
eyes, which were red from crying, so Selim quenched
it. We were again in mysterious darkness, and again
silence reigned among us. Soon the moon cast bright
silver light through the window. Evidently Hania was
afraid, for she nestled up to me still more closely, and I
had to hold her hand besides. Selim sat opposite us in
an armchair, and, as his custom was, passed from a noisy
mood into thoughtfulness, and after a while fell to
imagining. Great silence was among us; we were a little
afraid; but it was pleasant there.
<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
</p>

<p>"Let Selim tell us some story," said I, "he tells stories
so well. Shall he, Hania?"</p>

<p>"Let him."</p>

<p>Selim raised his eyes and thought awhile. The moon
lighted clearly his handsome profile. After a time he
began to speak in a quivering, sympathetic, and lowered
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Beyond forests, beyond mountains, lived in the
Crimea a certain kind woman named Lala, who could
soothsay. Once the Sultan was passing her cottage. This
Sultan, who was called Harun, was very rich; he had a
palace of coral with columns of diamonds; the roof of
that palace was of pearls. The palace was so large that it
took a year to go from one end of it to the other. The
Sultan himself wore genuine stars in his turban. The
turban was of sun-rays, and on top of it was a crescent,
which a certain enchanter had cut from the moon and
bestowed on the Sultan. That Sultan was passing near
Lala's cottage, and weeping; he was weeping so, and
weeping, that his tears fell on the road, and wherever a
tear fell a white lily sprang up right away.</p>

<p>"'Why art thou weeping, O Sultan Harun?' asked
Lala.</p>

<p>"'Why should I not weep,' replied Sultan Harun,
'when I have only one daughter, beautiful as the morning
dawn, and I must give her to a black Div with fiery
eyes, who every ye&mdash;'"</p>

<p>Selim stopped suddenly and was silent.</p>

<p>"Is Hania asleep?" whispered he to me.</p>

<p>"No; she is not asleep," answered the girl, with drowsy
voice.</p>

<p>"'How should I not weep,' said Harun the Sultan
to her [continued Selim], when I have only one daughter,
and I must give her to the Div?'
<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
</p>

<p>"'Do not weep, O Sultan,' says Lala; 'sit on the winged
horse and ride to the grotto of Borah. Evil clouds will
chase thee on the road, but throw thou these poppy seeds
at them and directly the clouds will fall asleep.'"</p>

<p>And so Selim went on, and then he stopped a second
time and looked at Hania. The child was now asleep
really. She was very tired and pained, and was sleeping
soundly. Selim and I scarcely dared to breathe lest we
might waken her. Her breathing was even, peaceful,
interrupted only at times by deep sighs. Selim rested
his forehead on his hand and fell into serious thought.
I raised my eyes toward the sky, and it seemed to me
that I was flying away on the wings of angels into
heavenly space. I cannot tell the sweetness which penetrated
me, for I felt that that dear little being was sleeping
calmly and with all confidence on my breast. Some
kind of quiver passed through my whole body,&mdash;something
not of earth; new and unknown voices of happiness
were born in my soul, and began to sing and to play like
an orchestra. Oh, how I loved Hania! How I loved her,
as a brother and a guardian yet, but beyond bound and
measure.</p>

<p>I approached my lips to Hania's hair and kissed it.
There was nothing earthly in that, for I and the kiss
were yet equally innocent.</p>

<p>Selim shivered all at once and woke up from his
pensiveness.</p>

<p>"How happy thou art, Henryk!" whispered he.</p>

<p>"Yes, Selim."</p>

<p>But we could not stay there in that way.</p>

<p>"Let us not wake her, but carry her to her room,"
said Selim.</p>

<p>"I will carry her alone, and do thou just open the
door," answered I.
<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
</p>

<p>I drew my arm carefully from under the head of the
sleeping girl, and laid her on the sofa. Then I took her
carefully in my arms. I was still a youth, but I came of
uncommonly strong stock; the child was small, frail,
and I carried her like a feather. Selim opened the door
to the adjoining chamber, which was lighted, and in that
way we reached the green chamber, which I had destined
to be Hania's room. The bed was already prepared. In
the chimney a good fire was crackling; and near the
chimney, poking the coals, sat old Vengrosia, who, when
she saw me burdened as I was, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, for God's sake! and so the Panich is carrying
the little maid. Wasn't it possible to wake her, and let
her come herself?"</p>

<p>"Let Vengrosia be silent!" said I, angrily. "A young
lady, not 'a maid,' only a young lady; does Vengrosia
hear? The young lady is tired. I beg not to wake
her. Undress her and put her to bed quietly. Let
Vengrosia remember that this is an orphan, and that
we must comfort her with kindness for the loss of her
grandfather."</p>

<p>"An orphan, the poor little thing; an orphan, indeed,"
repeated the honest Vengrosia, with emotion.</p>

<p>Selim kissed the old woman for this, then he returned
for tea.</p>

<p>Selim forgot everything and became frolicsome at tea;
I did not follow his example, however, first, because I
was sad, and second, I judged that it did not become a
serious man, already a guardian, to appear like a child.
That evening Selim raised another storm; this time with
Father Ludvik, because when we were at evening prayers
in the chapel, he flew out to the yard, climbed onto the
low roof of the ice-house, and began to howl. The dogs
of the yard rushed together from all sides and made
<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
such an uproar while accompanying Selim that we could
not say our prayers.</p>

<p>"Have you gone mad, Selim?" asked Father Ludvik.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Father, I was praying in Mohammedan
fashion."</p>

<p>"Do not make sport of any religion, thou rascal!"</p>

<p>"But if I, begging your attention, want to become a
Catholic, only I am afraid of my father, what can I do
with Mohammed?"</p>

<p>The priest, attacked on his weak side, was silent, and
we went to bed. Selim and I had a room together, for
the priest knew that we liked to talk, and did not wish
to hinder us. When I had undressed and saw that Selim
was doing the same without praying, I inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But really, Selim, dost thou never pray?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. If thou wish, I will begin right
away."</p>

<p>And standing in the window he raised his eyes to the
moon, stretched his hands toward it, and began to cry in
a singing voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Allah! Akbar Allah! Allah Kerim!"</p>

<p>Dressed only in white, with his face raised toward the
sky, he was so beautiful that I could not take my eyes
from him.</p>

<p>Then he began to explain,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What shall I do? I do not believe in this prophet of
ours, who would let others have only one wife, but had
as many himself as he pleased. Besides, I tell thee that
I like wine. I am not free to be anything except a Mohammedan,
but I believe in God, and often I pray as I
know how. But do I know anything? I know that
there is a Lord God, and that is the end of the question."</p>

<p>After a while he continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Knowest what, Henryk?"
<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I have splendid cigars. We are children no longer;
let us smoke."</p>

<p>Selim sprang out of bed and got a package of cigars.
We each lighted one, then lay down and smoked in silence,
spitting out of the bed in secret from each other.</p>

<p>"Knowest thou what, Henryk?" said Selim after a
while. "How I envy thee! Thou art really grown up
now."</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"For thou art a guardian already. Oh, if some one
would leave me such a ward to care for!"</p>

<p>"That is not so easy, and, besides, where could another
Hania be found in the world? But knowest what?"
continued I, in the tone of a mature wise man. "I hope
that soon I shall not go to school. A man who has such
obligations at home cannot go to school."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;thou art raving! What! thou wilt not learn
any more? But school is the main thing."</p>

<p>"Thou knowest that I like to study, but duty before
all. Unless my father and mother send Hania to Warsaw
with me."</p>

<p>"They won't even dream of it."</p>

<p>"While I am in the classes, surely not; but when I am
in the University they will. Well, dost thou not know
what a student means?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! That may happen. Thou wilt be her
guardian, and thou wilt marry her."</p>

<p>I sat up in bed.</p>

<p>"Selim, art thou mad?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldst thou not marry her? In school one
is not free to marry; but a student may not only have a
wife, he may have even children," said Selim.</p>

<p>At that moment all the University prerogatives and
<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
privileges did not concern me in the least. Selim's
question illuminated, as with a lightning flash, those
sides of my heart which to me were still dark. A thousand
thoughts, like a thousand birds, flew through my
head all at once. To marry my dear, beloved orphan!
Yes; that was the lightning flash, the new flash of thought
and feelings. It seemed to me that suddenly into the
darkness of my heart some one had brought light. Love,
deep, but brotherly hitherto, had grown rosy on a
sudden from that light and was heated through it by an
unknown warmth. To marry Hania, that bright-haired
angel, my dearest, most beloved Hania. With a weak
voice now and lower, I repeated like an echo,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Selim, art mad?"</p>

<p>"I would lay a wager that thou art in love with her
already," said Selim.</p>

<p>I made no answer; I quenched the light, then seized a
corner of the pillow and began to kiss it.</p>

<p>Yes; I loved her already.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">ON the second or third day after the funeral, my
father came, summoned by a telegram. I trembled
lest he should recall my dispositions touching Hania,
and my forebodings were real to a certain degree. My
father praised me and embraced me for my zeal and conscientiousness
in fulfilling duties; that pleased him
evidently. He repeated even a number of times, "Our
blood!" which he did only when he was much pleased with
me. He did not divine to what extent that zeal was
interested, but my dispositions had not pleased him overmuch.
<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
It may be that the exaggerated statements of
Pani d'Yves moved him toward this a little, though
really in the days following that night in which my
feelings rose to consciousness I made Hania the first
person in the house.</p>

<p>He was not pleased by my project to educate her in
the same way as my sisters.</p>

<p>"I recall and withdraw nothing," said he. "That is
the affair of thy mother. She will determine what she
likes; that is her department. But it is worth while
to think over this: What is best for the girl herself."</p>

<p>"Education, father, will never harm. I have heard
that from thy own mouth more than once."</p>

<p>"True, in the case of a man," answered he, "for the
education of a man gives position, but with a woman it
is different. A woman's education should be in accord
with the position which she is to occupy in life. Such a
girl does not need more than a medium education; she
has no need of French, music, and the like. With a
medium education Hania will find more easily an honest
official for a husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Father!"</p>

<p>He looked at me with astonishment.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?"</p>

<p>I was as red as a beet. The blood almost spurted
through my face. In my eyes it grew dark. To compare
Hania with an official seemed such blasphemy before my
world of imagining that I could not withhold a cry of
indignation. And that blasphemy pained me the more
since it came from the lips of my father. That was the
first cold water thrown by reality on the burning faith of
youth, the first blow aimed by life into the fairy castle of
illusions, the first deceit and disenchantment from the
bitterness of which we defend ourselves with pessimism
<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
and unbelief. But as red-hot iron, when a drop of cold
water falls on it, merely hisses and turns the water into
steam, so the burning soul of a man under the influence
of its first contact with the cold palm of reality, hisses, it
is true, from pain, but soon warms reality itself with its
own heat.</p>

<p>My father's words wounded me at once, therefore, and
wounded me in a wonderful manner, for under their
influence I had a feeling of offence not against my father,
but, as it were, against Hania. In virtue, however, of
that internal resistance which exists only in youth, I
soon threw it as far from my soul as possible, and forever.
My father understood nothing of my enthusiasm, and
ascribed it to excessive devotion to the duties confided to
me, which, moreover, was natural at my time of life, and
which, instead of angering, simply flattered him and weakened
his dislike to the higher education of Hania. I
promised him to write a letter to my mother, who was to
remain abroad a good while yet, and beg her to make
final arrangements in this regard. I do not remember
that I have ever written so long and so heartfelt a letter.
I described the death of old Mikolai, his last words, my
desires, fears, and hopes; I moved vigorously the chord of
compassion which was always quivering in my mother's
heart; I depicted the disquiet of conscience which would
await me beyond doubt, if we should not do for Hania all
that lay in our power,&mdash;in a word, according to my opinion
at that time, my letter was of its kind a real masterpiece,
which must produce its effect. Pacified somewhat by
this, I waited patiently for an answer, which came in two
letters,&mdash;one to me, the other to Pani d'Yves. I had won
the battle at all points. My mother not only agreed
to the higher education of Hania, but enjoined it most
emphatically.
<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
</p>

<p>"I should wish," wrote my kind mother, "in case it
agrees with the will of thy father, that Hania be considered
in every way as belonging to our family. We owe
this to the memory of old Mikolai, to his devotion and
faithfulness."</p>

<p>My triumph then was as great as it was complete, and
Selim shared it with me heartily,&mdash;Selim, whom everything
which touched Hania concerned as much as if he
himself had been her guardian.</p>

<p>It is true that the sympathy which he felt, and the
tenderness which he exhibited for the orphan, began to
anger me a little, all the more since my own relations with
Hania had changed greatly since that memorable night
when I had become conscious of my feelings. When with
her I felt as if convicted; the former heartiness and childlike
intimacy had vanished on my side completely. Barely
a few days before the girl had fallen asleep quietly on my
breast; now at the mere thought of this the hair rose on
my head. A few days before at good-morning and good-night
I kissed her pale lips as a brother would; now the
touch of her hand burned me, or pierced me with a delicious
quiver. I began to honor her as the object of first
love is honored usually; and when the innocent girl,
neither divining nor knowing anything, nestled up to me
as formerly, I was angry in my soul, though not at her; I
looked on myself as sacrilegious.</p>

<p>Love had brought me unknown happiness, but also
unknown suffering. If I had had some one to whom I
could confide my suffering; if I had been able at times to
weep on some one's breast, an act for which I had often a
wonderful desire,&mdash;I should have removed half the weight,
beyond doubt, from my soul. I might have confessed all
to Selim, but I feared his disposition. I knew that he
would feel my words heartily at the first moment; but
<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
who could assure me that next day he would not ridicule
me with the cynicism peculiar to him, and with frivolous
words defile my ideal, which I dared not touch with any
giddy thought? My character had at all times been well
locked up in me; besides, there was one great difference
between me and Selim. I had always been somewhat
sentimental; Selim had not sentiment to the value of a
copper. I could fall in love only when sad, Selim only
when joyous. I concealed my love from every one,
almost from myself, and really no one discovered it. In
a few days, without ever having seen any models, I had
learned instinctively to hide all indications of that love,
such as the confusion which often came on me, and the
blushes with which I was covered when Hania was
mentioned in my presence,&mdash;in a word, I developed
immense cunning, that cunning by the aid of which a
boy sixteen years old will often deceive the most careful
eye watching him. I had not the least design of
confessing my feelings to Hania. I loved her, and that
was sufficient. Only at times, when we were alone, something
urged me to kneel before her and kiss the hem of
her dress.</p>

<p>Selim meanwhile played his mad pranks, laughed, was
witty and joyous for both of us. He was the first to bring
a smile to Hania's face, when once at breakfast he proposed
to Father Ludvik to turn Mohammedan and marry
Pani d'Yves. Neither the French woman, who was rather
easily offended, nor the priest, could get angry with him;
with her he had made himself such a favorite that when
he made eyes at her and laughed, all ended in a slight
scolding and in general merriment. In his treatment of
Hania a certain tenderness and care were evident, but in
this relation too his innate joyousness conquered everything.
He was more confidential with her than I. It was
<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
evident that Hania liked him much, for whenever he entered
the room she was more cheerful. He made continual
sport of me, or rather of my sadness, taking it for the
artificial dignity of one who wishes to be grown up in
a hurry.</p>

<p>"Look, all of you, he will end by becoming a priest,"
said he.</p>

<p>Then I dropped the first thing I could, so as to bend
down for it and hide the blush which covered my face;
but Father Ludvik took snuff and answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"To the honor of God! to the honor of God!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Christmas holidays were over. My faint
hope of remaining at home was not justified in the least.
On a certain evening it was announced to the great
guardian that next morning early he must be ready for
the road. There was need of starting early, for we had
to turn in at Horeli, where Selim was to take farewell of
his father. So we rose at six o'clock in the dark. Ah!
my soul was as gloomy as that cold wintry, windy morning.
Selim was in the worst humor also. As soon as he
had crept out of bed, he declared that the world was
stupid, and most wretchedly ordered; I agreed with this
perfectly. When we had dressed we went from the station
to the house for breakfast. It was dark in the yard;
small flakes of sharp snow, whirled by the wind, struck
our faces. The windows of the dining-room were lighted.
Before the entrance stood the sleigh, in which our things
were packed already; the horses were shaking the bells;
dogs were barking around the sleigh. All this, taken
together, formed, at least for us, a picture so gloomy that
the heart was straitened at sight of it.</p>

<p>On entering the dining-room we found my father and
the priest pacing up and down with serious faces. Hania
was not there. I looked with a throbbing heart toward
<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
the door of the green chamber. Would she come, or
was I to go away without farewell?</p>

<p>Meanwhile my father and the priest fell to giving us
advice and detailing morality. Both began with this,
that at our age there was no need to repeat to us what
labor and learning meant; still both spoke of nothing else.
I listened to everything without the least attention,
chewing toasted bread and swallowing with straitened
throat the heated wine.</p>

<p>All at once my heart beat so powerfully that I could
hardly sit in my chair, for in Hania's room I heard rustling.
The door opened, and out came Pani d'Yves, in a
wrapper, her hair in papers; she pressed my hand warmly.
For the disappointment which she had caused me I
wanted to throw the glass of wine at her head. She
expressed the hope that such good youths would surely
learn perfectly; to this Selim answered that the memory
of the papers in her hair would give him strength and
endurance in study. Hania did not show herself.</p>

<p>It was not destined me, however, to drain the bitter
cup. When we rose from the table Hania came out, looking
drowsy, yet all rosy and with ruffled hair. When I
pressed her hand while wishing good-morning, it was hot.
Immediately it occurred to me that she had a fever because
of my departure, and I played a tender scene in spirit,
but her fever was simply the warmth of sleep. After a
while my father and the priest went for letters to be
delivered in Warsaw. Selim rode out through the door on
an immense dog which had entered the room a moment
earlier. I was left alone with Hania. Tears were coming
to my eyes; from my lips tender and warm words were
rushing forth. I had no intention to confess that I loved
her; but I was urged to say something like this, My dear,
my beloved Hania! and to kiss her hands at the same
<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
time. That was the only convenient moment for such
an outburst, though I might give way to it before people
without drawing the attention of any one; still I did not
dare. I wasted that moment most shamefully. I drew near
to her and stretched out my hand, but I did so awkwardly,
somehow, and unnaturally. "Hania," said I, with a
voice so foreign to me that I drew back at once and was
silent. I had the wish to kiss her cheek; meanwhile she
herself began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My God! how sad it will be without the Panich!"</p>

<p>"I will come at Easter," said I, in a low, strange bass.</p>

<p>"But it is a long time till Easter."</p>

<p>"Not at all long," muttered I.</p>

<p>At that moment Selim rushed in, and after him came
my father, the priest, Pani d'Yves, and some servants.
The words, "To the sleigh! to the sleigh!" sounded in
my ears. We all went to the porch; there my father
and the priest embraced me. When the time came to
take leave of Hania, I had an almost irrestrainable wish
to seize her in my arms and kiss her as of old; but I
could not bring myself to it.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Hania," said I, giving her my hand, but in
my soul a hundred voices were weeping, a hundred most
tender and fondling expressions were on my lips.</p>

<p>I saw on a sudden that the girl was shedding tears,
and with equal suddenness was heard that stubborn Satan
within, that irresistible wish to tear open my own wounds,
which later in life I felt more than once; so, though my
heart was bursting into bits, I said in a cold and rough
voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not cry without reason, my Hania." Then I sat
down in the sleigh.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Selim took farewell of all. Running up
to Hania he seized her two hands, and, though the
<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
girl tried to pull them away, he kissed them wildly,
first one and then the other. Oh, what a wish I had to
beat him off at that moment! When he had kissed
Hania, he sprang into the sleigh. "Move on!" cried
my father. The priest blessed us with the cross for
the road. The driver called "Hetta! ho!" to the horses,
the bells sounded, the snow squeaked under the runners,
and we moved over the road.</p>

<p>"Scoundrel! robber!" said I in my soul. "That is
how thou didst take farewell of thy Hania! Thou wert
disagreeable to her, scolded her for tears of which thou
wert unworthy, tears of an orphan."</p>

<p>I raised the collar of my fur and cried like a little
child in silence, for I was afraid lest Selim should detect
me in tears. It appeared, however, that Selim saw
everything perfectly; but he himself was moved, hence
he said nothing at first. But we had not gone so far as
Horeli when he called,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Henryk!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Thou art blubbering?"</p>

<p>"Let me alone."</p>

<p>Again there was silence between us. But after a while
Selim again said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Henryk!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Thou art blubbering?"</p>

<p>I made no answer; suddenly Selim bent down, took a
handful of snow, raised my cap, spread the snow on my
head, and covered it again, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That will cool thee!"

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">I DID not go home at Easter, for the approaching
examination for <i>maturitas</i> stood in the way. Besides,
my father wished me to pass the preliminary
examination before the beginning of the University year.
He knew that I would not like to work in vacation, and
that beyond doubt I should forget at least one half of what
I had learned in school, so I worked very vigorously.
Besides the ordinary lessons in the gymnasium and the
work for the examination, Selim and I took private
lessons from a student who, as he had entered the University
not long before, knew best what we needed.</p>

<p>This for me was a memorable time, for in it fell
the whole structure of my thoughts and imagining,
reared so laboriously by Father Ludvik, my father, and
the whole atmosphere of our quiet house.</p>

<p>The young student was a radical in every regard.
While explaining the history of Rome, he knew so well
how to explain his disgust and contempt for the great
oligarchy during the reforms of the Gracchi that my
arch-noble convictions were swept away like smoke.
With what profound faith my young teacher declared,
for example, that a man who was soon to occupy the
powerful and in every sense influential position of student
at the University should be free from all "prejudices,"
and not look on anything save with the compassion
of a genuine philosopher.</p>

<p>In general he was of opinion that for the regulation
of the world, and for the exercise of a mighty influence
on all people, a man is best between the eighteenth and
twenty-third year of his life, for later he becomes gradually
an idiot or a conservative.
<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
</p>

<p>Of those who were neither students nor professors of
the University, he spoke with compassion; but he had
ideals, which never left his lips. From him I learned
for the first time of the existence of Moleschotte and
B&uuml;chner,&mdash;two men of science whom he cited oftenest.
One should hear with what ardor our preceptor spoke
of the conquests of science in recent times, of great
truths which the blind superstitious past had avoided,
and which the most recent scholars had raised "from the
dust of oblivion" and announced to the world with unparalleled
courage.</p>

<p>While uttering these opinions he shook his thick,
curly foretop, and smoked an incredible number of
cigarettes, assuring us that he was so trained that it was
all one to him whether he let the smoke out through
his mouth or his nostrils, and that there was not in
Warsaw another man who could smoke in that fashion.
Then he rose usually, put on his cloak, which lacked
more than half its buttons, and declared that he must
hurry, for he had another "little meeting." Saying this,
he winked mysteriously and added that Selim's age
and mine did not permit him to communicate to us
nearer information about this "little meeting," but that
later and without his explanation we should understand
its meaning.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this which would not have pleased
our parents much, the young student had his really
good sides. He understood well what he was teaching
us, and besides he was a real fanatic of science. He
wore boots with holes in them, a threadbare coat, a cap
which was like an old nest; he never had a copper on
his person; but his mind never dwelt on his personal
cares, poverty, want almost. He lived through a passion
for science; of a joyous life for himself he had no thought.
<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
Selim and I looked on him as some higher supernatural
personage, as an ocean of wisdom, as an immovable
weight. We believed sacredly that if any one could
save humanity in case of danger, it was surely he,
that imposing genius, who, beyond doubt, was of this
opinion himself. But we clung to his convictions as to
bird-lime.</p>

<p>As to me, I went farther, perhaps, than even my master.
That was the natural reaction against my previous
education; and, besides, the student had really opened before
me gates to new worlds of knowledge, in comparison
with which the circle of my ideas was very narrow.
Dazzled by these new truths, I had not many thoughts
and fancies to devote to Hania. At first, and immediately
after coming, I did not part with my ideal. The
letters which I received from her fed that fire on the
altar of my heart; but, compared with the ocean of ideas
of the young student, all our village world, so calm and
quiet, began at once to grow little and diminish in my
eyes. Hania's form did not vanish, it is true, but was
enwrapped, as it were, in a light mist.</p>

<p>As to Selim, he advanced also by the earthly road of
violent reforms; but of Hania he thought less, since opposite
our quarters was a window in which sat a schoolgirl
named Yozia. Indeed, Selim began to sigh at her,
and for whole days they looked at each other from
the two windows, like two birds in two cages. Selim
repeated with unshaken certainty, "this one or none."
Frequently it happened that he would lie face and
hands on the bed and study, then throw his book on
the floor, spring up, seize me, and cry, laughing like a
madman,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my Yozia! how I love thee!"</p>

<p>"Go to the plague, Selim!" I would say to him.
<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
</p>

<p>"Oh, it is thou, not Yozia," he would answer roguishly,
and return to his book.</p>

<p>At last came the days of examination. Selim and I passed
both the final examination of the gymnasium and the one
for entrance to the University very favorably; after that
we were as free as birds, but we stayed three days longer
in Warsaw. We used that time for getting students' uniforms,
and for a solemnity which our master considered
indispensable; that is, a feast for three in the first wine-cellar
that we came to.</p>

<p>After the second bottle, when Selim's head and mine
were turning, and when to the cheeks of our master, now
a comrade, a flush came, we were seized by a sudden and
uncommon tenderness, combined with an inclination to
confessions of the heart.</p>

<p>"Well, ye have come out among people, my boys," said
the master, "and the world stands open before you.
Ye can amuse yourselves now, throw away money, play
the lord, fall in love; but I tell you that these are follies.
A life on the surface, without an idea for which a man
lives, toils, and struggles, is folly. But to live wisely
or to live reasonably, and to struggle wisely, one should
look on things soberly. As to me, I think that I look on
them soberly. I believe in nothing which I cannot touch
myself, and I advise the same to you. God knows there
are so many ways of living and thinking in the world,
and all in such confusion, that one needs the devil knows
what kind of head to avoid error. But I hold fast to
science, and that's the end of it. They will not entrap
me with trifles. That life is foolish, over this theme I shall
not break a bottle on any man's head; but we have science.
Had we not, I would shoot myself. Every one has the
right to do that, as I think; and I will shoot myself
surely if I grow bankrupt to that degree. But on my
<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
foundation one will not be bankrupt. Thou wilt be
deceived in everything: fall in love, the woman will
deceive thee; have religion, the moment of doubt will
come; but thou mayst sit quietly till death investigating
the canal of the nutritive infusoria, and wilt
not even notice how on a certain day the world will
stupidly grow somehow and somehow dark to thee, and
then the end,&mdash;the water clock, the portrait in the illustrated
paper, the more or less dull biography, and the
comedy will be over! After that there will be nothing.
I can give you my word on that, my little fellows. Ye
may be bold in believing in no nonsense. Science is my
fiddle-bow; Science is the foundation. Meanwhile all this
has the good side,&mdash;that if thou occupy thyself with such
things, thou mayst go about in broken boots boldly and
sleep on a hay-loft. It will make no difference to thee.
Do ye understand?"</p>

<p>"To the health and honor of science!" cried Selim,
whose eyes were gleaming like coals.</p>

<p>Our master pushed back his immense woolly forelock,
emptied his goblet, then inhaling smoke he let two
enormous currents of it out through his nostrils, and
continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Besides exact sciences&mdash;Selim, thou art drunk!&mdash;besides
exact sciences there is philosophy, and there are ideas.
With these life is filled to the brim. But I prefer exact
sciences. Philosophy, and especially ideal-real philosophy,
I tell you that I revile it. It is guess-work. A man is
pursuing truth, as it were, but pursuing it as a dog pursues
his own tail. In general I cannot endure guess-work.
I love facts. Thou canst not squeeze whey out of water.
As to ideas, that is another thing. For them it is worth
while to lay down one's head; but ye and your fathers travel
by stupid ways. I tell you that. Long life to ideas!"
<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
</p>

<p>We emptied our goblets again. Our forelocks were
steaming. The dark room of the cellar seemed still
darker; the candles on the table burned with a faint
light; smoke hid the pictures on the walls. Outside the
window in the yard an old beggar was singing the pious
hymn, "Holy, heavenly, angelic Lady!" and in the pauses
he played a plaintive minstrel melody on a fiddle. Wonderful
feelings filled my breast. I believed the words of
the master, but I felt that he had not told everything yet
which could fill out one's life. Something was lacking.
A species of melancholy possessed me in spite of myself;
so under the influence of imagination, wine, and momentary
enthusiasm I said in a low voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But women, gentlemen! a loving woman, devoted,
who stops at nothing in life?"</p>

<p>Selim began to sing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i2">
   "Woman is changeable:
  </p>
  <p class="i2">
   Stupid the man who believes in her!"
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Our master looked at me with a peculiar expression.
He was thinking of something else, but soon he shook
himself and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! thou hast shown the tip of the sentimental
ear. Knowest thou, that Selim will go much farther in
the world than thou. The deuce will take thee. Guard
thyself, guard thyself, I say, lest some petticoat crawl into
thy path and spoil thy life. Woman! woman!" (here the
master blinked according to his custom), "I know that
ware somewhat. I cannot complain; God knows I cannot.
But I know this too, that thou must not give thy
finger to the devil, for right away he will take thy whole
hand. Woman! love! all our misfortune is in this, that
we make great things out of nonsense. If thou wish to
amuse thyself as I do, amuse thyself, but don't put thy
<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
life in it. Have reason at once, and do not pay good coin
for false goods. Do ye think that I complain of women?
I do not even dream of doing so. On the contrary, I love
them; but I do not let myself be taken by chaff of my own
imagining. I remember when I fell in love the first time
with a certain Lola, I thought, for example, that her dress
was sacred, but it was calico. That's the point. Was it
her fault that she walked in mud instead of flying through
the heavens? No! it was I who was stupid, through
putting wings on her by force. Man is rather a limited
beast. One or another of us carries God knows what
ideal in his heart, and therewith feels a need of loving;
hence on seeing the first little goose that he meets, he says
to himself, 'That is she.' Afterward he finds out that
he has made a mistake, and because of that small mistake
the devil takes him, or he lives an idiot all his
life."</p>

<p>"But you will acknowledge," said I, "that a man feels
the need of loving, and surely you feel that need as well
as others."</p>

<p>A scarcely discernible smile shot across his lips.</p>

<p>"Every necessity may be satisfied," answered he, "in
various ways. I help myself in my own way. I have
said that I do not look on stupid things as great. I am
sober, God knows, more sober than at this moment. But
I have seen many men who have broken their lives, or
snarled them up, like a thread, for one woman; so I say
that it is not worth while to put all one's life in that. I
say that there are better things, loftier objects, and that
love is a trifling matter. To the health of sobriety!"</p>

<p>"To the health of women!" shouted Selim.</p>

<p>"Very good; let us have that," answered our master.
"They are agreeable creatures, only take them not too
seriously. To the health of women!"
<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
</p>

<p>"To the health of Yozia!" cried I, touching Selim's
glass.</p>

<p>"Wait! Now is my turn," answered he. "To the
health of thy Hania! one deserves the other."</p>

<p>The blood began to play in me, and sparks flashed from
my eyes.</p>

<p>"Be silent, Selim," cried I. "Do not mention that
name before me in this shop!"</p>

<p>Then I threw my glass to the floor, and it broke into a
thousand bits.</p>

<p>"Hast gone mad?" cried our master.</p>

<p>I had not gone mad at all, but anger had sprung up in
me and was blazing like a flame. I could listen to everything
which the master said about women; I could even
take pleasure in it; I could ridicule them with others. I
could do that because I did not connect the words and
the ridicule with any one of my own, and because it did
not even come to my mind that the general theory was
to be applied to persons dear to me. But when I heard
the name of my purest orphan bandied about frivolously
in that room, amid smoke, dirt, empty bottles, corks, and
cynical conversation, I thought that I had heard some
abominable sacrilege, some defilement, some wrong
wrought against Hania, and from anger I almost lost self-control.</p>

<p>Selim looked at me for a moment with astonishment, and
then his face began to grow dark quickly, his eyes shot
sparks, on his forehead came out knots of veins, his features
extended and became sharp as those of a real Tartar.</p>

<p>"Thou dost forbid me to say what I please?" cried he,
in a deep voice, broken by panting breath.</p>

<p>Luckily the master rushed between us at this moment.</p>

<p>"Ye are not worthy of the uniforms which ye wear!
What is this? Ye will fight, or pull each other by the
<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
ears, like school-boys? Yes, philosophers who break
glasses on each other's heads. Be ashamed of yourselves!
Ye are persons with whom to talk touching universal
questions! Be ashamed of yourselves! From the war
of ideas to a war of fists. Stop! But I will say that I
proposed a toast in honor of universities; and that ye are
drones if ye will not make peace, and if ye leave even a
drop in the glasses."</p>

<p>We recovered. But Selim, though more drunk, recovered
first.</p>

<p>"I implore thy pardon," said he, in a tender voice. "I
am a fool."</p>

<p>We embraced heartily, and emptied the glasses to the
bottom to the honor of universities. Then our master
intoned <i>Gaudeamus</i>. Through the glass doors leading
to the cellar, merchants began to look in. It was
growing dark outside. We were all what is called tipsy.
Our joyfulness rose to the zenith and then descended
gradually. Our master was the first who fell into meditation,
and after a while he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"All this is well, but, taking everything together, life
is stupid. These are all artificial means; but as to what
happens in the soul, that is another thing. To-morrow
will be like to-day: the same misery, four naked walls,
the hay-loft, broken boots, and&mdash;so on without end.
Labor and labor, but happiness? A man deceives
himself as best he can and deadens&mdash; Farewell!"</p>

<p>So saying, he put his cap with broken crown on his
head, executed a few mechanical motions which had for
object the buttoning of his coat with buttons which did
not exist, lighted his cigarette, and waving his hand
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But do ye pay here, for I am naked, and be in good
health. Ye may remember me or not,&mdash;all one to
<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
me. I am not sentimental. Be in good health, my
honest boys&mdash;"</p>

<p>He uttered the last words in a low and emotional
voice, as if to contradict the statement that he was not
sentimental. The poor heart needed love, and was as
capable of it as any other heart; but misfortune from
years of childhood, poverty, and the indifference of people
had taught that heart to withdraw into itself. His soul
was a proud one, though ardent, hence always full of fear
of being rejected should it incline first to some person too
cordially.</p>

<p>We remained alone for a while, and under the influence
of a certain sadness. Those were perhaps gloomy
forebodings, for we were not to see our poor master
again in life. Neither he nor we divined that in his
breast had been inherent for a long time elements of
mortal disease, from which there was no rescue. Misery,
too much exertion, feverish labor over books, sleepless
nights, and hunger had hastened the crisis.</p>

<p>In the autumn, at the beginning of October, our master
died of consumption. Not many comrades followed
his coffin, for it was the time of vacation; but his poor
mother, a dealer in wax candles and holy images under
the Dominican church, wept aloud for the son whom
often she had not understood during life, though, like a
mother, she loved him.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE next day after that feast, horses came from the
old Mirza in Horeli, and we set out for home on
the following morning. We had two long days' ride
before us, so we started at dawn. In our stone house
<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
everything was asleep yet; but in the place opposite
Yozia's face gleamed in the window, amid geraniums,
yellow violets, and fuchsias. Selim, when he had put
on his travelling bag and student's cap, stood in the
window, ready for the road, to announce that he was
going; to this an answer was given from among the geraniums
by a melancholy glance. But when he placed
one hand on his heart and sent a kiss with the other,
the face between the flowers grew red and pushed back
quickly into the dark interior of the room.</p>

<p>Below, on the pavement of the yard, a brichka, drawn
by four sturdy horses, rolled in. It was time to take
farewell and sit in the wagon; but Selim waited, and
stood in the window persistently, hoping to see something
more. Hope deceived him, however; the window
remained empty. Only when we had descended and were
passing the dark entrance of the building opposite, did
we see on the steps two white stockings, a nut-colored
dress, a bosom bent forward, and two bright eyes shaded
by a hand; the eyes were looking out of darkness into
daylight.</p>

<p>Selim rushed at once to the entrance. I took my seat
in the brichka right there close by; I heard whispers
and certain sounds very similar to the sound of kisses.
Then Selim came out blushing, half laughing, half moved,
and sat by my side. The driver struck the horses.
Selim and I looked involuntarily toward the window.
Yozia's face was among the flowers again; a moment
more and a hand holding a white handkerchief was
thrust forth; one more sign of farewell, and the brichka
rolled out onto the street, taking with it me and the
beautiful ideal of poor Yozia.</p>

<p>It was very early in the morning. The city was in
slumber; the rosy light of dawn passed along the windows
<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
of the sleeping houses. Only here and there an
early bird, a passer-by, roused with his steps a drowsy
echo; here and there a guard was sweeping the street;
sometimes a cart was heard coming from some village
to the city market. Beyond this it was noiseless, but
clear and breezy, as is usual on a summer morning.</p>

<p>Our light brichka, drawn by four horses, bounded
along the pavement, like a nutshell pulled by a string.
Soon the cool breath of the river surrounded our faces;
the bridge resounded under the hoofs of our horses; and
half an hour later we were beyond the barriers among
broad fields, and wheat, and forests.</p>

<p>Our breasts breathed deeply of the splendid morning
air, and our eyes feasted on the region about. The earth
had wakened from sleep; pearly dew was hanging on the
wet leaves of the trees and glittering on every ear of
wheat. In the hedges the birds moved about joyously
with noisy chirping and twittering, greeting the beautiful
day. The forests and meadows were coming out of
the mist of morning, as if out of swathing bands. Here
and there on the meadows, water was gleaming; through
this storks waded among the golden flowers of the
water-lily. Rosy smoke went straight up from the
chimneys of village cottages; a light breeze bent in waves
the yellow fields of ripening wheat, and shook the dampness
of night from them. Joy was poured out everywhere;
it seemed that all was waking, living; that the
whole region around was singing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i2">
   "When the morning dawn arises,
  </p>
  <p class="i2">
   To thee the land, to thee the sea&mdash;"
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>What was taking place then in our hearts every one will
understand easily who remembers how in youth he
returned home on such a wonderful summer morning.
<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
The years of childhood and the subjection of school were
behind us; the age of youth was spread out broadly,
as a rich, flowery steppe, with an endless horizon,&mdash;a
curious and unknown land into which we had started
on a journey with good omens, youthful, strong, almost
with wings on our shoulders, like young eagles. Of
earthly treasures the greatest is youth, and of that treasure
with all its wealth we had not spent yet a single
copper.</p>

<p>We passed the road quickly, for at the chief stopping-places
relays of horses were waiting for us. Toward
evening of the second day, after riding all night, we drove
out of a forest and saw Horeli, or rather the pointed
summit of the domestic minaret, shining in the rays of
the setting sun. Soon we came out onto a dam, bordered
with willows and privet, on both sides of which were
two immense ponds with grist-mills and saw-mills. We
were accompanied by the drowsy croaking of frogs,
swimming in water warmed by the heat of the sun and
along banks overgrown with grass. It was clear that the
day was inclining to its rest. Herds of cattle and flocks
of sheep, hidden in clouds of dust, were returning by the
dam to the buildings of the farmyard. Here and there
crowds of people with sickles, scythes, and rakes on their
shoulders were hurrying homeward, singing, "Dana, oi
dana!" Those honest toilers stopped the brichka, kissed
Selim's hands, and greeted him warmly.</p>

<p>Soon the sun inclined still more toward setting and
hid half its bright shield behind the reeds. Only one
broad golden line of light was reflected yet on the
middle of the ponds, on the banks of which the trees
looked into the smooth surface. We turned to the right
a little; and soon, amid lindens, poplars, firs, and ash-trees,
shone the white walls of the mansion of Horeli.
<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
In the yard was heard the bell calling workmen to supper;
and from the minaret came the pensive voice of the
domestic muezzin, announcing that starry night was
falling from the sky to the earth, and that Allah is
great. As if to accompany the muezzin, a stork, standing,
like an Etruscan vase, in a nest on the top of a tree
above the roof of the mansion, issued for a while from his
statuesque repose, raised to the sky a bill which was like
a bronze arrow, then dropped it on his breast and rattled,
shaking his head as if in greeting.</p>

<p>I looked at Selim. There were tears in his eyes, and
his face shone with a sweetness beyond compare, peculiar
to him alone. We drove into the yard.</p>

<p>Before the windowed porch sat the old Mirza, drawing
blue smoke from his pipe; he was looking with a joyful
eye at the calm and industrious life moving on that charming
landscape. When he saw his son he sprang up quickly,
caught him in his arms, and pressed him long to his
breast, for though he was stern to the boy he loved him
beyond everything. He asked at once about his examination;
then followed new embraces. All the numerous
servants ran in then to meet the Panich, and the dogs
sprang joyously around him. A tame she-wolf, a favorite
of the old Mirza, jumped from the porch. "Zula!
Zula!" called Selim, and she put her great paws on his
shoulders, licked his face, and then ran around him as
if mad, whining and showing her terrible teeth from
delight.</p>

<p>Now we went to the dining-room. I looked at Horeli
and everything in it, like a man thirsting for novelty.
Nothing in it had been modified; the portraits of Selim's
ancestors, captains, bannerets, hung on the walls. The
terrible Mirza, Sobieski's colonel of light horse, looked on
me as before with his ominous, slanting eyes; but his
<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
countenance, slashed with sabres, looked still uglier and
very terrible. Selim's father had changed most. From
being black, his forelock had grown iron gray, his thick
mustache had become almost white, and the Tartar
type appeared with increasing distinctness in his features.
Ah, what a difference between the father and the son,
between that bony face, stern, even harsh, and that face
simply angelic, resembling a flower, fresh and sweet! But
it is difficult for me to describe that love with which the
old man looked upon Selim, and with which his eyes
followed every movement of his son.</p>

<p>Not wishing to interrupt them, I remained at one side;
but the old man, as hospitable as a genuine Polish noble,
seized me at once, embraced me, and tried to detain me
for the night. I would not pass the night there, for I
was in a hurry to reach home, but I had to stay for
supper.</p>

<p>I left Horeli late in the evening, and when I was near
home the triangle had risen in the sky; that meant that
it was midnight. Windows in the village were not
lighted; fire in a tar-pit near the forest was visible from
a distance. Dogs were barking at the cottages. In the
alley of linden-trees, which extended to our house, it was
dark; even strain out thine eyes thou couldst see nothing.
A man passed at one side humming a song in low tones,
but I did not see his face. I reached the porch; the windows
were dark. Clearly all were asleep; but dogs, dashing
out from all sides, began to bark round the brichka in gladness.
I sprang down and knocked at the door; I could
not make any one hear for a long time. At last this became
disagreeable; I had thought that they would be
waiting for me. Only after a time did a light begin to
flit here and there past the window-panes, and then a
drowsy voice, which I recognized as Franek's, inquired,
<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>I answered. Franek opened the door and fell to kissing
my hands at once.</p>

<p>"Are all well?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Franek; "but the old lord has gone
to the city, and will return only to-morrow."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he conducted me to the dining-room,
lighted a hanging lamp over the table, and went to make
tea. I was alone for a while with my thoughts, and with
my heart beating quickly. But that while was of short
duration, for Father Ludvik ran in, in a dressing-gown;
the honest Pani d'Yves, dressed also in white, with her
usual papers and in a cap; and Kazio, who had come
from school for vacation a month earlier. The honest
hearts greeted me with feeling, admired my growth;
the priest insisted that I had grown manly, Pani d'Yves
that I had grown comely.</p>

<p>Father Ludvik, poor man, inquired only after some
time, and then timidly, about examination and my school
diploma. When he heard of my successes he just wept,
taking me in his arms and calling me his dear boy.
And now from the chamber came the patter of small
naked feet, and my two little sisters ran in, in their
night-dresses and little caps, repeating, "Henlis has
come! Henlis has come!" and they sprang on my knees.
In vain did Pani d'Yves put them to shame, saying that
it was an unheard of thing for two young ladies (one
was eight, the other nine) to show themselves to people
in such "dishabille." The two, without saying a word,
put their little arms around my neck and pressed their
mouths to my cheeks. After a while I asked timidly
about Hania.</p>

<p>"Oh, she has grown!" answered Pani d'Yves. "She
will come right away; she is dressing, I think."
<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
</p>

<p>In fact, I did not wait long, for five minutes later,
perhaps, Hania entered the room. I looked at her; and,
oh, what had become in half a year of that slender, thin
orphan of sixteen? Before me stood an almost mature,
or at least maturing young lady. Her form had grown
full, rounded marvellously. She had a delicate but
healthy complexion; on her cheeks was ruddiness, as it
were, the reflection of the morning dawn. Health, youth,
freshness, charm, were radiating from her, as from a rose
at its opening. I noticed that she looked at me curiously
with her large blue eyes; but I saw also that she must
have understood my admiration and the impression
which she made on me, for a kind of indescribable smile
wandered in the corners of her mouth. In the curiosity
with which we looked at each other was hidden the undefined
bashfulness of a youth and a maiden. Oh, those
simple heartfelt relations of a brother and sister, relations
of childhood, had gone somewhere into a forest, to return
nevermore.</p>

<p>Ah, how beautiful she was with that smile and that
quiet joy in her eyes! Light from the lamp hanging over
the table fell on her bright hair. She was dressed in a
black robe with something thrown over her which was
equally dark. This she held on her breast beneath her
white neck with her hand; but in this apparel was evident
a certain charming disorder, which arose from the
haste with which she had dressed. The warmth of sleep
issued from her. When at greeting I touched her hand,
it was warm, soft, satin-like, and her touch pierced me
with a delightful quiver. Hania had changed as well
mentally as physically. When I went away she was a
simple maiden, half servant; now she was a young lady,
with a noble expression of face and elegant movements,
betraying good breeding and the habit of select society.
<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
She was roused morally and mentally; a soul was looking
out through her eyes. She had ceased to be a child in
every respect; her undefined smile, and a kind of innocent
coquetry with which she considered me declared this,
and from which it was evident that she understood in
how greatly changed relations we stood toward each
other. I saw soon that she had a certain superiority over
me; for I, though more trained in learning, in reference to
life, in reference to understanding every position, every
word, was still rather a simple boy. Hania was freer
with me than I with her. My dignity of a guardian and
lord's son had also gone somewhere into a forest. On
the road home I had been arranging with myself how to
greet Hania, what to say to her, how to be kind and indulgent,
but all these plans tumbled down utterly. The
position somehow began to be defined that not I was good
and kind to her, but rather that she seemed to be good
and kind to me. I could not understand this clearly at
first, but I felt the position more than I understood it.
I had arranged with myself to ask her what she was
studying, what she had learned, how she had passed the
time, whether Pani d'Yves and Father Ludvik were satisfied
with her; but it was she who always, with that smile
in the corners of her mouth, asked me what I had been
doing, what I had learned, and what I intended to do in
the future. All had come out wonderfully different from
what I had intended. Speaking briefly, our relations had
changed in a sense directly inverse.</p>

<p>After an hour's conversation we all betook ourselves
to rest. I went to my room a little drowsy, a little
astonished, a little deceived and downcast, but through
various impressions. Love roused again began to push
out, like a flame through the cracks of a burning building,
and soon covered those impressions completely.
<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
Then simply Hania's form, that maiden figure, rich, full
of charms, such as I had seen her, alluring, surrounded
with the warmth of sleep, with her white hand holding
the disordered dress on her bosom, with her hanging
tresses, roused my young imagination, and veiled with
itself everything before me.</p>

<p>I fell asleep with her image under my eyelids.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">I ROSE very early next day and ran out to the garden.
The morning was beautiful, full of dew and the odor
of flowers. I went quickly to the hornbeam picket, for
my heart told me that I should find Hania there. But
evidently my heart, too receptive of forebodings, had
deceived itself. Hania was not there, no trace of her.
Only after breakfast did I find myself alone with her. I
asked if she would walk in the garden. She consented
willingly and ran to her chamber; she returned soon
with a large straw hat on her head, which shaded her
forehead and eyes, and with a parasol in her hand. She
smiled at me roguishly from under the hat, as if to say,
"See how this becomes me."</p>

<p>We went to the garden together. I turned toward the
hornbeam picket, and on the road thought, how shall I
begin conversation, and thought also that Hania, who certainly
could begin better than I, had no wish to assist me,
but rather amused herself with my perplexity. I walked
along at her side in silence, cutting off with my whip
flowers growing on the side of the path, till Hania
laughed all on a sudden.</p>

<p>"Pan Henryk," said she, catching at the whip, "what
have the flowers done to you?"
<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
</p>

<p>"Hania, what are the flowers to me? But thou seest
that I do not know how to begin talk with thee; thou hast
changed much, Hania. Ah, how thou hast changed!"</p>

<p>"Let us suppose that to be true. Does it make you
angry?"</p>

<p>"I do not say that it does," answered I, half in sorrow;
"but I cannot make myself used to it, for it seems to me
that that other little Hania whom I knew before, and
thou, are two different beings. That one had grown into
my memory, into&mdash;my heart, like a sister, Hania, and
therefore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And therefore" (here she pointed to herself) "this
one is a stranger, is she not?" asked she, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Hania! Hania! how canst thou even imagine such a
thing?"</p>

<p>"Still it is very natural, though perhaps sad," answered
she. "You are looking in your heart for the old brotherly
feelings, and do not find them, that is all."</p>

<p>"No, I do not look in my heart for the old Hania, for
she is there always; but I look for her in thee, and as to
my heart&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As to your heart," interrupted she, joyously, "I can
guess what has become of it. It has stayed somewhere in
Warsaw with some other little heart. That is guessed
easily!"</p>

<p>I looked deeply into her eyes. I did not know
whether she was quizzing me a little or counting on
the impression made on me yesterday, and which I was
unable to hide, but she was playing with me somewhat
cruelly. All at once a wish to resist was roused
in me. I thought that I must have a supremely comical
face, looking at her with the expression of a
mortally wounded deer; so I mastered my feelings
and said,
<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"If that is true?"</p>

<p>A visible expression of astonishment, and, as it were,
of dissatisfaction, came to her face.</p>

<p>"If that is true," answered she, "it is you who have
changed, not I."</p>

<p>She frowned a little, and, looking at me from under
her forehead, went on some time in silence. I endeavored
to hide the glad emotion with which her words
penetrated me. "She says," thought I, "that if I love
another, it is I who have changed; therefore it is not she
who has changed, she&mdash;" And from delight I dared not
finish this wise inference.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, it was not I, not I, but she
who had changed. That little maiden who six months
before knew nothing of God's world, to whose mind it
had never occurred to mention feelings, and for whom
such a conversation would have been as Chinese, carried
it on to-day as freely and accurately as if she had been
reciting a lesson. How had that child mind developed
and become so flexible? But wonderful things take
place in girls. More than one falls asleep in the
evening a child and wakes up in the morning a
woman, with another world of feelings and thoughts.
For Hania, with a nature quick, capable, sensitive, the
passage of her sixteenth year, another sphere of society,
learning, books, read, perhaps, in secret,&mdash;all this was
more than sufficient.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we walked on side by side in silence which
Hania was the first to break.</p>

<p>"Then you are in love, Pan Henryk?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," answered I, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Then you will be sighing for Warsaw?"</p>

<p>"No, Hania; I should be glad were I never to leave
here."
<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
</p>

<p>Hania glanced at me quickly. Evidently she wished
to say something, but was silent. After a while, however,
she struck her skirts lightly with the parasol, and said,
as if answering her own thoughts,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, what a child I am!"</p>

<p>"Why dost thou say that, Hania?"</p>

<p>"Oh, so&mdash; Let us sit on this bench and talk of something
else. Is not the view from here beautiful?" asked
she, with that well-known smile on her lips.</p>

<p>She seated herself on the bench not far from the paling
under an immense linden-tree. From that point the view
was very beautiful indeed in the direction of the pond, the
dam, and the forest beyond the pond. Hania pointed it out
to me with her parasol; but I, though a lover of beautiful
views, had not the least desire to look at it,&mdash;first, because
I knew it perfectly; second, I had before me Hania, a
hundred times more beautiful than anything which surrounded
her; finally, I was thinking of something else.</p>

<p>"How clearly those trees are reflected in the water!"
said she.</p>

<p>"I see that thou art an artist," I answered, not looking
at the trees or the water.</p>

<p>"Father Ludvik is teaching me to sketch. Oh, I have
learned much while you were gone. I wanted&mdash;but
what is the matter? Are you angry with me?"</p>

<p>"No, Hania, I am not angry, for I could not be angry
with thee; but I see that thou avoidest my questions,
and this is the trouble, we are both playing at hide and
seek, instead of speaking sincerely and with confidence,
as in old times. Maybe thou dost not feel this, but for
me it is disagreeable."</p>

<p>These simple words had this effect only, that they
brought us into great perplexity. Hania gave me both
hands, it is true; I pressed those hands perhaps too vigorously,
<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
and, oh, terror! I bent over them quickly and
kissed them not at all as befitted a guardian. Then we
were confused to the utmost. She blushed to the neck,
I also; and finally we were silent, not knowing in any
way how to begin that conversation which should be
sincere and full of confidence.</p>

<p>Then she looked at me, I at her, and again we hung
out red flags on our faces. We sat side by side like two
dolls; it seemed to me that I was listening to the hurried
beating of my own heart. Our position was unendurable.
At times I felt that some hand was seizing me by the
collar to throw me at her feet, and another was holding
me by the hair and would not let me do so. All at once
Hania sprang up and said in a hurried, confused voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must go. I have a lesson at this hour with Pani
d'Yves. It is nearly eleven."</p>

<p>We returned by the same road to the house, and
went on as before in silence. I, as before, kept cutting
the heads off the flowers with my whip, but this time
she had no compassion for the flowers.</p>

<p>"Our former relations have returned beautifully; there
is nothing to be said on that point. Jesus, Mary! what
is taking place within me?" thought I, when Hania left
me to myself. I was in love so that the hair was rising
on my head.</p>

<p>Just then the priest came and took me to look at the
management. On the way he told me many things
touching our estate; these did not occupy me in the least,
though I pretended to listen attentively.</p>

<p>My brother Kazio, who, enjoying his vacation, spent
the whole day out of doors, in the stables, in the forest, at
shooting, on horseback, or in a boat, was at that particular
moment in the farm-yard riding a young horse from the
stud. When he saw me and the priest, he galloped up
<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
to us on the chestnut, which reared as if mad, and asked
us to admire the horse's form, fire, and pace; then he dismounted
and went with us. Together we visited the
stables, the cow-houses, the barns, and were just going
to the fields, when it was announced that my father had
come, so we had to go home.</p>

<p>My father greeted me more warmly than ever. When
he learned of the examinations, he took me in his arms
and declared that thenceforward he would consider me
full grown. Indeed, a great change had taken place in
him with reference to me. He treated me with more confidence
and affection. He began to talk with me at once
about property interests; he confided to me his intention
of buying one of the neighboring estates, and asked my
opinion. I divined that he spoke of that purposely to
show me how seriously he looked on my significance as a
mature person and the first son in the family. At the
same time I noticed how genuinely he was pleased with
me and my advance in study. His pride of a parent
was flattered immensely by the testimonial which I had
brought from the professors. I noticed, meanwhile, that
he was testing my character, my style of thought, my
ideas touching honor, and that he put various questions
purposely to test me with them. It was evident that the
parental inspection proved favorable, for though my philosophic
and social principles were utterly different from
his, I did not bring them forward; in other ideas we
could not differ. So my father's severe, lion-like face became
more radiant than ever I had seen it. He covered
me with gifts that day; he gave me a brace of pistols,
with which he had fought a duel not long before with
Pan Zoll, and on which were marked a number of other
duels which he had fought during youth, while serving
in the army. Then I received a splendid horse of Eastern
<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
blood, and an ancient sabre handed down from my ancestors;
the hilt was set with stones; on the broad Damascus
blade was an image of the Mother of God, inlaid with
gold in the steel, and the inscription, "Jesus, Mary!"
That sabre had become one of our most precious family
relics, and for years had been the object of sighs from me
and Kazio, for it cut iron as if shavings. My father,
when presenting the sabre, unsheathed and whirled it a
couple of times so that the air whistled and there was
a flash in the room; then he made a cross with it over
my head, kissed the image of the Mother of God on the
blade, and said, while delivering the weapon into my
hands,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Into worthy hands! I brought no shame to it; bring
thou none!" Then we threw ourselves into each other's
arms. Meanwhile Kazio seized the sabre with delight;
and though only a lad of fifteen, but uncommonly strong,
he began to give blows with an accuracy and with a
quickness that would not have shamed any trained
master of fencing. My father looked at him with satisfaction,
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"He will be perfect; but thou wilt do what is needed,
wilt thou not?"</p>

<p>"I will, father. I should be able to manage Kazio
even. Of all the comrades whom I have tried in fencing,
only one has surpassed me."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Selim."</p>

<p>My father made a wry face.</p>

<p>"Selim! But thou must be stronger?"</p>

<p>"That is indifferent. What would make me try him?
Selim and I will never fight."</p>

<p>"Ai! various things happen," answered my father.</p>

<p>After dinner that day we were all sitting on the broad,
<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
vine-covered porch; from this porch the view was on the
immense front yard and in the distance on the shady road
bordered by linden-trees. Pani d'Yves was working an
altar-cloth for the chapel; my father and the priest were
smoking pipes and drinking black coffee. Kazio was
circling about in front of the porch, following the turns of
swift swallows, at which he wanted to shoot balls; but
my father would not let him do that. Hania and I were
looking at drawings which I had brought home, and
were thinking least of all of the drawings; for me they
served only to conceal from others the glances which I
cast at Hania.</p>

<p>"Well, and how hast thou found Hania? Does she
seem ugly to thee, lord guardian?" asked my father,
looking facetiously at the girl.</p>

<p>I began to examine a drawing very carefully, and
answered from behind the paper,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will not say, father, that she has grown ugly, but
she has grown tall, and has changed."</p>

<p>"Pan Henryk has reproached me already with these
changes," put in Hania, with freedom.</p>

<p>I wondered at her daring in presence of my father. I
could not have mentioned those reproaches so freely.</p>

<p>"Oh, what matters it whether she has grown old or
grown pretty!" said Father Ludvik; "but she learns
quickly and well. Let Madame tell how quickly she has
learned French."</p>

<p>It should be known that the priest, though highly
educated, did not know French and could not learn it,
though he had spent a number of years under our roof
with Pani d'Yves. The poor man, however, had a weakness
for French, and considered a knowledge of it as an
indispensable mark of superior education.</p>

<p>"I cannot deny that she learns easily and willingly,"
<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
answered Pani d'Yves, turning to me; "but still I must
complain of her."</p>

<p>"Oh, Pani! what new fault have I committed?" cried
Hania, crossing her hands.</p>

<p>"What fault? You will explain here right away,"
answered Pani d'Yves. "Just imagine, this young lady,
when she finds a moment of time, takes up a novel immediately;
and I have strong reasons for thinking that
when she goes to bed, instead of quenching the candle
and sleeping, she reads for whole hours."</p>

<p>"She does a very bad thing; but I know from some
source that she follows the example of her teacher," said
my father, who was fond of teasing Pani d'Yves when he
was in good humor.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon greatly; I am forty-five years of
age," answered the French woman.</p>

<p>"Why, just think, I never should have said that,"
answered my father.</p>

<p>"You are malicious."</p>

<p>"I do not know that; but I know this, that if Hania
gets novels from any place, it is not from the library, for
Father Ludvik has the key to it. The blame therefore
falls on the teacher."</p>

<p>In truth, Pani d'Yves had read novels all her life,
and, having a passion to relate them to every one, she
must surely have related some to Hania; hence, in
the words of my father, which were half in jest, a certain
truth lay concealed, which he wished to emphasize
purposely.</p>

<p>"Oh, see! Some one is coming!" cried Kazio, suddenly.</p>

<p>We all looked into the shady alley between the linden-trees,
and at the other end of it, perhaps a verst away, we
saw a cloud of dust, which approached us with uncommon
rapidity.
<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
</p>

<p>"Who can that be? What speed!" said my father,
rising up. "Such a dust one can distinguish nothing."</p>

<p>In fact, the heat was great; no rain had fallen for
more than two weeks, so that along the roads clouds of
white dust rose at every step. We looked for a while,
yet in vain, at the approaching cloud, which was not
farther than a few tens of steps from the front yard,
when out of the cloud emerged a horse's head with distended,
red nostrils, fiery eyes, and flowing mane. The
white horse was going at the swiftest gallop; his feet
barely touched the earth; and on his back, bent to the
horse's neck, in Tartar fashion, was no other than my
friend Selim.</p>

<p>"Selim is coming, Selim!" cried Kazio.</p>

<p>"What is that lunatic doing? The gate is closed!"
cried I, springing from my place.</p>

<p>There was no time to open the gate, for no one could
reach it in season; meanwhile, Selim urged on like a
madman, at random, and it was almost certain that he
would fall on the gate, more than two ells high, with
sharp peaks at the top.</p>

<p>"O God, have mercy on him!" cried the priest.</p>

<p>"The gate! Selim, the gate!" screamed I, as if possessed,
waving my handkerchief and running with all
my might across the yard.</p>

<p>Something like five yards from the gate, Selim straightened
himself in the saddle, and measured the gate with
a glance quick as lightning. Next, the scream of women
sitting on the porch came to me, the swift trampling of
hoofs; the horse rose, suspended his forelegs in the air,
and went over the gate at the highest speed without
stopping one instant.</p>

<p>When before the porch, Selim reined in his steed so
that the beast's hoofs dug into the earth, then snatching
<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
the hat from his own head, he waved it like a standard
and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How are ye, dear beloved lords? How are ye? My
respects to the lord benefactor!" cried he, bowing to my
father; "my respects to the beloved priest, Pani d'Yves,
Panna Hania! We are all together again. Vivat!
Vivat!"</p>

<p>Then he sprang from the horse, and throwing the reins
to Franek, who had run out of the hall the moment
before, he embraced my father, then the priest, and fell
to kissing the hands of the ladies.</p>

<p>Pani d'Yves and Hania were pale from terror, and just
because of that they greeted Selim as if he had been
rescued from death.</p>

<p>"Oh, thou art playing the madman, the madman!
What terror thou didst bring on us!" said Father Ludvik.
"We thought that it was all over with thee."</p>

<p>"But why so?"</p>

<p>"That gate. How is it possible to race so at random?"</p>

<p>"At random? I saw very well that the gate was
closed. Oho! I have my perfect Tartar eyes."</p>

<p>"And thou dost not fear to race so?"</p>

<p>Selim laughed. "Not in the least, Father Ludvik.
But for that matter, the merit is my horse's, not mine."</p>

<p>"There is a bold boy for you!" said Pani d'Yves.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is true! Not every man would dare that,"
added Hania.</p>

<p>"It is thy wish to say," added I, "that not every horse
could clear the gate, for more such men could be found."</p>

<p>Hania gazed long at me.</p>

<p>"I would not advise you to try," said she; then she
turned toward Selim and her look expressed admiration,
for really this daring deed of the Tartar was one of those
risks which always please women. One should have
<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
seen him at that moment, his fine, dark hair falling on
his forehead, his cheeks flushed from the swift movement,
his gleaming eyes, from which shone delight and
gladness. As he stood there near Hania, looking her in
the eyes with curiosity, no artist could have imagined a
more beautiful couple.</p>

<p>But I was touched in the highest degree by her words.
It seemed to me that that, "I would not advise thee to
try," had been spoken in a voice in which a tone of irony
was trembling. I looked with an inquiring glance at my
father, who had examined Selim's horse a moment before.
I knew his parental ambition; I knew that he was jealous
the moment that any one surpassed me in anything, and
this had angered him toward Selim for a long time. I
concluded, therefore, that he would not oppose in case
I wished to show that I was not a worse horseman than
Selim.</p>

<p>"That horse gallops well, father," said I.</p>

<p>"Yes, and that Satan sits well," muttered he. "Couldst
thou do the same?"</p>

<p>"Hania doubts," answered I, with a certain bitterness.
"May I try?"</p>

<p>My father hesitated, looked at the gate, at the horse,
at me, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give peace."</p>

<p>"Naturally!" exclaimed I, in sorrow; "it is better for
me to be counted an old woman in comparison with
Selim."</p>

<p>"Henryk! what art thou saying?" cried Selim, encircling
my neck with his arms.</p>

<p>"Gallop! gallop, boy! and do your best," said my
father, whose pride was touched.</p>

<p>"Bring the horse here!" called I to Franek, who was
leading the tired steed slowly around the yard.
<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
</p>

<p>"Pan Henryk!" cried Hania, springing up from her
seat, "then I am the cause of this trial. I do not wish
it; I do not wish it. Do not do it; do not, for my
sake!"</p>

<p>And while speaking, she looked me in the eyes, as if
she wished to finish with her eyes that which she could
not express in words.</p>

<p>Ah! for that look I would have given the last drop of
my blood at that moment; but I could not and would
not draw back. My offended pride was stronger just then
than aught else; so I mastered myself and answered
dryly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou art mistaken, Hania, in thinking that thou art
the cause. I shall clear the gate to amuse myself."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, in spite of the protests of all save
my father, I mounted and moved forward at a walk
into the alley of lindens. Franek opened the gate and
closed it after me. I had bitterness in my soul, and
would have gone over the gate had it been twice as high.
When I had ridden about three hundred yards, I turned
the horse and began at a trot, which I changed to a
gallop immediately.</p>

<p>All at once I noticed that the saddle was moving. One
of two things had happened,&mdash;either the girth had
stretched during the former leap, or Franek had loosened
it to let the horse breathe, and through stupidity, or
perhaps forgetfulness, had not informed me.</p>

<p>Now it was too late. The horse was approaching the
gate at the highest speed, and I did not wish to stop him.
"If I kill myself, I shall kill myself," thought I. I
pressed the sides of the horse convulsively. The air
whistled in my ears. Suddenly the points of the gate
gleamed before my eyes. I waved my whip, felt myself
borne through air, a scream from the porch struck my
<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
ears, it grew dark in my eyes&mdash;and after a while I
recovered from a faint.</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" cried I. "Was I thrown? I
fainted."</p>

<p>Near me were my father, the priest, Pani d'Yves, Selim,
Kazio, and Hania white as linen, with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? What is the matter?" was the
cry on all sides.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. I was thrown, but that was not my
fault. The girth was stretched."</p>

<p>In fact, after the momentary faint I felt perfectly well,
only breath lacked me a little. My father fell to touching
my hands, feet, shoulders.</p>

<p>"It does not hurt?" inquired he.</p>

<p>"No; I am perfectly well."</p>

<p>My breath too returned to me. But I was angry, for
I thought that I seemed ridiculous,&mdash;that I must seem
ridiculous. In falling from the horse, I was thrown with
violence across the whole width of the road, which passed
near a grass-plot, and fell on the grass; because of this
the elbows and knees of my clean clothing were stained
green, my dress and hair disordered. But still the unfortunate
outcome had rendered me a service. A moment
before, Selim was the object of general attention in our
circle, as a guest, and as a guest just arrived; now I had
taken from him that palm of victory at the cost of my
knees and elbows. Hania, thinking herself all the time,
and justly, the cause of this hazardous trial which for
me might have ended badly, tried to make up for her
hastiness with kindness and sweetness. Under such
influence I soon recovered my joyousness, which was
communicated to all the society which a moment before
had been terrified. We amused ourselves perfectly.
<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
Lunch was served, at which Hania was the mistress, and
then we went to the garden. In the garden Selim became
as full of pranks as a little boy; he laughed, frolicked, and
Hania helped him with all her soul. Finally he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, how we shall amuse ourselves this time, all
three of us!"</p>

<p>"I am curious to know," said Hania, "who is the most
joyous!"</p>

<p>"Oh, surely I," answered Selim.</p>

<p>"But perhaps it is I. I am gladsome by nature."</p>

<p>"But the least gladsome is Henryk," added Selim.
"He is naturally dignified, and a little sad. If he had
lived in the Middle Ages, he would have been a knight-errant
and a troubadour, only he cannot sing. But we,"
continued he, turning to Hania, "have looked for the
poppy and found it."</p>

<p>"I cannot agree to that," answered I. "For any given
disposition I prefer the opposite, since in this case one
has the qualities which are lacking the other."</p>

<p>"Thanks," replied Selim; "I admit that thou art by
nature fond of weeping, and Panna Hania of laughing.
Well, let it be that: get married, you two&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Selim!"</p>

<p>Selim looked at me and began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, young man? Ha! ha! Dost remember the
oration of Cicero, 'commoveri videtur juvenis,' which in
Polish means: the young man seems confused. But that
signifies nothing, for without cause even thou canst blush
gloriously: Panna Hania, he cooks crawfish
<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2">
</a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> gloriously,
and now he has blushed for himself and you."</p>

<p>"Selim!"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing! I return to my subject. Thou,
sir, art a man of weeping, and thou, young lady, art a

<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>lady of laughing; get married. What will happen? He
will begin to blubber, and you to laugh; you will never
understand each other, never agree, different always; and
what do I care for chosen natures? Oh, with me it
would be different: we should simply laugh all our
lives, and that would be the whole story."</p>

<p>"What are you saying?" answered Hania, and then both
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>As to me, I had not the least desire to laugh. Selim
did not know what injustice he did me in persuading
Hania of the difference between her disposition and mine.
I was angry in the highest degree, and answered Selim
with sarcasm,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou hast a strange view, and it astonishes me all
the more, since I have noticed that thou hast a weakness
for melancholy persons."</p>

<p>"I?" said he, with unfeigned astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes. I will merely remind thee of a certain maiden,
some fuchsias, and a little face between them. I give
thee my word that I do not know such a melancholy
face."</p>

<p>Hania clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"Oho! I am learning something new!" cried she,
laughing. "Is she pretty, Pan Selim; is she pretty?"</p>

<p>I thought that Selim would grow confused and lose
his boldness; but he merely said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Henryk?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Dost thou know what I do with those whose tongues
are too long?" And he laughed.</p>

<p>Hania insisted on his telling her even the name of this
chosen one; without thinking long, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yozia."</p>

<p>But if he had been what he pretended he would have
<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
paid dearly for his sincerity, for Hania gave him no peace
from that hour till evening.</p>

<p>"Is she pretty?"</p>

<p>"Oh, so."</p>

<p>"What kind of hair has she, and eyes?"</p>

<p>"Nice ones, but not such as please me more than all
others."</p>

<p>"And what kind please you?"</p>

<p>"Bright hair, and eyes, if they are kind, blue, like
those into which I am looking at this moment."</p>

<p>"Oo, Pan Selim!"</p>

<p>And Hania frowned; but Selim, putting his palms
together, made himself pleasant with that incomparable
sweetness in his eyes, and began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Panna Hania, be not angry. What has the poor
little Tartar done? Be not angry! Let the lady
laugh."</p>

<p>Hania looked at him, and as she looked the cloud vanished
from her forehead. He simply enchanted her. A
smile wandered in the corners of her mouth; her eyes
grew bright, her face radiant; and at last she answered in
a soft, mild voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very well, I will not be angry; but I beg you to be
nice."</p>

<p>"I will, as I love Mohammed, I will."</p>

<p>"And do you love your Mohammed much?"</p>

<p>"As dogs a beggar."</p>

<p>And then both laughed again.</p>

<p>"But now tell me whom does Pan Henryk love? I
asked him, but he would not tell me."</p>

<p>"Henryk? Do you know" (here he looked at me
askance) "he is not in love with any one yet, perhaps, but
he will love. Oh, I know perfectly whom! and as to
me&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
</p>

<p>"As to you, what?" inquired Hania, trying to conceal
her confusion.</p>

<p>"I would do the very same&mdash;but wait a bit; he may
be in love already."</p>

<p>"I beg thee to stop, Selim."</p>

<p>"Thou, my honest boy," said Selim, putting his arm
around my neck&mdash; "Ah, if you knew how honest he is."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that," said Hania; "I remember what he
was to me after my grandfather's death."</p>

<p>A cloud of sadness flew between us then.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," said Selim, wishing to change the
subject, "that after examination we had a little feast with
our master&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And drank?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, that is the custom which one cannot avoid.
So while we were drinking, I, being, as you know, a giddy
fellow, raised a toast to you. I acted unwisely, but
Henryk sprang up: 'How dare you mention Hania in
such a place as this?' said he to me; for that was a
wine-cellar. We came near fighting. But he will not let
any one offend you, no, no&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hania gave me her hand. "How good you are, Pan
Henryk!"</p>

<p>"Well," answered I, carried away by Selim's words,
"say thyself, Hania, is not Selim just as honest, since he
tells this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what great honesty!" said Selim, laughing.</p>

<p>"But it is," answered Hania; "you are worthy of each
other, and we shall have such a pleasant time in
company."</p>

<p>"You will be our queen!" cried Selim, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! Hania! we invite you to tea," called
Pani d'Yves from the garden veranda.
<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
</p>

<p>We went to tea, all three of us in the very best feeling.
The table was set under the veranda; the lights, shielded
by glass tubes, burned brightly, and moths in a swarm
circled around them; they butted against the glass walls
of the tubes; the leaves of wild grapevines rustled, moved
by the warm night air; and beyond the poplars rose a
great golden moon. The last conversation between Hania,
Selim, and myself had brought us to a wonderfully mild,
friendly tone. That calm and quiet evening acted also
on the older persons. My father's face and the priest's
were as serene as the sky.</p>

<p>After tea Pani d'Yves began to play solitaire; my
father fell into perfect humor, for he commenced to tell
of old times, which with him was always a sign of good
feeling.</p>

<p>"I remember," said he, "we halted once not far from a
village in Krasnostav. The night was dark; even strain
your eyes out, you could not see anything" (here he
drew smoke from his pipe and let it go above the light).
"People were as tired as a Jew's nag. We were standing
silently, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here began a narrative of wonderful and most wonderful
happenings. The priest, who had listened to this
more than once, still stopped smoking and listened more
attentively; he raised his spectacles to his forehead,
and, nodding, repeated "Uhum! Uhum!" or called out,
"Jesus, Mary! well, and what?"</p>

<p>Selim and I, leaning against each other, with eyes fixed
on my father, caught his words eagerly. On no face was
the expression depicted so definitely as on Selim's. His
eyes were gleaming like coals; a flush covered his face; his
hot Eastern nature came to the surface like oil. Hardly
could he sit in one place. Pani d'Yves smiled as she
looked at him, and showed him to Hania with her eyes;
<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
then both began to observe him, for they were entertained
by that face, which was like a mirror or the surface of
water, in which everything is reflected that comes near
its transparency.</p>

<p>To-day, when I recall evenings like that, I cannot resist
my emotion. Many waves on the water, many clouds in
the sky, have passed since that time; but still winged
memory pushes before my eyes continually similar pictures
of the village mansion, the summer night, and that
family, harmonious, loving, happy,&mdash;a gray veteran telling
former adventures of his life; youths with fire in their
eyes; farther on a face like a field flower&mdash;Ei! Many
waves on the water and clouds in the sky have passed
since that time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the clock struck ten. Selim sprang up, for
he had received the command to return that same night.
The whole company decided to go with him as far as the
cross at the end of the lindens near the second gate, I
on horseback farther, as far as the meadows. We started
then, all of us except Kazio, who had fallen asleep in the
best fashion.</p>

<p>Hania, Selim, and I pushed on ahead, we two leading
our horses by the bridles, Hania between us. The three
old people walked behind. It was dark in the alley; the
moon, merely breaking through the dense foliage, marked
the dark road with silver spots.</p>

<p>"Let us sing something," said Selim, "some song, old
and good; for example, the song about Filon."</p>

<p>"No one sings that," answered Hania. "I know
another: 'Oh, autumn, autumn, the leaf is withering on
the tree!'"</p>

<p>We agreed at last to begin with "Filon," which the
priest and my father liked much, for it reminded them of
old times, and then sing "Oh, autumn, autumn!" Hania
<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
placed her white hand on the mane of Selim's horse and
began to sing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i2">
   "The moon has gone down, the dogs are all sleeping;
</p>
  <p class="i2">
   But some one is clapping beyond the pine wood.
  </p>
  <p class="i2">
   Surely, Filon, my darling, is watching,
  </p>
  <p class="i2">
   Awaiting me under the favorite maple."
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>When we finished, the voices of the old people were
heard behind us in the darkness: "Bravo! bravo! sing
something more." I accompanied as best I could, but I
did not sing well; while Hania and Selim had beautiful
voices, especially Selim. Sometimes, when I went too far
beyond the notes, they both laughed at me. Then they
hummed some other songs, during which I thought, "Why
does Hania hold the mane of Selim's horse, and not
the mane of mine?" That horse pleased her peculiarly.
Sometimes she nestled up to its neck, or, patting it, repeated,
"My steed, mine!" and the gentle beast snorted
and stretched out its open nostrils toward her hand, as if
looking for sugar. All this caused me to grow sad again,
and I looked at nothing save that hand, which continued
to rest on the horse's mane.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we reached the cross at the end of the linden-trees.
Selim bade good-night to all: he kissed the
hands of Pani d'Yves and wished to kiss Hania's; but she
would not consent, and looked at me as if afraid. But as
a recompense, when he was on horseback she approached
him and spoke. In the light of the moon, unobstructed
in that place, I saw her eyes raised to Selim's, and the
sweet expression of her face.</p>

<p>"Do not forget Pan Henryk. We shall always amuse
ourselves and sing together, and now good-night!" said
she, giving him her hand.</p>

<p>Hania and the older people went toward the house,
<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
Selim and I toward the meadows. We rode on some
time in silence by an open road without trees. Round
about it was so bright that one might count the needle-like
leaves on the low juniper bushes growing by the
road. From time to time the horses snorted, or a stirrup
struck against a stirrup. I looked at Selim; he was
thoughtful and turned his eyes to the depths of night.
I had an overpowering desire to speak of Hania. I felt
the need of confessing to some one the impressions of the
day, of telling every word of hers, but not a movement
could I make; I knew not how to begin that conversation.
Selim began it first, for suddenly, neither from one reason
nor another, he bent toward me, and embracing my neck
kissed me on the cheek, and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, my Henryk! how beautiful and charming thy
Hania is! Let the devil take Yozia!"</p>

<p>This exclamation chilled me like a sudden breath of
wintry wind. I made no answer, but removed Selim's
arm from my neck, and, pushing him away, rode on in
silence. I saw that he was greatly confused, and had
grown silent also; after a while, turning to me, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Art thou angry about something?"</p>

<p>"Thou art a child!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps thou art jealous?"</p>

<p>I reined in my horse.</p>

<p>"Good-night to thee, Selim."</p>

<p>It was evident that he had no desire to take further
farewell, but he stretched out his hand mechanically for
pressure. Then he opened his lips as if to say something;
but I turned my horse quickly, and trotted toward
home.</p>

<p>"Good-night!" cried Selim.</p>

<p>He stood a while yet on the same spot, then rode
slowly toward Horeli.
<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
</p>

<p>Lessening my speed, I rode at a walk. The night was
beautiful, calm, warm; the meadows, covered with dew,
seemed like broad lakes. From those meadows came the
voices of land rails; bitterns were calling in the distant
reeds. I raised my eyes to the starry immensity; I
wanted to pray and to cry.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard the tramp of a horse behind me. I
looked around; it was Selim. He had caught up, and,
coming before me in the road, said with a voice full of
emotion,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Henryk! I have come back because something is the
matter with thee. At first I thought: 'if he is angry, let
him be angry!' But afterward I grew sorry for thee. I
could not restrain myself. Tell me what the matter is.
Perhaps I have spoken too much with Hania? Perhaps
thou art in love with her, Henryk?"</p>

<p>Tears stopped my throat, and I could answer nothing at
once. If I had followed my first inspiration, thrown myself
on Selim's honest breast, cried there, and confessed
all! Ah! I remember that whenever I met an outpouring
of the heart in another, and opened my own heart
affectionately in response, a kind of irresistible, rebellious
pride, which should have been broken as a stone with a
pickaxe, froze my heart and bound the words on my lips.
How many times has my happiness been ruined by that
pride, and always have I regretted it later! Still at the
first moment I could never resist it.</p>

<p>"I was sorry for thee," continued Selim.</p>

<p>So he had compassion on me; that was sufficient to
shut my mouth. I was silent. He gazed at me with
his angelic eyes; he spoke with an accent of entreaty
and repentance in his voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Henryk! Perhaps thou lovest her? She, as thou
seest, has pleased me, but let this be the end. If thou
<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
wish, I will not say another word to her. Tell me: perhaps
thou art in love with her already? What hast thou
against me?"</p>

<p>"I do not love her, and I have nothing against thee.
I am a little weak. I was thrown from the horse; I got
shaken. I am not at all in love; I only fell from the
horse. Good-night to thee!"</p>

<p>"Henryk! Henryk!"</p>

<p>"I repeat to thee, I was thrown from the horse."</p>

<p>We parted again. Selim kissed me in farewell, and
rode away more calmly; for, in truth, it might be supposed
that the fall had had that effect on me. I remained
alone, with a straitened heart, in a kind of deep sorrow, in
tears which stopped my throat, moved by Selim's kindness,
angry with myself, and cursing my conduct in having
repulsed him. I let the horse go at a gallop, and
soon I was before the mansion.</p>

<p>The windows of the drawing-room were lighted; the
sound of the piano came through them. I gave the horse
to Franek, and entered. Hania was playing some song
which I did not know; she was playing for herself, falsifying
the melody with all a dilettante's confidence, for it
was not long since she had begun to learn, but it was
more than sufficient to enchant my spirit, which was
much more in love than it was musical. When I entered,
she smiled at me without ceasing to play. I threw myself
into an armchair standing opposite, and looked at
her. Over the music-rack her clear, serene forehead was
visible, and her brows, outlined symmetrically. Her eyelashes
were downcast, for she was looking at the keys.
She played some time yet, then stopped, and, raising her
eyes on me, said in a fondling, soft voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pan Henryk?"</p>

<p>"What, Hania?"
<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask something&mdash; Ah! Have you invited
Selim for to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No. Father wishes us to go to Ustrytsi to-morrow,
for a package has come from mother for Pani Ustrytski."</p>

<p>Hania was silent, and struck a few soft notes; but it
was evident that she did so only mechanically, while
thinking of something else, for after a while she raised
her eyes and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pan Henryk?"</p>

<p>"What, Hania?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you about something&mdash;Ah! here
it is! Is that Yozia in Warsaw very pretty?"</p>

<p>That was too much; anger, mixed with vexation, pressed
my heart. I approached the piano quickly; my lips were
trembling when I answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not prettier than thou. Be at rest. Thou mayst try
thy charms boldly on Selim."</p>

<p>Hania rose from the piano stool; a burning blush of
offence covered her face.</p>

<p>"Pan Henryk! what do you say?"</p>

<p>"That which thou wert aiming at."</p>

<p>I seized my hat, bowed to her, and left the room.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">IT is easy to divine how I passed the night after those
vexations of a whole day. When I had lain down,
I asked myself first of all what had happened, and why I
had had such adventures. The answer was easy: Nothing
had happened; that is, I could not reproach either
Selim or Hania with anything which might not be explained
by the friendliness which bound us all equally,
or by curiosity, or by mutual sympathy. That Selim
<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
pleased Hania, and she him, was more than certain; but
what right had I to be angered because of that, and destroy
every one's peace? Not they were at fault, but I.
This thought should have calmed me, but the opposite
happened. No matter how I explained their mutual
relations, though I saw that I had caused many vexations
unjustly to both, still, I felt that a certain unspeakable
danger was impending in the future; this consideration,
that the danger was not tangible, that it could not be
put in the form of a reproach against Selim or Hania,
made it felt all the more keenly by me. Besides this, I
thought of one other thing; namely, that not having the
right to reproach them, I had still sufficient reason for
alarm. These were all subtleties of the case, almost impossible
to be seized, in which my mind, still unsophisticated,
was entangled and tortured as if amid snares and
darkness. I felt simply wearied and broken, like a man
who has made a long journey; and still one other thought,
bitter and painful, came back to my head without ceasing;
namely, this, that it was I, expressly I, who by jealousy
and awkwardness, was impelling those two persons
toward each other. Oh, how much knowledge had I
been acquiring, though I had no knowledge whatever!
Such things are divined. What is more, I knew that,
amid all these wrong paths, I should go, not where I
wished to go, but where I should be urged by feelings
and circumstances, not infrequently temporary and insufficient,
but which are somehow important and on which
happiness often depends. I was very unhappy; and
though those vexations of mine might seem foolish to
some persons, I will say this, that the greatness of any
misfortune depends not on what it is in itself, but on how
one feels it.</p>

<p>And still nothing had happened. Lying in bed, I
<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
repeated these words to myself, till gradually my
thoughts began to grow dim, to scatter, and to fall into
the usual disorder of sleep. Various strange elements
pushed themselves into this disorder. My father's narratives,
persons and events in those narratives, were joined
then with Selim, Hania, and my love. Perhaps I had
some fever, all the more since I had fallen. The wick
of the burnt candle dropped all at once into the candlestick;
it grew dark, then blue flame flickered up, then less
of it, and still less, till at last the expiring light shone
brightly and died. It must have been late; the cocks
were crowing outside the window. I fell into an oppressive,
unhealthy sleep, out of which I rose not very
quickly.</p>

<p>Next morning it appeared that I had slept past the
breakfast hour, and past the chance of seeing Hania
before dinner, for she had lessons till two with Pani
d'Yves. But after a long sleep I took courage, and did
not look on the world as so black. "I will be kind
and cordial to Hania, and thus make amends for yesterday's
peevishness," thought I.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I had not foreseen one circumstance;
namely, that my last words had not only annoyed, but
offended her. When she came in with Pani d'Yves to
dinner, I hurried toward her quickly; and all at once,
as if some one had poured water on me, I withdrew
again into myself with my cordiality, not because I
wished to do so, but because I was repulsed. Hania
answered very politely, "Good-day," but so coldly that all
wish for heartfelt effusions deserted me. I sat down near
Pani d'Yves, and during the whole dinner Hania seemed
not to take note of my existence. I confess that that
existence appeared then so empty and pitiful in my eyes
that if any man had offered three coppers for it I would
<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
have told him to deliver the money. What was I to do?
The desire for resistance was roused in me, and I determined
to pay Hania in the same coin. That was a
wonderful r&ocirc;le regarding a person whom one loves above
everything. I could say truly, "Lips abuse thee, though
the heart weeps!" During the whole dinner we did not
speak once directly, only through the medium of others.
When Hania said, for example, that there would be rain
toward the evening, I turned to Pani d'Yves, and told her,
and not Hania, that there would be no rain. This pouting
and bickering had a certain exciting charm for me. "I
am curious to know, my young lady, how we shall get on
in Ustrytsi, for we must go there," thought I. "In
Ustrytsi, I will ask her something purposely in the presence
of others; she must answer then, and so the ice will
be broken." I promised myself much from that visit.
True, I had to go with Pani d'Yves; but how would that
harm me? At present I cared much more for this, that
no one at the table should take note of our anger. Should
any one notice it, thought I, that one would ask if we were
angry; then all would be discovered, all would come out.
At the very thought of this, a blush came to my face, and
fear pressed my heart. But, oh, wonder! I saw that
Hania feared this much less than I; besides, she saw my
fear, and in her soul was amused at it. In turn, I felt
overcome; but for the moment there was nothing to be
done. Ustrytsi was waiting for me, so I caught at that
thought as a plank of salvation.</p>

<p>Hania was thinking too of it, for after dinner, when she
brought black coffee to my father, she kissed his hand
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg not to go to Ustrytsi."</p>

<p>"Ah, what a rogue, what a rogue, that dear Hania!"
thought I, in my soul.
<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
</p>

<p>My father, who was a little deaf, did not hear at once.
Kissing her on the forehead, he asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What dost thou wish, little woman?"</p>

<p>"I have one prayer."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"That I may not go to Ustrytsi."</p>

<p>"But why, art thou ill?"</p>

<p>"If she says that she is ill," thought I, "all is lost, the
more since my father is in good humor."</p>

<p>But Hania never lied, even innocently; therefore, instead
of masking the lack of wish as a headache, she
answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am well, but I do not like to go."</p>

<p>"Ah! then thou wilt go to Ustrytsi, for there is need
of thy going."</p>

<p>Hania courtesied and went away without saying a
word. Had it been proper, I should have gladly shown
her zyg, zyg, zyg, on my fingers.</p>

<p>After a while I asked my father why he ordered
Hania to go.</p>

<p>"I wish the neighbors to see in her our relative, and
grow familiar with that position. Hania in going to
Ustrytsi goes there, so to speak, in the name of thy
mother; dost understand?"</p>

<p>Not only did I understand, but I wanted to kiss my
honest father for that thought.</p>

<p>We were to start at five o'clock. Hania and Pani
d'Yves were then dressing upstairs. I gave orders to
bring out a light carriage for two persons, since I intended
to go myself on horseback. It was three miles to
Ustrytsi, so with good weather we had a very pleasant
drive before us. Hania came down dressed in black, it is
true, but with care and even elegance, for such was my
father's desire. I could not take my eyes from her. She
<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
looked so beautiful that I felt my heart soften immediately;
the desire for resistance and the artificial coldness
flew away somewhere beyond the ninth boundary. But
my queen passed me in real queenly fashion; she did not
even look at me, though I had arrayed myself as best I
knew how. I may add in passing that she was somewhat
displeased, for really she had no desire to go, though that
was not from a wish to annoy me, but from more reasonable
causes which I discovered later.</p>

<p>At five o'clock punctually the ladies took their seats in
the carriage, and I mounted my horse; we started together.
On the road I held aside from Hania, wishing by
all means to arrest her attention. In fact, she looked
at me once when my horse reared, measured me with
calm eye from foot to head, even smiled, I thought,
though slightly, which gave me comfort at once; but
she turned quickly to Pani d'Yves and began to talk
with her in such a way that I could not take part in
the conversation.</p>

<p>We came at last to Ustrytsi. Selim had preceded us.
Pani Ustrytski was not there. We found at home only
Pan Ustrytski, the two governesses, one French, the other
German, and Pan Ustrytski's daughters,&mdash;the elder
Lola, a rather coquettish, pretty, chestnut-haired person
of the same age as Hania, and the younger, Marynia, a
child yet.</p>

<p>After the first greeting the ladies went at once to the
garden for strawberries; but Pan Ustrytski took Selim
and me to show us his new weapons, and his new dogs
for hunting wild boars; these dogs he had brought at great
cost from Vrotslavie. I have mentioned already that
Pan Ustrytski was the most passionate hunter in that
whole region, and moreover a very honorable and kind
man, as active as he was rich. He had only one fault,
<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
which made him annoying to me: he laughed all the
time; every few words he slapped his stomach, repeating,
"A farce, gracious benefactor! What is it called?" For
this reason people spoke of him as "Neighbor Farce," or
"Neighbor What-is-it-called."</p>

<p>Well, Neighbor Farce took us to the kennel, not considering
that perhaps we preferred a hundred times to be
with the ladies in the garden. We listened for a while
to his narratives, till at last I remembered something I
had to say to Pani d'Yves, and Selim said right out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"All this is very well, lord benefactor. The dogs are
beautiful; but what is to be done if we both have a
greater wish to go to the young ladies?"</p>

<p>"Ah, a farce, gracious benefactor! What is it called?
Well, go then; I will go with you."</p>

<p>And we went. Soon, however, it appeared that I had
nothing to wish for so greatly. Hania, who somehow
kept apart from her companions, did not cease to ignore
me, and occupied herself with Selim perhaps purposely.
It fell to my lot, moreover, to amuse Panna Lola. What
I talked of, how I avoided talking nonsense, how I answered
her friendly questions, I know not; for I followed
Selim and Hania incessantly, catching their words, observing
their looks and movements. Selim did not notice
me; but Hania did, and lowered her voice designedly, or
looked with a certain coquettishness on her companion,
who permitted himself to be borne away by that flood of
favor. "Wait, Hania," thought I; "thou art acting thus
to torment me; I will treat thee in the same way." And
taking things in that fashion, I turned to Panna Lola.
I have forgotten to say that this young person had a special
weakness for me, and showed it too plainly. I began to
pay court to her. I flattered her, and laughed, though I
had a greater wish to cry; but Lola looked at me, radiant,
<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
with her moist, dark blue eyes, and fell into a romantic
frame of mind.</p>

<p>Ah, if she had known how I hated her at that moment!
But I was so absorbed in my r&ocirc;le that I even did something
dishonorable. When Panna Lola, in the course of
conversation, made some malicious remark about Selim
and Hania, though in my soul I was quivering with
anger, I did not answer her as I should have done, but
merely smiled rather stupidly and passed it over in
silence.</p>

<p>We spent about an hour in this way; then lunch was
served under a weeping chestnut, which touched the
earth with the tips of its branches and formed a green
dome above our heads. Then I first learned that Hania's
repugnance to visiting Ustrytsi did not regard me; she
had better reasons.</p>

<p>The matter stood simply in this way: Pani d'Yves, as a
descendant of an ancient noble French house, and, besides,
better educated than other governesses, thought herself
somewhat superior to the French woman at Ustrytsi,
but especially superior to the German; while those two
in their turn thought themselves better than Hania,
because her grandfather had been a servant. The well-bred
Pani d'Yves did not let them know her feelings, but
they slighted Hania even to rudeness. Those were common
feminine quarrels and ambitions; still I could not permit
my dear Hania, who alone was worth a hundred times
more than all Ustrytsi, to be their victim. Hania endured
the slight with tact and sweetness which did honor to her
character, but still such treatment was bitter to her. Had
Pani Ustrytski been present, nothing of the kind would
have happened, but at that moment both governesses took
advantage of the favorable occasion. As soon as Selim sat
near Hania, whispers and jests began, in which even Panna
<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
Lola took some part, because she was jealous of Hania's
beauty. I rebuffed those taunts a number of times sharply,
perhaps even too sharply; but soon Selim took my place in
spite of me. I saw a flash of anger shoot across his brows;
but he bethought himself quickly and turned a calm, sneering
glance on the governesses. Incisive, witty, and eloquent
as few persons at his age, he soon confused them so
much that they knew not where to take refuge. Pani
d'Yves, with her dignity, aided him, and also I, who would
have driven out the two foreign women. Panna Lola, not
wishing to offend me, came over also to our side, and,
though insincerely, showed Hania a kindness twofold
greater than usual. In a word, our victory was perfect, but
unfortunately, and to my great vexation, the chief merit
this time fell also to Selim. Hania, who, notwithstanding
all her tact, hardly restrained tears from suffusing her
eyes, looked at Selim as her savior, with thankfulness
and homage. So when we rose from the table and began
to walk again through the garden in couples, I saw her
incline toward Selim, and heard her whisper,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pan Selim! I am very&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she stopped suddenly, for she was afraid of weeping;
emotion was uppermost in spite of her.</p>

<p>"Panna Hania, do not mention that. Do not mind it; do
not be troubled."</p>

<p>"You see how difficult it is for me to speak of this
matter, but I wished to thank you."</p>

<p>"For what, Panna Hania? For what? I cannot endure
tears in your eyes. For you I would gladly&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now in his turn he did not finish, for he could not find
the expression; and perhaps he noticed in season that
he had let the feelings with which his breast was filled
go too far, so he turned away his face not to let his emotion
be seen, and was silent.
<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
</p>

<p>Hania looked at him with eyes bright from tears, and I
then did not ask what had happened.</p>

<p>I loved Hania with all the power of a youthful soul; I
deified her; I loved her with the love which is only in
heaven. I loved her form, her eyes, every hair of her head,
the sound of her words. I loved every bit of her dress.
I loved the air which she breathed; that love pervaded
me through and through, and was not only in my heart,
but in my whole being. I lived only in her and through
her; that love flowed in me as my blood; it radiated from
me as the warmth of my body. For others something besides
love might exist; for me the whole world existed
in love; there was nothing beyond it. To the world I was
blind, deaf, and indifferent, for my reason and senses were
held by that single feeling. I felt that I was blazing
like a lighted torch, that that flame was devouring me, that
I was dying. What was that love? A mighty voice, a
mighty calling of one soul to another, "My deified, my
sacred one, my love, hear me!" I did not inquire what
had happened, for I understood that not to me, not to me,
was Hania answering that heart question. In the midst
of indifferent people, a man thirsting for love wanders as
in a forest, and he shouts and calls as in a forest, waiting
to learn if some voice of sympathy will answer him; so
now I did not ask any longer what had happened, for beside
my own love and my own useless shouting, I felt and
overheard two voices in sympathy, the voices of Selim
and Hania. They were calling to each other mutually
with the voices of hearts; they were calling unfortunately
for me, and they themselves did not know that. One was to
the other as a forest echo, and one followed the other as
the echo follows the voice. And what could I do against
this necessity which they could call happiness, but which
I must call misfortune? What could avail against that
<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
order of nature, against that fatal logic of things? How
win Hania's heart when some irresistible power was impelling
it in another direction?</p>

<p>I separated from the company and sat on a bench of the
garden, and thoughts like these were sounding in my head,
like flocks of frightened birds. A madness of despair and
suffering seized me. I felt that in the midst of my
family, in the midst of well-wishing hearts, I was lonely.
To me the whole world seemed a desert, seemed orphaned;
the heaven above me was so indifferent to the wrong done
by people that in spite of me one thought beyond others
mastered me, swallowed everything, and covered me with
its gloomy peace. The name of it was death. And then,
an escape from that vicious circle, an end to sufferings, an
end of all that sad comedy, a cutting of all the painful
knots binding the soul, and repose after torture,&mdash;ah!
that repose, for which I was so thirsty, that dark repose,
that repose of nothingness, but calm and eternal.</p>

<p>I was one exhausted by tears, by suffering and drowsiness.
Oh, to sleep! to sleep at any price, even at the
price of life. Then from the calm immense blue of heaven
to which my former faith of childhood had fled, one thought
flew to me like a bird and sat in my brain. That thought
was in the brief words: but if&mdash;</p>

<p>That was a new circle in which I was involved by the
force of implacable necessity. Oh, I suffered greatly, but
there from the neighboring alley joyous words came to me,
or low, half-audible whispers of conversation. Around me
was the odor of flowers; on the trees twittering birds were
settling themselves to rest; above me hung the calm sky,
ruddy with the evening twilight. All was peaceful, all
happy; amidst that bloom of life, in pain and with set teeth,
I alone desired to die. Suddenly I trembled; before me
rustled the dress of a woman.
<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
</p>

<p>I looked; it was Panna Lola. She was calm and mild;
she looked at me with sympathy, and perhaps with more
than sympathy. Amidst the light of evening and the
shadows cast by the trees, she seemed pale; her abundant
tresses, unwound as if by chance, fell upon her shoulders.</p>

<p>At that moment I did not feel any hatred toward her.
"Oh; thou single compassionate soul!" thought I, "dost
thou come to console me?"</p>

<p>"Pan Henryk, you are somehow sad, perhaps suffering?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, suffering," cried I, with an outburst; and
seizing her hand I placed it against my burning forehead,
then I kissed it quickly and ran off.</p>

<p>"Pan Henryk!" cried she after me, in a low voice.</p>

<p>But at that moment, at the crossing of the paths,
appeared Selim and Hania. Both had seen my outburst,
had seen me kiss and press Lola's hand to my forehead,
so smiling, they exchanged glances, as if saying to each
other, "We understand what that means."</p>

<p>But soon it was time to go home. Immediately beyond
the gate Selim's road lay in another direction, but I was
afraid that he might wish to conduct us. I mounted in
haste, and said aloud that it was late, and time for Selim
and me. When parting, I received from Panna Lola a
wonderfully warm pressure of the hand, to which I gave
no response.</p>

<p>Selim turned immediately beyond the gate; for the
first time he kissed Hania's hand for good-night, and she
did not forbid.</p>

<p>She ceased to ignore me. She was in too mild a mood
to remember the morning anger, but I interpreted that
mood of mind in the worst sense possible. Pani d'Yves
fell asleep after a few moments, and began to nod in all
directions. I looked at Hania. She was not asleep; her
<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
eyes, opened widely, were bright as if from happiness.
She did not break the silence; she was evidently too
much occupied with her own thoughts. Only when near
the house did she look at me, and, seeing that I was so
meditative, she asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of what are you thinking? Is it of Lola?"</p>

<p>I did not answer a word; I only gritted my teeth. Tear,
tear me, if that gives thee pleasure; from me thou wilt
not get one groan.</p>

<p>Hania in reality had not even dreamed of tearing me.
She asked, for she had a right to ask. Astonished at my
silence, she repeated the question. Again I gave no
answer. She thought, therefore, that it was pouting continued
since morning, and so was silent.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">ONE morning, some days later, the first ruddy light
of early dawn came in through a heart cut in the
window-shutter, and roused me from sleep. Soon after,
some one knocked on the shutter; and in the rosy opening
appeared, not the face of Mitskewich's Zosia, who in a
similar manner roused Tadeush, nor of my Hania either,
but the mustached face of Vah, the forester, and his deep
voice cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Panich!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Wolves are following a wolf bitch in the Pohorovy
woods. Shall we go to lure them?"</p>

<p>"Right away!"</p>

<p>I dressed, took my gun and hunter's knife, and went
out. Vah was all wet from the morning dew; on his
shoulder was a single-barrelled gun, long and rusty, but
<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
he never missed aim with this piece. It was early; the sun
had not risen yet. People had not gone to their work, nor
cattle to pasture. The sky was only colored blue, rosy
and golden on the east; on the west it was sombre. The
old man hurried in his fashion.</p>

<p>"I have a horse and cart. Let us ride to the Pits,"
said he.</p>

<p>We took our seats and drove on. Just beyond the
granaries a hare, or rabbit, sprang out of the oats, ran
across the road and into the meadow, marking with a
darker trace the surface silvered over by dew.</p>

<p>"A cat crosses the road!" said the forester; "a charm
on a dog!" Then added: "It is late already. The earth
will soon get a shadow."</p>

<p>This meant that the sun would rise before long, for
with the light of dawn bodies cast no shadow.</p>

<p>"But is it bad hunting when there are shadows?"
asked I.</p>

<p>"With long shadows it is passable, but with short ones
useless work."</p>

<p>In hunter's language this meant that the later the
hour, the worse the hunting, for, as is known, the nearer
midday the shorter the shadows.</p>

<p>"Where shall we begin?" asked I.</p>

<p>"At the Pits in the Pohorovy woods."</p>

<p>The Pohorovy woods were a part of the forest which
was very dense,&mdash;that part where "the Pits" were; that
is, holes made by the roots of old trees thrown down by
storms.</p>

<p>"And do you think that luring will succeed?"</p>

<p>"I will begin to play as a wolf bitch, perhaps some wolf
will come."</p>

<p>"But he may not."</p>

<p>"Ei! he will come."
<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
</p>

<p>When we reached Vah's cottage we left the horse and
cart, and went forward on foot. After half an hour's walk,
when the sun had begun to rise, we sat down in a pit.</p>

<p>Round about us was a thicket of impenetrable small
growth; only here and there were enormous trees. The
pit was so deep that even our heads were concealed in it.</p>

<p>"Now back to back!" muttered Vah.</p>

<p>We sat back to back; above the surface of the ground
appeared only the crowns of our heads and the gun-barrels.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Vah. "I will play."</p>

<p>Putting two fingers in his mouth and modulating his
drawling voice with them, he began to imitate a wolf
bitch; that is, to howl like a she-wolf when she entices
he-wolves.</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>And he placed his ear to the ground.</p>

<p>I heard nothing, but Vah took his face from the earth
and whispered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, there is sport, but far away, two miles."</p>

<p>Then he waited a quarter of an hour; again he put his
fingers to his mouth and howled. The doleful, ominous
sound passed through the thicket; and far, far away it
flew over the damp earth, rebounding from pine to pine.
Vah put his ear to the ground again.</p>

<p>"They are playing, but not farther than a mile away."</p>

<p>Indeed, I heard then, as it were a distant echo of howling,
very far away yet, barely audible.</p>

<p>"Where will it come out?" asked I.</p>

<p>"On you, Panich."</p>

<p>Vah howled a third time; a howling answered quite
near now. I grasped the gun more firmly, and we held
the breath in our breasts. The silence was absolute; a
breeze merely shook from hazel-nut bushes dewdrops,
<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
which fell pattering on the leaves. From afar, from the
other edge of the forest, came the calling of wood grouse.</p>

<p>Suddenly, some three hundred yards distant, something
shook in the forest. The juniper bushes moved quickly,
and from the midst of the dark needle-like leaves emerged
a triangular head, gray, with pointed ears and red eyes. I
could not shoot, for the head was too far away, so I waited
patiently, though with beating heart. Soon the whole beast
came out of the junipers, and with a few short springs ran
up toward the pit, smelling carefully on every side. At
one hundred and fifty yards the wolf halted and listened,
as if foreboding something. I saw that he would not come
nearer, and drew the trigger.</p>

<p>The report of the gun was mingled with the painful
cry of the wolf. I sprang out of the pit, Vah after me,
but we did not find the wolf at the place. Vah, however,
examined the spot carefully where the dew was wiped
away on the ground, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"He colors!"</p>

<p>Indeed, there were traces of blood on the grass.</p>

<p>"You haven't missed, though far. He is coloring.
Oh, he is coloring! We must follow."</p>

<p>And so we went. Here and there we came upon
trampled grass and more traces of blood. The wounded
wolf rested from time to time; that was evident. Meanwhile
an hour passed in woods and thickets, then a
second. The sun was now high; we had gone over an
immense piece of road without finding a thing except
traces, which at times disappeared altogether. Then we
came to the corner of the forest; traces continued for about
two versts more through a field toward the pond, and were
lost at last in swampy ground covered with reeds and
sweet flag. It was impossible to go farther without a
dog.
<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
</p>

<p>"He will stay there; I shall find him to-morrow," said
Vah, and we turned toward home.</p>

<p>Soon I ceased to think of Vah's wolf and the result of
the hunt, which was rather unfortunate. I returned to my
usual circle of suffering. When we were approaching
the forest, a hare sprang up almost from under my feet;
instead of shooting it, I trembled, as if roused from sleep.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Vah, in indignation, "I would shoot my
own brother if he jumped up in that way."</p>

<p>I only laughed and went on in silence. When crossing
the so-called "forest road" which led to the highway
of Horeli, I saw fresh tracks of a horse wearing shoes.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Vah, what tracks these are?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me that they are made by the young
Panich from Horeli, on his way to the mansion."</p>

<p>"Then I will go to the mansion. Farewell, Vah."</p>

<p>Vah begged me timidly to go to his cottage, which was
not far, to refresh myself a little. I saw that in case of
refusal I should cause him great pain; still I refused, but
promised to come next morning. I did not wish to leave
Selim and Hania together long without me.</p>

<p>During the five days which had passed since the visit
to Ustrytsi Selim had come almost daily. But I guarded
them like the eye in my head, and to-day for the first
time came the chance that they could be alone. "Now,"
thought I, "it will come to a confession between them,"
and I felt that I was growing as pale as he who loses
hope of hope.</p>

<p>I feared this as a misfortune, an unavoidable sentence
of death, which we know to be coming, but which we
delay as long as possible.</p>

<p>On reaching home, I met Father Ludvik in front of the
mansion, with a bag on his head, and a wire net over his
face; he was going to the beehives.
<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
</p>

<p>"Is Selim here, Father Ludvik?" asked I.</p>

<p>"He is; he came about an hour and a half ago."</p>

<p>"Where shall I find him?"</p>

<p>"He went to the pond with Hania and Evunia."</p>

<p>I ran to the garden quickly, then to the brink of the
pond where the boats were. One of the largest was
missing. I looked out over the pond, but at first could
see nothing. I guessed that Selim must have turned to
the right toward the alders; in this way the boat and
those in it were concealed by the reeds on the bank. I
seized an oar, sprang into a one-seated boat, pushed out
quietly, kept among the reeds, did not leave them. There
I could see without being visible.</p>

<p>In fact, I soon saw them. On a broad part of the pond,
free of reeds, was a motionless boat, the oars hanging. At
one end was sitting my little sister, Evunia, turned away
from Hania and Selim; at the other end were the two.
Evunia, bending over the boat, struck the water joyously
with her little hands, and was occupied entirely with this
amusement; but Selim and Hania, almost leaning against
each other, seemed absorbed in conversation. Not the
least breath of wind wrinkled the transparent blue surface;
the boat, Hania, Evunia, and Selim were reflected
in it as in a mirror, calm, motionless.</p>

<p>That was a very beautiful picture, perhaps, but at sight
of it the blood rushed to my head; I understood everything.
They had taken Evunia, for the child could not be
in their way or understand their confessions. They took
her for appearance' sake. "All is over," thought I. "All
is over!" sounded the reeds. "All is over!" blurted out
the ripple, striking the side of my boat; and it grew
dark in my eyes. I felt cold and hot. I felt that pallor
was covering my face. "Thou hast lost Hania! thou hast
lost her!" cried voices above me and in me. Then I
<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
heard, as it were, the same voices crying, "Jesus, Mary!"
and then these continued, "Push up nearer; hide in the
reeds; thou wilt see more!" I obeyed, and pushed on
with the boat as silently as a cat. But at that distance I
could not hear conversation; I only saw more distinctly
that they were sitting side by side on one bench, not holding
each other's hands, but Selim was turned toward
Hania. It seemed to me after a while that he was kneeling
before her, but it only seemed so. He was turned
toward her and was looking at her entreatingly; she was
not looking at him, but seemed to glance on every side
and unquietly; then she raised her eyes. I saw that she
was confused; I saw that he was begging for something.
I saw finally that he placed his palms together before her,
that she turned her head and eyes toward him slowly,
that she began to lean toward him, but suddenly recovered
herself and pushed back toward the edge of the
boat. Then he seized her hand, as though fearing that she
might fall into the water. I saw that he did not let the
hand go; after that I saw nothing. I let the oar drop,
and I fell on the bottom of the boat, for a cloud covered
my eyes. "Save! save, O God!" cried I, in spirit; "here
they are killing a man!" I felt that breath lacked me.
Oh, how I loved her, and how unhappy I was! Lying on
the bottom of the boat and tearing my clothing with rage,
I felt all the helplessness of that rage. Yes; I was powerless,
powerless as an athlete with bound hands, for what
could I do? I might kill Selim; I might drive my boat
against theirs and sink both in the water; but from
Hania's heart I could not tear her love for Selim and
take it for myself alone,&mdash;that was impossible.</p>

<p>Ah, that feeling of powerless rage, that conviction that
there is no help, seemed almost worse at that moment
than any other. I had always been ashamed to cry
<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
even before myself. If pain pressed tears from my eyes
by force, pride kept them back with force not inferior.
But now at last burst forth the helpless rage which was
rending my breast; and in my loneliness, in presence of
that boat with the loving pair reflected in the water, in
presence of that calm sky and those reeds rustling plaintively
above my head, and in my sadness and misfortune,
I burst into measureless sobbing, into one great wave of
tears, and, lying on my back with hands clasped above
my head, I almost bellowed with mighty, unspeakable
sorrow.</p>

<p>Then I grew weak. A numbness came over me. My
thinking power almost ceased to act; I felt cold at the
points of my fingers and toes. I grew weaker and
weaker. I used the remnant of my thought. It seemed
that death and a great and icy calm were drawing near.
It seemed that that gloomy queen of the grave was taking
me into her possession, so I greeted her with a calm,
glassy eye. "It is over," thought I, and a great weight,
as it were, fell from my breast.</p>

<p>But it was not over. How long I lay thus on the
bottom of the boat, I could not tell. Light, downy
clouds were moving along the vault of heaven. Lapwings
and storks, calling sadly, flew by in succession.
The sun had risen high in the heavens and was burning
with heat. The breeze had gone down; the motionless
reeds had ceased to rustle. I woke, as if from sleep, and
looked around. The boat with Hania and Selim was no
longer before me. The silence, repose, and delight which
reigned in all nature were in wonderful contrast to the
torpor in which I had wakened a moment before. Round
about all was calm and smiling. Dark sapphire water-grasshoppers
were sitting on the edges of the boat and
on the leaves of water-lilies which were as flat as shields;
<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
little gray birds were swinging on the reeds, twittering
sweetly; here and there buzzed an industrious bee that
had wandered in over the water; sometimes from the
sweet flag wild ducks were heard; teal escorted their
young to the plain of water. Before my eyes, the kingdoms
and commonwealths of birds drew aside the curtains
concealing their daily life; but I looked at nothing. My
torpor had not passed. The day was hot; I felt an unendurable
headache. Bending over the boat, I seized water
with my hands and drank it with parched lips. That
brought back some strength to me. Taking the oar, I
moved among reeds toward the landing-place. How late
it was! and at home they must have inquired for me.</p>

<p>On the road I tried to calm myself. "If Selim and
Hania have confessed that they love each other," thought
I, "it may be better that all is passed. At least, the
cursed days of uncertainty are over." Misfortune had
raised its visor and stood before me with clear face. I
knew it, and must struggle with it. Wonderful thing!
this thought began to have for me a certain painful
charm. But still I was uncertain, and resolved to examine
Evunia adroitly, at least in as far as was possible.</p>

<p>I was at home for dinner. I greeted Selim coldly, and
sat down at the table in silence. My father looked at
me and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is the matter with thee,&mdash;art sick?"</p>

<p>"No; I am well, but weary. I rose at three in the
morning."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I went with Vah to hunt wolves. I shot one. Later
on I lay down to sleep, and my head aches somewhat."</p>

<p>"But look in the glass, and see what a face thou hast."</p>

<p>Hania stopped eating for a while, and looked at me
carefully.
<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
</p>

<p>"Perhaps yesterday's visit to Ustrytsi has acted on
you, Pan Henryk," said she.</p>

<p>I looked her straight in the eyes and inquired almost
sharply,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What dost thou mean by that?"</p>

<p>Hania was confused and began to explain something
indistinctly. Selim came to her aid,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But that is very natural. Whoever is in love grows
thin."</p>

<p>I looked now at Hania, now at Selim, and replied
slowly, putting a sharp accent on each syllable,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not see that ye are growing thin, either thou or
Hania."</p>

<p>A scarlet flush covered the faces of both. A moment
of very awkward silence followed. I myself was uncertain
whether I had not gone too far, but fortunately my
father had not heard what was said. The priest took it
as the usual chaffing of young people.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is a wasp with a sting!" cried he, taking
snuff. "He has given it to you. See now, don't tackle
him."</p>

<p>O Lord, how little that triumph comforted me, and how
gladly I would have transferred it to Selim!</p>

<p>After dinner, in passing through the drawing-room, I
looked in the glass. Really, I looked like Piotrovin.
<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3">
</a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> It
was blue under my eyes; my face was sunk. It seemed
to me that I had grown wonderfully ugly, but that was
all one to me then. I went to find Evunia. Both my
little sisters had dined earlier than we, and were in the
garden, where a gymnasium for children had been fixed.
Evunia was sitting carelessly on a wooden platform hung
by four cords to the crossbeam of a swing. While sitting
there, she was talking to herself, shaking the locks of her

<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
golden head from time to time and swinging her feet.
When she saw me she laughed and stretched forth her
little hands. I took her in my arms and went down the
alley with her. Then I sat on a bench, and, putting
Evunia before me, asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What has Evunia been doing to-day?"</p>

<p>"Evunia went to walk with her husband and Hania,"
answered the little girl, boastingly.</p>

<p>Evunia called Selim her husband.</p>

<p>"And was Evunia polite?"</p>

<p>"She was."</p>

<p>"Ah, that is well, for polite children always listen to
what older people say, and remember that they have
something to learn. But does Evunia remember what
Selim said to Hania?"</p>

<p>"I have forgotten."</p>

<p>"Ei, maybe Evunia remembers a little?"</p>

<p>"I have forgotten."</p>

<p>"Thou art not polite! Let Evunia remember right off,
or I shall not love Evunia."</p>

<p>The little girl began to rub one eye with her fist; and
with the other, which was full of tears, she looked at me
from under her brow, and frowning, as if to cry, her lips
already quivering and in the form of a horseshoe, she
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have forgotten."</p>

<p>What could the poor little thing answer? Indeed,
I seemed to myself idiotic, and immediately was ashamed
of having spoken with deceitful tongue to that innocent
little angel,&mdash;to ask one thing, wishing to learn another.
Besides Evunia was the pet of the whole house, and my
pet, so I did not wish to torment her any further. I
kissed her, stroked her hair, and let her go. The little
girl ran at once to the swing, and I walked off as wise as
<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
before, but still with the conviction in my heart that a
confession had passed between Selim and Hania.</p>

<p>Toward evening Selim said to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall not see thee for a week; I am going on a
journey."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked I, with indifference.</p>

<p>"My father commands me to visit his brother in
Shumna. I must stay there about a week."</p>

<p>I looked at Hania. That information called out no
impression on her face. Evidently Selim had told her
of the visit already.</p>

<p>She smiled, raised her eyes from her work, looked at
Selim somewhat cunningly, somewhat perversely, and
asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But are you glad to go there?"</p>

<p>"As glad as a mastiff to go to a chain," answered he,
quickly; but he restrained himself in time, and seeing
that Pani d'Yves, who could not endure anything trivial,
was making a wry face, he added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg pardon for the expression. I love my uncle;
but you see it is pleasanter here for me, near Pani d'Yves."
And speaking thus, he cast a sentimental glance at Pani
d'Yves, which roused laughter in all, not excluding Pani
d'Yves herself, who, though she was easily offended, had
a special weakness for Selim. She took him gently by
the ear and said with a kindly smile,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Young man, I might be thy mother."</p>

<p>Selim kissed her hand, and there was concord; but I
thought to myself, what a difference between me and that
Selim! If I had Hania's affection, I should merely dream
and look toward the sky. What place should I have for
jokes! but he laughs, jokes, is joyous as never before.
Even when radiant with happiness, he was always joyful.
Just before going he said to me,
<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dost know what I will say? Come with me."</p>

<p>"I will not; I have not the least intention."</p>

<p>The cold tone of the answer struck Selim somewhat.</p>

<p>"Thou hast become strange," said he. "I do not know
thee for some time&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Finish."</p>

<p>"But everything is forgiven those who are in love."</p>

<p>"Unless those who cross our path," answered I, with
the voice of the stone Comandore.</p>

<p>Selim struck me with a glance as sharp as lightning,
and went to the bottom of my soul.</p>

<p>"What dost thou say?"</p>

<p>"I say that I will not go, and, secondly, that one does
not forgive everything!"</p>

<p>Had it not been that all were present at this conversation,
Selim certainly would have made the whole question
clear at once. But I did not wish to make it clear till I
had more positive proof. I saw, however, that my last
words had disquieted Selim and alarmed Hania. He
loitered yet awhile, putting off his departure under trifling
pretexts, and then, choosing the moment, said to me
in a low voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take a horse and conduct me. I wish to speak to
thee."</p>

<p>"Another time," answered I, aloud. "To-day I feel
somewhat weak."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">SELIM went really to his uncle and stayed there, not a
week, but ten days. For us those days passed in
gloom. Hania seemed to avoid me and look on me with
concealed fear. I had no intention indeed to speak with
<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
her sincerely about anything, for pride tied the words on
my lips; and she, I know not why, so arranged affairs
that we were never alone for an instant. At last she grew
sad, looked wretched and thin. Noting this sadness, I
trembled and thought, "Indeed, this is not the passing
caprice of a girl; it is a genuine, deep feeling, unfortunately."</p>

<p>I was irritable, gloomy, and sad. In vain did my
father, the priest, and Pani d'Yves inquire what the
matter was. Was I sick? I answered in the negative;
their solicitude simply annoyed me. I passed whole
days alone, on horseback; sometimes I was in the woods,
sometimes among the reeds in a boat. I lived like a
savage. Once I spent a whole night in a forest, with a
gun and a dog, before a fire which I had kindled purposely.
Sometimes I spent half a day with our shepherd,
who was a doctor, and grown wild through continual
solitude; he was eternally collecting herbs and testing
their properties. This man initiated me into a fantastic
world of spells and superstitions.</p>

<p>But would any one believe it, there were moments
when I grieved for Selim and my "circles of suffering"
as I called them.</p>

<p>Once the idea came to me of visiting Mirza Davidovich
in Horeli. The old man was captivated by this, that I
visited him for his own sake, and received me with open
arms. But I had come with another intent. I wished
to look at those eyes in the portrait of Sobieski's terrible
colonel of light horse. And when I saw those evil eyes
turning everywhere after a man, I remembered my own
ancestors, whose counterfeits hung at home in the drawing-room;
they were equally stern and iron-like.</p>

<p>My mind, under the influence of such impressions,
came to a condition of wonderful exaltation. Loneliness,
<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
the silence of night, life with nature,&mdash;all these should
have acted on me with soothing effect; but within me I
carried, as it were, a poisoned arrow. At times I gave
myself up to dreams, which made that condition still
worse. More than once, while lying in some remote
corner of a pine wood, or in a boat among reeds, I imagined
that I was in Hania's apartment at her feet; that I
was kissing her hands, her feet, her dress; that I was
calling her by the most fondling names, and she, placing
her hands on my heated forehead, was saying: "Thou
hast suffered enough; let us forget everything! It was a
bitter dream. I love thee, Henryk." But then came the
awakening and the dull reality,&mdash;that future of mine,
gloomy as a day of clouds, always without her, to the end
of life without her; this future seemed to me all the
more terrible. I grew misanthropic, avoided people, even
my father, the priest, and Pani d'Yves. Kazio, with his
talkativeness of a boy, his curiosity, his eternal laughter
and endless tricks, disgusted me to the utmost.</p>

<p>And still those honest people tried to distract me, and
suffered in secret over my condition, not knowing how to
explain it. Hania, whether she divined something or
not,&mdash;for she had strong reason to suppose that I was in
love with Lola Ustrytski,&mdash;did what she could to console
me. But I was so harsh even toward her that she could
not free herself of a certain dread when talking to me.
My father himself, usually severe and unsparing, strove
to distract me, turn my attention to something, and
meanwhile to test me. More than once, he began conversations
which, as he judged, should be of interest.
One day after dinner we went out in front of the
mansion.</p>

<p>"Does not a certain thing strike thee at times?" asked
he, looking at me inquiringly; "I wanted to ask thee
<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
about it this good while,&mdash;does it not strike thee that
Selim is circling a little too much about Hania?"</p>

<p>Judging the case simply, I should have grown confused
and let myself be caught, as they say, in the very act.
But I was in such a state of mind that I did not betray
by one quiver the impression which my father's words made
on me, and replied calmly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No; I know that he is not."</p>

<p>It wounded me that my father took part in those
questions. I considered that, since the affair touched me
alone, I alone should decide it.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou guarantee that?" asked my father.</p>

<p>"I will. Selim is in love with a schoolgirl in Warsaw."</p>

<p>"I say this, for thou art Hania's guardian, and 'tis thy
duty to watch over her."</p>

<p>I knew that my honest father said this to rouse my
ambition, occupy me with something, and snatch my
thoughts from that gloomy circle in which I seemed to be
turning; but I answered, as if in perverseness, indifferently
and gloomily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What sort of guardian am I? Thou wert not here, so
old Mikolai left her to me, but I am not the real guardian."</p>

<p>My father frowned; seeing, however, that in this way
he could not bring me to terms, he chose another. He
smiled under his gray mustache, half closed one eye, in
the fashion of a soldier, took me gently by the ear, and
asked, as if joking,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But has Hania, perhaps, turned thine own head?
Speak, my boy."</p>

<p>"Hania? Not in the least. That would amuse thee."</p>

<p>I lied as if possessed; but it passed off more smoothly
than I had expected.</p>

<p>"Then has not Lola Ustrytski? Hei?"</p>

<p>"Lola Ustrytski, a coquette!"
<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
</p>

<p>My father became impatient.</p>

<p>"Then what the devil is it? If thou art not in love, go
as a soldier to the first muster."</p>

<p>"Do I know what the matter is? Nothing is the matter
with me."</p>

<p>But I was tormented and made more impatient by questions
which in their anxiety neither my father nor the priest
spared, nor even Pani d'Yves. At last relations with them
became disagreeable. I was carried away by everything
and enraged at every trifle. Father Ludvik saw in this
certain traits of a despotic character coming to the surface
with age, and looking at my father significantly he laughed
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Topknot chickens by blood!"</p>

<p>But even he lost patience sometimes. Between my
father and me there were frequently very disagreeable
passages. Once at dinner during a dispute about nobility
and democracy I so forgot myself as to declare that I
should prefer a hundred times not to be born a noble.
My father ordered me to leave the room. The women
fell to crying because of this, and the whole house was
embittered for two days.</p>

<p>As to me, I was neither an aristocrat nor a democrat; I
was simply in love and unhappy. There was no place in
me whatever for principles, theories, or social convictions;
and if I fought in the name of some against others, I did
so only through vexation, to annoy it is unknown whom or
why, just as I began religious disputes with Father Ludvik
to annoy him. These disputes ended with slamming of
doors. In short, I poisoned not the existence of myself only,
but that of the whole house; and when after ten days Selim
returned, a stone, as it were, fell from every one's breast.
When he came I was not at home, for I was racing
about through the neighborhood on horseback. I returned
<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
only toward evening and went straight to the farm buildings,
where a stable-boy said, while taking my horse,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Panich has come from Horeli."</p>

<p>At that moment Kazio came up and repeated the same
news.</p>

<p>"I know that already," answered I, harshly. "Where
is Selim now?"</p>

<p>"In the garden with Hania, I think. I will go and look
for him."</p>

<p>We both went to the garden, but Kazio ran ahead. I,
not hurrying purposely with the greeting, had not gone
fifty steps when, at the bend of the alley, I saw Kazio
hastening back.</p>

<p>Kazio, who was a great rogue and a joker, began from afar
to make gestures and grimaces like a monkey. His face
was red; he held his finger to his mouth and laughed,
stifling laughter at the same time. When he came up to
me he called in a low voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Henryk! He! he! he! Tsss!"</p>

<p>"What art thou doing?" asked I, in ill-humor.</p>

<p>"Tss! as I love mamma! he! he! Selim is kneeling
before Hania in the hop arbor. As I love mamma!"</p>

<p>I caught him immediately by the arms and drove my
fingers into them.</p>

<p>"Be silent! Stay here! Not a word to anybody,
dost understand? Stay here! I will go myself; but be
silent, not a word before any one, if thy life is dear to
thee."</p>

<p>Kazio, who from the beginning had considered the whole
affair on the humorous side, seeing the corpse-like pallor
that covered my face, was evidently frightened, and stood
on the spot with open mouth; but I ran on, as if mad,
toward the arbor.</p>

<p>Crawling forward quickly and silently as a serpent, between
<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
the barberry bushes which surrounded the arbor, I
worked myself up to the very wall; the wall was made of
small short bits of sticks, so I could hear and see everything.
The repulsive r&ocirc;le of a listener did not seem repulsive
at all to me. I pushed aside the leaves very delicately
and thrust forward my ear.</p>

<p>"There is some one near by!" said the low, suppressed
whisper of Hania.</p>

<p>"No; only leaves moving on the branches," answered
Selim.</p>

<p>I looked at them through the green veil of the leaves.
Selim was not kneeling near Hania now; he was sitting at
her side on a low bench. She was as pale as linen; her
eyes were closed, her head inclined and resting on his
shoulder. He had encircled her waist with his arm, and
drawn her toward him with love and delight.</p>

<p>"I love, Hania! I love! I love!" repeated he, whispering
passionately; and inclining his head he sought her lips
with his. She drew back, as if warding off the kiss, but
still their lips met and remained joined in that manner
long, long; it seemed to me whole ages.</p>

<p>And then I thought that all which they had wished to
say to each other they said in that kiss. Some sort of
shame stopped their words. They had daring enough for
kisses, but not enough for speech. A deathlike silence
reigned, and amid that silence there came to me merely
their quick and passionate breathing.</p>

<p>I seized the wooden grating of the arbor with my hands,
and feared lest I might crush it into bits with that convulsive
pressure. It grew dark in my eyes; I felt a turning
of the head; the earth flew somewhere from under me
into a bottomless pit. But even at the price of my life I
wished to hear what they were saying; hence I mastered
myself again, and catching the air with parched lips, with
<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
forehead pressed to the grating, I listened, counting every
breath which they drew.</p>

<p>Silence continued some time yet. At last Hania began
in a whisper,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Enough, enough! I dare not look you in the eyes.
Let us leave this."</p>

<p>And turning her head aside, she tried to tear herself
out of his arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hania! what is taking place in me? I am so
happy!" cried Selim.</p>

<p>"Let us go from here. Some one will come."</p>

<p>Selim sprang up with gleaming eyes and distended
nostrils.</p>

<p>"Let the whole world come," said he. "I love, and I
will say so in the eyes of all people. I know not how
this happened. I struggled with myself; I suffered, for it
seemed to me that Henryk loved thee, and thou him.
But now I care for nothing. Thou lovest me, and so it
is a question of thy happiness. Oh, Hania! Hania!"</p>

<p>And here again was the sound of a kiss; and then
Hania began to speak in a soft and, as it were, weakened
voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I believe, I believe, Selim; but I have many things to
tell thee. They want to send me abroad to the old
lady, I think. Yesterday Pani d'Yves spoke of this to
Henryk's father. Pani d'Yves thinks that I am the
cause of Pan Henryk's strange conduct. She thinks that
he is in love with me. I myself do not know but that is
the case. There are times when it seems to me that he
is. I do not understand him. I fear him. I feel that
he will hinder us, that he will separate us; but I&mdash;"</p>

<p>And she finished in a barely audible voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I love, much, much."</p>

<p>"Listen, Hania. No earthly power shall separate us.
<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
Should Henryk forbid me to come here, I shall write to
thee. I have some one who will always bring a letter.
I shall come myself too. By the side of the pond after
dark. Go always to the garden. But thou wilt not go
abroad. If they wish to send thee, I will not permit it,
as God is in heaven. Do not say such things, Hania, or
I shall go mad. Oh, my beloved, my beloved!"</p>

<p>Seizing her hands, he pressed them passionately to his
lips. She sprang up quickly from the bench.</p>

<p>"I hear voices: they are coming," cried she, with fear.</p>

<p>Both went out, though no one was coming and no one
came. The evening rays of the sun cast gleams of gold
on them, but to me those gleams seemed as red as blood.
I too dragged on slowly toward the house. Just at the
turning of the alley I met Kazio, who was on the watch.</p>

<p>"They have gone. I saw them," whispered he. "Tell
me what I am to do?"</p>

<p>"Shoot him in the head!" cried I, with an outburst.</p>

<p>Kazio flushed like a rose, and his eyes gave out phosphoric
light.</p>

<p>"Very good!" said he.</p>

<p>"Stop! Don't be a fool! Do nothing. Meddle in
nothing, and on thy honor, Kazio, be silent. Leave everything
to me. When thou art needed, I will tell thee; but
not a word before any one."</p>

<p>"I'll not even squeak though they kill me."</p>

<p>We went on awhile in silence. Kazio, penetrated
with the importance of the question and sniffing some
kind of terrible event, toward which his heart was rushing,
looked at me with sparkling eyes; then he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Henryk?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>We both whispered, though no one was listening.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou fight with Selim?"
<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
</p>

<p>"I know not. Perhaps."</p>

<p>Kazio stopped and suddenly threw his arms around my
neck.</p>

<p>"Henryk! my golden brother! My heart! My only
one! if thou wish to fight, let me do it. I will manage
him. Let me try. Let me, Henryk; let me!"</p>

<p>Kazio was simply dreaming of deeds of knighthood,
but I felt the brother in him as never before; therefore I
gathered him to my breast with all my strength and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, Kazio! I know nothing yet, and, besides, he
would not accept thee. I know nothing yet of what
will happen. Meanwhile give directions to saddle the
horse in good season. I will go in advance, meet him on
the road, and speak to him. Meanwhile watch both; but
don't let them suspect that thou knowest anything.
Have the horse saddled."</p>

<p>"Wilt thou take arms?"</p>

<p>"Phe! Kazio; he has none. No; I only wish to speak
with him. Be calm, and go at once to the stable."</p>

<p>Kazio sprang away that moment according to my request.
I returned slowly to the house. I was like a man
struck on the head with the back of an axe. I have the
right to say that I knew not what to do; I knew not
how to act. I simply wished to shout.</p>

<p>Until I was perfectly certain that I had lost Hania's
heart, I was anxious to be certain. I judged that in every
case a stone would then fall from my heart: now misfortune
had raised its visor. I was looking at its cold,
icy face and stony eyes; but a new uncertainty was born
in my heart,&mdash;not uncertainty as to my misfortune, but
one a hundred times worse, the feeling of my own helplessness,
the uncertainty as to how I was to struggle with
that feeling.
<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
</p>

<p>My heart was filled with gall, bitterness, and rage.
Voices of self-denial, voices of devotion, which at other
times often spoke in my soul, saying, "Renounce Hania
for the sake of her happiness; it is thy duty to think of
that first of all; sacrifice thyself!" Those voices were
perfectly dumb now. The angel of silent sadness, the
angel of devotion and tears, had flown far away from me.
I felt like a worm which had been trampled, but of
which people had forgotten that it possessed a sting. I
had let myself so far be hunted by misfortune as a wolf
by a dog; but, too much despised and pressed upon, I had
begun like a wolf to show my teeth. A new active
power named revenge rose in my heart. I began to feel
a species of hatred for Selim and Hania. "I will lose
life," thought I; "I will lose everything that may be lost
in this world; but I will not permit those two to be
happy." Penetrated by this thought, I grasped it as a
sentenced man grasps a crucifix. I had found a reason
for life; the horizon became bright before me. I drew
in a full breath, broadly and freely, as never before.
My thoughts, which had been scattered and stormed
away, arranged themselves in order and were turned with
all force in one direction ominous for Selim and Hania.
When I reached the house, I was almost calm, and cool.
In the hall were sitting Pani d'Yves, Father Ludvik,
Hania, Selim, and Kazio, who had just returned from the
stable and did not move one step from the two.</p>

<p>"Is there a horse for me?" asked I of Kazio.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Wilt thou go a part of the way with me?" put in
Selim.</p>

<p>"Yes; I can. I will go to the stacks to see if any
damage is done. Kazio, let me have thy place."</p>

<p>Kazio yielded the place, and I sat down near Selim and
<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
Hania, on a sofa under the window. Involuntarily I
remembered how we had sat there immediately after
Mikolai's death, when Selim told the Crimean tale about
Sultan Harun and the soothsaying Lala. But at that
time Hania, still small and with eyes red from weeping,
had rested her golden head on my breast and fallen
asleep; now that same Hania, taking advantage of the
darkness descending into the room, was pressing Selim's
hand secretly. In that time the sweet feeling of friendship
had joined us all three; now love and hatred were
soon to enter into combat. But all was calm apparently:
the lovers were smiling at each other; I was more gladsome
than usual. No one suspected what kind of gladsomeness
that was.</p>

<p>Soon Pani d'Yves begged Selim to play something. He
rose, sat at the piano, and began to play Chopin's mazurka.
I remained alone for a time on the sofa with Hania. I
noticed that she was gazing at Selim as at a rainbow, that
she was flying away into the region of fancies on the wings
of music, and I determined to bring her back to the earth.</p>

<p>"How many gifts that Selim has, has he not, Hania?
He plays and sings."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is true!" said she.</p>

<p>"And, besides, what a beautiful face! Just look at
him now."</p>

<p>Hania followed the direction of my eyes. Selim was
sitting in the shade; but his head was illuminated by the
last light of the evening, and in those gleams he seemed
inspired, with his uplifted eyes,&mdash;and he was at that
moment inspired.</p>

<p>"How beautiful he is, Hania, is he not?" repeated I.</p>

<p>"Are you very fond of him?"</p>

<p>"He cares nothing for my feelings, but women love
him. Ah, how that Yozia loved him!"
<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
</p>

<p>Alarm was depicted on Hania's smooth forehead.</p>

<p>"And he?" inquired she.</p>

<p>"Ei! he loves one to-day, another to-morrow. He
can never love any one long. Such is his nature. If he
should ever say that he loves thee do not believe him"
(here I began to speak with emphasis); "for him it will be
a question of thy kiss, not thy heart, dost understand?"</p>

<p>"Pan Henryk!"</p>

<p>"True! but what do I say? This does not concern
thee. And, moreover, thou art so modest, wouldst thou
give thy kiss to a stranger, Hania? I beg pardon, for
it seems to me that I have offended thee even with the
supposition. Thou wouldst never permit that, wouldst
thou, Hania, never?"</p>

<p>Hania sprang up to go away, but I seized her by the
hand and detained her by force. I tried to be calm, but
rage was throttling me, as if with pincers. I felt that I
was losing self-control.</p>

<p>"Answer," said I, with repressed excitement, "or I
shall not let thee go."</p>

<p>"Pan Henryk! what do you want? What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;I say," whispered I, with set teeth, "that thou
hast no shame in thy eyes. Hei?"</p>

<p>Hania sat down again on the sofa, helpless. I looked
at her; she was pale as linen. But pity for the poor girl
had fled from me. I grasped her hand, and squeezing its
small fingers, continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hear me! I was at thy feet. I loved thee more than
the whole world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pan Henryk!"</p>

<p>"Be silent. I saw and heard everything. Thou art
shameless,&mdash;thou and he."</p>

<p>"My God! my God!"</p>

<p>"Thou art shameless. I would not have dared to kiss
<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
the hem of thy garment, and he kissed thee on the lips.
Thou thyself didst draw him to thy kisses. Hania, I
despise thee! I hate thee! I hate thee!"</p>

<p>The voice died in my breast. I began to breathe
quickly and catch for air, which was lacking in my
breast.</p>

<p>"Thou hast felt," said I, after a while, "that I will
separate you. If I had to lose my life, I will separate
you, even if I had to kill him, thee, and myself. What
I said a moment ago is not true. He loves thee, he
would not leave thee; but I will separate you."</p>

<p>"Of what are you talking with so much earnestness?"
asked Pani d'Yves, who was sitting at the other end of
the room.</p>

<p>There was a moment when I wanted to spring up and
tell everything; but I remembered myself, and said in an
apparently calm though somewhat broken voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We were disputing as to which arbor in the garden is
the more beautiful, the rose or the hop arbor."</p>

<p>Selim stopped playing suddenly, and looked at us with
attention, then he said with the greatest calmness,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I would give all others for the hop arbor."</p>

<p>"Thy taste is not bad," answered I. "Hania is of the
opposite opinion."</p>

<p>"Is that true, Panna Hania?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, in a low voice.</p>

<p>Again I felt that I could not hold out longer in that
conversation. Red circles began to flash before my eyes.
I sprang up, and running through several chambers to
the dining-room, seized a decanter of water standing on
the table, and poured the water on my head. Then, without
knowing what I did, I dashed the decanter to the
floor, where it broke into a thousand bits, and ran to
the entrance.
<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
</p>

<p>My horse and Selim's were standing before the porch,
saddled. I ran to my room for a moment to wipe the
water from my face in some fashion; that done, I returned
to the hall. In the hall I found the priest and Selim in
the greatest terror.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" asked I.</p>

<p>"Hania has grown weak and fainted."</p>

<p>"What? how?" cried I, grasping the priest by the
arm.</p>

<p>"Immediately after thy going she burst into loud weeping,
and fainted. Pani d'Yves has taken her to her
room."</p>

<p>I flew to Pani d'Yves' chamber without saying a word.
Hania had really burst into loud weeping and fainted,
but the paroxysm had passed. When I saw her I forgot
everything, fell on my knees before her bed like a madman,
and, without noticing the presence of Pani d'Yves,
cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hania, my golden, my love! what is the matter with
thee?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing now," answered she, in a weak voice,
and she tried to smile. "Nothing now. Really nothing."</p>

<p>I sat a quarter of an hour with her, then I kissed her
hand and returned to the hall. It was not true that I
hated her; I loved her as never before. But to make up
for that, when I saw Selim in the hall I wanted to choke
him. Oh, him, him, I hated at that moment from the
bottom of my soul. He and the priest ran up to me
together.</p>

<p>"Well, how is it there?"</p>

<p>"All is well." And turning to Selim I said in his ear,
"Go home. To-morrow we will meet at the Pits near the
edge of the forest. I want to speak to thee. I do not wish
thee to come here. Our relations must cease."
<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
</p>

<p>The blood rushed to his face. "What does this mean?"</p>

<p>"I will tell thee to-morrow. I do not wish to do so to-day.
Dost understand? I do not wish. To-morrow
morning at six."</p>

<p>When I had said this I went back to Pani d'Yves'
chamber. Selim ran some steps after me, but stopped at
the door. A few minutes later I looked through the
window and saw him ride away.</p>

<p>I sat about an hour in the chamber adjoining that one
where Hania was resting. I could not go in, for, weakened
by crying, she had fallen asleep. Pani d'Yves and
the priest went to hold some consultation with my father.
I sat alone till the hour for tea.</p>

<p>During tea I saw that my father, the priest, and Pani
d'Yves had faces half mysterious, half severe. I confess
that a kind of disquiet seized me. Could they have divined
something? That was probable; for in every case between
us young people things had happened that day
which were quite unnatural.</p>

<p>"To-day," said my father, "I have received a letter from
thy mother."</p>

<p>"How is mother's health?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly good. But she is troubled about what is
happening here. She wants to return soon, but I will not
permit her; she must stay two months longer."</p>

<p>"What is mother alarmed about?"</p>

<p>"It is known to thee that small-pox is in the village; I
was so incautious as to inform her."</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I did not know that small-pox was
prevalent. It may be that I had heard of it, but of course
the information had dropped from my ears, as from a
wall.</p>

<p>"Will father go to her?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I shall see. We will talk of that."
<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
</p>

<p>"It is now nearly a year that the dear woman has been
abroad," said the priest.</p>

<p>"Her health requires it. She will be able to spend the
coming winter at home. She writes that she feels much
better, but is yearning for us, and is disquieted," said my
father. Then, turning to me, he added, "Come to my room
after tea. I wish to speak with thee."</p>

<p>"I will, father."</p>

<p>I rose and with all the others went to Hania. She was
perfectly well now; she wished even to rise, but my
father would not give permission. About ten in the
evening a brichka rattled up before the porch, and in it
Doctor Stanislav, who had been in peasant cottages since
midday. After he had examined Hania carefully, he declared
that she was not sick in the least, but needed
rest and recreation. He forbade study and prescribed
amusement and cheerfulness.</p>

<p>My father asked his advice about taking my little
sisters away till the epidemic should pass. The doctor
set him at rest by saying that there was no danger, and
wrote himself to my mother to be at rest. Then he went
to bed, for he was ready to drop from fatigue. I lighted
him to the other building, where he was to pass the night
with me. I was about to lie down, for I was wearied
beyond description by the impressions of the day, when
Franek entered and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The old lord begs the Panich to come."</p>

<p>I went at once. My father was sitting in his room
near a desk on which was the letter from my mother.
Father Ludvik and Pani d'Yves were present also. My
heart fluttered like that of an accused who has to appear
before a judgment seat. I felt almost certain that they
wished to ask me about Hania. In fact, my father began
to speak touching things of great importance. To set my
<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
mother at rest, he had determined to send my little sisters
with Pani d'Yves to his brother at Kopchan. In that
case Hania would be alone with us. This my father did
not wish. He knew, he said, that among us young people
things were happening which he did not wish to investigate,
but for which he had no word of praise; he hoped,
however, that the departure of Hania would put an end to
them.</p>

<p>Here all looked at me inquiringly, but they were not a
little astonished when, instead of opposing Hania's departure
desperately, I approved of it gladly. I had calculated
simply in this way, that the departure would be
equivalent to breaking all relations with Selim. And, besides,
a certain hope, like a will o' the wisp, gleamed in
my heart, that it was I, and no one else, who would take
Hania to my mother. I knew that my father could not
leave home, since the harvest was at hand. I knew that
Father Ludvik had never been abroad; so I only remained.
But this was a faint hope, and soon it was quenched like a
will o' the wisp, when my father said that Pani Ustrytski
would go abroad for sea baths in a couple of days, and
that she had consented to take Hania and accompany her
to my mother. The day following the morrow, Hania was
to set out in the evening. This saddened me no little,
but I preferred that she should go without me rather than
stay. Besides, I confess that immense delight rose in
my mind when I said to myself, "How will Selim receive
this, and what will he do, when I tell him about it to-morrow?"
<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">AT six on the following morning I was at the Pits,
where Selim was waiting for me. While riding
thither, I made a solemn promise to be calm.</p>

<p>"What didst thou wish to say?" inquired Selim.</p>

<p>"I wished to say to thee that I know all. Thou lovest
Hania, and she thee. Selim, thou hast acted dishonorably
in ensnaring Hania's heart. I wish to tell thee this, first
of all."</p>

<p>Selim grew pale, but every element in him was roused.
He rode up to me so closely that our horses almost pushed
each other, and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why? why? Reckon with thy words."</p>

<p>"First, because as thou art a Mussulman, and she is a
Christian, thou canst not marry her."</p>

<p>"I will change my religion."</p>

<p>"Thy father will not permit that."</p>

<p>"Oh, he will permit it."</p>

<p>"In every case, there are obstacles besides that. Even
shouldst thou change thy religion, neither I nor my father
will give thee Hania, never and never! Dost understand?"</p>

<p>Selim bent toward me from his saddle, and answered,
putting emphasis on every word,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall not ask thee! Dost understand in thy turn?"</p>

<p>I was still calm, for I kept the news of Hania's departure
till the last.</p>

<p>"Not only will she not be thine," answered I, with
coolness, and with equal emphasis, "but thou wilt not see
her again. I know that thou hast in mind to send
letters. I declare that I will watch, and for the first one
<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
I will have thy messenger flogged with rods. Thou wilt
not come any more to us. I forbid thee."</p>

<p>"Let us see," replied he, panting with rage. "Permit
me to speak in my turn. I have not acted dishonorably,
but thou hast. Now I see clearly. I asked thee if thou
wert in love with her; thy answer was, 'No!' I wanted
to withdraw while there was time; thou didst reject the
sacrifice. Who is to blame? Thou didst say falsely
that thou wert not in love with her. Through vanity,
through egotistical pride, thou wert ashamed to confess
thy love. Thou didst love in darkness, I in light. Thou
didst love secretly, I openly. Thou didst poison her life;
I tried to make it happy. Who is to blame? I would
have withdrawn; God knows I would. But to-day it is
too late. To-day she loves me; and listen to what I say:
Ye may forbid me your house, ye may intercept my
letters; but I swear that I will not yield up Hania, that I
will not forget her, that I will love her always and seek
her everywhere. I act directly and honorably; but I
love. I love above all things on earth; my whole life is in
my love; I should die without it. I do not wish to bring
unhappiness into thy house; but remember that there is
in me now something of such kind that I myself fear it.
I am ready for anything. Oh, if ye work any wrong on
Hania&mdash;"</p>

<p>He said all this hastily; then he was pale and set his
teeth. A mighty love had possessed that fiery Eastern
nature, and it radiated from him like heat from a flame;
but I paid no heed to that, and answered with icy and
cold decision,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have not come here to listen to thy confessions. I
jeer at thy threats, and I again repeat: Hania will never
be thine."</p>

<p>"Listen once more," said Selim: "I will not try to tell
<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
the greatness of my love for Hania, because I could not
express it, and thou couldst not understand it. But I
swear to thee that, in spite of all my love, if she loved
thee now, I should still find in my soul noble feelings
enough to renounce her forever. Henryk, why should
we be rivals for Hania? Thou hast always been noble.
Listen, then: give her up, and afterward ask even my
life of me. Here is my hand, Henryk! The question is
of Hania,&mdash;Hania, remember."</p>

<p>And he bent toward me with open arms, but I reined
back my horse.</p>

<p>"Leave the care of Hania to me and my father. We
have already taken thought for her. I have the honor
to inform you that the day after to-morrow Hania will go
abroad, and that thou wilt never see her hereafter. Now
farewell."</p>

<p>"Ah! in that case we shall meet again."</p>

<p>"We shall!"</p>

<p>I turned my horse and rode home without looking
back.</p>

<p>It was gloomy in our house during those two days before
Hania's departure. Pani d'Yves and my little sisters
went away the day following the conversation with my
father. There remained only my father, Kazio, I, the
priest, and Hania. The poor girl knew now that she
must go, and this news she received with despair. Evidently
she thought to seek salvation and the last plank
of safety in me; but I, divining this, strove not to be
alone with her one moment. I knew myself sufficiently;
and I knew that with tears she could do whatever she
liked with me, and that I could not refuse her anything.
I avoided even her glance, for I could not endure that
prayer, as it were, for compassion which was depicted in
it whenever she looked at my father or me.
<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
</p>

<p>On the other hand, even though I wished to intercede
for her, I knew that it would be of no avail, for my father
never changed a thing that he had once settled, and withal
a certain shame kept me far from Hania. In her presence
I was ashamed of my last conversation with Selim, of
my recent harshness, of my whole r&ocirc;le, and finally of
this, that without approaching her I still followed her
from a distance. But I had reason to follow her. I
knew that Selim was circling about our house day and
night, like a bird of prey.</p>

<p>On the second day after the conversation I saw Hania
hide hastily a written paper, beyond doubt a letter to or
from Selim. I divined even that perhaps they would see
each other; but though I watched in the gray hour for
Selim, I could not catch him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile two days passed quickly, like an arrow
through the air. On the eve of the day when she was to
pass the night at Ustrytsi, my father went to the next town
to buy horses, and took Kazio to try them. Father Ludvik
and I were to escort Hania. I noticed that as the decisive
moment drew near a wonderful disquiet took possession
of her. She changed in the eyes, and her whole body
trembled. At moments she shivered as if terrified. At
last the sun set in a kind of gloom, behind thick yellowish
clouds piled on one another,&mdash;clouds that threatened
storm and hail. On the western horizon distant thunder-rolls
were heard in succession, like the terrible grumbling
of a coming tempest. The air was sultry and filled with
electricity. The birds had hidden under roofs and trees;
only swallows were rushing unquietly through the air.
The leaves ceased to rustle on the trees and hung as if
they had fainted. From the direction of the farmyard
came the plaintive bellowing of cattle, returning from
pasture. A species of gloomy unrest pervaded all nature.
<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
Father Ludvik had the windows closed. I wished to
reach Ustrytsi before the outbreak of the storm, so I
sprang up to go to the stable and hurry the stable-boys.
When I was leaving the room Hania stood up, but sat
down immediately. I looked at her. She blushed and
then turned pale.</p>

<p>"The air oppresses me somehow!" said she; and, sitting
near the window, she began to fan herself with a
handkerchief.</p>

<p>Her strange disquiet increased evidently.</p>

<p>"We might wait," said the priest; "the storm will
burst forth in half an hour or so."</p>

<p>"In half an hour we shall be at Ustrytsi," answered I;
"besides, who knows but our fears may be vain." And
I ran to the stable.</p>

<p>My horse was saddled already, but there was delay
with the carriage, as usual. Half an hour had passed
before the coachman drove up to the porch with the carriage.
I was behind it on horseback. The storm seemed
to be just overhanging, but I did not wish to delay any
longer. They brought out Hania's trunks at once and
strapped them behind to the carriage. Father Ludvik
was waiting on the porch in a white linen coat, a white
umbrella in his hand.</p>

<p>"Where is Hania? Is she ready?" asked I.</p>

<p>"She is ready. She went half an hour ago to pray
in the chapel."</p>

<p>I went to the chapel, but did not find Hania. I went
to the dining-room, from there to the drawing-room,&mdash;no
Hania in any place.</p>

<p>"Hania! Hania!" I began to call.</p>

<p>No one gave answer. Somewhat alarmed, I went to her
room, thinking that she might have grown faint. In her
room the old woman Vengrosia was sitting and crying.
<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
</p>

<p>"Is it time," asked she, "to take farewell of the young
lady?"</p>

<p>"Where is the young lady?" asked I, impatiently.</p>

<p>"She went to the garden."</p>

<p>I ran to the garden immediately.</p>

<p>"Hania, Hania! It is time to go."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Hania! Hania!"</p>

<p>As if in answer to me the leaves began to rustle under
the first breath of the tempest; a few large drops of rain
fell, and silence set in again.</p>

<p>"What is this?" asked I of myself, and felt that the
hair was rising on my head with fright.</p>

<p>"Hania! Hania!"</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed to me that from the other end
of the garden I heard an answer. I recovered myself.
"Oh, what a fool!" thought I, and ran in the direction
whence the voice came. I found nothing and nobody.</p>

<p>On that side the garden ended at a paling; beyond that
was a road toward a sheepfold in the field. I seized hold
of the paling and looked on the road. It was empty; but
Ignas, a farm-boy, was herding geese in a ditch near the
paling.</p>

<p>"Ignas!"</p>

<p>Ignas took off his cap and ran toward the paling.</p>

<p>"Hast thou seen the young lady?"</p>

<p>"I saw the young lady when she was going away."</p>

<p>"How? when she was going away?"</p>

<p>"Toward the forest with the Panich from Horeli. Oh,
they went, how they went, as fast as ever the horses
could gallop!"</p>

<p>Jesus, Mary! Hania had fled with Selim.</p>

<p>It grew dark in my eyes, and then a lightning-flash, as
it were, flew through my head. I remembered Hania's
<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
disquiet; that letter which I had seen in her hand. Then
all had been arranged. Selim had written to her and
had seen her. They had chosen the moment before our
departure, for they knew that all would be occupied
then. Jesus, Mary! A cold sweat covered me. I do
not remember when I stood on the porch.</p>

<p>"The horse! the horse!" shouted I, in a terrible voice.</p>

<p>"What has happened? What has happened?" cried
the priest.</p>

<p>He was answered only by a roar of thunder, which
was heard at that moment. The wind whistled in my
ears from the mad rush of my horse. Dashing into the
alley of lime-trees. I crossed it in going toward the road
which they had taken; I rushed across one field, then
another, and hurried on. The traces were evident.
Meanwhile the storm had begun; it grew dark. On the
black piles of clouds fiery zigzags of lightning began to
define themselves. At times the whole sky was one
blaze; then a still denser darkness came down; rain
poured in one torrent. The trees swayed and bent on
the roadside. My horse, struck by the mad blows of my
whip and pressed by spurs, was snorting and groaning,
and I also snorted from rage. Bent over the neck of the
horse, I watched the tracks on the road, not seeing aught
else and not thinking of it. In this mood I rushed into
the forest. At that moment the storm became still
more intense. A kind of rage seized the earth and the
sky. The forest bent like wheat in a field, and brandished
around its dark branches; the echoes of thunder
spread from pine-tree to pine-tree in the gloom; the roar
of thunder, the sound of trees, the crash of breaking
limbs, were all mingled in a kind of hellish concert. I
could not see traces now, but I flew onward like a whirlwind.
Only beyond the forest, by the glare of lightning,
<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
did I recognize tracks again; but I noticed with terror
that the snorting of my horse grew more and more violent,
while his speed became less. I redoubled the blows of
the whip.</p>

<p>Just beyond the forest began a real sea of sand which
I could avoid by going to one side, while Selim had to
pass through it. That must delay his flight.</p>

<p>I raised my eyes. "O God! bring it about that I overtake
them, and then kill me, if 'tis Thy will!" cried I, in
despair. And my prayer was heard. All at once ruddy
lightning rent the darkness, and in its bloody glare I saw
an escaping brichka. I could not distinguish the faces
of the fleeing, but I felt sure that they were Selim and
Hania. They were less than one third of a mile ahead,
but were not going very swiftly; for because of the
darkness and the floods, which the rain had raised, Selim
was forced to drive cautiously. I uttered a cry of rage
and delight. Now they could not escape me.</p>

<p>Selim looked around, shouted too, and fell to beating
the frightened horses with a cane. By the gleam of
lightning Hania too recognized me. I saw that she
grasped Selim in despair, and he told her something. In
a few seconds I was so near that I could hear Selim's
voice.</p>

<p>"I have weapons!" cried he, in the dark. "Do not
come near; I shall shoot."</p>

<p>But I cared for nothing. I pushed on and on.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried Selim; "halt!"</p>

<p>I was scarcely fifteen yards away, but the road began
now to be better, and Selim urged his horses into a full
gallop. The distance between us increased for a moment,
but again I began to overtake them. Selim turned then
and aimed his pistol. He was terrible, but he aimed
coolly. Another moment, and I might have touched the
<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
carriage with my hand. Suddenly the report of a pistol
was heard. My horse threw himself to one side, sprang
still a number of times, then sank to his knees. I raised
him; he reared on his hind legs, and, snorting heavily,
rolled on the ground with me.</p>

<p>I sprang up at once and ran with all the strength left
in me, but that was a vain effort. Soon the brichka went
farther and farther from me; then I saw it only when
lightning rent the clouds. I tried to shout. I could not;
breath failed in my breast. The rattle of the brichka
came to me fainter and fainter; at last I stumbled against
a stone and fell.</p>

<p>In a moment I rose again. "They have gone! they
have gone! they have vanished!" repeated I, aloud, and
do not remember what happened to me. I was helpless,
alone in the tempest and the night. That Satan of a
Selim had conquered me. But if Kazio had not gone
with my father, we should have pursued them together;
and then what would have happened?</p>

<p>"What will happen now?" screamed I, loudly, so as to
hear my own voice and not go mad. And it seemed to
me that the whirlwind was jeering at me, and whistling:
"Sit there at the roadside, without a horse, while he is off
there with her." And thus the wind howled and laughed
and roared. I went back slowly to my horse. From his
nostrils flowed a stream of dark stiffening blood, but he
was alive yet; he panted and turned his dying eyes toward
me. I sat near him, rested my head on his side, and it
seemed to me that I too was dying. But meanwhile the
wind whistled above my head and laughed and cried,
"He is there with her!" It seemed to me at times that
I heard the hellish rattle of that brichka, flying off in the
night with my happiness. And the whirlwind whistled,
"He is there with her!"
<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
</p>

<p>A marvellous stupefaction seized hold of me. How
long it lasted I cannot tell. When I recovered, the tempest
had passed. Along the sky bright flocks of light,
whitish clouds were moving; in the intervals between
them the blue of heaven was visible, and the moon was
shining brightly. From the field a mist was rising.
My horse, already cold, reminded me of what had passed.
I looked around to see where I was. On the right I perceived
distant lights in windows, so I hurried toward
them. It turned out that I was right near Ustrytsi.</p>

<p>I resolved to go to the mansion and see Pan Ustrytski,
which I could do the more easily since he lived not in
the mansion itself, but had his own little house; in this
he slept and spent his time usually. The light was shining
yet in his window. I knocked at the door. He
opened it himself, and started back frightened.</p>

<p>"Farce!" cried he; "what a look thou hast, Henryk!"</p>

<p>"Lightning killed my horse out there on the road; I
had nothing to do but to come here."</p>

<p>"In the name of the Father and Son! But thou
art wet through, cold. It is late. Farce! I will
have something to eat brought in, and dry clothes for
thee."</p>

<p>"No, no; I wish to go home at once, nothing more."</p>

<p>"But why did not Hania come? My wife will start
at two in the morning. We thought that you would
bring her to spend the night."</p>

<p>I resolved at once to tell him all, for I needed his
assistance.</p>

<p>"A misfortune has happened," said I. "I reckon on
this, that you will not mention the matter to any one,
neither to your wife, nor your daughters, nor the governesses.
The honor of our house is at stake here."</p>

<p>I knew that he would tell no one, but I had little hope
<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
that the affair would be concealed; therefore I preferred
to anticipate, so that in a given event he could explain
what had happened. And I told him all, declaring that
I was in love with Hania.</p>

<p>"But thou must fight with Selim, I suppose? Farce!
what&mdash;" said he, listening to the end.</p>

<p>"Yes; I wish to fight with him to-morrow. But to-day
I must pursue them, and therefore I beg you to give me
your best horse immediately."</p>

<p>"Thou hast no need to pursue them. They have not
gone far. They took various roads and returned to
Horeli Where could they go? Farce! They returned
to Horeli, and fell at the feet of the old Mirza. They
had no other escape. The old Mirza confined Selim in
the granary, and the young lady he will take back to thy
house. A farce, is it! But Hania! Hania! well!"</p>

<p>"Pan Ustrytski!"</p>

<p>"Well, well, my child, be not angry. I do not take
this ill of her. My women, that is different. But why
lose time?"</p>

<p>"That is true; let us not lose time."</p>

<p>Pan Ustrytski stopped for a moment. "I know now
what to do. I will go straightway to Horeli, and do thou
go home, or better wait here. If Hania is in Horeli, I will
take her and go to thy house. Thou thinkest they may
not give her to me? Farce! But I prefer to be with
the old Mirza when we take her, for thy father is quick-tempered,
ready to challenge the old man, but the old
man is not to blame. Is he?"</p>

<p>"My father is not at home."</p>

<p>"So much the better!"</p>

<p>Pan Ustrytski slapped his hands.</p>

<p>"Yanek!"</p>

<p>The servant entered.
<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
</p>

<p>"Horses and a brichka for me in ten minutes. Dost
understand?"</p>

<p>"And horses for me?" said I.</p>

<p>"And horses for this gentleman! Farce! lord benefactor."</p>

<p>We were silent for a time.</p>

<p>"Will you permit me to write a letter to Selim?" asked
I. "I wish to challenge him by letter."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid that the old man will not let him fight.
He will confine him a time and think that sufficient.
But for me that is little, little! If Selim is in prison already,
you will not see him; that cannot be brought about
through the old man; but a letter may be left for any one.
Besides, I shall not tell my father that I am going to
fight. He might challenge the old Mirza, and the old
Mirza is not to blame. But if Selim and I fight to begin
with, there will be no reason for their fighting. Indeed,
you said yourself that I must fight with him."</p>

<p>"I thought this way: fight, fight! That is always the
best way for a noble; whether old or young, it is one.
For some one else, a farce! but not for a noble. Well,
write; thou art correct."</p>

<p>I sat down and wrote as follows: "Thou art contemptible.
With this letter I slap thee in the face. If thou
wilt not appear to-morrow near Vah's cottage with pistols
or with swords, thou wilt be the last of cowards, which
very likely thou art."</p>

<p>I sealed the letter and gave it to Pan Ustrytski. Then
we went out; the brichkas had come already. Before
sitting in mine, one terrifying thought came to my
head.</p>

<p>"But," said I to Pan Ustrytski, "if Selim took Hania
not to Horeli?"
<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
</p>

<p>"If not to Horeli, then he has gained time. It is
night; there are fifty roads in every direction, and&mdash;look
for a wind in the fields. But where could he have
taken her?"</p>

<p>"To the town of N."</p>

<p>"Sixteen miles with the same horses. Then be at
rest. A farce! isn't it? I will go to N. to-morrow,
to-day even, but first to Horeli. I repeat to thee, be at
rest."</p>

<p>An hour later I was at home. It was late at night,
very late even, but lights were gleaming everywhere in
the windows. Soon people were running with candles
through various rooms. When my brichka stopped before
the porch, the doors squeaked, and Father Ludvik
came out with a lamp in his hand.</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" whispered he, putting his finger to his
mouth.</p>

<p>"But Hania?" inquired I, feverishly.</p>

<p>"Hania is here already. The old Mirza brought her
back. Come to my room. I will tell thee all."</p>

<p>I went to the priest's room.</p>

<p>"What happened to thee?"</p>

<p>"I pursued them. Selim shot my horse. Is father
here?"</p>

<p>"He came just after the old Mirza had gone. Oh,
misfortune! misfortune! The doctor is with him now.
We were afraid that he would have an apoplectic stroke.
He wanted to go and challenge the old Mirza immediately.
Don't go to thy father, for it might harm him.
To-morrow beg him not to challenge the Mirza. That
would be a grievous sin, and, besides, the old man is not
to blame. He beat Selim and confined him; Hania he
brought home himself. He enjoined silence on his servants.
It is fortunate that he did not find thy father."
<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
</p>

<p>It turned out that Pan Ustrytski had foreseen everything
perfectly.</p>

<p>"How is Hania?"</p>

<p>"Every thread on her was wet. She has a fever. Thy
father gave her a dreadful scolding. The poor child!"</p>

<p>"Did Doctor Stanislav see her?"</p>

<p>"He did, and commanded her to go to bed without
delay. Old Vengrosia is sitting near her. Wait here for
me. I will go to thy father and tell him that thou hast
come. He sent horsemen after thee in every direction.
Kazio too is not at home, for he has gone to look for thee.
O God! O God, Thou Almighty, what has happened
here!"</p>

<p>So saying, the priest went to my father. But I could
not wait in his room. I ran to Hania. I did not wish
to see her, oh, no! that would cost her too much. I
wished rather to be sure that she had really returned,
that she was again out of danger, under our roof, near
me, sheltered from the tempest and the terrible events
of that day.</p>

<p>Wonderful feelings shook me when I approached her
room. Not anger, not hatred, did I feel in my heart,
but a great and deep sorrow, an inexpressible compassion
for that poor unfortunate victim of Selim's madness. I
thought of her as of a dove, which a falcon had swept
away. Ah! how much humiliation the poor thing must
have felt, through what shame she must have passed in
Horeli, in presence of the old Mirza! I swore to myself
that I would not reproach her to-day or ever, and would
act with her as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>At the moment when I reached the chamber door, it
opened; old Vengrosia came out. I stopped her and
inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is the young lady sleeping?"
<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
</p>

<p>"She is not; she is not," repeated the old woman.
"Oh, my golden young master, if you had seen what
was here! When the old lord bellowed at the young
lady, I thought the poor dear would die on the spot.
And she was terrified and wet through. O Jesus!
Jesus!"</p>

<p>"But now how is she?"</p>

<p>"You will see that she is sick altogether. It is lucky
that the doctor is here."</p>

<p>I commanded Vengrosia to return at once to Hania,
and not to shut the door; for I wished to look at her
from a distance. In fact, looking from the dark chamber
through the open door, I saw her sitting on the bed,
dressed in night-clothing. A deep flush was on her face;
her eyes were gleaming. I saw besides that she was
breathing quickly; evidently she had a fever.</p>

<p>I hesitated for a time whether to go in or not; but at
that moment Father Ludvik touched my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Thy father calls thee," said he.</p>

<p>"Father Ludvik, she is sick!"</p>

<p>"The doctor will come at once. Meanwhile thou wilt
talk to thy father. Go, go; it is late."</p>

<p>"What o'clock?"</p>

<p>"One in the morning."</p>

<p>I struck my forehead with my hand. But I had to
fight with Selim at five in the morning.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">AFTER a talk with my father which lasted half an
hour, I returned to the station, but did not lie
down. I calculated that to reach Vah's at five I must
leave the house by four at least, therefore I had not
<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
quite three hours before me. Soon after, Father Ludvik
came to see if I were not ill after that mad ride, and if
I had changed clothing properly after being wet; but
for me to be wet was the same as not to be wet. The
priest urged me to go to bed at once; meanwhile he forgot
himself in talk, and so an hour passed.</p>

<p>He narrated in detail all that the old Mirza had said.
It seemed that Selim had simply committed an act of
madness; but, as he told his father, he saw no other
method. It seemed to him that after the flight, his
father would have no escape but to bless him, and we
none but to give him Hania. It was also disclosed that
after talking with me not only did he write to Hania,
but he had a meeting with her; and it was then that he
persuaded her to flee with him. The girl, though she
did not comprehend the results of this step, resisted instinctively
with all her might; but Selim involved her
with his prayers and his love. He represented to her
that the flight was simply a drive to Horeli, after which
they would be united forever and be happy. He assured
her that afterward he would bring her to us, but as his
betrothed; that my father would agree to everything;
that I must agree, and, what was more, I would console
myself easily with Lola Ustrytski. Finally, he implored,
entreated, and begged Hania. He said that for her he
would sacrifice everything, even life; that he could not
survive separation; that he would drown, shoot, or poison
himself. And then he cast himself at her feet and so
persuaded her that she agreed to everything. But when
the flight began, and they had started, Hania grew
terrified and begged him with tears to return; but he
would not, for, as he told his father, he forgot the whole
world then.</p>

<p>This was what the old Mirza told Father Ludvik, and he
<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
told it, perhaps, to show that though Selim ventured on a
mad deed he had done so in good faith. Taking everything
into consideration, Father Ludvik did not share the
anger of my father, who was indignant at Hania's ingratitude.
According to the priest Hania was not ungrateful;
she was simply led astray by sinful worldly love. For that
reason the priest gave me some edifying instruction about
worldly feelings, but I did not take it ill at all of Hania
that her love was worldly; I would have been willing to
pay with my life had that love been differently directed.
I felt the greatest compassion for Hania, and moreover my
heart had so grown to her that, had I wished to tear it
away, I should have had to tear it asunder. Therefore I
begged Father Ludvik to take her part before my father,
and to explain to him her act as he had to me. I took
farewell of him then, for I wished to be alone.</p>

<p>After the priest had gone, I took down that famous old
sabre, given me by my father, and the pistols, to prepare
for the meeting of the morning. Of that meeting I had had
neither the time nor the wish to think hitherto. I wished
to fight for life and death; that was all. As to Selim, I was
convinced that he would not disappoint me. I wiped my
sabre carefully with soft cotton along its broad blue
blade. In spite of something like two hundred years, it
had not one dent, though in its day it had opened not a
few helmets and breastplates, and drunk no little Swedish,
Tartar, and Turkish blood. The golden inscription,
"Jesus, Mary," shone distinctly. I tried the edge; it was
as fine as the edge of a satin ribbon. The blue turquoises
on the hilt seemed to smile, as if begging for a hand to
grasp and warm them.</p>

<p>Having finished with the sabre, I took the pistols, for
I knew not what weapons Selim might choose. I
dropped olive oil on the locks, put bits of linen cloth
<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
around the bullets, and loaded both carefully. They
were ready now. It was three o'clock. When I had
finished the work, I threw myself into an armchair and
began to meditate. From the course of events, and from
what Father Ludvik had told me, one point became more
and more evident: that I was to blame not a little for
all that had happened. I asked myself if I had fulfilled
properly the duty of guardian which old Mikolai had imposed
on me, and I answered, No. Had I thought of
Hania, and not of myself? I answered, No! Of whom
had I been thinking in all this affair? Directly of myself.
And meanwhile Hania, that mild, defenceless creature,
was among us, like a dove among birds of prey. I could
not stifle in myself the immensely bitter thought that
Selim and I had torn her like a tempting booty; and
in that struggle, during which the robber actors were
thinking mainly of themselves, she had suffered most who
was least to blame. Now in a couple of hours we were
to have our last battle concerning her.</p>

<p>These thoughts were bitter and grievous. It turned
out that this whole world of nobles was too rude for
Hania. Unfortunately my mother had not been at home
for a long time, and we men had hands that were too
rough; we had crushed between them the delicate flower
thrown among us by fate. Blame hung over our whole
house, and this blame must be effaced with my blood
or Selim's. I was ready for either event.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the light of day had begun to look in with
increasing force through my window. I quenched the
candles burning on the table; it was almost daylight.
Half-past four struck clearly in the hall of the house.</p>

<p>"Well, it is time!" thought I; and, throwing a cloak
over my shoulders to hide the weapons in case some one
met me, I went out of the station.
<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
</p>

<p>While passing near the house, I noticed that the main
door in the entrance, which was fastened at night usually
by the jaws of an iron lion, was open. Evidently some
one had gone out; hence I needed to take every precaution
not to meet that person. Stealing along silently by the
side of the front yard toward the linden-trees, I looked
carefully on all sides, but it seemed to me as if everything
round about were sleeping calmly. Only in the alley did
I raise my head boldly, feeling sure that they would not
see me now from the mansion. The morning was very
clear and beautiful after yesterday's tempest. The sweet
odor of wet lindens met me with great freshness in the
alley. I turned on the left toward the forge, the mill,
and the dam; that was the road to Vah's cottage. Sleep
and weariness fled far away from me under the influence
of the fresh morning and fine weather. I was full of a
certain good hope; some internal forewarning told me that
in that struggle which was to come, I should conquer.
Selim used pistols like a master, but I was not inferior as
a shot; in handling a sabre he surpassed me in skill, it is
true, but to make up I was far stronger than he, to that degree
stronger that he could hardly endure my strokes on
his sabre. "And, moreover, come what may," thought I,
"this is the end; and if it is not the solution, it will be
the cutting of the Gordian knot which has bound me and
stifled me so long. Besides, in good or bad faith, Selim
has wrought great injustice on Hania, and he must atone
for it."</p>

<p>Thus meditating, I reached the bank of the pond.
Mist and steam had dropped from the air onto the water.
Daylight had painted the blue surface of the pond with
the colors of dawn. Early morning had only just begun.
The air was growing more and more transparent; it was
fresh everywhere, calm, rosy, quiet; only from the reeds
<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
came to my ears the quacking of wild ducks. I was near
the sluices and bridge, when I stopped on a sudden, as if
driven into the earth.</p>

<p>On the bridge stood my father, with his arms behind
him and a quenched pipe in one hand. Leaning on the
railing of the bridge, he was looking thoughtfully at the
water and the morning dawn. It was evident that he
as well as I had been unable to sleep, and he had gone
out to breathe the morning air, or perhaps to look here
and there at the management.</p>

<p>I did not see him at once, for I was walking at the
side of the road, so the willows hid the railing of the
bridge from me; but I was not more than ten yards
away. I hid behind the willows, not knowing at the
moment what to do.</p>

<p>But my father stood in the same place all the time. I
looked at him. Sleeplessness and anxiety were apparent
on his face. He cast his eyes at the pond and muttered
the morning prayer.</p>

<p>To my ears came the words,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hail, Mary, full of grace! The Lord be with Thee!"
Here he whispered the continuation, and again aloud,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And blessed be the fruit of Thy womb. Amen!"</p>

<p>I was impatient at standing behind the willows, and I
determined to slip by quietly over the bridge. I could
do that, for my father was turned toward the water; and,
besides, he was a little deaf, as I have mentioned, for
during his time in the army he had been deafened by the
excessive roar of artillery. Stepping along cautiously, I was
passing the bridge beyond the willows, but unfortunately
a badly fastened plank moved. My father looked around.</p>

<p>"What art thou doing here?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Oh, to walk, father,&mdash;I am going to walk only," answered
I, growing as red as a beet.
<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
</p>

<p>My father approached me, and opening slightly the
cloak with which I had covered myself carefully, he
pointed to the sabre and pistols.</p>

<p>"What is this?" asked he.</p>

<p>There was no help for it; I had to confess.</p>

<p>"I will tell father everything," I said; "I am going to
fight with Selim."</p>

<p>I thought that he would burst out in anger, but beyond
my expectation he only asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who was the challenger?"</p>

<p>"I."</p>

<p>"Without consulting thy father, without saying a word."</p>

<p>"I challenged him yesterday in Ustrytsi, immediately
after the pursuit. I could not ask about anything, father,
and, besides, I was afraid that thou wouldst forbid me."</p>

<p>"Thou hast guessed right. Go home. Leave the
whole affair to me."</p>

<p>My heart was straitened in me with such pain and
despair as never before.</p>

<p>"Father, I entreat thee by all that is holy, by the
memory of my grandfather, do not forbid me to fight
with the Tartar. I remember how thou didst call me a
democrat, and wert angry with me. Now I remember
that thy blood as well as grandfather's is flowing in me.
Father, he injured Hania! is that to go unpunished?
Give not people the chance to say that our family let an orphan
be wronged, or would not avenge her. I am greatly
to blame. I loved her, and did not tell thee; but I swear
that even if I had not loved, I would for the sake of her
orphanhood, our house, and our name do what I am doing
now. Conscience tells me that this is noble; and do
thou, father, not oppose me; for if what I say is true,
then I do not believe that thou wouldst forbid me to be
noble. I do not! I do not! Remember, father, that
<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
Hania is wronged; and I challenged, I gave my word. I
know that I am not mature yet; but have not the immature
just the same feelings and the same honor as grown
persons? I have challenged; I have given my word; and
thou hast taught me more than once that honor is the
first right of nobles. I gave my word, father; Hania was
wronged; there is a spot on our house, and I have given
my word. Father, father!"</p>

<p>And pressing my lips to his hand, I wept like a beaver;
I prayed almost to my father; but in proportion as I
spoke, his severe face became gentle, milder and milder;
he raised his eyes, and a large heavy tear, really a parental
one, fell on my forehead. He fought a grievous battle
with himself, for I was the sight of his eyes, and he loved
me above all things on earth; therefore he trembled for
me; but at last he inclined his iron-gray head and said
in a low, barely audible voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"May the God of thy fathers conduct thee! Go, my
son, go to fight with the Tartar."</p>

<p>We fell into each other's arms. My father pressed me
long; long did he hold me to his breast. But at last he
shook himself out of his emotion, and said with strength
and more joyously,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now then, fight, my son, till thy battle is heard in
the sky!"</p>

<p>I kissed his hand, and he asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"With swords or pistols?"</p>

<p>"He will choose."</p>

<p>"And the seconds?"</p>

<p>"Without seconds. I trust him; he trusts me. Why
do we need seconds?"</p>

<p>Again I threw myself on his neck, for it was time to
go. I looked back when I had gone about a third of a
mile. My father was on the bridge yet, and blessed me
<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
from afar with the holy cross. The first rays of the rising
sun fell on his lofty figure, encircling it with a kind of
aureole. And thus in the light, with upraised hands,
that veteran seemed to me like an old eagle blessing
from afar its young for such a high-sounding and winged
life as he himself had admired on a time.</p>

<p>Ah, how the heart rose in me then! I had so much
confidence and faith and courage that if not one, but ten
Selims had been waiting for me at Vah's cottage, I should
have challenged all ten of them immediately.</p>

<p>I came at last to the cottage. Selim was waiting for
me at the edge of the forest. I confess that when I saw
him I felt in my heart something like that which a wolf
feels when he sees his prey. We looked each other in
the eyes threateningly, and with curiosity. Selim had
changed in those two days; he had grown thin and ugly,
but maybe it only seemed to me that he had grown ugly,
his eyes gleamed feverishly, the corners of his mouth
quivered.</p>

<p>We went immediately to the depth of the forest, but
we did not speak a word the whole way.</p>

<p>At last, when I found a little opening among the pines,
I stopped, and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here. Agreed?"</p>

<p>He nodded his head and began to unbutton his coat, so
as to take it off before the duel.</p>

<p>"Choose!" said I, pointing to the pistols and the sabre.</p>

<p>He pointed to a sabre which he had with him: it was
Turkish, a Damascus blade, much curved toward the
point.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I threw off my coat; he followed my
example, but first he took a letter from his pocket and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I die, I beg to give this to Panna Hania."
<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
</p>

<p>"I will not receive it."</p>

<p>"This is not a confession; it is an explanation."</p>

<p>"Agreed! I will take it."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, we rolled up our shirt-sleeves. Only
now did my heart begin to beat more vigorously. At
last Selim seized the hilt of his sabre, straightened himself,
took the position of a fencer, challenging, proud,
and holding the sabre higher than his head, said briefly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am ready."</p>

<p>I struck on him at once, and so impetuously that he
had to retreat a number of steps, and he received my
blows on his sabre with difficulty; he answered, however,
each blow with a blow, and with such swiftness that
stroke and answer were heard almost simultaneously. A
flush covered his face; his nostrils distended; his eyes
stared out slantingly in Tartar fashion, and began to cast
lightning.</p>

<p>For a while there was nothing to be heard but the
clink of blades, the dry sound of steel, and the whistling
breath of our breasts.</p>

<p>Selim soon understood that if the struggle was to continue,
he must fall, for neither his lungs nor his strength
would hold out. Large drops of sweat came out on his
forehead; his breath grew hoarser and hoarser. But also
a certain rage possessed him, a certain madness of battle.
His hair, tossed around by the movement, fell on his
forehead, and in his open mouth shone his white teeth.
You would have said that the Tartar nature had become
roused in him and grown wild when he felt the sabre in
his hand and smelt blood. Still I had the advantage of
equal fury with greater strength. Once he could not
withstand the blow, and blood trickled from his left arm.
After a few seconds, the very point of my sabre touched
his forehead. He was terrible then, with that red ribbon
<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
of blood mixed with sweat and trickling down to his
mouth and chin. It seemed to rouse him. He sprang up
to me and sprang away like a wounded tiger. The point
of his sabre circled with the terrible swiftness of a fiery
thunderbolt, around my head, arms, and breast. I caught
those mad blows with difficulty, all the more since I
was thinking rather of giving than taking. At times we
came so near each other that breast almost struck breast.</p>

<p>All at once, Selim sprang away; his sabre whistled
right near my temple; but I warded it off with such
strength that his head was for a moment undefended.
I aimed a blow capable of splitting it in two, and&mdash;a
thunderbolt, as it were, struck my head suddenly. I
cried, "Jesus, Mary!" the sabre dropped from my hand,
and I fell with my face to the earth.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">WHAT happened to me during a long time, I do not
remember, nor do I know. When I woke, I was
lying on my back in a chamber and on my father's bed.
My father was sitting near me in an armchair, with his
head bent back, pale, and with closed eyes. The blinds
were shut; lights were burning on the table; and in the
great stillness of the chamber, I heard only the ticking
of the clock. I stared for some time at the ceiling
vacantly, and was summoning my thoughts sluggishly;
then I tried to move, but unendurable pain in my head
prevented me. This pain reminded me a little of all that
had happened, so I called in a low, weak voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Father!"</p>

<p>My father quivered and bent over me. Joy and tenderness
were expressed on his face, and he said,
<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"O God! thanks to Thee! He has recovered consciousness.
What son? what?"</p>

<p>"Father, I fought with Selim."</p>

<p>"Yes, my love! Do not think of that."</p>

<p>Silence continued for a while, then I asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Father, but who brought me to this room from the
forest?"</p>

<p>"I brought thee in my arms; but do not say anything,
do not torment thyself."</p>

<p>Not five minutes had passed when I inquired again. I
spoke very slowly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Father?"</p>

<p>"What, my child?"</p>

<p>"But what happened to Selim?"</p>

<p>"He fainted also from loss of blood. I had him carried
to Horeli."</p>

<p>I wanted to inquire about Hania and my mother, but I
felt that consciousness was leaving me again. I thought
that black and yellow dogs were dancing on their hind
legs around my bed, and I looked at them. Then again
I seemed to hear the sounds of village fifes; at moments,
instead of the clock which hung opposite my bed, I saw
a face look out of the wall and draw back again. That
was not a condition of complete unconsciousness, but of
fever and a scattering of thought; but it must have
lasted rather long.</p>

<p>At times I was a little better, and then I half recognized
the faces around my bed,&mdash;now my father, now the
priest, now Kazio, now Doctor Stanislav. I remember
that among those faces was lacking one. I could not
make out which; but I know that I felt that lack, and I
sought that face instinctively.</p>

<p>One night when I had slept very soundly, I woke
toward morning. The lights were burning on the table.
<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
I was very, very weak. All at once I discerned a person
bent over the bed whom I did not know at first, but at
sight of whom I felt as well as if I had died and was
taken into heaven. That was a kind of angelic face; but
so angelic, so sacred, kind, with tears flowing out of its
eyes, that I felt as though I were preparing to weep.
Then a spark of consciousness returned to me; it grew
bright in my eyes; and I called weakly in a low voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mamma!"</p>

<p>The angelic face bent to my emaciated hand, lying
motionless on the coverlet, and pressed lips to it. I tried
to raise myself, but felt pain again in my temples; hence
I exclaimed only,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mamma! it pains!"</p>

<p>My mother, for it was she, had begun to change the
bandages with ice, which were on my head. That process
had caused me no little suffering; but now those sweet,
beloved hands with careful delicacy began to move
around my poor slashed head, so that, not feeling the
least pain, I whispered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pleasant! Oh, pleasant!"</p>

<p>Thenceforward I had more consciousness; only toward
evening I fell into a fever; then I saw Hania, though
when I was conscious I never saw her near me. But I
saw her always in some danger. At one time a wolf with
red eyes was rushing at her; again some one was carrying
her away,&mdash;as it were, Selim, as it were, not Selim, but
with a face grown over with black bristles and with horns
on his head. Then I cried out sometimes; and sometimes
I begged that wolf, or that horned one, very politely and
humbly, not to carry her away. At those moments my
mother placed her hands on my forehead, and the evil
visions vanished immediately.</p>

<p>At last the fever left me for good. I regained perfect
<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
consciousness. That did not mean that I was in better
health. Some other kind of sickness attached itself, a
certain unheard of weakness, under the influence of
which I was evidently sinking.</p>

<p>During whole days and nights I looked at one point in
the ceiling. I was as if conscious, but indifferent to all
things; I cared not for life, nor death, nor the persons
watching over my bed. I received impressions, saw
everything that was passing around me, remembered
everything, but I had not strength to collect my thoughts,
I had not strength to feel.</p>

<p>One evening it seemed evident that I was dying. A
great yellow candle was placed near my bed; then I saw
Father Ludvik in his vestments. He gave me the sacrament,
then he put the holy oil on me, and after that he
sobbed so that he came near losing consciousness. They
carried my mother out in a faint. Kazio was howling at
the wall and tearing his hair. My father was sitting with
clasped hands; he was just as if petrified. I saw all of
this perfectly, but was perfectly indifferent; and I looked
as usual with dead, glassy eyes on the ceiling, on the
edge of the bed or the foot of it, or at the window,
through which were coming in milky and silvery bundles
of moonlight.</p>

<p>Then, through all doors, the servants began to push
into the room, crying, sobbing, and howling. Kazio led
them in, and they filled the whole room; but my father
sat there as stony as before. At last when all had knelt
down, the priest began the Litany, but stopped, for he
could not go on from tears. My father sprang up suddenly,
and bellowing, "O Jesus! O Jesus!" threw himself
his whole length on the floor.</p>

<p>At that moment I felt that the points of my toes and
my feet were beginning to grow cold; a certain wonderful
<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
drowsiness seized me, and a yawning. "Ah! now I am
dying!" thought I, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>But instead of dying I fell asleep really, and slept so
well that I did not wake till twenty-four hours later, and
so greatly strengthened that I was unable to understand
what had happened. My indifference had vanished; my
powerful young constitution had conquered death itself,
and was roused to new life and new forces. Now again
there were such scenes of delight at my bed that I shall
not attempt to describe them. Kazio was simply frantic
from happiness.</p>

<p>They told me later that immediately after the duel,
when my father carried me wounded to the house, and the
doctor could not answer for my life, they had to shut up
the honest Kazio, for he was simply hunting Selim like a
wild beast, and he swore that if I died he would shoot
the Tartar at sight. Fortunately Selim too was wounded
somewhat, and had to lie a time in bed.</p>

<p>But now every day brought me new solace. My desire
for life returned. My father, my mother, the priest, and
Kazio watched day and night above my bed. How I
loved them then; how I yearned for them when they left
the room! But with life the old feeling for Hania began
to speak in my heart again. When I woke from that
sleep which all had considered at first an eternal one, I
asked straightway for Hania. My father answered that
she was well; but that she had gone with Pani d'Yves
and my little sisters to his brother's, for the small-pox
was increasing in the village. He told me, moreover,
that he had forgiven her, that he had forgotten everything,
and asked me to be quiet.</p>

<p>I spoke frequently of her afterward with mother, who,
seeing that that subject occupied me more than all others,
began herself a conversation, and finished it with the
<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
kindly though indefinite words that when I got well she
would speak with my father of many things which to me
would be very agreeable, but that I must be quiet and
try to recover as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>While saying this, she smiled sadly, but I wished to
weep from delight. Once something happened in the
house which disturbed my peace, and even filled me with
fear. In the evening, when my mother was sitting near
me, the serving-man Franek came in and asked her to
Hania's room.</p>

<p>I sat up immediately in bed. "Has Hania come?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"No!" answered my mother. "She has not come.
He asks me to Hania's room, for they are painting there
and putting on new paper."</p>

<p>At times it seemed to me that a heavy cloud and an
ill-concealed sadness lay on the foreheads of the persons
surrounding me. I had no knowledge of what was passing,
and my inquiries were set aside somehow. I asked
Kazio; he answered as did others, that in the house
all was well; that our little sisters, Pani d'Yves, and
Hania would return soon; and, finally, that I must be
quiet.</p>

<p>"But where does this sadness come from?" asked I.</p>

<p>"Seest thou, I will tell thee all. Selim and the old
Mirza come here every day. Selim is in despair whole days.
He cries; he wants absolutely to see thee; and our mother
and father are afraid that this visit would harm thee."</p>

<p>"Wise Selim," said I, smiling, "he came near splitting
my skull, and now he is crying for me. Well, is he thinking
of Hania all the time?"</p>

<p>"How could he have Hania in his head? I know not.
For that matter, I did not ask; but I think that he has
renounced her altogether."
<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
</p>

<p>"That is a question."</p>

<p>"In every case some one else will get her; be at rest on
that point."</p>

<p>Here Kazio made a wry face, student fashion, and
added with the mien of a rogue,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know even who. God grant only that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That what?"</p>

<p>"That she return as soon as possible," added he, hurriedly.</p>

<p>These words pacified me completely. A couple of days
later, in the evening, my father was sitting near me with
my mother. He and I began to play chess. After a
while mother went out, leaving the door open. Through
the door a whole row of rooms was visible; at the end of
this row was Hania's room. I looked at it, but I could
not see anything, for mine was the only room lighted.
Hania's door, so far as I could see in the darkness, was
closed.</p>

<p>Then some one went in, as it were Doctor Stanislav, and
did not shut the door.</p>

<p>My heart beat unquietly. There was light in Hania's
room.</p>

<p>The light fell in a bright column to the dark neighboring
hall; and on the background of that clear column it
seemed to me that I saw a delicate line of smoke, curling
as dust curls in sunlight.</p>

<p>Gradually an indefinable odor struck my nostrils, but
an odor which became stronger and stronger every moment.
Suddenly the hair rose on my head. I recognized
the odor of juniper.</p>

<p>"Father! what is that?" cried I, throwing the chess-men
and chess-board on the floor.</p>

<p>My father jumped up, confused, perceiving also that
cursed odor of the juniper, and closed the door of the
room as quickly as possible.
<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
</p>

<p>"That is nothing," said he, hurriedly.</p>

<p>But I was already on my feet; and though I staggered,
I pushed quickly toward the door.</p>

<p>"They are burning juniper!" cried I. "I want to go
there."</p>

<p>My father caught me by the waist.</p>

<p>"Do not go! do not go! I forbid thee."</p>

<p>Despair seized me; so grasping the bandages around my
head, I cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I swear then that I will tear off these bandages,
and open my wounds with my own hands. Hania
is dead! I want to see her."</p>

<p>"Hania is not dead. I give thee my word!" cried my
father, seizing my hands and struggling with me. "She
was sick, but she is better. Calm thyself! Calm thyself!
Have we not had misfortune enough already? I will
tell thee everything, but lie down. Thou canst not go to
her. Thou wouldst destroy her. But lie down; I swear
to thee that she is better."</p>

<p>My strength failed me, and I fell on the bed, repeating
only,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My God! My God!"</p>

<p>"Henryk, come to thyself! Art thou a woman? Be a
man. She is no longer in danger. I have promised to
tell thee everything, and I will tell it, but on condition
that thou collect thy strength. Lay thy head on the
pillow. That way. Cover thyself, and be quiet."</p>

<p>I was obedient.</p>

<p>"I am quiet; but more quickly, father, more quickly!
Let me know everything right away. Is she really
better? What was the matter with her?"</p>

<p>"Listen, then: that night in which Selim took her
away there was a storm. Hania wore only a thin dress
which got wet to the last thread. Besides, that mad step
<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
cost her not a little. In Horeli, where Selim took her,
she had no change of clothes, so she returned in that same
little wet dress. That very night she got a chill and a
violent fever. The next day old Vengrosia could not hold
her tongue, and told her about thy trouble. She even
said that thou wert killed. Evidently that hurt her. In
the evening she was unconscious. The doctor did not
know for a long time what the matter was. Thou knowest
that small-pox was in the village; it is here yet. Hania
caught the small-pox."</p>

<p>I closed my eyes, for it seemed that I was losing consciousness;
at last I said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on, father, for I am calm."</p>

<p>"There were moments of great danger," continued he.
"That same day on which we looked on thee as lost, she
too was almost dying. But to both of you a lucky crisis
came. To-day she is recovering, as well as thou. In a
week or so she will be perfectly well."</p>

<p>"But what happened in the house? Oh, what happened?"</p>

<p>My father was silent and looked at me carefully, as if in
fear that his words might have shocked my still feeble mind.
I was lying motionless. Silence continued a long time. I
was collecting my thoughts and was looking at the new
misfortune. My father rose and began to walk with long
strides through the room, looking at me from time to time.</p>

<p>"Father," said I, after a long silence.</p>

<p>"What, my boy?"</p>

<p>"Is she&mdash;is she&mdash;greatly marked?"</p>

<p>My voice was calm and low, but my heart was beating
audibly in expectation of the answer.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered my father. "As usual after the
small-pox. Maybe there will be no marks. There are
marks, now; but they will disappear, of course."
<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
</p>

<p>I turned to the wall. I felt that something worse
than usual was happening to me.</p>

<p>A week later, however, I was on my feet, and in two
weeks I saw Hania. Ah! I will not even attempt to
describe what had become of that beautiful, ideal face.
When the poor girl came out of her room, and I saw her
for the first time, though I had sworn to myself previously
that I would not show the least emotion, I became
weak and fell into a dead faint. Oh, how terribly marked
she was!</p>

<p>When they brought me out of the faint, Hania was
weeping aloud, certainly over herself and me, for I too
was more like a shadow than a man.</p>

<p>"I am the cause of all this!" repeated she, sobbing;
"I am the cause."</p>

<p>"Hania, my dear sister, do not weep; I will love thee
always!" and I seized her hands to raise them to my
lips as before. Suddenly I shivered and drew back my
lips. Those hands, once so white, delicate, and beautiful,
were dreadful. They were covered with black spots, and
were rough, almost repulsive.</p>

<p>"I will always love thee!" repeated I, with an effort.</p>

<p>I lied. I had immense compassion in my heart, and
the tearful love of a brother; but the old feeling had
flown away, as a bird flies, without leaving a trace.</p>

<p>I went to the garden; and in that same hop arbor
where the first confession had taken place between Selim
and Hania, I cried, as after the death of some dear one.
In truth, the former Hania had died for me, or rather,
my love had died; and in my heart there remained merely
emptiness and pain, as if from an incurable wound, and
a memory that presses tears from the eyes.</p>

<p>I sat long and long. The quiet autumn evening began
to flush in the twilight on the tree-tops. They looked
<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
for me in the house; at last my father entered the hop
arbor. He looked at me and respected my sorrow.</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" said he, "God has visited thee grievously;
trust in Him. He knows always what He does."</p>

<p>I rested my head on my father's breast, and for some
time we were both silent.</p>

<p>"Thou wert greatly attached to her," said my father,
after a while. "So tell me, if I were to say to thee,
Give her thy hand for a lifetime, what wouldst thou
answer?"</p>

<p>"Father," replied I, "love may fly from me, but honor
never. I am ready."</p>

<p>My father kissed me heartily, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"May God bless thee! I recognize thee, but it is not
thy duty, not thy obligation; it is Selim's."</p>

<p>"Will he come here?"</p>

<p>"He will come with his father. His father knows
everything now."</p>

<p>In fact, Selim came about dusk. When he saw Hania,
he grew red, and then as pale as linen. For a while a
great struggle between his heart and his conscience was
evident on his face. It was clear that from him too that
winged bird, whose name is love, had flown.</p>

<p>But the noble youth conquered himself. He rose,
stretched out his arms, fell on his knees before Hania,
and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Hania! I am always the same; I will never
desert thee,&mdash;never, never!"</p>

<p>Abundant tears were flowing down Hania's face; but
she pushed Selim away gently.</p>

<p>"I do not believe, I do not believe that it is possible to
love me now," said she; then covering her face with her
hands, she cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, how kind and noble you all are! I alone am
<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
less noble, more sinful; but now all is ended. I am
another person."</p>

<p>And in spite of the insistence of the old Mirza, in spite
of Selim's prayers, she refused her hand.</p>

<p>The first storm of life had broken that beautiful flower
when it had barely opened. Poor girl! She needed now
after the tempest some holy and peaceful harbor, where
she could pacify her conscience, and bring her heart
to rest.</p>

<p>She found that quiet and holy harbor. She became a
Sister of Charity.</p>

<p>Later on, new events and one terrible storm caused
me for a long time to lose sight of her. But after a
number of years I saw her unexpectedly. Peace and
calm were depicted on those angelic features; all traces
of the terrible disease had disappeared. In the black
robe and white head-dress of the cloister she was beautiful
as never before; but it was a beauty not of earth,
beauty more angelic than human.</p>

<h2>TARTAR CAPTIVITY.</h2>

<p class="topnote">FRAGMENTS FROM THE CHRONICLE OF A NOBLE, ALEXIS ZDANOBARSKI.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">MY attendant, riding in advance, or following,
thrummed on his teorban, while sorrow and
longing for Marysia pressed my heart; and the farther
I went the more ardently I loved her. Then came to
my mind the words, <i>post equitem sedet atra cura</i> (behind
the horseman sits dark care). But if in the great decrease
of my fortune I had spoken with his serene great
mightiness, Pan Tvoryanski, I dared not mention my
feelings. Nothing was left me but to win a fortune
with my sword, and when I had adorned myself with
military glory to stand before him. Neither God nor
my Marysia could take it ill of me that I did not make
the confession to Pan Tvoryanski. If Marysia had commanded
me to spring into fire, or into water, or simply
to shed my blood, Thou, O Jesus Christ, who lookest into
my heart, seest that I would have done so. There was
one thing, however, which I could not sacrifice, even for
my charming maiden, and that was the honor of a noble.
My fortune was nothing; but the dignity of blood is
great, and from my ancestors I had received a command,
sacred as a last will, to remember ever that my life
<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
was my own, that I might expose it to peril, but <i>integra
rodu</i>
<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
<i>dignitas</i> was an inheritance from my ancestors,
which I was bound to hand down as I had received it,
that is, <i>integram</i>. O God, grant eternal rest to my ancestors,
and may eternal light shine on them for the ages
of ages! Even had his serene great mightiness, Tvoryanski,
consented to give me his daughter, I had no place
to which I might conduct her. If, considering the scantiness
of my fortune, he, in his pride, had called me a
pauper, or simply a homespun, I, knowing the excellence
of my family, should have been insulted and forced to
take revenge on him, which may God not permit, since
he is the father of my Marysia.</p>

<p>Nothing remained but to go to the frontier. Of trappings,
girdles, and what was best after my ancestors,
some I pawned, others I sold and received three hundred
weighty ducats, which I gave to Tvoryanski on interest;
then, taking farewell of Marysia with tears and deep
sighing, I prepared for the road during the night, and
next morning I and my attendant turned our horses'
heads eastward.</p>

<p>The journey was through Zaslav and Bar to Haysynie.
Stopping now at a castle, now at a mansion, now at an
inn, we came at last to Uman, beyond which the steppe
was open before us, level, rich, silent. My attendant,
riding in advance, played on the teorban and sang songs.
He seemed as if flying before me, the bird, as it were,
which I was pursuing, namely, glory; and behind me followed
another bird; this was grief. We were going to the
stanitsa called Mohylna, where in his day my serene,
great, mighty father stood on guard as colonel of an

<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
armored squadron which he at his own cost had mounted
for war with the Bisurmans.
<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
</p>

<p>It was very far to Mohylna, for, praise be to God, the
Commonwealth has spread itself over the earth widely;
and, besides, we had to travel through steppes, on which
Tartars and various other ruffians were prowling night
and day; a man had to guard his life carefully.</p>

<p>Along the road I marvelled at everything. Since that
was my first time in the Ukraine, I saw the strangest
deeds and strangest things. That country is warlike;
there the common man too is more resolute and daring
than with us, and in peasants there is courage of which
a noble would not be ashamed. When you pass through
a settlement, though people know you to be a man of
birth, they hardly raise a cap, and look you straight in
the eyes. In every cottage there is a sabre and a musket,
and more than one peasant has a hatchet-headed staff in
his hand, like a noble in another place. There is a daring
nature in these people. They even make small account
of commissioners of the Commonwealth; for this the
sabre has punished them already, and will punish them
more in the future. The vicinity of pagans, and continual
readiness for warfare, has developed their courage. They
cultivate the earth not too willingly; and if any one wins
profit from tillage, he prefers to settle on his own fields
rather than on those of a master. On the other hand,
they join escorts of nobles, or light squadrons of the Commonwealth
readily, and are excellent warriors, especially
in scouting and skirmishing, though in battle <i>non cunctant</i>
(they are not slow). They raise shouts, and go at
the enemy as if they were smoke, cutting and thrusting.
Each of their settlements is more like a tabor than a
village; they keep multitudes of horses, which feed winter

<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>and summer in the steppes, and are as swift as those
of the Tartars. Many of these people betake themselves
also to the islands of the Dnieper, and there at the
Saitch lead a life in the fashion of monks, but military
and quite robber-like. From these uncontrolled actions
our dear country has suffered much, and will suffer
much more in the future, till it tames them. It would
be difficult for a noble, or even a great lord, to keep
them in one place; for time after time they break away
to empty steppes, of which in those regions there are
many; they settle in the steppes and live at their own
will. In form of body, and in manners, they are different
from our peasants; they are tall and strong, dark in complexion,
more like Tartars; their mustaches are black,
as with the Wallachians; they shave their heads after
the fashion of pagans, leaving on the very crown only a
tuft, thick and long.</p>

<p>Seeing and considering all this, I wondered greatly at
that land and at everything in it; and as I have called
it warlike, I repeat now, that a country more suited to an
armed and mounted people it would be vain to seek
throughout the whole earth. When some of these
people are killed, others ride in from all sides and along
every road, just as if flocks of birds were flying in; and
throughout that wild steppe it is easier to hear the
sound of muskets, the clatter of sabres, the neighing of
horses, the fluttering of flags in the wind, and the shouts
of warriors, than the lark in a meadow.</p>

<p>Old minstrels, greatly honored by every one, go about
there as in Podolia and Volynia. These, being blind,
play on lyres and sing knightly songs; these minstrels
cause courage and love of glory to flourish greatly. Warriors
in those regions, seeing that they live to-day and
to-morrow decay, esteem their own lives as a broken
<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
copper, and spend their blood as a magnate spends gold,
caring more for a beautiful death than for life and
earthly goods. Others love war above everything, and
though often of high birth, they become almost wild in
continual fighting, and go to battle as if to a wedding,
with great rejoicing and songs. In time of peace they
are terribly grieved at not finding an outlet for warlike
humors, hence they are dangerous to public peace.
These men are called "the desperate." When a warrior
is killed, all count that an ordinary occurrence, and even
his nearest friends do not mourn overmuch for him,
saying that it beseems a man more to die in the steppe,
than in bed, like a woman.</p>

<p>Indeed, in that land is the best school and practice of
knighthood. When a young regiment has passed one
year or two in a stanitsa, it becomes as keen as a Turkish
sabre, so that neither German cavalry nor Turkish janissaries
can stand before its fury when they are equal in
numbers; and what must it be for other inferior soldiers,
as, for example, the Wallachians, or any kind of hireling?
It is easy to quarrel in the steppe; and this should be
avoided, for the whole country is swarming with armed
men.</p>

<p>Advancing with my attendant, I met household troops
of the Pototskis, the Vishnyevetskis, the Kisiels, the
Zbaraskis, in various uniforms, black, red, and many-colored,
now quota troops of the Commonwealth, now squadrons
of the king. The horses of these warriors advanced
to their bellies in grass, and snorted as if swimming in
water; captains managed the squadrons, as shepherd dogs
tend their flocks; the Cossacks beat kettle-drums, blew
their horn trumpets and fifes, or sang songs, making so
tremendous an uproar that when they had passed and
disappeared the wind brought back a sound, as it were, of
<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
some distant storm. At intervals moved also the wagons
of bullock-drivers, which squeaked shrilly; from this
squeaking our horses were frightened. Some of those
bullock-drivers were bringing salt from the Liman at the
Euxine; others were returning from among foul pagans
at the Palus Maeotis, or from Moscow; others were taking
Moldavian wine to the Saitch; and the wagons moved
one after another in the order of storks, forming lines a
mile long on the steppe.</p>

<p>We met also herds of oxen, all of one color, gray, with
great curving horns. Crowding together, they moved so
closely as to form a solid mass, their horned foreheads
swaying from side to side.</p>

<p>Beyond the stanitsa Kiselova, one company of an
important hussar regiment met us. The men were in
full equipment, and a sound went from their wings, as
from those of eagles. My attendant and I could not
take our eyes from them, though it was difficult to look
at the men, for the eye was struck by a terrible glare of
sunlight reflected from their weapons; the gleams from
their lance-points raised upward were like flames of burning
candles suspended in the air. But the hearts rose in
us, for those hussars seemed more like a company of
kings than common warriors, such was the <i>auctoritas</i>
(authority) in them, and the majesty of battle.</p>

<p>Beyond the stanitsa the country was wilder. Often in
the steppe we saw at night fires of Cossack couriers sent
to various stanitsas, or even of peasants who were fleeing
to the steppe. We did not approach these, since we
made our own fires.</p>

<p>At times strangers came to us, either hungry men, or
men gone astray in the steppe; and once came a wonderful
person with a face all grown over with hair, like
a wolf's face. My attendant began to cry out with fear
<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
when he saw him; and I, thinking that I had to do with
a werewolf (wolf man), was reaching for my sabre to
slash him. When that monster did not howl, but praised
God, I would not touch him. The unknown said that
he was a Tartar by descent, but a Catholic. I wondered
at that, for the Tartars in Lithuania adhere to the Koran.
But this man changed his faith for his wife, and, serving
later as a flag-bearer in his regiment, was sent by the
Lithuanian hetmans with a letter to the horde, because
he knew Tartar. Still it was hateful to my man to sleep
at one fire with him. More frequently we spent the night
sleeping in turns, or not sleeping at all, so as to keep
watch of our horses. More than once I stretched on the
grass and looked at the twinkling stars of the sky, thinking
in my soul that the one which looked on me most
lovingly was Marysia. In my grief I had the consolation
of knowing that that little star would never shine for
another, but would keep faith with me, since it had a
heart that was honest, and a soul as pure as a tear dropped
in prayer before God.</p>

<p>At times Marysia came to me in sleep, just as if living;
and one night when she came she promised to pray for
me and to fly after me through the air, like a swallow,
and if she grew weary she would rest on my head, and
twitter to heaven to obtain for me glory and happiness.
Then she vanished like mist; and when I woke I thought
that an angel had been near me, and what astonished me
also was this, that the horses pricking their ears snorted
loudly, as if they had felt some one near them. Considering
such apparitions as a mark of God's favor and encouragement
in my toil, I vowed to the most Holy Mary and
to Saint Alexis, my patron, never to stain myself with
mortal sin, so as to retain their favor in the future also.
That night I prayed till daylight, or till the time of starting.
<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
Generally we were moving on the road before sunrise,
which in those regions is altogether more beautiful
than with us; for when the first rays shoot along the
plain covered with dew from the night cold, the whole
steppe, because of the myriads of flowers, looks like brocade
interwoven with pearls. From this comes joy to
all creatures. Partridges, quails, ptarmigans, and other
birds of the steppe, shooting along through the grass,
dash those pearls down to the earth.</p>

<p>There are countless myriads of birds in that region.
We met every day cunning bustards and slender storks.
These last stand on the ground, stretching upward their
long necks, like spears, and keep guard in order around
the grave mounds; but when they fly through the air,
with tremendous outcry, they rise to such heights that
the eye cannot follow them. Bullock-drivers respect
these birds greatly; for by the order of their flying they
bring the holy cross to one's mind. Warriors too, counting
them with their sabres, predict fortune from their
number; but, according to my reason, this has nothing
to do with reality, for whatever the Lord God in His
mercy intends for a man, He will give anyhow. Of other
birds there are ravens, crows, hawks, and eagles. These
creatures at twilight make a great uproar, now sitting
in a circle on some mound, now breaking out without
cause in a rattling and croaking so immense and complaining
that there is need to shut one's ears.</p>

<p>The evening twilights are far redder than with us.
The reason of this is that pagans shed much Christian
blood there; this blood goes to heaven and is red, crying
for vengeance. Grave mounds here cover the whole
country, as far as the eye can reach, and in them are
lying knights waiting for the day of Judgment. Some
say that these knights are only sleeping, and will wake
<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
when the campaign shall be heralded of all Christian
kings against the pagan. I know not if this be true;
but I think that it may happen, for everything is in the
power of God.</p>

<p>This is a land of warlike people, a land which Poles,
Cossacks, and Tartars, in continual warfare, have trampled
with hoofs of horses, one chasing another in arms. And
so whole generations are like those figures which appear
and disappear in a holiday puppet-show. Many good
nobles come here also to live. They bring peasants from
the Crown, or, finding them in the place, begin settlements;
for though one must lead a life in continual
fear of war, the Lord God has given such courage to
our people that dangers, instead of frightening them,
are rather an enticement. In fact, when a noble youth
comes to years, it is difficult to keep him at home, or on
the school bench, for he is tearing away, like a falcon,
to fly to the border. Many a one loses his life there;
but some poor boy comes out a lord, as have many whose
children live now in their castles, keep escorts, and enjoy
senatorial dignity in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>It is in accordance with God's thought for a knightly
man to become a lord from war and from land, and by
settling the steppe to give growth to the Commonwealth.
From the Masovians, who are great people to multiply,
and who increase like bees in a hive, are descended
most of those colonists. They cultivate the steppe with
ploughs, and become agriculturists readily; but in time of
war they go in a body, one after another, all willing to
die.</p>

<p>Thinking over these matters, I rejoiced greatly; for I
understood that either I should lie down in battle,&mdash;for
which a noble, a Christian warrior should always be
ready,&mdash;and receive a heavenly crown, or, giving notable
<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
service to my country, restore to its former splendor my
family, and delight my ancestors in paradise. They, too,
came to fortune; not by lawsuits at courts, or by uproars
at diets, but by blood, the foundation of life; and what
they received they received from the Commonwealth, and
they did not spare it on behalf of the Commonwealth.
Thus my serene, great, mighty grandfather and my father,
each of them, fitted out a regiment for war against the
Bisurman. May God grant them light eternal in heaven,
for it is proper that a fortune which came with the sabre
should be spent on the sabre. As to me, though my
heart aches for Marysia, and the wind whistles through
my purse, I am the heir of a glorious name and great,
noble ambition, owing to which I hear at night, as it
were, trumpets and voices of some kind, which call to
me, "Preserve thy name unspotted; be equal to thy
fathers; yield not to evil!" Thou, O God, so bless me,
that I shall preserve my name, and be equal to my
fathers! I will break before I bend.</p>

<p>And I proposed to myself that if God would grant me
to await a time of fortune, and go for Marysia, I would go,
not in ticking, but in brocade, not in a torn cap, but in
ostrich plumes, not with one attendant, but with an
escort and with a baton in my hand, as a lord for a lord's
daughter, as a great knight for a senator's child. And
then, without detriment to family honor, I would fall at
the feet of Tvoryanski, for I should bow to him, not as
to a lord for a fortune, but as to a father for his daughter.
In poverty I should have consented to yield her, even
though my soul were rent; for if through love I hope to
make her my wife, I hope in wealth to blow the dust
from before her dear feet, not that they should be bare
and bleeding on life's thorny path.</p>

<p>Better courage entered my heart in proportion as I let
<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
myself deeper into the steppe with my attendant. It is
sad in that steppe, for it is empty; but it is so spacious
there that it seems to a man that he is yonder eagle or
hawk. The grass comes higher and higher along the
sides of the horses, as if it were greeting you with honor;
and while making a great rustling it seems to say, "Welcome,
O warrior of God!" The farther, however, the
more dangerous, for Mohylna is the last Christian watchtower;
the warrior there takes holy communion daily,
so as to be ready for death at all hours.</p>

<p>The Tartars, now in large parties, now singly, circle
around that stanitsa, though when a larger number comes,
an experienced man knows it easily, as in the night the
wolves howl behind them tremendously; for when a
great camp of them moves, whole flocks of wolves follow,
knowing that in the track of it they will find carrion
enough, both of them and their horses. Others are of
opinion, however, that wolves do not eat Tartar flesh,
being friends of the Tartars, who, because of their greed
and foul paganism, may well be compared with wild
beasts.</p>

<p>But while prowling around, dreadful things too meet
the Tartars; for when Cossacks stationed near the armored
squadron of the stanitsa catch one of those pagans, they
have no pity, and commit terrible cruelties.</p>

<p>One night, I saw a great fire in the steppe, and people
around it. I went toward the place with my attendant,
wishing to see who were there, and if God would grant
me to let fly a few arrows among them. But they were
only Cossacks from the stanitsa, who had made a great
fire, and were throwing bound Tartars into it alive, hurling
each one as if he were a sack. The Tartars called on
their Allah in vain. From those who were roasted a
strong odor went out; and the Cossacks, dancing around
<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
the fire like evil spirits, gave themselves up to delight.
I gave command at once to leave off this work, and slay
the prisoners simply with sabres, as was proper; to this
they answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be off, or the same thing will happen to thee!"</p>

<p>When they learned that I was a noble, they removed
their caps; and hearing that I was going to the colonel to
serve, they offered to conduct me to the station. We
went, then, for the rest of the night, in their company,
and without adventure; but on the road I saw one wonder
more. At a certain place the steppe was covered completely
with glittering insects, like those which about
Saint John's day appear with us, but not in such numbers.
These glittered in the darkness throughout the
grass as far as the eye could see, so that you might say
that a part of the sky with the stars had fallen, and was
lying on the earth. Only at dawn did those little stars
cease to gleam; it was not far then to the stanitsa, as
was shown by the crowing of cocks, of which there are
many, for the soldiers love their shrill crowing, and keep
a great number of them. Soon after, when the air became
clearer, we saw in the morning dawn several well-sweeps;
the wind bore to us barking of dogs and neighing
of horses. When nearer still to the stockade, I heard
the song, "<i>Salve janua salutis</i>," which went out over the
dew, and was very loud, for three hundred men were
singing it, kneeling on the square beneath the open sky.</p>

<p>When I reached the stanitsa, I went at once to the
serene, great, mighty Peter Koshyts, a rich nobleman from
Lithuania, and a warrior of experience, who was colonel
there. He had been so hacked in long campaigning that
men said that pagans had written out the whole Koran
on his face with their sabres. He was a knight accustomed
to every trick of war, and had served the Commonwealth
<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
greatly. Having known my father, he received
me as if I had been his own son, and inscribed me that
very day in the regiment. Others told me later that I
had come in good season, for the locusts would soon
swarm from the Crimea. In fact, I learned that there was
great fear, and the alarm was sounded in every stanitsa;
the knighthood was kept in utmost watchfulness.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">WE advanced, as usual, without baggage; for a Tartar
detachment can be overtaken only in that way.
At three in the afternoon, we came to an elevation, called
the Pagan Tombs; and by a lucky chance for us, the fog,
which since morning had covered all the steppe, dropped
down on a sudden. Though we could not see the Tartar
camp itself, we knew from noise and the bellowing of
cattle which came out of the fog, that it was not far
distant. The Cossacks sent forward on reconnoissance,
stole up to the very wagons, seized some prisoners with
lariats, and brought them in so badly beaten and terrified
that, though put to torture at once, blood came from
their mouths instead of words. Our voevoda learned
from them, however, that that camp was the main one;
that the Khan's brother was there present, with many
considerable Murzas; and that, excluding Tartars who
had care of extra horses, wagons, prisoners, and the wagon
train, those who could be employed in battle were only
four times greater in number than our troops.</p>

<p>When he had heard this, the voevoda began to draw us
up on those heights in order of battle. Delight entered
our hearts, for we saw that in the proportion and number
of only four to one the Tartars could not withstand
<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
our impetus; since the tabor, and the great number of
slow cattle, hindered their retreat, they could not flee
from our sabres.</p>

<p>They knew too well of our presence, and, having no
escape, began also to make ready for battle, in their own
way; this we knew at once by the sound of their great
drum, which they call "balt," and which they consider
sacred, obeying its voice in all things.</p>

<p>All at once the fog thinned so much that most of the
horse-tail standards were visible; and next it disappeared
altogether. We saw black swarms of pagandom,&mdash;horse
at the side of horse, and man near man, standing in a
dense mass in the form of a sickle. From out this mass
skirmishers began to break away in flocks, and race off in
various directions. Some of them rushed right up to our
squadrons, jeering at us, shouting terribly, waving their
hands, and challenging all who were ready for single
combat. But the voevoda permitted only Cossacks to
go; he wished to bring the line into perfect order, which
was done quickly, since he was an old warrior, experienced
and very strict.</p>

<p>Standing in readiness for battle, we looked at the
skirmishing and the wonderful work of the Cossacks,
who know best how to manage duels with those vermin.
They chased then for prisoners, and also to kill; but
though we watched intently to see the first body fall
headlong, we could not distinguish it, for numbers fell
together on both sides. The old essaul of the Cossacks
dragged to the very feet of the voevoda a Murza; but
he was strangled, for he had dragged him six furlongs,
and his face was all torn by prickly plants of the steppe.
We took that, however, as a good omen; and the voevoda,
who was hurried, gave command to strike up with drum
and trumpet, and shouted,
<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Begin! begin!"</p>

<p>The horde answered with a tremendous uproar; hearing
these sounds, the skirmishers vanished at once from the
field, on which the hussars had to meet now, as usual,
the entire strength of the enemy.</p>

<p>The whole army stood, as has been said, on the height,
ready to rush directly on the pagan; but it pleased the
courage of the voevoda to let off in advance, according to
old usage, one squadron, like a falcon from the hoop, so
that by breaking everything on its path it might spread
dismay and disorder in the ranks of the enemy.</p>

<p>We saw that squadron moving under the lead of
Babski, as clearly as a thing on the palm of the hand,
since in going down gradually from the height it advanced
right there close to us. When they had passed
the slope, the horses acquired the highest speed, and
the ground bent beneath them, the hussars, leaning forward
in their saddles, lowered their lances. The air
groaned loudly, and such a strong wind from them struck
us that the plumes on our helmets were fluttering. So
they went forward with a noise from their wings, and the
streamers on their lances, just like a storm; and it was
clear that whatever opposed them would be rubbed out
of existence.</p>

<p>The captains had received command to give no succor
till that squadron had cut a road to the rear through
the pagans. We gazed on them well, for they ran about
five furlongs, and, since they went on grass, the dust was
not great. In our squadron, which stood motionless,
there was such silence that the buzzing of horse-flies and
gnats could be heard. Each man was straining his eyes
out after the advancing squadron; at times a horse
neighed, or, smelling blood, stretched his neck and, opening
his nostrils, groaned plaintively.
<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
</p>

<p>In the Tartar camp no small uproar set in among the
pagans; they raised the shout, "Allah! Allah!" and
soon a cloud of arrows, dense as rain, struck the hussars,
rattling on their mail harness. Then came the cry,
"Jesus, Mary!" which was a sign that ours would be
there soon with their lances. Indeed, with God's help,
they arrived and struck with such impetus that the
pagans opened in two halves, like a log when a wedge has
split it. They went through the middle, as if on a street.
Then that street closed behind them, and the throng hid
them completely; we saw only a terrible seething, sometimes
a helmet gleamed, and sometimes, when a horse
reared under a man, we saw an armed hand; then again
a streamer flew into the air, like a bird, and dropped
down.</p>

<p>On the square of the Tartar camp, where there was no
grass, a terrible dust rose, in which there was a struggling
and a boiling. The rattle of muskets, the terrible uproar,
and the shouts almost split our ears. On our side murmurs
began to go about through the squadron, for it was
difficult to remain in one place. Men were ready to rush
forward; horses were rearing.</p>

<p>We began to repeat the litany for the dying; while
doing so, a certain noble youth, instead of saying, "Lord,
have mercy on them!" cried, "I see another streamer!"
Then the warriors cried in one voice for permission to
rush after the others.</p>

<p>A great and unrestrained enthusiasm seized every rank.
Sparks flashed from the eyes of some; others, from desire
for pagan blood, were as flushed as blushing maidens;
still others, who were younger, shed abundant tears, and,
stretching their hands upward, cried, "Let us go to help
our brothers."</p>

<p>But the colonel commanded great silence threateningly,
<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
and said, "It is not proper for knights to strike without
command, like some kind of militia, and spoil the patience
of knighthood with too great eagerness. If any man stirs,
he'll be dragged at a horse's tail!"</p>

<p>We looked now in silence at those who were perishing,
and at the whole Tartar camp, which, like a gigantic serpent
with iron in its entrails, was twisting and squirming
from pain, wishing to smother that squadron which had
fastened into its body.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sun had gone down; the redness of evening
was in the sky. But there was no longer need to
await the command, for suddenly the second squadron
was sent rushing after the first, carrying with it destruction,
after that went the third and the fourth. Under this
avalanche of armed men and horses the camp began to
waver, and it was clear that the foul Mohammed would
fall in the dust at the feet of Mary most pure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the cannon, of which six pieces were drawn
up just behind us, began to act with weight and majesty,
breaking the ends of the camp with their balls. The captains
on our side, according to old custom, rolled up their
sleeves, and shook their batons very fiercely; the rage of
battle rose to our heads like wine. One and another man
cried out the name of his patron; and we heard continually:
"Saint Peter! Saint John! Saint Matthew!" Some,
neglecting the saints, shouted, "Strike! kill!" I, sinful
servant of God, began an ardent prayer, and when I had
finished and raised my thoughts to Mary, a miracle happened
to me, for all at once a pretty little swallow, flying
around above our heads, settled on mine and, clapping
its wings, began to repeat, "Tsivit!" just as if praying for
me. Hence such a power entered my bones that the hair
was rising under my helmet.</p>

<p>The moment had come! An orderly rushed to us
<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
from the voevoda and waved the bunchuk standard; then
the captains hurried to the ranks; the colonel cried, "In
God's name, slay the dog-brothers!"</p>

<p>Our horses rose on their haunches, and next moment
the wind whistled in our ears.</p>

<p>We struck the pagans fiercely; unable to atop us,
they fell, like grain-stalks trampled under hoofs. We
overturned men, horses, tents, pickets. The roaring of
cannon outsounded the crash of breaking lances. Horses
whined. In the crush, after the breaking of the lances,
when new legions fell on us, it came to sabres and two-handed
swords. More than one man fought with the
stump of his sabre, or drove the soul out of a body with
armed fist. Feathers flew into the air from the wings and
the helmets of hussars. The air, hot from the meeting of
men and horses, stopped the breath in the throats of the
combatants.</p>

<p>Now hoarse shouts rose, the groan of trampled men, a
whining, a whistling of sabres and arrows. The pagans
gave a ferocious resistance; but they had become weak;
they were falling ever more thickly, and terror began to
seize hold of them. In the uproar and in blindness they
could not see whither to flee; therefore, howling, and
shielding their faces with their arms, they died under
sword blows. Horses, with their riders, crushed down in
the furious onset, formed quivering piles, and we rushed
over those bodies slippery with blood, cutting through
the crowd to the wagons, from which were heard the
lament of prisoners, the shrill cry of women, and a calling
to Heaven.</p>

<p>The slaughter continued in darkness, until a flame
rose from wagons, which the Cossacks had fired. Smoke
and sparks burst forth in rolls, and in those sparks and
that smoke the cattle in the tabor filled the air with sad
<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
bellowing. Then, when the tabor was broken, oxen,
sheep, goats, riderless horses, and camels, wild from terror,
rushed like a hurricane over the steppe.</p>

<p>The greatest disorder rose at the wagons. Some seized
plunder in the uproar; others cut the bonds of captives
who, feeling their hands free, broke the burning wagons
and struck the enemy with flaming brands. The sobbing
of women roused greater rage in the soldiers, so that even
those who fell on their faces and stretched their hands
out for fetters died beneath the sword.</p>

<p>Considerable detachments which could not break from
the tabor, though they howled, imploring mercy, were
cut to pieces. After those who fled from defeat went
pursuers, and with them I hurried forward. Whole
crowds fled before one man; hands grew weary with
hewing; feet slipped in blood; the breath stopped in the
breasts of horses. In the darkness we cut at random.
At last the horse under me, throwing blood from his
mouth, fell on the grass; next moment a dream, as it
were, seized me, for blood gushed from me in a stream.
I sat down to commend myself to God, or the most holy
Lady, when the steppe went around, the bright stars
began to dance in the sky, and I fainted.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">A PAGAN, according to our language, is a beast as
it were, or an unclean dog; for what is unclean
among men is displeasing to God. And though the Bisurmans
call themselves better than Christians, in the
depth of their conscience they know their uncleanness
and strive eagerly to wash it away, pouring water on
their members seven times daily; they would have no
<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
need to do this, of course, were they less hardened in
sin. With no people is captivity so grievous, because
of their cruelty, and because there are neither churches
nor Catholic priests in the midst of them. If a prisoner
falls into mortal sin, being unable to find absolution at
death, he may be damned easily. They treat prisoners
with cruelty, too, as is shown by what I suffered. They
have a festival which they call "Bimekbairon," before
which they fast a whole month. To conceal his own
vileness with appearances of justice, Mohammed, their
prophet, commanded them to shorten on this day the
period of captivity for prisoners, to give freedom to those
who have served out their time, and declare to all others
how long they must serve in the future, and besides
keep their promises under oath. The oath must be uttered
two hours after midnight, when their priest is on
the tower, or, if there is no tower, when he goes out on a
mound and begins to cry with his fingers in his ears:
Lai Lacha i Lalach Mohammed Rossulach esse de Miellai,
Lala i Lalach! They swear then on books called Hamaeli,
at the bottom of which is depicted the sabre of Ali, the
assistant of Mohammed,&mdash;this sabre they call Delfikari.
If they swear on one of these volumes to any one, they
will keep the oath surely; but they are so skilled in
deceit, that they deceive not only their captives but their
god, by swearing on books made of Venetian soap. Such
an oath, they say, will be washed away by the first rain
that comes, hence it is not possible to believe them.</p>

<p>They sell prisoners into Asia, which is quite another
part of the world; those who remain behind, they send
to herd flocks; when at work they beat these with
raw-hides, and kill them with hunger. Being fond of
idleness themselves, they barely rise up to perform ablutions;
and for the rest of the day sit on horse-skulls
<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
covered with carpets, hold their hands idly across their
stomachs, bend now to the right, now to the left. But
they are very fond of music and the sound of flutes,
and sit listening whole days to whistles. Putting two
of these whistles in the mouth, they play on them, fingering
as on a flute. Besides, they have drums covered
with horsehide, cymbals, bronze disks which make a great
clatter, and long staffs ornamented with horse manes and
covered with little bells. When they play on these instruments,
such a din rises that the dogs howl; but they
themselves are delighted, and say that sweetness comes
to their ears from the noise, and that various diseases
fly away before those voices.</p>

<p>There is great drunkenness among the Tartars, for
though not free to drink wine, they fill themselves with
mare's milk fermented, which goes to the head more than
wine. And then being angry and cruel, they kill prisoners,
after they have tortured them.</p>

<p>Of Christian nations the Genoese and Venetians visit
them in ships, and deal in various places which were
built by the ancients, that is, the Greeks. These Christians
bring, above all, parchment lamps of various colors,
which the Tartars fill with mutton fat; then lighting
these lamps, they hang them on graves and mosques in
endless number, and burn incense. These lights, white,
rosy, green, and blue, seem suspended in the night air,
and afford a wonderful spectacle, which, were it turned
to God's praise, might delight every eye. But just at
that time they permit the greatest vileness.</p>

<p>Their priests are also sorcerers, and communicate with
evil spirits. When the Tartars go to rob and plunder,
these priests make the nights dark for them, and raise
great fogs in the daytime, so that their camp may escape
pursuit.
<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
</p>

<p>There are not so many people at Perekop, and in
the whole Chersonesus, as we in the Commonwealth
imagine; but all are employed in warfare, not merely
the nobles. They are very enduring of hunger, cold, and
toil, for from youth they go naked, from which cause
their skin becomes black. In battle, they cannot stand
before armed men, therefore their warfare consists more
in stratagem than bravery, and in attacking, seizing, and
escaping with all speed. Especially at sight of armored
men they lose heart, saying that there is no power even
in sorcery to stop their impetus. Any hussar squadron
will destroy in battle with the Tartars four or five times
its own number. They have less fear of death than of
captivity among Cossacks; but for them it is easier to
meet the Cossack than it is to meet us. I think that
the Commonwealth, if so minded, might easily conquer
the whole Crimea, if we were in alliance with Venice,
which would send its fleet to the Euxine, and thus not
let the Turks come with assistance. But there are
people, it seems, among us who prefer skirmishing on
the steppes to the safety of the Commonwealth; such
men would not be glad should this happen. God enlighten
them in their blindness.</p>

<p>The mode of living and manners of the Tartars are
beastly; and with their management, or rather indolence,
they would die of hunger were it not for robbery,
which brings them great riches. To robbery they
owe the wealth which I saw among them: such as
countless herds of cattle, fat sheep, playful goats, swift
horses, and camels. Under tents, or in straggling stone
villages, some keep their gold brocade, belts, horse trappings,
goblets, carpets, inlaid weapons, spices, and perfumes,
all piled in heaps, without order. They make no
use of these treasures, fearing that they might have
<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
to give the Khan some of them, or some to the Turks
to whom they are subject. They go about in coats of
sheep-skin with the wool outside. But what any one
has he hides, and says that he is rich, for which reason
others respect him. Of towns built by them I have not
heard; but those which exist are from remote periods.
The Chersonesus was densely inhabited of old, until its
towns and inhabitants were destroyed by various pagans.
Still certain places have remained rather large and very
beautiful; but the inhabitants lead a barbarous life, just
as in filthy camping places.</p>

<p>They took me, with a number of others, to a certain
settlement called Kizlich, at the very shore of the
Euxine, where a small salt stream trickles into deep
water. Houses there are built from the ruins of a city
destroyed, as those people say, by Sauromati. But some
of the buildings are beautiful though much broken. In
old times there were temples; into these now the Tartars
drive sheep and horses at night; only one have they
turned into a mosque.</p>

<p>They dig from the ground too at times stone figures
formed as skilfully as if they were living. Tartar children
sit on the heads of these, or break their limbs
with stones. Those children also threw dust and dirt
at me, and called me "Gaur! gaur!" But I endured that
patiently, all the more since Aga Sukyman, which in
our speech means Solomon, is <i>pr&aelig;fectus</i> of this town;
he it was who found me in a faint and took me captive.
At first he treated me decently. He did this because,
finding handsome armor on my body, and an inlaid sabre,
he considered me a notable person and expected a large
ransom.</p>

<p>I, thinking it improper for a noble even in captivity to
dissimulate, denied out of hand. I told him that though
<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
of distinguished family I had no fortune, and that no
one would come for me with ransom. Not believing this,
he, in his cunning, said to me in Russian,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, you Poles! each man of you calls himself a poor
fellow, and does not promise ransom, so that he may
be put to death; for this you promise yourselves great
delight in heaven from your God."</p>

<p>He did not sell me into Asia, like many others; and
having almost perfect liberty, I went daily to the seashore.
There, sitting on the rocks, I gazed into the
distance of the water, which was as blue as turquoise,
and gave rein to my thoughts. Ofttimes I cried bitterly;
for well I understood that my fate was settled by misfortune
now, and sealed. I could not think of knightly
service to the country, nor of glory, nor Marysia. Hence
sadness seized my soul; suffering gnawed into my heart;
and there came on me terrible yearning for the Commonwealth,
and all that I had lost in it. I would rather
not have come into the world, I would rather have
perished in battle, I would rather Sukyman had given
me to torture at once, for then at least I should have
received the palm, and seen with the eyes of my spirit
that which I yearned for in my body. In pain I saw
not the end of my suffering.</p>

<p>Every Friday, which is Sunday for the Tartars, when
other prisoners had rest from their labors, we sat at the
stream, and, helping one another to weep, we often sang
the psalm: <i>Super flumina Babylonis</i>. Thus the day
passed for us in remembering and speaking of our
country, and from this our souls received no little
solace. It happened that among the prisoners who bore
the yoke of captivity in Kizlich I was the only noble;
hence I exercised a certain rule over the others; I strengthened
their spirit, so that not one might be found who
<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
should wish to lighten his misfortune by deserting the
true faith. In fact, God did not permit that.</p>

<p>Having among the Tartars importance by reason of
the expected ransom, I tried to bring some relief to
other captives. Sometimes I succeeded in giving part
of my food to the hungriest; sometimes I helped them in
their labor. I carried water to the thirsty, not making
it a discredit to myself; for if the Lord Jesus made
common people inferior in birth and blood, He promised
them a crown in heaven, and thereby made them our
younger brothers, to whom protection and defence is due
from the knightly order.</p>

<p>On their part, these captives kissed my hands with
humility; and though I told them that I was only
a captive like them, and that the hour might come in
which they would see me in greater suffering and debasement
than they were in at that time, they would not
believe this, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"For God's sake! that will not be."</p>

<p>But I knew that that would be when Sukyman grew
tired of waiting in vain for the ransom; and I prepared
for the worst that could happen to the body, since the
soul, having lost happiness, was in pain and torture
already.</p>

<p>In fact, Sukyman came one day to me, and said:</p>

<p>"Thou doest ill to repay my favor with ingratitude. I
treat thee like a guest, and thou art living in stubbornness;
see then lest I bend thee under my knee."</p>

<p>Here he declared his plans at once, and asked me to
write to the Commonwealth for a thousand gold ducats,
for which I should receive freedom. I could not do
this: first, because I had only three hundred, and but
little interest had accrued; second, I feared that Pan
Tvoryanski might, through his great liberality, pay for
<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
me out of his own purse, which was opposed to my
ambition. But when the Lord sent terror into my bones
in view of Sukyman's anger, I said, so as to put off the
time of torment, that I must be obedient to his will.
I gave him a letter; but it was to a priest, an acquaintance
whom I had near Kamenets. Describing my captivity,
I begged him to implore aid for me, which could
come from God only.</p>

<p>Delighted in his greed, Sukyman sent that letter by
Tartars going to the fair at Suchava, to which place
attendants are sent by our magnates for sweetmeats.</p>

<p>Sukyman was more cordial now than before, and
invited me to his house, which was the most beautiful in
Kizlich. He was a rich pagan, and greatly respected,
as well for his bravery as his good fortune, which had
withheld favor from him only in one thing, and that
was, that from many wives he had no son, but five
daughters. The eldest of these, Illa, he loved much for
her beauty. I happened often to see her; for the Tartars
do not keep their women in seclusion as the Turks
do, and do not force them to cover their faces. When
Illa came to the table, she looked at me first with fear
and curiosity, as at some wonder. Afterward, when her
native wildness was tamed, she would put a vessel of
fermented milk to my lips without saying a word, or a
ball of rice and mutton, as a sign of her favor. Sukyman
not only did not oppose this, but did the like himself, for
as we met every day he took a great fancy to me,
and frequently persuaded me to throw aside sadness.
Through my influence, the other prisoners too were more
comfortable, since Illa provided all kinds of food for them
plentifully.</p>

<p>Therefore they loved her; and when she came to the
cistern they kissed her garments, calling her their patroness.
<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
That pagan girl had not only a fair countenance,
but a tender heart; so that often I was sorry to think
that she must be damned for the errors of her faith.
To me she showed more and more affection. She would
sit crouched in a corner of the room, and, winding a silk
cloth around her head, look whole hours at me in silence,
her eyes gleaming like a cat's eyes. I asked her one day
why she looked at me in that way. Putting her hand
to her forehead, her lips, and her breast, she bent to my
feet, and replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear one, I wish to be thy captive."</p>

<p>Then she ran away. Sinful desires fell on me, against
which I had to seek defence in ardent prayer. That same
day Sukyman came and said to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou didst deceive me with thy letter, therefore I
ought to kill thee; but since Allah has not blessed me
with sons, I take pity on thy youth and thy beauty.
Therefore I tell thee that if thou wilt reject the errors of
thy faith and receive our Prophet, I will give thee Illa,
who loves thee, and will make thee my son; all that I
have will be thine."</p>

<p>At first I could not let the breath out of my mouth
from mighty astonishment; but when I recovered, I answered
that Satan tempted Christ, showing Him various
kingdoms from a mountain-top.</p>

<p>Enraged at these words, he roared like a wild beast;
he ordered me to take off the clothes which I wore. When
I did this, a Kalmuck captive brought a hempen shirt to
me, and Sukyman commanded me fiercely to carry water
to the cattle.</p>

<p>It was on Monday, I remember, when I had to begin
that labor. I went up the stream, which was salt at the
seaside; I took leather bags, and drawing water carried
it and poured it into a stone cistern. Tartar women, who
<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
went to the stream to wash clothes, set dogs at me. In
the evening I did not go to the village as formerly, but
lay down to sleep among camels. Because I was wearied,
God sent me sleep right away; later I woke on a sudden,
and saw some slender figure coming toward me in the
moonlight. I made the sign of the cross, thinking it a
ghost; but it was Illa, who brought a dish of water, and
olive oil. Then, washing my feet and anointing them, she
sat near by on the straw, and looked as before at me, in
silence, while great silver drops were flowing from her
eyelids.</p>

<p>"Illa," asked I, "why hast thou come here?"</p>

<p>She whispered quietly, showing her moist lids in the
moonlight,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear one, why hast thou despised me?"</p>

<p>From weeping she could say no more. The heart in
me was moved toward that maiden, and I wanted to
gather her to my bosom; but white Marysia stood before
me, and the sinful thought flew away. I told Illa that I
could not be her husband, if only because of her faith,
which in my eyes was for the soul of a man what foul
rust is for iron; but that I could give her more than anything
which might come from others, that is, the holy
cross, which would cleanse her from original sin, and
secure her salvation. In her blindness she could not find
vision; and, seizing her head with both hands, in great
despair, she went away as she had come to me.</p>

<p>The next day I returned to my labor, which was the
more oppressive because they gave me to eat sparingly.
I met Sukyman, also.</p>

<p>"I will bend thee," said he.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt bend only my body," answered I; "for
know that, being a noble, I have a soul that is unbending."
<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
</p>

<p>When he heard this, he went away gnashing his teeth.
Thus did God punish me for that deceitful letter; if I
had not written it, I should not have roused Sukyman
against me so savagely because I had rejected his
daughter.</p>

<p>On Friday the captives came as usual to meditate, to
sing mournful songs, and wash their wounds. Seeing
me in my debasement, they fell at my feet with earnest
weeping, crying that my dignity had been disgraced.
But I did not think so; Christ, though of kingly race,
suffered still greater contempt, wishing by that to show
the estate of nobles that the worth of honorable blood is
stained, not by suffering, but by the dread of it. The
prisoners, hearing of the conditions which Sukyman
offered me, cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, pretend to receive the Prophet; do so only
for appearance' sake, and you will not lose your soul.
When son of the powerful Sukyman, you will bring
comfort to yourself and to us, for we shall be your
captives."</p>

<p>I told them if that was their counsel, they must be
near unto dogs, for they were defiling their lips with
barking against the Lord God, not understanding that it
is improper to incline, even apparently, before the false
prophet. Then they said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We shall all lose our lives here;" and they were in
despair.</p>

<p>God has refused honor to people without birth, and
made them more regardful of temporal profit.</p>

<p>Hearing of this, the pr&aelig;fectus Sukyman became very
angry, and determined to bend me with hunger. He did
not wish to kill, or to sell me; for he himself had long
loved me, and could not kill me because of Illa, who, as
I learned afterward, clung to her father's garments when
<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
he made threats against my life, and with great entreaties
she restrained him, in the hope that my mind would
change soon, in accord with her wishes.</p>

<p>Then times of great affliction came to me, and the foreseen
hour of suffering struck. But when I thought of
my fathers, of the glory and the untarnished name which
they left me, great strength entered my heart. I thought
only of this, not to bring disgrace by anything in captivity
to the order of nobles, the dignity of which I carried
there in myself, and which is the foundation of the
Commonwealth. Sukyman, wishing that I should degrade
myself, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou mayest eat with dogs, and take what is thrown
to them."</p>

<p>Unwilling to do that, I ate only locusts, which I found
on the sea shore. Frequently also food was placed near
me by some unseen hand, in which I suspected Illa. But
later on they watched her, and she could not continue;
other women, Tartar witches, not only had no compassion
for me, but once they so beat me with sticks that
my whole body was blue. If locusts were lacking, I
suffered hunger. Sometimes the captives brought me
figs gathered in the Tartar gardens; but when I saw that
they received blows for so doing, I commanded them to
stop. They looked at me with tears, repeating,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our lord, to what has it come with thee!"</p>

<p>Slavery, not only my own, but that of others, became
more severe; for the Tartars flamed up with great hatred
against us. One poor Cossack, named Fedko, was impaled
on a stake, where he died on the second day afterward,
repeating, "O Christ! O Christ!" In the night
we removed him from the stake and buried him in the
sand by the sea, begging God for a death equally beautiful.
Surely that Father who existed before the ages
<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
ennobled Fedko in heaven, covered him with purple, and
raised him to the highest glory.</p>

<p>I was thinking to part soon with my earthly covering,
for it was a month since I had begun to eat locusts,
which now were scarcer and scarcer in the sand. I had
grown terribly emaciated and black, and my legs were
tottering under me. When I had filled the bags in the
stream, I carried them with groaning, until at last, sitting
down in the camel yard, next to the garden, I could go
no farther. Then those beasts, whose hearts were better
than those of the pagans, stretched out their bent necks
through the hurdle fence to me, and, snorting, took pity
on my suffering.</p>

<p>But once in the night, while half sleeping, I saw Illa
again; she brought water and food to me. Because of
great weakness, I slept in the daytime as well; and God,
in His mercy, sent me dreams about my dear country.
Marysia came to me too, all in white, with angel's wings
on her shoulders; with these she shaded my head from
the heat. She came always at midday, in great heat;
and toward evening, when I was weakest, I heard singing
coming from heaven. I was unconscious perhaps for a
time, for I saw not the light of earth; but afterward
health returned to me, for I saw again new piles of straw,
the enclosure for the camels, and the heads of those
beasts raised toward the sky.</p>

<p>A certain time Sukyman, coming near me, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Learn the power of the servants of the Prophet!"</p>

<p>To which I answered, "Learn that of a servant of
Christ."</p>

<p>Meanwhile a festival came. The Tartars, when night
fell, took those Venetian lamps which I have mentioned,
and ornamented the whole place with them; then each
man, holding a light in his hand, went out on the road,
<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
and they marched on in crowds. That was at the time
of the full moon. They cried in loud voices to their God
and Prophet, for they have a custom to walk and pray
the whole night. They gave great alms also on that day;
captives were sitting in rows along the road; and what
any one asked for in food or in clothing he received. The
years of service were shortened for some; and a certain
Essaul, who had dragged a Tartar child out of the water,
received liberty, for it is mean to refuse what is lawful
on that day. Hence there was great joy among the captives,
for no one suffered hunger or received blows, or
was punished with death. Sukyman walked past the
straw where I was lying, and at his side went Illa; but
very haughtily, for she did not look at me, but taking a
barley cake from a basket she threw it toward me, while
looking in the opposite direction. A Kalmuck captive,
sitting near, seized the cake. Sukyman thought that I
would ask as well as others, and he would not have refused
me. But, though I had not taken anything in my
mouth for a long time, I did not think it befitting a noble
to stretch out his hand with common people, and I chose
to stifle with wind the hunger which was gnawing my
entrails. Sukyman said then to others,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Indeed, this captive has an iron soul; we should entreat
him to have pity on himself, for he puts his own
pride above everything."</p>

<p>The pagan did not know that just then my soul had
placed itself in the dust, and in the greatest weakness
before the Lord, for my suffering was almost stronger
than I was. But in the night some one placed food near
me again. When I had eaten this eagerly, I felt stronger,
and dragged myself at once from the camel yard; and,
though my hands and feet were trembling, I began to
carry water again to the cistern. Of locusts, too, God
<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
sent an abundance during the days which succeeded.
Meanwhile hunger taught me to eat ugly things of the
sea, which, though vile in form, are not bad. I lived
then like a bird from day to day, and when I walked
along the sea shore each wave brought to my feet those
poor snails, making a noise with them as with nutshells.</p>

<p>The nights began to be very cold. Other prisoners
were permitted to go to the village. I had to sleep on my
straw; but the compassionate camels lay around me,
warming me with their breath and bodies. I thought
that I should not endure the cold, and that was my one
hope; I had no other before me. Ah! dear mother, dear
country, how I yearned for thee, and for thee, my maiden,
whom I did not see, but did not cease to love, and desired
all the more,&mdash;desired like water in heat, like bread
in hunger, like death in torture!</p>

<p>Still Providence watches in many ways over those
whom it tries; for had it not been for the misery and contempt
in which I was living, Sukyman might have sold
me to Tsargrad or Galata, where there are great markets
for slaves; but now, because of that misery, no one would
take me at any price, as I was more like a dying man, or
a Lazarus, than a knight. Not to mention that merely a
filthy shirt covered my naked limbs, my leanness had
made me a skeleton, and besides abundant hair had
grown out on my face and head; the skin which had
cracked on all my body was covered with scabs and red
spots from the camels. Some thought me a leper, and
even among captives I began to rouse disgust. But I
offered up for my sins my body, a vain covering, which,
like every garment, tears and falls into rags; for only two
things are lasting, the immortal soul and honor, which,
based upon birth, is its principal quality, just as brightness
is that of stars in the sky.

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">SPRING came again, and a warmer sun shone on my
misery, to which I had become so accustomed that I
had almost forgotten that there are happy people on earth.
Storks, wagtails, swallows, and larks flew in flocks toward
the north; and I said to them, "Free birds, ah, tell the
Commonwealth and all estates that I have endured like a
patriot noble, and though fastened so firmly to the earth,
though trampled by the feet of pagans, I weep only before
God, and preserve a proud face toward my enemies, and
have not let my soul be conquered."</p>

<p>The end of my misery was still far away; but that spring
brought changes, and new omens, it was full of wonderful
auguries: In the sky above the Crimea appeared the
rod of God's anger, a comet, and blinking with blue eye
it shook its tail as a sign of destruction to the Crimea
and pagandom. The terrified Tartars, going with shouting
at night, and with an uproar and rattling, sent clouds
of blazing arrows to the sky to frighten that bird of evil
omen. Their priests proclaimed a fast, and their magicians
predicted a plague. Fear fell upon the hearts of
people; and it was no vain fear, for tidings came that a
plague had broken out at the Palus Maeotis. Expeditions
were to go that spring to the Commonwealth by two
roads; but they did not go. People, standing in crowds
on the street, dared not speak aloud, and only turned their
eyes to the East, whence was to fly the "Black Div," as
they called it. Fresh news was circling continually;
till at last it thundered on Kizlich that the plague had
appeared in the Khan's capital. The Khan himself fled
from his capital. Some said that he would hide with his
<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
wives in the mountains on the south; others that he
would come to Kizlich, where sea breezes purify the air.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Khan, following the advice of soothsayers, came to
Kizlich, driving immense herds and flocks in advance, so
as to have food for his court. Sukyman received him
with great honor; and people fell on their faces before him,
for those slaves consider him almost a god and related to
the heavenly bodies. He did not bring many of the horde,
only his court, a thousand Baskaks, with a few Hadjis, and
Agas in yellow coats; for it was feared that the plague
would appear more easily in a great concourse of people.</p>

<p>The plague travelled over the Crimea, especially that
part called Yenikale. When it attacked a place, it took
every one in it, and passed other villages altogether; but
wherever it went, even birds fell down dead. The nearest
it came to Kizlich was two days' journey. The Khan
thanked God for his escape, and made liberal gifts to the
soothsayers; he also gave freedom to many captives. But
just when others gathered the fruits of his favor, the last
trial met me.</p>

<p>A certain time when the Khan was riding past the
straw on which I was lying, he came very near, looked at
me, and asked Sukyman who that was who seemed to
be so miserable. I know not what answer was given;
but I saw that they talked long together, and evidently
Sukyman was complaining of my ingratitude and stubbornness,
for at last he said aloud, "Try him, lord!"</p>

<p>Made curious by this, the Khan turned his horse
toward me. That moment two messengers sprang out
before him, and shouted, "On thy face, unbelieving dog!"
but I did not obey, though they fell to beating me on the
head with long reeds. Then the master, approaching,
inquired,
<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why wilt thou not fall on thy face before me?"</p>

<p>I answered, "If it is not befitting a noble to do that
before his own king, how dost thou wish me to do it before
a stranger and a pagan?"</p>

<p>Here the Khan, turning his face from me, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou didst speak wisely, O Sukyman." And then
he said to me, "If I were to offer thee the choice, either
to show me honor and fall on thy face before me, for
which thou wouldst receive freedom, or die a cruel
death, which wouldst thou choose?"</p>

<p>To this I answered that it did not befit a captive to
choose; let him, the Khan, do what he liked with me;
but let him observe, however, that each man of the lowest
station may inflict a cruel death; but the majesty of
a monarch, having its source in the will of God, becomes
most like the Creator, and shows its power best, when it
gives life instead of death. He pondered over my words,
and said afterward,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If, being a captive, thou wilt not honor or obey me,
thou dost act against God, who commands captives to
obey."</p>

<p>I answered, "Only my body is in captivity."</p>

<p>Hearing this, the Tartars grew pale; but the Khan was
patient, for it was not in vain that they called him discreet.
After he had meditated a time, he rode away; but
while doing so, he said to the Agas and to his messengers,
"When ye fall into captivity among unbelievers, be like
this man."</p>

<p>Now I had rest for two days, and they brought food
to me. Some even came to me saying, "Our lord will
not forget thee; but when he brings thee into favor, do
not forget us."</p>

<p>Captivity had so debased the hearts of those people
that, foreseeing a change in my fortune, they were seeking
<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
favors with me while I was still lying in filth. I
rejoiced in soul, for I thought that I should receive freedom,
and perhaps with it find happiness. After two days,
the Khan, in passing, turned his horse to me a second
time.</p>

<p>"I have weighed," said he, "thy words in my wisdom,
and I put them on the scales of justice. Thou hast
found favor with me for thy courage; say then what
thou dost wish that I should do for thee?"</p>

<p>I answered that for one born in a free condition, freedom
was the dearest fruit of his favor.</p>

<p>"And if I refuse it?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Then give me death."</p>

<p>He stopped again; he desired so much that all should
admire and praise his wisdom that he undertook nothing
without meditation. During this time the heart was
beating in me like a hammer. After he had thought a
while, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not draw the bow too far lest it break and wound
thy hands; therefore I tell thee my last words: I will
give thee a yellow coat, take thee to my court, reward
thee with riches, and make thee my equerry, will not
extort change of faith from thee, if thou wilt promise to
serve me with good will."</p>

<p>My heart quivered at once with great joy, but suddenly
I thought that those were temptations of Satan, and
besides what should I say to my fathers in answer to
their question, "What wert thou on earth?" Could I
say to those knights who had fallen in battle, "I was
of my own choice a Tartar equerry"? And a terrible fear
seized me before that question of my fathers, a fear
greater than torture and death; stretching out my hands
to the Khan then, I cried, "Oh, lord, do not ask my will,
for the will comes from the soul; the soul is not only
<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
mindful of faith, but of the condition in which it entered
the world; and receiving that condition from my fathers,
I must bear it back to them unspotted."</p>

<p>"Captive, thou hast broken the bow," said the Khan.</p>

<p>I saw that the hour had come, for anger began to appear
on his face; but he recollected himself and spoke these
words to Sukyman,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wise Sukyman, indeed, I have gone too far in kindness
to this dog, and now I command thee to break
him without fail; but before thou takest his life, bring
him by torture to this, that he shall crawl in obedience
even at thy feet."</p>

<p>Then he rode away; Kalmucks took me and bound
me to a stake, at command of Sukyman. All the people
and captives that were there ran together to see what
tortures would be given me. Directing my soul to God
with all the strength that was in me, I implored this of
Him most, to give me fortitude, and not let me debase
myself. All at once I felt that my prayer was heard, for
a strong spirit breathed on me. I thought that I represented
the power of that cross which never will perish;
that I was there as an envoy of the Commonwealth, a
delegate from the estates to be tortured; that I was there
a soldier, to die at command of Christ, called to testify
with my blood the foundation of my life, to testify to
the soul, which, like a heavenly fire, does not perish.</p>

<p>And thinking thus, though wretched, weak, covered
with dust, emaciated by hunger, I felt immeasurable
majesty within myself, as if I had been looking from
some height on this world. The Kalmucks began to
lash me with rawhides, and soon I was swimming in
blood.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou fall on thy face?" asked they.</p>

<p>"I am a Polish noble," I answered.
<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
</p>

<p>Then they lashed me again; others lighted slow fires
at my feet, so that, while burning, I should cry the sooner
for mercy. In fact, I began to yield, but not in soul,
only in body, for great weakness passed through my
bones, and the light of day paled before my eyes. Seeing
that death was approaching, I raised my head with
the remnant of my strength, and cried in the direction
of the Commonwealth, "Dost thou see me; dost thou
hear me?"</p>

<p>Then suddenly, as it were, across all the steppe and
through Perekop, came to me the voice, "I see." In
the distance something began to seem hazy; the heavens
and the air ran together; out of this came a woman with
a sweet face and stood near me. The fire ceased to burn
me; the rawhide whistled above me no more, and I felt
that I was flying, borne on the hand of that woman.
With her was a legion of angels singing, "Not in a kontush
and with a sabre, but in wounds, O knight, knight
manful in battle, enduring in torture! O Paladin of
Christ, faithful son of the bloody land! Welcome to
peace! welcome to happiness! welcome to joy!" And
so we flew onward to heaven, and what I saw there my
sinful lips cannot utter to mortal ears.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">A WAGON squeaks under me, and a fresh, cool
breeze blows around. I open my eyes; I see not
Kizlich, but a steppe,&mdash;a steppe like the sea. Then I
close my lids, thinking that a dream is presenting some
puppet-show before me. I look again; I see the old face
of Kimek, Pan Tvoryanski's house-steward, and behind
him a number of attendants.
<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
</p>

<p>"Praise be to God," he says, "you have recovered!"</p>

<p>I ask whither I am going.</p>

<p>"To the Commonwealth."</p>

<p>"I am free?"</p>

<p>"Free."</p>

<p>"Who ransomed me?"</p>

<p>"The young lady."</p>

<p>When he said "young lady," something like an immense
weeping burst forth from my breast. I stretched out my
hands; I fainted.</p>

<p>When I came to myself a day later, a wagon was
squeaking beneath me, and Kimek told all. Behold, Pan
Tvoryanski had been transferred from this wretched
world to a better one, leaving Marysia his heiress; she was
living with her uncle, a bishop. Tidings of my misery, my
torments and tortures, reached them; then she, falling at
her uncle's feet, acknowledged her love, and, with his permission,
ransomed me from Sukyman's power.</p>

<p>Kimek did not find the Khan in Kizlich. When the
plague passed he went to a place called Eupatoria; and
Sukyman, thinking me dead, sold what was left of me for
three hundred gold ducats.</p>

<p>Kimek also thought that he would be more likely to
take me home dead, for I took no note of God's world
for two weeks; still the Lord restored life to me.</p>

<p>Hearing all this, and understanding that I was ransomed
from pagan captivity at the instance of my
maiden, I wept earnestly, and made this vow in my soul
to love that compassionate maiden and guard her during
my lifetime. It seemed to me then that my stay in the
Crimea, my captivity with Sukyman, and the tortures
which I had suffered were a dream. Providence so orders
the things of this life that in time everything passes and
remains only in memory, with this difference, however,
<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
that the harsher the happenings the pleasanter it is to
remember them. So that not only past labors, but sorrows
become joyous.</p>

<p>If God sometimes tries a man of knightly station
severely, He adds strength to him; and if He takes his
life, He rewards him even in that way. He sent me
a saving angel in my Marysia, and did not let me disgrace
myself in time of trials.</p>

<p>When I woke in the night, or when the morning
dawned and I waked after sleep, I repeated that I was
going to my birthplace, and would see Marysia. Thinking
thus, I wished to sit on horseback immediately; but
Kimek would not permit that, as there was no strength
in me. I lay on my back in the wagon, like some bag,
and in that way we went to Mohylna. There, when my
old comrades saw me, they rushed out like bees from a
hive, crying, "We know of thee, we know! we know!
Welcome, dear comrade!" and looking at my feet, into
which burnt coals had settled thickly, they covered themselves
with tears, and one repeated to another, "Bend
the head before him, for he is the truest knight among
all!" Then they began to give me what each owned or
had acquired from plunder: hence, horses with trappings,
silk tents, sabres set with precious stones, Italian sequins,
Turkish cloth, holsters, rich daggers, vessels of silver or
of pure gold, sable furs; one man would give a handful
of turquoises or rubies, another a diamond clasp or
pin, so that they threw down before me treasures worth
thousands of gold ducats which I had to carry in five
wagons. This they did with good heart, but the more
easily since they were going on a war against the Cossacks;
for Loboda and Nalevaika had begun their movement
in the Ukraine, for which they were crushed by
Jolkevski.
<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
</p>

<p>Then we went farther. Frequently various detachments
of warriors met us, and some warriors, when approaching,
inquired: "Whom are ye carrying?" To
which Kimek answered, "A noble cut to pieces in captivity."
After these words each not only left us in
quiet, but besides gave what he could. Beyond Kieff,
we met Jolkevski himself, who, feigning a march on
Pereyaslav, wanted to cross the Dnieper. When that
famous warrior heard what had met me in captivity, he
said, "They reward men of less value with starostaships;
I will write to the king of this." He gave me a
costly ring, which I wear on my finger till now. My
heart rose at sight of his warriors, who, though not
numerous, and fatigued by continual pursuing, were so
trained and so willing that in no battle could an enemy
hold the field before them.</p>

<p>Looking at those men, black from the wind, men who
slept on the grass of the steppe, ate nothing for two
days and three, removed not their armor at night
even, who stanched their wounds with powder, and who
withal had the courage of heroes, I felt humble, and
thought it not well to be elated and think much of my
services, when those made naught of enduring such hardships
and were singing in gladness, as if not understanding
that they were heroes. Oh, how sorry I was not to
be able to mount a horse, wear armor, carry a lance, and
go with them! I had to stay behind, and besides pull
out dead coals from my skin.</p>

<p>There were great delights at that time in the Ukraine
for all valiant souls. Every night flames could be seen,
and battle trumpets heard.</p>

<p>Pan Pototski, voevoda of Kamenyets, with Jolkevski,
whirled around the steppes like an eagle. Prince Rojinski
was victorious near Pavolochy; Yazlovetski was
<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
skirmishing; Nalevaika, Loboda and Sasko, with the rabble,
rushed away through ravines like fleeing wolves.</p>

<p>Once peasants drunk on Moldavian wine met us. Kimek
told them, as he had others, that he was taking
home a wounded noble. They lighted many torches to
recognize me in the night; then they moved on, taking
me to Kremski. When torches were lighted in Kremski's
camp I was recognized by that Cossack Essaul who
had been with me in the Crimea and was liberated for
saving a child. This Cossack began to cry, "O lord!
O lord!" and afterward, while saying, "That Pole they
are taking is a saint!" he fell at my feet. When he told
Kremski how I had helped them in captivity, others
came to me cap in hand; these I reprimanded at once
for not remaining in obedience to the Commonwealth.
Kremski not only did not take my life, more than that,
he took nothing, but, having made me a present, sent a
guard with me. So the enemy is able to honor wounds
and bravery in a warrior, for this God certainly rewarded
Kremski with salvation; he was not so hostile to the
Commonwealth as people imagined.</p>

<p>In the Ukraine, nay, in the whole Commonwealth, it
was seething as in a beehive, and God sent many misfortunes
on our land; for with war moved also that hell-dweller,
the pestilence. When their minds were occupied
with other things, there were few who paid attention to
it; but I saw it with my own eyes from the wagon. That
pestilence went not in a straight line, but, as in the
Crimea, attacked in spots, carrying off single hamlets, villages,
and settlements. Here and there also were mayors
of the air,
<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
so called; and piles of manure were burning
<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
in the villages, smoking abundantly and offensively, the
odor of which the pestilence could not endure. In the
night tar-makers watched these heaps lest the fire should
die out in them. The people, in view of disaster, formed
processions, in which banners with death-heads were carried.
At the same time God sent down blindness of some
sort on men; for there was no agreement among magnates,
who, instead of mounting their horses, as they might have
done, simply and honestly, disturbed diets with their
wrangling. The enemy assembled on the borders, and
our forces were wonderfully scattered. In this, our misfortune
has ever consisted; for if all the nobles and magnates
would rush to battle in harmony, the orb of the earth
would tremble before us. I say this, because there are
none who can stand before our lances. Later in life I saw
Turkish janissaries, Scottish infantry, and Swedish cavalry
broken by them; so I assert, that nature endowed us more
richly with warlike capacity than others, but we send a
thousand men out, where others send ten times as many.</p>

<p>The secret of why this is done must be sought in God's
will, for it should seem to each one easier to mount a
horse, than disturb with the tongue. Greater glory would
result, less error of mind, greater merit, and more certain
salvation.</p>

<p>A man passes like a traveller through the world, and
should not be concerned for himself, but only for the
Commonwealth, which is and must be without end.
Amen!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">O GOD, Holy, Almighty, Immortal, be Thou praised in
Thy works! Whenever I turn my eyes filled with
tears, I see Thee, and when I see Thee I confess Thee.
<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
Thou hast hung the fires of heaven in the firmament.
Thou, in commanding the sun to rise from the sea, makest
day on the mountains and in the valleys. In Thy praise
is the murmur of pine woods and the lowing of flocks in
the field. In Thy praise armies ride through the steppes,
with the neighing of horses; and every earthly Commonwealth
gives Thee honor. And because Thou hast
deserted Thy servant and deprived him of happiness, in
this too be Thou praised. My life has passed in war,
and my hair has grown white in trials. O Lord, I was
present where cannon sang Thy majesty with fire, and
thundered Thy name in smoke! In Moldavia and Livonia
my blood has flowed; and to-day I am old, my dim pupils
are turning earthward, and my body desires endless rest.
Not earthly goods, not wealth, not honors, not offices do I
bear to that world with me, for behold I am poor as at
first. But, O Lord, I will show Thee my shield, and I
will say: "Behold, it is stainless; that is only my blood!
My name I have preserved unspotted; I have not yielded
in spirit&mdash;though bending from pain, I did not break."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here ends the fragment from the diary of Alexis
Zdanoborski. It appears from this short chronicle that
that "unbroken prince," who would not become a Tartar
equerry, had a life full of suffering. In accordance with
the spirit of the time he was greatly attached to his
name. With Marysia, as is evident from the closing
commentary, he was separated by fate. It is certain
also that he never married. Indeed, it is proper to infer
from all, that this noble died without posterity, and was
the last of his race.</p>

<h2>LET US FOLLOW HIM.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">CAIUS Septimius Cinna was a Roman patrician.
He had spent his youth in the legions and in severe
camp-life. Later he returned to Rome to enjoy glory,
luxury, and a great though somewhat shattered fortune.
He used and abused at that time everything which the
gigantic city could offer.</p>

<p>His nights were spent at feasts in lordly suburban
villas; his days in sword practice with fencers, in discussions
with rhetors at the baths, where disputes were
held, and where the scandal of the city and the world
was related, in circuses, at races, at the struggles of gladiators,
or among Greek musicians, Thracian soothsayers,
and wonderful dancing-girls from the islands of the
Archipelago. He inherited from the renowned Lucullus,
a relative on the mother's side, a love for exquisite
dishes. At his table were served Grecian wines,
Neapolitan oysters, Numidian mice, and locust fat preserved
in honey from Pontus.</p>

<p>Whatever Rome possessed Cinna must have, beginning
with fish of the Red Sea, and ending with white ptarmigans
from the banks of the Borysthenes (Dnieper). He
made use of things not only as a soldier run riot, but as
a patrician who passes the measure. He had instilled
into himself, or had perhaps even roused in himself, a
<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
love for the beautiful,&mdash;a love for statues rescued from
the ruins of Corinth, for pitchers from Attica, for Etruscan
vases from foggy Sericum, for Roman mosaics, for
fabrics brought from the Euphrates, for Arabian perfumes,
and for all the peculiar trifles which filled the void of
patrician life.</p>

<p>He knew how to talk of these trifles, as a specialist and
connoisseur, with toothless old men, who decked out their
baldness in wreaths of roses when going to a feast, and
who after the feast chewed heliotrope blossoms to make
the breath of their lungs odoriferous. He felt also the
beauty of Cicero's periods, and of verses of Horace or
Ovid.</p>

<p>Educated by an Athenian rhetor, he conversed in
Greek fluently; he knew whole pages of the "Iliad" by
heart, and during a feast could sing odes of Anacreon till
he had grown hoarse or drunk. Through his master
and other rhetors he had rubbed against philosophy, and
become sufficiently acquainted with it to know the plans
of various edifices of thought reared in Hellas and the colonies;
he understood too that all these edifices were in
ruins. He knew many Stoics personally; for these he
cherished dislike, since he looked on them rather as a
political party, and, besides, as hypochondriacs, hostile
to joyous living. Sceptics had a seat frequently at his
table; and during intervals between courses they overturned
entire systems, and announced at their cups, filled
with wine, that pleasure was vanity, truth something unattainable,
and that the object of a sage could be only
dead rest.</p>

<p>All this struck Cinna's ears without piercing to the
depth. He recognized no principle, and would have none.
In Cato he saw the union of great character and great
folly. He looked on life as a sea, on which winds blew
<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
whithersoever they listed; and wisdom in his eyes was
the art of setting sails in such fashion that they would
urge one's boat forward. He esteemed his own broad
shoulders and sound stomach; he esteemed his own beautiful
Roman head, with his aquiline nose and powerful
jaws. He was certain that with these he could pass
through life somehow.</p>

<p>Though not belonging to the school of Sceptics, he
was a practical Sceptic and hence a lover of pleasure,
though he knew that pleasure was not happiness. The
genuine teaching of Epicurus he did not know; hence he
considered himself an Epicurean. In general he looked
on philosophy as mental fencing, as useful as that which
was taught by the sword-master. When discourses on it
wearied him, he went to the circus to see blood.</p>

<p>He did not believe in the gods any more than in virtue,
truth, and happiness. He believed only in soothsaying,
and had his own superstitions; moreover, the mysterious
beliefs of the Orient roused his curiosity. To slaves he was
a good master, unless when occasional tedium brought him
to cruelty. He thought life a great amphora, which was
the more valuable the better the wine contained in it; hence
he tried to fill his own with the best. He did not love any
one; but he loved many things, among others his own eagle-like
face with splendid skull, and his shapely patrician
foot.</p>

<p>In the first years of his frolicking life he loved also to
astound Rome, and succeeded a number of times. Later
he grew as indifferent to that as to other things.
<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">AT last he ruined himself. His creditors tore his
property to pieces, and in place of it there remained
to Cinna weariness, as after great toil, satiety, and one
more unexpected thing, a certain deep disquiet. He had
tried wealth; he had tried love, as that age understood it;
he had tried pleasure, military glory, and dangers. He had
come to know the limits of human thought more or less;
he had come in contact with poetry and art. Hence he
might suppose that from life he had taken what it
had to give. Now he felt as though he had overlooked
something&mdash;and that the most important. But he did
not know what it was, and tortured his head over this
problem in vain. More than once had he striven to shake
himself out of these thoughts, and out of this disquiet.
He had tried to persuade himself that there was nothing
more in life, and could not be; but straightway his disquiet,
instead of diminishing, increased quickly to such a
degree that it seemed to him that he was disquieted not
only for himself, but for all Rome. He envied the Sceptics
and also considered them fools, for they insisted
that one may fill completely the void with the empty.
There existed in him then two men, as it were, one of whom
was astonished at the disquiet which he felt, while the
other was forced to recognize it as perfectly normal.</p>

<p>Soon after the loss of his property, thanks to great family
influence, Cinna was sent to an official post in Alexandria,
partly to build up a new fortune in a rich country.
His disquiet entered the ship at Brundisium, and sailed
across the sea with him. In Alexandria Cinna thought
that questions concerning office, new people, another
<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
society, new impressions, would relieve him of the intrusive
companion. But he was mistaken.</p>

<p>Two months passed, and just as the grain of Demeter,
brought from Italy, grew still more luxuriantly in the
rich soil of the Delta, so his disquiet from a sturdy twig
changed, as it were, into a spreading cedar, and began to
cast a still greater shadow on the soul of Cinna.</p>

<p>At first he strove to free himself of this shadow by the
same life that he had led in Rome formerly. Alexandria
was a place of pleasure, full of Grecian women with golden
hair and clear complexions, which the Egyptian sun
covered with a transparent, amber lustre. In their society
he sought rest.</p>

<p>But when this also proved vain he began to think of
suicide. Many of his comrades had freed themselves
from life's cares in that manner, and for causes still more
foolish than those which Cinna had,&mdash;frequently from
weariness alone, from the emptiness of life, or a lack of
desire to make further use of it. When a slave held a
sword adroitly and with sufficient strength, one instant
ended all. Cinna caught at this idea; but when he had
almost resolved to obey it, a wonderful dream held him
back. Behold, it seemed to him that when he was borne
across the river
<a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
he saw on the other bank his disquiet in
the form of a wretched slave; it bowed to him, saying, "I
have come in advance to receive thee." Cinna was terrified
for the first time in life; because he understood that
if he could not think of existence beyond the grave without
disquiet, then they would both go there.</p>

<p>In this extreme, he resolved to make the acquaintance
of sages with whom the Serapeum was crowded, judging
that among them perhaps he might find the solution of his
riddle. They, it is true, were unable to solve any doubt
<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
of his; but to make up they entitled him "of the museum,"
which title they offered usually to Romans of high birth
and position. That was small consolation at first; and
the stamp of sage, given a man who could not explain
that which concerned him most highly, might seem to
Cinna ironical. He supposed, however, that the Serapeum
did not reveal all its wisdom at once, perhaps; and
he did not lose hope altogether.</p>

<p>The most active sage in Alexandria was the noble
Timon of Athens, a man of wealth, and a Roman citizen.
He had lived a number of years in Alexandria, whither
he had come to sound the depths of Egyptian science.
It was said of him that there was no parchment or
papyrus in the Library which he had not read, and that
he possessed all the wisdom of mankind. He was, moreover,
mild and forbearing. Cinna distinguished him at
once among the multitude of pedants and commentators
with stiffened brains, and soon formed with him an
acquaintance which, after a time, was changed into close
intimacy, and even into friendship. The young Roman
admired the dialectic skill, the eloquence and dignity,
with which the old man spoke of lofty themes touching
man's destiny, and that of the world. He was struck
especially by this, that that dignity was joined to a certain
sadness. Later, when they had grown more intimate,
Cinna was seized frequently by the wish to inquire of the
old sage the cause of that sadness, and to open his own
heart to him. In fact, it came to that finally.
<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">A CERTAIN evening, after animated discussions about
the transmigration of souls, they remained alone
on the terrace, from which the view was toward the sea.
Cinna, taking Timon's hand, declared openly what the
great torment of his life was, and why he had striven to
approach the scholars and philosophers of the Serapeum.</p>

<p>"I have gained this much at least," said he; "I have
learned to know you, O Timon, and I understand now that
if you cannot solve my life's riddle, no other man can."</p>

<p>Timon gazed for a time at the smooth surface of the
sea, in which the new moon was reflected; then he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hast thou seen those flocks of birds, Cinna, which fly
past here in winter from northern glooms? Dost thou
know what they seek in Egypt?"</p>

<p>"I do. Warmth and light."</p>

<p>"Souls of men also seek warmth, which is love, and
light, which means truth. The birds know whither they
are flying for their good; but souls are flying over roadless
places, in wandering, in sadness, and disquiet."</p>

<p>"Why can they not find the road, noble Timon?"</p>

<p>"Once man's repose was in the gods; to-day, faith in
the gods is burnt out, like oil in a lamp. Men thought
that to souls philosophy would be the light of truth;
to-day, as thou knowest best of all, on its ruins in Rome
and in the Academy in Athens, and here, sit Sceptics,
to whom it seemed that it was bringing in peace, but
it brought in disquiet. For to renounce light and
heat is to leave the soul in darkness, which is disquiet.
Hence, stretching out our hands before us, we seek an
exit in groping."
<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
</p>

<p>"Hast thou not found it?"</p>

<p>"I have sought, and I have not found it. Thou hast
sought it in pleasure, I in thought; and the same mist
encircles us. Know then that not thou alone art suffering,
but in thee the soul of the world is tortured. Is it
long since thou hast ceased to believe in the gods?"</p>

<p>"At Rome they are honored publicly yet, and even
new ones are brought from Asia and Egypt; but no
one believes in them sincerely, except dealers in vegetables,
who come in the morning from the country to
the city."</p>

<p>"And these are the only people who live in peace."</p>

<p>"They are like those who bow down here to cats and
onions."</p>

<p>"Just like those, who, in the manner of beasts, ask for
nothing beyond sleep after eating."</p>

<p>"But is life worth the living in view of this?"</p>

<p>"Do I know what death will bring?"</p>

<p>"What is the difference, then, between thee and the
Sceptics?"</p>

<p>"Sceptics are satisfied with darkness, or feign that
they are satisfied, but I suffer in it."</p>

<p>"And thou seest no salvation?"</p>

<p>Timon was silent for a moment, and then answered
slowly, as if with hesitation,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wait for it."</p>

<p>"Whence?"</p>

<p>"I know not."</p>

<p>Then he rested his head on the palm of his hand; and
as if under the influence of that silence which had settled
down on the terrace, he began to speak in a low and
measured voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"A wonderful thing; but at times it seems to me that
if the world contained nothing beyond that which we
<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
know, and if we could be nothing more than we are, this
disquiet would not exist in us. So in this sickness I
find hope of health. Faith in Olympus and philosophy
are dead, but health may be some new truth which I
know not."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Beyond expectation, that talk brought great solace to
Cinna. When he heard that the whole world was sick,
and not he alone, he felt as if some one had taken a
great weight from him and distributed it on a thousand
shoulders.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">FROM that time the friendship uniting Cinna and the
old Greek became still more intimate. They visited
each other frequently and exchanged thoughts, like bread
in time of a banquet. Besides, Cinna, in spite of experience
and the weariness which comes of use, had not
reached the age yet when life has ceased to contain the
charm of unknown things; and just this charm he found
in Antea, Timon's only daughter.</p>

<p>Her fame was not less in Alexandria than the fame of
her father. Eminent Romans frequenting Timon's house
did her homage, Greeks did her homage, philosophers
from the Serapeum did her homage, and so did the
people. Timon did not restrict her to the gineceum, after
the manner of other women; and he tried to transfer to
her everything that he himself knew. When she had
passed the years of childhood, he read Greek books with
her, and even Latin and Hebrew; for, gifted with an
uncommon memory, and reared in many-tongued Alexandria,
she learned those languages quickly. She was a
<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
companion to him in thoughts; she took frequent part in
the discussions which were held in Timon's house during
Symposiums. Often in the labyrinth of difficult questions,
she was able, like Ariadne, to avoid going astray
herself and to extricate others. Her father honored and
admired her. The charm of mystery and almost of
sacredness surrounded her, besides; for she had prophetic
dreams, in which she saw things invisible to common
mortals. The old sage loved her as his own soul, and the
more for this reason, that he was afraid of losing her; for
frequently she said that beings appeared in dreams to
her,&mdash;ominous beings,&mdash;also a certain divine light, and
she knew not whether this light was the source of life or
death.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she was met only by love. The Egyptians,
who frequented Timon's house, called her the Lotus; perhaps
because that flower received divine honor on the
banks of the Nile, and perhaps also because whoever saw
it might forget the whole world besides.</p>

<p>Her beauty was equal to her wisdom. The Egyptian
sun did not darken her face, in which the rosy rays of
light seemed to be enclosed in transparent mother-of-pearl.
Her eyes had the blueness of the Nile, and their
glances flowed from a remoteness as unknown as the
source of that mysterious river. When Cinna saw and
heard her the first time, on returning home, he conceived
the wish to rear an altar to her in the atrium of his house,
and offer a white dove on it. He had met thousands of
women in his life, beginning with virgins from the remote
north, with white eyelashes and hair the color of
ripe wheat, and ending with Numidians, black as lava;
but he had not met hitherto such a figure, or such a soul.
And the oftener he saw her, the better he knew her, the
oftener it happened to him to hear her words, the more
<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
did amazement increase in him. Sometimes he, who did
not believe in the gods, thought that Antea could not be
the daughter of Timon, but of a god, hence only half
woman, and therefore half immortal.</p>

<p>And soon he loved her with a love unexpected, immense,
irresistible, as different from the feeling which he
had known up to that time as Antea was different from
other women. He desired to love her only to do her
honor. Hence he was willing to give blood to possess
her. He felt that he would prefer to be a beggar with
her than to be C&aelig;sar without her. And as a whirlpool
of the sea sweeps away with irresistible might all that
comes within its circle, so Cinna's love swept away his
soul, his heart, his thoughts, his days, his nights, and
everything out of which life is composed.</p>

<p>Till at last it swept away Antea.</p>

<p>"<i>Tu felix</i> (Thou art happy), Cinna!" said his friends.</p>

<p>"<i>Tu felix</i>, Cinna," said he to himself; and when at
last he married her, when her divine lips uttered the
sacramental words, "Where thou art Caius, there am I,
Caia," it seemed to him that his felicity was like the sea,&mdash;inexhaustible
and boundless.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">A YEAR passed, and that young wife received at her
domestic hearth almost divine honor; to her husband
she was the sight of his eyes, love, wisdom, light.
But Cinna, comparing his happiness with the sea, forgot
that the sea has its ebbs.</p>

<p>After a year Antea fell into an illness cruel and unknown.
Her dreams changed into terrible visions, which
exhausted her life. In her face the rays of light were
<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
quenched; there remained only the paleness of mother-of-pearl.
Her hands began to be transparent; her eyes sank
deeply under her forehead; and the rosy lotus became
more and more a white lotus, white as the face of the
dead. It was noticed that falcons began to circle above
Cinna's house, which in Egypt was a herald of death.
The visions grew more and more terrible.</p>

<p>When at midday the sun filled the world with bright
light, and the city was buried in silence, it seemed to
Antea that she heard around her the quick steps of invisible
beings, and in the depth of the air she saw a
dry, yellow, corpse-like face gazing with black eyes at
her. Those eyes gazed persistently, as if summoning her
to go somewhere into a darkness full of mysteries and
dread. Then Antea's body began to tremble, as in a
fever; her forehead was covered with pallor, with drops of
cold sweat; and that honored priestess of the domestic
hearth was changed into a helpless and terrified child,
who, hiding on her husband's breast, repeated with pale
lips,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Save me, O Caius! defend me!"</p>

<p>And Caius would have hurled himself at every spectre
which Persephone might send from the nether world, but
in vain did he strain his eyes into space round about.
As is usual in midday hours, it was lonely. White light
filled the city; the sea seemed to burn in the sun, and in
the silence was heard only the calling of falcons circling
above the house.</p>

<p>The visions grew more and more frequent, and at last
they came daily. They pursued Antea in the interior of
the house, as well as in the atrium and the chambers.
Cinna, by advice of physicians, brought in Egyptian
sambuka players, and Bedouins, blowing clay whistles;
the noisy music of these was to drown the sound made
<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
by the invisible beings. But all this proved futile. Antea
heard the sound amid the greatest uproar; and when the
sun became so high that a man's shadow was near his
feet, like a garment hanging from the arm, in the air
quivering from heat appeared the face of the corpse, and
looking at Antea with glassy eyes it moved away gradually,
as if to say, "Follow me!"</p>

<p>Sometimes it seemed to Antea that the lips of the
corpse moved slowly; sometimes that black disgusting
beetles came out from between them and flew through
the air toward her. At the very thought of that vision
her eyes were filled with terror, and at last life became
such a dreadful torture that she begged Cinna to hold a
sword for her, or to let her drink poison.</p>

<p>But he knew that he had not strength for the deed.
With that very sword he would have opened his own veins
to serve Antea, but he could not take her life. When he
imagined that dear face of hers dead, with closed eyes,
filled with icy composure, and that breast opened with his
sword, he felt that he must go mad before he could kill her.</p>

<p>A certain Greek physician told him that Hecate appeared
to Antea, and that those invisible beings whose
noise frightened the sick woman were the attendants of
the ominous divinity. According to him, there was no
salvation for Antea, for whoso has seen Hecate must die.</p>

<p>Then Cinna, who not long before would have laughed
at faith in Hecate, sacrificed a hecatomb to her. But the
sacrifice was useless, and next day the gloomy eyes were
gazing at Antea about midday.</p>

<p>Attendants covered her head; but she saw the face
even through the thickest covering. Then they confined
her in a dark room; the face looked at her from the
walls, illuminating the darkness with its pale gleam of
a corpse.
<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
</p>

<p>Every evening the sick woman grew better, and fell
into such a deep sleep that to Cinna and Timon it seemed
more than once as though she would not wake again.
Soon she grew so weak that she could not walk without
assistance. She was borne about in a litter.</p>

<p>Cinna's former disquiet returned with a hundredfold
greater force and took complete possession of him.
He was terrified regarding the life of Antea; but there
was also a wonderful feeling that her sickness was in
some way mysteriously connected with that of which
he had spoken in his first conversation with Timon.
Perhaps the old sage had the same thought; but Cinna
would not ask him, and feared to talk concerning this
matter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sick woman withered like a flower in
whose cup a poisonous spider has settled.</p>

<p>But the despairing Cinna strove against hope to save
her. First he took her to the desert near Memphis; but
when a stay in the quiet of the pyramids gave no respite
from the dreadful visions, he returned to Alexandria and
surrounded her with soothsayers, who professed to enchant
away diseases. He brought in from every kind of
shameless rabble people who exploited the credulity of
mankind by marvellous medicines. But he had no choice
left, and snatched at every method.</p>

<p>At this time there came from C&aelig;sarea a renowned
physician, a Hebrew, Joseph, son of Khuza. Cinna
brought him at once to his wife, and for a time hope returned
to his heart. Joseph, who had no faith in Greek
and Roman gods, rejected contemptuously the opinion
about Hecate. He supposed it more likely that demons
had entered the sick woman, and advised Cinna to leave
Egypt, where, in addition to demons, marshy effluvia of
the Delta might injure Antea. He advised also, perhaps
<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
because he was a Hebrew, to go to Jerusalem,&mdash;a place
where demons have no entrance, and where the air is dry
and wholesome.</p>

<p>Cinna followed this advice the more willingly,&mdash;first,
because there was no other, and second, because Jerusalem
was governed by an acquaintance of his, a procurator
whose ancestors were formerly clients of the house of
Cinna.</p>

<p>In fact, when they came, the procurator, Pontius, received
them with open arms and gave them as dwelling
his own summer residence, which stood near the walls
of the city. But Cinna's hope was swept away before
his arrival. The corpse-like face looked at Antea even
on the deck of the galley; on coming to the city the
sick woman waited for midday with the same deathly
terror as on a time in Alexandria.</p>

<p>And so their days began to pass in oppression, despair,
and fear of death.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">IN the atrium, in spite of the fountain, the shady portico,
and the early hour, it was extremely hot, for the
marble was heated by the spring sun; but at a distance
from the house there grew an old, branching pistachio-tree,
which shaded a considerable area round about. As
the place was open, the breeze there was far greater than
elsewhere; hence Cinna commanded to carry to that spot
the litter, decked with hyacinths and apple-blossoms, in
which Antea was resting. Then sitting near her, he
placed his palm on her hands, which were as pale as alabaster,
and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it pleasant for thee here, carissima?"
<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
</p>

<p>"Pleasant," answered she, in a scarcely audible voice.</p>

<p>And she closed her eyes, as if sleep had seized her.
Silence followed. Only the breeze moved with a rustling
the branches of the pistachio-tree; and on the earth
around the litter were quivering golden spots, formed of
sun-rays, which broke through between the leaves; locusts
were hissing among the rocks.</p>

<p>The sick woman opened her eyes after a moment.</p>

<p>"Caius," said she, "is it true that in this country a
philosopher has appeared, who cures the sick?"</p>

<p>"They call such men prophets here," answered Cinna.
"I have heard of him, and I wished to bring him to
thee, but it turned out that he was a false miracle-worker.
Besides, he blasphemed against the sanctuary and the
religion of this country; hence the procurator has delivered
him to death, and this very day he is to be crucified."</p>

<p>Antea dropped her head.</p>

<p>"Time will cure thee," said Cinna, seeing the sadness
reflected on her face.</p>

<p>"Time is at the service of death, not of life," answered
she, slowly.</p>

<p>And again silence ensued; round about the golden
spots quivered continually; the locusts hissed still more
loudly, and from the crannies of the cliff little lizards
crept out onto stones, and sought sunny places.</p>

<p>Cinna looked from moment to moment at Antea, and
for the thousandth time despairing thoughts flew through
his head. He felt that all means of salvation had been
spent, that there was no ray of hope, that soon the dear
form before him would become a vanishing shadow and
a handful of dust in a columbarium.</p>

<p>Even now while lying with closed eyes in the litter
decked with flowers, she seemed dead.</p>

<p>"I will follow thee!" said Cinna, in his soul.
<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
</p>

<p>Meanwhile steps were heard in the distance. Immediately
Antea's face became white as chalk; from between
her half-open lips came hurried breathing; her bosom
heaved quickly. The ill-fated martyr felt sure that the
crowd of invisible beings which preceded the corpse with
glassy eyes were drawing near. Cinna seized her hands
and strove to pacify her.</p>

<p>"Fear not, Antea; I hear those steps too. That is
Pontius, who is coming to visit us," added he, after a
while. In fact, the procurator, attended by two slaves,
appeared at the turn of the path. He was a man no
longer young; he had an oval face carefully shaven, full
of assumed dignity, and also of suffering and care.</p>

<p>"A greeting to thee, noble Cinna, and to thee, divine
Antea!" said he, as he came under the shade of the
pistachio-tree. "After a cold night the day has grown
hot. May it favor you both, and may the health of
Antea bloom like those hyacinths and those apple-tree
twigs, which adorn her litter."</p>

<p>"Peace be with thee, and be greeted!" answered Cinna.</p>

<p>The procurator seated himself on a piece of rock,
looked at Antea, frowned imperceptibly, and answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Loneliness produces sadness and sickness; but in the
midst of crowds there is no place for fear, hence I will
give one advice to thee. Unfortunately this is neither
Antioch nor C&aelig;sarea; there are no games here, no horse-races;
and were we to erect a circus, those madmen would
tear it down the next day. Here thou wilt hear nothing
but this phrase, 'the law,' and everything disturbs that
law. I would rather be in Scythia."</p>

<p>"Of what dost thou wish to speak, O Pilate?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have wandered from my subject; but cares
are the cause of this. I have said that among crowds
there is no room for fear. Now ye can have a spectacle
<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
to-day. In Jerusalem, ye should be amused with something;
above all, Antea should be in the midst of crowds
at midday. Three men will die on the cross to-day;
that is better than nothing! Because of the Pasch a
mob of the strangest ruffians has come from out all this
land to the city. Ye can look at those people. I will
command to give you a place apart near the crosses. I
hope that the condemned will die bravely. One of them
is a marvellous person: he calls himself the Son of God;
he is as mild as a dove, and has really done nothing to
merit death."</p>

<p>"And didst thou condemn him to the cross?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to rid myself of trouble, and also avoid stirring
up that nest of hornets that buzz around the temple;
even as it is, they send complaints to Rome against me.
Besides, the accused is not a Roman citizen."</p>

<p>"The man will not suffer less for that reason."</p>

<p>The procurator made no answer, but after a while he
began to speak, as if to himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is one thing that I do not like,&mdash;exaggeration.
Whoever uses that word before me takes away my cheerfulness
for the day. The golden mean! that is what
wisdom commands us to follow, as I think. And there
is not a corner of the world in which that principle is
less respected than here. How all this tortures me!
how it tortures me! In nothing is there repose, in
nothing balance,&mdash;neither in men nor in nature. At
present, for example, it is spring; the nights are cold;
but during the day there is such heat that it is difficult to
walk on stones. It is long yet till midday, and see what
is happening! Of the people&mdash;better not speak! I am
here, because I must be here. Never mind that! I might
leave my subject a second time. Go to witness the crucifixion.
I am convinced that that Nazarene will die
<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
valiantly. I gave command to flog him, thinking in that
way to save him from death. I am not cruel. When
he was lashed he was as patient as a lamb, and he blessed
the people. When he was covered with blood, he raised
his eyes and prayed. That is the most marvellous person
that I have seen in my life. My wife has not given me
a moment of peace because of him. 'Permit not the
death of that innocent man!' this is what she has been
dinning into my ears since daybreak. I wanted to save
him. Twice I went to the bema and spoke to those
priests and that mangy rabble. They answered in one
voice, raising their heads and opening their jaws to the
ears, 'Crucify him!'"</p>

<p>"Didst thou yield to them?" asked Cinna.</p>

<p>"I did, for in the city there would be mobs, and I am
here to keep peace. I must do my duty. I dislike exaggeration,
and, besides, I am mortally wearied; but when
I undertake a thing, I do not hesitate to sacrifice the life
of one man for the general welfare, especially when he
is an unknown person whom no one will mention. All
the worse for him that he is not a Roman."</p>

<p>"The sun shines not on Rome alone," whispered Antea.</p>

<p>"Divine Antea," answered the procurator, "I might
answer that on the whole round of the earth the sun shines
on Roman rule; therefore for the good of that rule it is
proper to sacrifice everything, and disturbances undermine
our authority. But, above all, I beg of thee not to
ask me to change the sentence. Cinna will tell thee
that that cannot be, and that, once sentence is pronounced,
C&aelig;sar alone can change it. Though I wished, I have
not the power to change. Is that not the case, Caius?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>But those words caused Antea evident pain, for she
said, thinking of herself, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then it is possible to suffer and die without being
guilty."</p>

<p>"No one is without guilt," answered Pontius. "This
Nazarene has committed no crime; hence I, as procurator,
washed my hands. But as a man, I condemn his
teaching. I conversed with him purposely rather long,
wishing to test the man, and convinced myself that he
announces monstrous things. The case is difficult! The
world must stand on sound sense. Who denies that
virtue is needed? Certainly not I. But even the
Stoics only teach men to endure opposition with calmness;
they do not insist that we should renounce everything,
from our property to our dinner. Answer, Cinna,&mdash;thou
art a man of sound judgment,&mdash;what wouldst
thou think of me were I, neither from one cause nor
another, to bestow this house in which thou art dwelling
on those tattered fellows who warm themselves in the
sun at the Joppa gate? And he insists on just such
things. Besides, he says that we should love all equally:
the Jews as well as the Romans themselves, the Romans
as the Egyptians, the Egyptians as the Africans, and so
on. I confess that I have had enough of this. At the
moment when his life is in peril, he bears himself as if
the question were of some one else; he teaches&mdash;and
prays. It is not my duty to save a man who has no care
for his own safety. Whoso does not know how to preserve
measure in anything is not a man of judgment.
Moreover, he calls himself the Son of God, and disturbs
the foundations on which society rests, and therefore
harms people. Let him think what he likes in his soul,
if he will not raise disturbance. As a man, I protest
against his teaching. If I do not believe in the gods, let
us concede that it is my affair. Still I recognize the
use of religion, and I declare so publicly, for I judge
<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
that religion is a curb on people. Horses must be harnessed,
and harnessed securely. Finally, death should
not be terrible to that Nazarene, for he declares that he
will rise from the dead."</p>

<p>Cinna and Antea looked at each other with amazement.</p>

<p>"That he will rise from the dead?"</p>

<p>"Neither more nor less; after three days. So at least
his disciples declare. I forgot to ask him myself. For
that matter, it is all one, since death liberates a man from
promises. And even should he not rise from the dead, he
will lose nothing, since, according to his teaching, genuine
happiness and eternal life begin only after death. He
speaks of this, indeed, as a man perfectly certain. In his
Hades it is brighter than in the world under the sun, and
whoso suffers more in this world will enter that with
greater certainty; he must only love, and love, and love."</p>

<p>"A wonderful doctrine," said Antea.</p>

<p>"And these people here cry to thee, 'Crucify him!'?"
inquired Cinna.</p>

<p>"And I do not even wonder at this, for hatred is the
soul of this people, for what, if not hatred, can demand
that love be crucified?"</p>

<p>Antea rubbed her forehead with her emaciated hand.</p>

<p>"And is he certain that it is possible to live and be
happy after death?"</p>

<p>"That is why neither the cross nor death terrify him."</p>

<p>"How good that would be, Caius!</p>

<p>"How does he know this?" inquired she, after a while.</p>

<p>The procurator waved his hand: "He says that he
knows it from the Father of all, who for the Jews is the
same as Jove for us, with this difference, that, according to
the Nazarene, the Father alone is one and merciful."</p>

<p>"How good that would be, Caius!" repeated the sick
woman.
<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
</p>

<p>Cinna opened his lips as if to make some answer, but
remained silent; and the conversation stopped. Evidently
Pontius was continuing to think of the strange
doctrine of the Nazarene, for he shook his head and
shrugged his shoulders repeatedly. At last he rose and
began to take leave.</p>

<p>All at once Antea said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Caius, let us go to look at that Nazarene."</p>

<p>"Hasten," said Pilate, as he was going away; "the procession
will move soon."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE day, hot and bright from early morning, was
obscured about midday. From the northeast
clouds were rolling up, either dark or copper-colored, not
over large, but dense, as if pregnant with a tempest. Between
them the deep blue of the sky was still visible, but
it was easy to foresee that they would soon pack together
and conceal the whole round of the sky. Meanwhile the
sun covered the edges of them with fire and gold. Over
the city itself and the adjacent hills there extended yet a
broad space of clear blue, and in the valley there was no
breath of wind.</p>

<p>On the lofty platform of ground called Golgotha stood
here and there small groups of people who had preceded
the procession which was to move from the city. The
sun illuminated broad, stony spaces, which were empty,
gloomy, and barren; their monotonous pearl-color was interrupted
only by the black net of ravines and gullies,
the blacker because the platform itself was covered with
light. In the distance were visible more elevated eminences,
equally empty, veiled by the blue haze of distance.
<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
</p>

<p>Lower down, between the walls of the city and the platform
of Golgotha, lay a plain bordered in places with cliffs
less naked. From crannies in which had collected some
little fertile earth, fig-trees peeped forth with few and
scant leaves. Here and there rose flat-roofed buildings
fixed to the cliff-side, like swallows' nests to stone walls,
or shining from afar in the sun-rays were sepulchres,
painted white. At present, because of the approaching
holidays and the concourse of provincials in the capital,
multitudes of huts and tents had been raised near the city
walls; these formed whole encampments filled with men
and camels.</p>

<p>The sun rose ever higher on that espanse of heaven
which was still free from clouds. The hours were approaching
in which usually deep silence reigned on those
heights, for every living creature sought refuge inside the
walls or within the ravines. And even at this time, in
spite of uncommon animation, there was a certain sadness
in that neighborhood in which the dazzling light fell not
on green, but on gray stone espanses. The noise of distant
voices, coming from the direction of the walls, was
changed into the sound of waves, as it were, and seemed
to be swallowed by the silence.</p>

<p>The single groups of people waiting on Golgotha since
morning turned their faces toward the city, whence the
procession might move at any moment. Antea's litter
arrived; a few soldiers, sent by the procurator, preceded it.
These were to open a way through the multitude, and in
case of need restrain from deeds of disrespect the fanatical
throng, and those who hated foreigners. At the side of
the litter walked Cinna, in company with the centurion
Rufilus.</p>

<p>Antea was calmer, less frightened than usual at the
approach of midday, and with it the terror of dreadful
<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
visions, which had drawn the life out of her. What the
procurator had said touching the young Nazarene, had
attracted her mind and turned attention from her own
misery. For her there was in this something wonderful
which she could hardly understand. The world of that
time had seen many persons die as calmly as a funeral
pile quenches when the fuel in it is consumed. But that
was a calmness coming from bravery, or from a philosophic
agreement with the implacable necessity of exchanging
light for darkness, real life for an existence misty, vanishing,
and indefinite. No one up to that time had blessed
death; no one had died with unshaken certainty that
only after the funeral pyre or the grave would real life
begin,&mdash;life as mighty and endless as only a being all-powerful
and eternal can give.</p>

<p>And he whom they had appointed for crucifixion
declared this as an undoubted truth. This teaching not
only struck Antea, but seemed to her the only source of
consolation. She knew that she must die, and immense
regret seized her. For what did death mean for her? It
meant to lose Cinna, to lose her father, to lose the world,
to lose love, for a cold, empty gloom, which was half
nothing. Hence the more desirable it was for her in life,
the greater must be her sorrow. If death could be good
for anything, or if it were possible to take with her even
the remembrance of love, or the memory of happiness,
she would be able to gain resignation the more quickly.</p>

<p>Then, while she expected nothing from death, she heard
all at once that it could give everything. And who had
made that announcement? A certain wonderful man, a
teacher, a prophet, a philosopher, who enjoined love as the
highest virtue, who blessed people when they were lashing
him; and this man they had condemned to the cross.
Hence Antea thought: "Why did he teach thus if the
<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
cross was his only reward? Others desired power; he
did not desire it. Others desired wealth; he remained
poor. Others desired palaces, feasts, excesses, purple
robes, and chariots inlaid with mother-of-pearl and ivory;
he lived like a shepherd. Meanwhile he enjoined love,
compassion, poverty; therefore he could not be malicious
and deceive people purposely. If he spoke the truth,
let death be blessed as the end of earthly misery, as the
change from a lower to a loftier happiness, as light for
eyes that are quenching, as wings with which one flies
away into endless bliss!"</p>

<p>Antea understood then what the promise of resurrection
signified. The mind and heart of the poor sick
woman cleaved with all their strength to that teaching.
She recalled also the words of her father, who had repeated
more than once that some new truth might bring the
tortured soul of man out of darkness and imprisonment.
And here was the new truth! It had conquered death;
hence it had brought salvation. Antea sank with her
whole being in those thoughts; so that for many and
many a day Cinna for the first time failed to find terror
in her face at the approach of midday.</p>

<p>The procession moved at last from the city toward
Golgotha. From the height where Antea was sitting, it
could be seen perfectly. The crowd, though considerable,
seemed lost on those stony espanses. Through the open
gate of Jerusalem flowed more and more people, and on
the way they were joined by those who had been waiting
outside the walls. They went at first in a long line,
which, as it moved forward, spread like a swollen river.
At both sides were running swarms of children.</p>

<p>The procession was made varied and many-colored by
the white tunics and the scarlet and blue kerchiefs of
women. In the centre were glittering the arms and spears
<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
of Roman soldiers, on which the sun cast fleeting rays, as
it were. The uproar of mingled voices came from afar
and rose with increasing distinctness.</p>

<p>At last the multitude came quite near; the first ranks
began to ascend the height. The throng of people hurried
on so as to occupy the nearest places and see the torment
more clearly; because of this the division of soldiers, conducting
the condemned, fell more and more toward the
rear. Children arrived first, mainly boys, half naked,
with cloths fastened around their hips, with shaven heads,
except two tufts of hair near the temple, embrowned, with
eyes almost blue, and harsh voices. In the wild uproar
they fell to pulling out of the crannies bits of stone broken
from the cliffs; these they wished to throw at those who
were to be crucified. Right after them the height swarmed
with a nondescript rabble. Their faces were for the
greater part excited by the movement and by the hope
of a spectacle. On no face was there a sign of compassion.
The noise of rasping voices, the endless number of
words thrown out by each mouth, the suddenness of their
movements, astonished Antea, though accustomed in
Alexandria to the word-loving liveliness of Greeks. Before
her, people spoke as if they wished to hurl themselves
at one another. They screamed as if escaping
death; they resisted as if some one were flaying them.</p>

<p>The centurion Rufilus, approaching the litter, gave
explanations in a calm, official voice. Meanwhile new
waves flowed up from the city. The throng increased
every moment. In the crowd were seen wealthy men of
Jerusalem, dressed in girded tunics, holding themselves
aloof from the wretched rabble of the suburbs. In
numbers also came villagers which the festival had
brought to the city, with their families; field-workers,
with kindly and astonished faces, came, bearing bags at
<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
their girdles; shepherds came, dressed in goat-skins.
Crowds of women came with the men; but as wives of
the more wealthy citizens did not leave their homes
willingly, these women were chiefly of the people. They
were villagers, or women of the street; these last dressed
gaudily, had dyed hair, brows, and nails; they wore immense
ear-rings and coin necklaces, and gave out from a
distance the odor of nard.</p>

<p>The Sanhedrim arrived at last; and in the midst of
it, Annas, an aged man with the face of a vulture and
eyes with red lids; then appeared the unwieldy Caiaphas,
wearing a two-horned hat, with a gilded tablet on his
breast. With these walked various Pharisees; as, for
instance, those who "drag their legs" and strike every
obstacle purposely with their feet; Pharisees with
"bloody foreheads," who beat those foreheads against the
wall, also by design; and Pharisees "bent over," as if to
receive the burden of the sins of the whole city on their
shoulders. Gloomy importance and cold vindictiveness
distinguished them from the noisy rabble.</p>

<p>Cinna looked at this throng of people with the cool,
contemptuous visage of a man of the ruling race, Antea
with astonishment and fear. Many Jews inhabited Alexandria,
but there they were half Hellenized; here for the
first time she saw Jews as the procurator had described
them, and as they were in their own native nest. Her
youthful face, on which death had imprinted its stamp,
her form, resembling a shadow, attracted general attention.
They stared at her with insolence in so far as the
soldiers surrounding her litter permitted them; and so
great among them was contempt for foreigners that no
compassion was evident in the eyes of any; rather did
gladness shine in them because the victim would not
escape death. Then the daughter of Timon understood
<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
for the first time, and precisely, why those people demanded
a cross for the prophet who had proclaimed love.</p>

<p>And all at once that Nazarene appeared to Antea as
some one so near that he was almost dear to her. He had
to die, and so had she. Nothing could save him now,
after the issuing of the sentence, and sentence had fallen
also on her; hence it seemed to Antea that the brotherhood
of misfortune and death had united them. But he
approached the cross with faith in a morrow after death.
She had not that faith yet, and had come to obtain it
from the sight of him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile from afar was heard an uproar, a whistling,
a howling, then all was silent. Next came clatter of weapons
and the heavy tread of legionaries. The crowds
swayed, opened, and the division conducting the condemned
began to push past the litter. In front, at
both sides, and behind, advanced soldiers with slow and
measured tread. Next were three arms of crosses, which
seemed to move of themselves; they were borne by persons
bent under the weight of them. It was easy to
divine that the Nazarene was not among those three, for
two had the insolent faces of thieves. The third was a
simple countryman, no longer young; clearly the soldiers
had impressed him to do work for another.</p>

<p>The Nazarene walked behind the crosses; two soldiers
marched near him. He wore a purple mantle thrown
over his garments, and a crown of thorns, from under the
points of which drops of blood issued; of these some
flowed slowly along his face, others had grown stiff under
the crown, in the form of berries of the wild rose, or
coral beads. He was pale, and moved forward with slow,
unsteady, and weakened step. He advanced amid insults
from the multitude, sunk, as it were, in the meditation
of another world; he was as if seized away from the earth
<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
altogether, as if not caring for the cries of hatred, or as
if forgiving beyond the measure of human forgiveness
and compassionate beyond the measure of human compassion,
for, embraced now by infinity, raised above human
estimate, he was exceedingly mild, and was sorrowful
only through his measureless sorrow for all men.</p>

<p>"Thou art Truth," whispered Antea, with trembling lips.</p>

<p>The retinue was passing just near the litter. It halted
for a moment while soldiers in front were clearing the
road of the throng; Antea saw then the Nazarene a few
steps away. She saw the breeze move his hair; she saw
the ruddy reflection from his mantle on his pallid and
almost transparent face. The mob, rushing toward him,
surrounded with a dense half-circle the soldiers, who had
to resist with spears, to save him from their rage. Everywhere
were visible outstretched arms with clinched fists,
eyes bursting through their lids, gleaming teeth, beards
thrown apart from mad movements, and foaming lips
through which came hoarse shouts. But he looked around,
as if wishing to ask, "What have I done to you?" then he
raised his eyes to heaven and prayed&mdash;and forgave.</p>

<p>"Antea! Antea!" cried Cinna at that moment.</p>

<p>But Antea seemed not to hear his cries. Great tears
were falling from her eyes; she forgot her sickness,
forgot that for many days she had not risen from the
litter; and sitting up on a sudden, trembling, half
conscious, from pity, compassion, and indignation at
the mad shrieks of the multitude, she took hyacinths
with apple blossoms and cast them before the feet of
the Nazarene.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence. Amazement seized
the crowd at sight of this noble Roman lady giving honor
to the condemned. He turned his eyes to her poor sick
face, and his lips began to move, as if blessing her.
<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
Antea fell again on the pillow of the litter; she felt that
a sea of light, of goodness, of grace, of consolation, of
hope, of happiness, was falling on her.</p>

<p>"Thou art Truth," whispered she, a second time.</p>

<p>Then a new wave of tears came to her eyes.</p>

<p>But they pushed him forward to a place a few tens of
steps distant from the litter; on that place stood already
the uprights of crosses, fixed in a cleft of the rocky platform.
The crowd concealed him again; but, since that
place was elevated considerably, Antea soon saw his
pale face and the crown of thorns. The legionaries turned
once more toward the rabble, which they clubbed away,
lest it might interrupt the execution. They began then
to fasten the two thieves to the side crosses. The third
cross stood in the middle; to the top of it was fastened,
with a nail, a white card which the growing wind
pulled and raised. When soldiers, approaching the
Nazarene at last, began to undress him, shouts rose in
the crowds: "King! king! do not yield! King, where are
thy legions? Defend thyself!" At moments laughter
burst forth,&mdash;laughter that bore away the multitude till
on a sudden the whole stony height resounded with one
roar. Then they stretched him face upward on the
ground, to nail his hands to the arms of the cross, and
raise him afterward with it to the main pillar.</p>

<p>Thereupon some man, in a white tunic, standing not
far from the litter, cast himself on the earth suddenly,
gathered dust and bits of stone on his head, and cried
in a shrill, despairing voice, "I was a leper, and he
cured me; why do ye crucify him?"</p>

<p>Antea's face became white as a kerchief.</p>

<p>"He cured that man; dost hear, Caius?" said she.</p>

<p>"Dost wish to return?" asked Cinna.</p>

<p>"No! I will remain here!"
<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
</p>

<p>But a wild and boundless despair seized Cinna because
he had not called the Nazarene to his house to cure Antea.</p>

<p>At that moment the soldiers, placing nails at his hands,
began to strike. The dull clink of iron against iron was
heard; this soon changed into a sound which went
farther, for the points of the nails, having passed through
flesh, entered the wood. The crowds were silent again,
perhaps to enjoy cries which torture might bring from
the mouth of the Nazarene. But he remained silent, and
on the height was heard only the ominous and dreadful
sound of the hammers.</p>

<p>At last they had finished the work, and the crosspiece
was drawn up, with the body. The centurion in charge
pronounced, or rather sang out monotonously, words of
command, in virtue of which a soldier began to nail the
feet.</p>

<p>At this moment those clouds, which since morning had
been extending on the horizon, hid the sun. The distant
hills and cliffs, which had been gleaming in brightness,
gleamed no longer. The light turned to darkness. An
ominous bronze-colored gloom seized the region about,
and, as the sun sank more deeply behind piles of clouds,
the gloom became denser. Men might have thought
that some being from above was sifting down to the
earth lurid darkness. The air now grew sultry.</p>

<p>All at once even those remnants of lurid gleams became
black. Clouds, dark as night, rolled and pushed
forward, like a gigantic wave, toward the height and the
city. A tempest was coming! The world was filled with
fear.</p>

<p>"Let us return!" said Cinna again.</p>

<p>"Once more, once more, I wish to see him," answered
Antea.</p>

<p>Darkness had concealed the hanging bodies. Cinna
<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
gave command to carry the litter nearer the place of
torment. They carried it so near that barely a few steps
were between them and the cross. On the dark tree
they saw the body of the Crucified, who in that general
eclipse seemed made of silver rays of the moon. His
breast rose with quick breathing. His face and eyes were
turned upward yet.</p>

<p>Then from the rolls of clouds was heard a deep rumbling.
Thunder was roused; it rose and rolled with tremendous
report from the east to the west, and then
falling, as if into a bottomless abyss, was heard farther
and farther down, now dying away, and now increasing;
at last it roared till the earth shook in its foundations.</p>

<p>A gigantic blue lightning-flash rent the clouds, lighted
the sky, the earth, the crosses, the arms of the soldiers,
and the mob huddled together, like a flock of sheep, filled
with distress and terror.</p>

<p>After the lightning came deeper darkness. Close to
the litter was heard the sobbing of women, who also
drew near the cross. There was something ominous in
this sobbing amid silence. Those who were lost in the
multitude began now to cry out. Here and there were
heard terrified voices,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Yah! oj lanu! [woe to us]! O Yah! Have they
not crucified the Just One?"</p>

<p>"Who gave true testimony! O Yah!"</p>

<p>"Who raised the dead!"</p>

<p>And another voice called,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Woe to thee, Jerusalem!"</p>

<p>Still another,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The earth trembles!"</p>

<p>A new lightning-flash disclosed the depths of the sky
and in them gigantic figures of fire, as it were. The
voices were silent, or rather were lost in the whistling of
<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
the whirlwind, which sprang up all at once with tremendous
force; it swept off a multitude of mantles and
kerchiefs, and hurled them away over the height.</p>

<p>Voices cried out anew,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The earth trembles!"</p>

<p>Some began to flee. Terror nailed others to the spot;
and they stood fixed in amazement, without thought, with
this dull impression only,&mdash;that something awful was
happening.</p>

<p>But, on a sudden, the gloom began to be less dense.
Wind rolled the clouds over, twisted and tore them like
rotten rags; brightness increased gradually. At last the
dark ceiling was rent, and through the opening rushed in
all at once a torrent of sunlight; presently the heights
became visible and with them the crosses and the terrified
faces of the people.</p>

<p>The head of the Nazarene had fallen low on his breast;
it was as pale as wax; his eyes were closed, his lips blue.</p>

<p>"He is dead," whispered Antea.</p>

<p>"He is dead," repeated Cinna.</p>

<p>At this moment a centurion thrust his spear into the
side of the dead. A wonderful thing: the return of light
and the sight of that death seemed to appease that crowd.
They pushed nearer and nearer, especially since the soldiers
did not bar approach. Among the throng were
heard voices,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come down from the cross! Come down from the
cross!"</p>

<p>Antea cast her eyes once more on that low-hanging
head, then she said, as if to herself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will he rise from the dead?"</p>

<p>In view of death, which had put blue spots on his eyes
and mouth, in view of those arms stretched beyond
measure, and in view of that motionless body which had
<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
settled down with the weight of dead things, her voice
trembled with despairing doubt.</p>

<p>Not less was the disappointment rending Cinna's soul.
He also believed not that the Nazarene would rise from
the dead; but he believed that had he lived, he alone,
with his power, good or evil, might have given health to
Antea. Meanwhile more numerous voices were calling:</p>

<p>"Come down from the cross! Come down from the
cross!"</p>

<p>"Come down!" repeated Cinna, with despair. "Cure
her for me; take my life!"</p>

<p>The air became purer and purer. The mountains were
still in mist, but above the height and the city the sky
had cleared perfectly. "Turris Antonia" glittered in sunlight
as bright itself as the sun. The air had become
fresh, and was full of swallows. Cinna gave command
to return.</p>

<p>It was an afternoon hour. Near the house Antea said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hecate has not come to-day."</p>

<p>Cinna also was thinking of that.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE vision did not appear the next day. The sick
woman was unusually animated, for Timon had
come from C&aelig;sarea. Alarmed for the life of his daughter
and frightened by Cinna's letters, he had left Alexandria
a few days earlier to look once again on his only child before
her parting. At Cinna's heart hope began to knock
again, as if to give notice to receive it. But he had not
courage to open the door to that guest; he did not dare to
harbor hope.
<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
</p>

<p>In the visions which had been killing Antea, there had
been intervals, it is true, not of two days, but of one
in Alexandria, and in the desert. The present relief
Cinna attributed to Timon's arrival, and her impressions
at the cross, which so filled the sick woman's soul that
she could talk of nothing else, even with her father.</p>

<p>Timon listened with attention; he did not contradict;
he meditated and merely inquired carefully about the
doctrine of the Nazarene, of which Antea knew, for that
matter, only what the procurator had told her.</p>

<p>In general she felt healthier and somewhat stronger;
and when midday had passed and gone, real solace shone
in her eyes. She repeated that that was a favorable day,
and begged her husband to make note of it.</p>

<p>The day was really sad and gloomy. Rain had begun
in the early morning, at first very heavy, then fine and
cutting, from low clouds which extended monotonously.
Only in the evening did the sky break through, and the
great fiery globe of the sun look out of the mists, paint in
purple and gold the gray rocks, the white marble porticoes
of the villas, and descend with endless gleams toward
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The next morning was wonderfully beautiful. The
weather promised to be warm, but the morning was fresh,
the sky without a spot, and the earth so sunk in a blue
bath that all objects seemed blue. Antea had given directions
to bear her out and place her under the favorite
pistachio-tree, so that from the elevation on which the
tree stood she might delight herself with the view of the
blue and gladsome distance.</p>

<p>Cinna and Timon did not move a step from the litter,
and watched the face of the sick woman carefully. There
was in it a certain alarm of expectation, but it was not
that mortal fear which used to seize her at the approach
<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
of midday. Her eyes cast a more lively light, and her
cheeks bloomed with a slight flush. Cinna thought
indeed at moments that Antea might recover; and at this
thought he wanted to throw himself on the ground, to
sob from delight, and bless the gods. Then again he
feared that that was perhaps the last gleam of the dying
lamp. Wishing to gain hope from some source, he
glanced every little while at Timon; but similar thoughts
must have been passing through his head, for he avoided
Cinna's glances. None of the three mentioned by
a word that midday was near. But Cinna, casting his
eyes every moment at the shadows, saw with beating
heart that they were growing shorter and shorter.</p>

<p>And he sat as if sunk in thought. Perhaps the least
alarmed was Antea herself. Lying in the open litter, her
head rested on a purple pillow; she breathed with delight
that pure air which the breeze brought from the west, from
the distant sea. But before midday the breeze had ceased
to blow. The heat increased; warmed by the sun, the
pepperwort of the cliffs and the thickets of nard began
to give out a strong and intoxicating odor. Bright butterflies
balanced themselves over bunches of anemones.
From the crevices of the rocks little lizards, already accustomed
to that litter and those people, sprang out, one after
the other, confident as usual, and also cautious in every
movement. The whole world was enjoying that serene
peace, that warmth, that calm sweetness and azure drowsiness.</p>

<p>Timon and Cinna seemed also to dissolve in that sunny
rest. The sick woman closed her eyes as if a light sleep
had seized her; and nothing interrupted that silence
except sighs, which from time to time raised her breast.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cinna noticed that his shadow had lost its
lengthened form and was lying there under his feet.
<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
</p>

<p>It was midday.</p>

<p>All at once Antea opened her eyes and called out in a
kind of strange voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Caius, give me thy hand."</p>

<p>He sprang up, and all the blood was stiffened to ice in
his heart. The hour of terrible visions had come.</p>

<p>Her eyes opened wider and wider.</p>

<p>"Dost thou see," said she, "how light collects there and
binds the air; how it trembles, glitters, and approaches
me?"</p>

<p>"Antea, look not in that direction!" cried Cinna.</p>

<p>But, oh, wonder! there was no fear on her face. Her
lips were parted; her eyes were gazing, and opening wider
and wider; a certain immeasurable delight began to
brighten her face.</p>

<p>"The pillar of light approaches me," said she. "See!
that is he; that is the Nazarene!&mdash;he is smiling. O
Mild! O Merciful! The transfixed hands he stretches
out like a mother to me. Caius, he brings me health, salvation,
and calls me to himself."</p>

<p>Cinna grew very pale, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whithersoever he calls us, let us follow him."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A moment later, on the other side, on the stony path
leading to the city, appeared Pontius Pilate. Before he
had come near, it was evident from his face that he was
bringing news, which, as a man of judgment, he considered
a fresh, absurd invention of the ignorant and credulous
rabble. In fact, while still at some distance, he
began to call, wiping perspiration from his brow,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Imagine to thyself, they declare that he has risen from
the dead!"</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<h2>BE THOU BLESSED.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">ONCE on a bright moonlight night the wise and
mighty Krishna fell into deep meditation, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thought man the most beautiful creation on earth;
but I was mistaken. Here I see the lotus, rocked by the
night breeze. Oh, how much more beautiful it is than
any living being; its leaves have just opened to the
silver light of the moon, and I cannot wrest my eyes
from it!</p>

<p>"Among men there is nothing to compare with it," repeated
he, sighing.</p>

<p>But after a while he thought,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why should I, a god, not create, by the power of my
word, a being who would be among men what the lotus
is among flowers? Let it be then to the delight of man
and the earth. Lotus, change thou into a living maiden
and stand before me."</p>

<p>The water trembled slightly, as if touched by the wings
of a swallow; the night grew bright; the moon shone with
more power in the sky; the night thrushes sang more
distinctly, then stopped on a sudden, and the charm was
accomplished: before Krishna stood the lotus in human
shape.</p>

<p>The god himself was astonished.</p>

<p>"Thou wert a flower of the lake," said he; "henceforth
be the flower of my thought, and speak."
<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
</p>

<p>The maiden began to whisper in a voice as low as the
sound made by the white leaves of the lotus when kissed
by a summer breeze,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lord, thou hast changed me into a living being; where
now dost thou command me to dwell? Remember, lord,
that when I was a flower I trembled and drew in my
leaves at every breath of the wind. I feared heavy rain;
I feared storms; I feared thunder and lightning; I feared
even the burning rays of the sun. Thou hast commanded
me to be the incarnation of the lotus; hence I have kept
my former nature, and now I fear the earth and all that
is on it. Where dost thou command me to dwell?"</p>

<p>Krishna raised his wise eyes to the stars, meditated a
while, and then asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dost thou wish to live on the summits of mountains?"</p>

<p>"Snow and cold are there, lord, I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Well, I will build thee a palace of crystal at the
bottom of the lake."</p>

<p>"In the depths of the waters move serpents and other
monsters; I am afraid, lord."</p>

<p>"Dost thou prefer the boundless steppes?"</p>

<p>"Whirlwinds and tempests rush over the steppes like
wild herds."</p>

<p>"What is to be done with thee, incarnate flower? Ha!
In the caves of Ellora live holy hermits. Wilt thou
dwell far away from the world, in those caves?"</p>

<p>"It is dark there, lord; I am afraid."</p>

<p>Krishna sat on a stone, and rested his head on his
hand. The maiden stood before him, trembling and
timid.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the dawn began to brighten the sky on the
east. The surface of the lake, the palms, and the bamboos
were gilded. At the water, rosy herons, blue storks,
in the forest, peacocks and bengalee were heard, and
<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
these were accompanied by distant sounds of strings
stretched over pearl shells, and by words of human song.
Krishna awoke from meditation and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is Valmiki, the poet, saluting the rising sun."</p>

<p>After a while the curtain of purple flowers covering
the climbing plants was pushed aside, and Valmiki appeared
at the lake.</p>

<p>When he saw the incarnate lotus the poet ceased to
play, the pearl shell fell from his grasp to the earth, his
arms dropped at his sides, and he stood dumb, as if the
mighty Krishna had made him a tree at the edge of the
water.</p>

<p>The god was delighted with this wonder at his work, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Awake, Valmiki, and speak."</p>

<p>And Valmiki said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I love!"</p>

<p>This was the only word that he remembered, and the
only word that he could utter.</p>

<p>Krishna's face was radiant at once.</p>

<p>"Wonderful maiden, I have found for thee a worthy
dwelling-place in the world: thou wilt dwell in the
heart of the poet."</p>

<p>Valmiki repeated a second time,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I love!"</p>

<p>The will of the mighty Krishna, the will of the deity,
began to urge the maiden toward the heart of the poet.
The god also made the heart of Valmiki as transparent
as crystal.</p>

<p>Calm as a summer day, quiet as the surface of the
Ganges, the maiden advanced toward the dwelling prepared
for her. But suddenly, when she looked into the
heart of Valmiki, her face grew pale, and terror surrounded
her, as a winter wind. Krishna was astonished.
<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
</p>

<p>"Incarnate flower," inquired he, "dost thou fear even
the heart of a poet?"</p>

<p>"O lord," answered the maiden, "where hast thou
commanded me to dwell? There in that one heart I see
the snowy summits of mountains, the abysses of waters,
full of marvellous creatures, the steppe with its whirlwinds
and tempests, and the caves of Ellora with their
darkness; therefore I am afraid, O lord!"</p>

<p>But the good and wise Krishna replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Calm thyself, incarnate flower. If in the heart of
Valmiki there lie lonely snows, be thou the warm breath
of spring, which will melt them; if in it there be the
abyss of waters, be thou the pearl in that abyss; if in it
there be the desert of the steppe, sow flowers of happiness
there; if in it there be the dark caves of Ellora, be
thou in that darkness the sun-ray&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Valmiki, who during that time had recovered his
speech, added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And be thou blessed!"</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<h2>AT THE SOURCE.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">I AM a student of yesterday; my diploma of doctor of
philosophy is not dry yet,&mdash;that is true. I have
neither wealth nor position. My whole fortune consists
of a rather poor little house and a few hundred rubles'
income. I can understand, therefore, why Tola's parents
refused me her hand; but they did more,&mdash;they insulted
me.</p>

<p>But why? What have I done? I brought them, as if
on the palm of my hand, a very honest heart, and I said:
"Give her to me. I will be the best of sons, and till
death I shall not cease to repay you; her I will worship;
her I will love and protect."</p>

<p>It is true that I said this stupidly, in a strange voice,
while stammering and panting. You knew, however,
that I was dragging my soul out, that through me was
expressed a feeling the equal of which you could not
meet in this world every day; and if you had chosen to
refuse me, why not refuse like kind people, with some
slight compassion in your hearts, but you insulted me.</p>

<p>You who claim to be Christians, and claim to be idealists,
how were you to know what I might do on leaving
your house after such a refusal? Who told you that I
would not put a bullet into my head,&mdash;first, because I
could not live without her, and second, because I could
not understand the contradiction between your pretended
principles and the real practice of your life, that phariseeism,
<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
that falsehood? Why had you no mercy on me
even for a moment? It was not right to trample even me
without cause; trampling inflicts pain. Were it not for
you, I might achieve something in this world. I am
young, little more than a student, without wealth, without
position,&mdash;that may be! But I have my future; you
spat on it, but, as God lives, I know not why you did so.</p>

<p>Those icy faces! that contemptuous indignation! Two
days ago I could not imagine that those people could be
such. "We thought you a man of honor; but you have
deceived us, you have abused our confidence&mdash;" These
are the words with which they slashed me across the
face, as with a whip. A moment before they had congratulated
me on my diploma as heartily as if I had been
their son; and only when, pale from emotion, I told
them what had been the greatest spur in my efforts, their
cordiality and smiles were extinguished, their faces grew
rigid, frost breathed from them&mdash;and it turned out that
I had "abused their confidence."</p>

<p>They so crushed, dazed, trampled me that after a while
I thought myself that I had done something disgraceful,
that I had really deceived them.</p>

<p>But how? What is the position? Who is the deceiver,
who the deceived, who plays the contemptible
r&ocirc;le? Either I have gone mad altogether, or there is
nothing mean in this, that a man loves honestly and
desires to give his soul, blood, and toil to another. If
your indignation was genuine, who is the fool in this
case?</p>

<p>Ah, Panna Tola! and I was deceived in thee also,&mdash;I
who counted on thee with such confidence. "We are sure,"
said they, "that our daughter has never authorized you in
any way to take this step." Of course I did not contradict.
And then that "daughter" appeared with all the unspeakable
<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
coolness of a well-bred young lady, and stammered,
with drooping eyes, that she could not understand
even how such a thought could occur to me.</p>

<p>Dost thou not understand? Listen, Panna Tola: thou
didst not say, "I love;" I admit that. I have not thy
bond and signature, but even if I had I would not present
them. I will say this much, however: there is justice and
there is a tribunal,&mdash;all one where they are, whether
somewhere beyond the clouds, or in the human conscience;
before this tribunal thou must say: I have deceived this
man; I have denied him; I have brought him humiliation
and misfortune.</p>

<p>I know not which failed thee, heart or courage; but I
know that thou hast deceived me horribly. I love thee
still. I do not wish to malign thee; but when it is a question
of ruining or saving, there is need of courage. Love
and honesty must be greater than fear, or the timbers of
an edifice raised with great toil will fall on some one's
head. They have fallen on mine. I built my whole
future on blind faith in thy love; and the result proved
that I built on sand, for courage failed thee at the
critical moment, since having to choose between the evil
humor of thy parents and my misfortune, thou didst
choose my misfortune.</p>

<p>If in this wreck thou hadst been what I thought thee,
life would be easier for me now; I should have consolation
and hope. Dost thou know that everything which I did
for some years I did because of thee and for thy sake? I
worked like an ox; I did not rest at night; I gained certain
medals and diplomas. Through thee I lived; through
thee I breathed; of thee I thought. And now there is a
desert before me, in which grief is howling, like a dog.
Nothing remains to me. I am curious to know if thou
wilt think even once of this.
<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
</p>

<p>But beyond doubt thy sober-minded parents will explain
to their daughter that I am a student, and that
this is my stupid exaltation. As to being a student, if I
were one yet, I might answer, like Shakespeare's Shylock,
Have we not hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,
passions? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you
wrong us, shall we not revenge? It is not permissible
to wrong any man, no matter who he be. My exaltation,
stupid or not, gives no man the right to injure
me. It is well that this present society of ours, which
is like a great soulless edifice composed of stupidity,
lies, and hypocrisy, is cracking and falling, since no
one can live in it. I have some leisure now; I am a
doctor of philosophy. I will dwell as a philosopher
on various human relations, which have recoiled on me
recently with such effect. For you people of judgment,
so called, it is enough if you find a vain word, an empty
name for a thing. Let some other man break his neck
on the thing itself. Well, never mind. Exaltation!
What profit is there for me in the word, if that to which
you apply it wrings my entrails? What aid to me is your
dictionary? Meanwhile you deny the right of existence
to everything which your blunted nerves cannot feel.
When the teeth have dropped from your superannuated
jaws, you cease to believe in toothache. But rheumatism
is serious; rheumatism hurts, while love is only exaltation.
When I think of this, two men rise up in me,&mdash;one the
student of yesterday, who in the name of the present
would hammer human dulness with the back of an axe,
the other a person deeply injured, who wishes to curse
and to sob. It is impossible to live thus. We have had
enough of this idealism in words, and utilitarianism in
acts. The time is coming when men must fit their deeds
to high principles, or have courage to proclaim principles
<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
as cynical as their deeds. God alone knows how often I
have heard Tola's parents say that wealth does not constitute
happiness, that character is worth more than
wealth, that peace of conscience is the highest good.
Are those statements true? Well, if they are, I have
some character, great industry, a calm conscience; I am
young and I love. Still, they turned me out of their
house. Were I to win half a million in the lottery, they
would give me their daughter to-morrow with delight.
Her father would come to my room in the morning and
open his arms to me&mdash;as God is in heaven he would.</p>

<p>If a man wishes to be a merchant, let him know at
least how to reckon; but you, though positive, do not
know even this. That position of yours and that judgment
of yours conduct you to illusions. You do not
know how to reckon&mdash;do you hear? I do not say this
in excitement; there is no exaggeration in my words.
Love exists and is real, hence we must recognize it as an
actual value. Were a mathematician of genius to appear,
he would show you this value in money, and then
you would seize your heads and cry, "Oh, what wealth!"
Love is just as positive and tangible, just as absolute in
life as is money. The reckoning is simple: life has as
much value as the happiness contained in it. Love is an
enormous capital, an inexhaustible source of happiness,
as great as youth and health. But such simple truths as
this cannot find room in your heads. I repeat that you
know not how to reckon. A million is worth a million
and not a copper more; but you think that it is worth as
much besides as all the other good in life. Because of
this error you are wandering in a world completely artificial,
and you deceive yourselves as to values. You are
romantic, but your romanticism is paltry, since it is pecuniary,
and besides it is harmful, since it breaks and spoils
<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
the lives, not only of people who do not concern you, but
the lives of your own children also.</p>

<p>Tola would have had a pleasant life with me; she
would have been happy. That being true, what more do
you wish? Do not answer that she would have refused
me. If you had not killed in her, by your teaching, all
freedom, will, sincerity, and courage, I should not be sitting
alone now, with a head bursting from pain. No one
has looked into Tola's eyes as I have; no one knows
better what she felt and what she would have been had
you not poisoned the soul in her.</p>

<p>But now I have lost Tola, and with her much else, by
which one lives as by bread, and without which one dies.
Oh, you, my parents, and thou, my lost wife! at times I
admit that you are unconscious of what you have done,
or you would come to me now. It cannot be that you
have no compassion for me....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What use in reproaches? Right is on my side. All
that I have written is strict truth, but that truth will
not bring Tola back to me.</p>

<p>And here is the gulf; for I cannot comprehend how
justice and truth can be useless. All that I have on my
side is useless to me, absolutely useless. Still the world
must be constructed just as men's minds are; how
comes the break, then? If constructed differently, we
must continue forever in our vicious circle; I can write
no more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After a long time I turn to my pen again. Let reality
speak for itself. I narrate simply that which took place.
The explanation came only after a long series of events;
therefore I give them in the order of their happening
before I could understand the causes myself.
<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
</p>

<p>On the morning after that day of disaster Tola's father
came to me. When I saw him, I grew rigid. There was
a moment when all thoughts flew from my head, as a
flock of birds fly from a tree. I think that one must feel
something similar at the moment of death. But his face
was mild, and right on the threshold he began to speak,
stretching his hands toward me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, we have spent a bad night, have we not? I
understand that; I was young myself once."</p>

<p>I made no answer; I understood nothing; I did not
believe that I saw him before my face. Meanwhile he
shook my hands, forced me to sit down, and, seating
himself in front of me, continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Recover yourself; be calm; let us talk like honest
people. My dear sir, do you think that you are the
only person who lay awake? We have not slept either.
As soon as we recovered a little after you left us, we
felt badly enough to be beyond help. We did indeed!
When something is sprung on a man suddenly, he loses
his head and then passes the measure. We were grieved,
and, to tell the truth, ashamed. The child rushed off to
her chamber; and the old people, like old people, fell to
throwing the blame on each other. Thou art at fault,
woman! thou art at fault, man! said we to each other.
Such is human nature. But later came reflection and
regret. He is young, honorable, capable; he loves our
child with his whole heart, it seems; why in God's name
were we so stubborn? One thing will explain our feelings.
Should you ever be a father, you will understand
this, that in parents' eyes nothing is enough for their
child. Still it occurred to us that that which seemed
little to us might satisfy Tola, so we made up our minds
that it was better to inquire what the girl had in her
heart, and we called her to counsel. The third counsellor
<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
was a good one! there is no denying that. When
she fell to embracing our feet, and put her dear head
on our knees, in this way&mdash; Well, you know parents'
hearts&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he was moved himself, and for a time we sat in
silence. Everything that I heard seemed to me a dream,
a fairy tale, a miracle; my suffering began to change
into hope. Tola's father mastered his emotion, and
continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Indeed, thou hast piled mountains on us, but we are
people of good will, though quick-tempered; and, in
proof of this, I will say that if thou prefer Tola to thy
feeling of offence&mdash;come&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he opened his arms to me. I fell into them, half
conscious, half bewildered, happy. I felt that my throat
was contracting, that I was fit only to burst into sobbing.
I wanted absolutely to say something, but could not. I
had in my soul one scream of delight, astonishment, and
gratitude. All this had fallen on me at once, like a
thunderbolt; neither my head nor my heart could take
it in, and I felt pain almost from that excess of change,
that excess of thoughts and feelings. Tola's father removed
my hands gently from his shoulders, and, kissing
me on the forehead, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is well now, well! I expected this of thee after
thy attachment to her. Forget what has happened, and
compose thyself."</p>

<p>Seeing, however, that I could not regain self-control,
or master my emotion, he began to scold me good-naturedly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be a man; control thyself! Thou art trembling as in
a fever! Well, but that little boy has struck in deeply
under thy rib."</p>

<p>"Oi, deeply!" whispered I, with an effort.
<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
</p>

<p>The father smiled and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it possible? but he seemed like still water."</p>

<p>Evidently my immense love for Tola pleased his
parental pride, for he was glad, and smiling he repeated
continually,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's a tick! that's a tick!"</p>

<p>I felt then that if we remained a quarter of an hour
longer in the room something in my head would give
way. Under ordinary conditions I can command myself,
but this time the transition was too great. I needed to
breathe fresh air, to see the movement on the streets;
above all, I needed to see Tola, and convince myself that
she was really existing, that all this was not a dream,
and that they were giving her to me really.</p>

<p>I asked Tola's father then to go to his house with me;
he consented with gladness.</p>

<p>"I wished to propose that myself," said he; "for surely
some little nose there is flattening itself against a window-pane,
and eyes are looking into the street. Thou art not
in a condition now to discuss serious matters; we will do
that hereafter."</p>

<p>A few moments later we were on the street. At first
I looked at people, houses, carriages, as a man who has
come out for the first time after a long illness, and feels
dizziness of the head. Gradually, however, movement
and fresh air restored me. Above all thoughts one was
dominant: "Tola loves thee; in a moment thou wilt see
her!" I felt a throbbing in my temples as mighty as
hammer strokes, and really a good hoop was needed
round my head to contain it. An hour before I had
thought that I should never see Tola again in life, or
should see her sometime in some place the wife of
another. And now I was going to her to tell her that
she would be mine; and I was going because she had
<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
stretched out her hand first. Yesterday I called her a
senseless doll, and still she had thrown herself at the
feet of her parents, imploring for both of us. My heart
was overflowing with sorrow, repentance, tenderness, and
a feeling that I was unworthy of Tola; I swore to myself
to reward her for this, to pay with attachment and boundless
devotion for each tear of hers shed yesterday.</p>

<p>Others grew blind in love; I had no need to grow
blind, for deeds were pleading for Tola. She had wrought
this miracle. I had done her injustice. I had done her
parents injustice as well. Had they been such as I had
thought them, they would not have let themselves be
persuaded. They would not have reached that simplicity,
not merely human, but angelic, with which her
father came to me and said: "We were mistaken;
take her!" Neither society ceremonial nor vanity had
the power to restrain him from this.</p>

<p>I remembered his words: "Indeed, thou didst pile
mountains on us, but we are people of good will, though
quick-tempered." That simplicity crushed me the more,
the greater the mountains which I had piled on them
yesterday. Not a word beyond these, no lofty phrases,
a playful smile,&mdash;that was all. When I thought of this
I could not restrain myself longer; I seized his hand, and
raised it with reverence to my lips.</p>

<p>He smiled again with that kindly clear smile, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My wife and I have said this long time that our
son-in-law must love us."</p>

<p>And it happened as they wished, for before I was their
son-in-law I loved them as if I had been their own son.</p>

<p>As I was walking very fast, Tola's father began to jest;
he puffed, and pretended to be suffering, said that he
could not keep pace with me, complained of the heat.
<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
In fact, the winter had broken the day before. A warm
breeze wrinkled the water in the city garden, and in the
air there was a species of revival, a kind of spring power.
At last we were in front of the house. Something vanished
from the window and disappeared in the depth of
the room; I was not sure that it was Tola. On the steps
my heart began to throb again. I feared the mother.
When we had passed the dining-hall we found her in
the drawing-room. As I entered, she approached me
quickly and reached out her hand, which I kissed reverentially
and with gratitude, stammering meanwhile,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How have I deserved this?"</p>

<p>"Forgive us yesterday's refusal," said she. "We had
not thought of this, that Tola could find no greater attachment
in the whole world."</p>

<p>"She could not! She could not!" cried I, with ardor.</p>

<p>"And since the happiness of our child is for us beyond
everything, we give her to you, and I can only say:
God grant you both happiness!"</p>

<p>She pressed my temples then; after that she turned
toward the door and called,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tola!"</p>

<p>And my love came in, pale, with reddened eyes, with
bits of hair dropping on her forehead, confused, moved
just as I was. How it was that nothing in her escaped
my attention, I know not. I only know this, I saw tears
gathering under her eyelids, her quivering lips, delight
breaking through the tears, and a smile under the confusion.
She stood for a moment with arms hanging, as
if at a loss what to do; then her father, whom, as was
evident, humor never deserted, said, shrugging his
shoulders,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ha! a hard case to cure! he has grown stubborn, and
will not have thee."
<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
</p>

<p>She looked at me quickly, threw herself on her father's
neck, and called, as if in an outburst,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not believe it; I do not believe it!"</p>

<p>If I had followed my heart's first impulse, I should
have fallen at her feet. I did not do that simply through
lack of courage, and because I had lost my head. I had
just presence of mind enough to repeat in any soul, "Do
not roar out, thou ass!" The honest father came again
to our rescue; freeing himself from Tola's embrace, he
said, as if angry with her,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If thou dost not believe me, then go to him."</p>

<p>And he pushed her toward me. Heaven opened before
me at that moment. I seized her hands. I kissed them
with delight, and I know not myself how long it was
before I could take my lips from them. More than once
I had imagined myself kissing her hands, but it is not
for imagination to measure itself with reality! My love,
so far, had been like a plant shut up in darkness. Now
it was carried suddenly into bright air to luxuriate in
warmth and in sunlight, hence the measure of my happiness
was filled. I drank openly from the source of good
and delight. To love and imprison that love in thyself,
to love and feel that thou art entering on thy right to love
and take possession,&mdash;are things entirely different. I not
only had not had, but I could not have had, any comprehension
of this.</p>

<p>The parents blessed us, and went out on purpose
to leave us alone, so that we might tell each other
all that we felt. But at first, instead of speaking, I
only looked at her with ravishment, and her face changed
beneath my gaze. Blushes covered her cheeks; the
corners of her mouth quivered with a smile full of timidity
and embarrassment; her eyes were mist-covered;
her head sank, as it were, between her shoulders; at moments
<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
she dropped her eyelids and seemed to wait for my
words.</p>

<p>At last, we sat down side by side at the window, each
holding the other's hand. Till that day she had been for
me, not of flesh and blood, as it were, but an abstraction,
a beloved spirit, a precious name, an admired charm
rather than a person; when her arm touched mine, however,
and I felt the warmth of her face, I could not resist
a certain astonishment that she was so real. A beloved
woman seems known but not felt till one is near her.
Now I looked with as much wonder at her face, her mouth,
her eyes, her bright hair, and her still brighter eyelashes,
as if I had never seen her till that moment. I was
carried away by her. Never had a face so satisfied all
my dreams of woman's beauty; no one had ever attracted
me so irresistibly as she. And when I thought that all
those treasures would be mine, that they belonged to me
already, and were my highest good, the whole world
whirled around with me.</p>

<p>At last I spoke. I told her feverishly how I had loved
her from almost the very first moment, a year and a half
before, in Velichka, where I met her by chance in a large
society, to me unknown, and where she had grown faint
at the bottom of the salt mine; and I ran to the well for
water. The next day I paid a visit to her parents; from
that visit I came away in love completely.</p>

<p>All this, as I supposed, was perfectly known to her;
but she listened with the greatest delight, blushing, and
sometimes even asking questions in a low voice. I spoke
a long time, and toward the end less stupidly than I had
expected. I told how afterward she had been my only
strength; how deeply and dreadfully unhappy I was
yesterday when I said to myself that all was lost, and
that I had lost faith in her also.
<span class="pagenum">[278]</span>
</p>

<p>"I was just as unhappy," said she. "And it is true
that at first I could not stammer out a word, but later
I tried to correct everything."</p>

<p>After a while we were both silent. In me there was
a struggle between timidity and a wish to kiss her feet;
at last, in the most monstrously awkward way possible,
and worthy of the last of idiots, I asked her if she loved
me even a little.</p>

<p>She strove for a time to give me an answer, but, unable
to bring herself to it, she rose and left the room.</p>

<p>She returned quickly with an album in her hand; she
sat again at my side and showed me a drawing, my own
portrait.</p>

<p>"I sketched this," said she, "from memory."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"But there is something more," added she, putting her
finger on the paper.</p>

<p>Then only did I note that at the side near the edge of
the paper, were the letters <i>j. v. a.</i>, in a very small hand.</p>

<p>"This is read in French," whispered Tola.</p>

<p>"In French?"</p>

<p>And in my boundless simplicity, I could not think
what they meant till she began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Je vous&mdash;?"</p>

<p>And hiding her face in her hands, she bent so low that
I saw the short hair on her neck, and her neck itself.
Then I guessed at last and said with throbbing heart,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now I may, I may&mdash;"</p>

<p>She raised her face, smiling and radiant,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And you must," added she, blinking, and, as it were,
commanding me for the future.</p>

<p>At that moment they called us to lunch. At that
lunch, I might have eaten knives and forks without
knowing it.
<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
</p>

<p>A man grows accustomed to nothing so easily as to happiness.
All that had passed was simply a series of
miracles, but two days later it seemed to me perfectly
natural that Tola was my betrothed. I thought that it
ought to be so, that she was mine; and for this reason
solely, that no other man loved her as I did.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Finally, the news of my betrothal went about through
the city, and I began to receive congratulations from my
comrades. Tola and I drove out beyond the suburbs with
her parents, on which occasion many persons saw us together.
I remember that drive perfectly. Tola, in a
sack trimmed with otter-skin, and a cap trimmed with
the same fur, looked like a vision, for her transparent
complexion seemed more delicate with the dark bronze
color of the trimmings. All turned to look after us, and
so admired was she that some of my acquaintances stood
as if fixed to the pavement.</p>

<p>Beyond the barriers, when we had passed rows of
cottages, each lower than the other, we reached the open
country at last. In the fields, between rows of trees, lay
clear water, and on this, light in long streaks was shining.
The meadows were flooded; the groves had no leaves;
but we felt the presence of spring. Then came the moment
of darkness, during which there is great calm in
the world; such a calm took possession also of us. After
the violent impressions of preceding days, I felt a great
and sweet calmness. I had before me the dear face of
Tola, rosy from the movement of air, but also soothed in
that peace and thoughtful. We were both silent, and
only looked at each other from moment to moment
and smiled. For the first time in life I understood the
meaning of undimmed, perfect happiness. As I was very
young and had lived through little, I had, in fact, no
<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
heavy sins on my conscience, but, like all men, I bore
with me my own load of defects, faults, and failures. Behold,
at that moment this burden dropped from my shoulders.
I felt in my bosom no bitterness. I had not the
least dislike for people; I was ready to forgive and help
every one. I felt renewed altogether, just as if love had
taken the soul out of me and put into my body an
angel immediately.</p>

<p>And this had happened because it was permitted me
to love, and she, that dear one sitting opposite, had been
given to me. What is more, for that very reason the four
persons in that carriage were not merely what is called
happy; they were better than ever they had been before.
All the pettinesses of society, the paltry ambitions, the
pitiful views of existence; all that which debases life and
makes it repulsive, flat, and deceitful,&mdash;we had shaken
away, together with the former sorrow and bitterness.
Tola's parents had barely opened their house to this
blessed guest when we began to live more broadly and
loftily than ever before.</p>

<p>Hence I could not understand why people so often reject
that which in life is the one, the supreme good.
Still oftener do they squander it. I know those
petty wise-saws which circulate like counterfeit money:
that love withers, grows old, passes away, vanishes, and
that finally habit alone is the bond between man and
woman. Now I will show that this truth relates solely
to stupid or pitiful people. There are chosen souls, who
know how to avoid that condition; I have met such in
the world, hence I myself have the wish and the will
to become one of them. If this flame to-day makes me
so happy, my first duty, and the most direct task of selfishness,
is that it should not quench, that it should not
even decrease in the future. Therefore I will defy that
<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
future! it has time on its side. I have my great love and
good will. To live with Tola and cease to love her,&mdash;we
will see about that!</p>

<p>All at once an irresistible desire mastered me to begin
that life at the earliest. I knew that society customs did
not permit betrothed persons to marry before the end of
certain weeks, or months, but I remembered that I had to
deal with exceptional people. I was convinced that Tola
would aid me, and I determined to involve her in the
affair.</p>

<p>On our return home, when they left us alone, I confessed
my thoughts to her. She listened with immense
delight. I saw that not only the plan itself, but even
discussion concerning it, had for her the charm of a lover's
conspiracy, and simply carried her away. At moments she
had the look of a child to whom people promise some
wonderful amusement which is soon to appear, and she
could not restrain herself from dancing through the room.
We did not mention the matter that evening, however;
but at tea I told of my hopes for the future, and the paths
which were opening before me. Tola's parents listened as
though those hopes had been realized. Could I have
supposed those people of dove-like simplicity to be
acting through politeness, I should have called that politeness
the very wisest, for seeing their faith and confidence
I said to myself, Though I were to lay down my head I will
not deceive you.</p>

<p>I took leave at a late hour. Tola hastened after me to
the entrance, and repeated, in a whisper,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let it be so; let it be so. Why delay? I am not fond
of delay! let it be so. Good-night. I fear only mamma,
mamma will be thinking of the wedding outfit."</p>

<p>I did not understand very clearly why she should make
a wedding outfit, since young ladies, as young ladies, must
<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
have at all times a certain supply of dresses. But in its
own way every expression of that sort made me happy to
a high degree, since it confirmed in some way that I was
not dreaming, that in truth I was going to marry Tola.
While returning home I repeated involuntarily: Wedding
clothes, wedding clothes! I do not foresee that through
them any great difficulty can rise. I saw, however, with
the eyes of my soul a multitude of dresses, bright, dark,
many-colored, and I fell in love with each of them in turn.
Then it occurred to me that I must arrange a house in
which to receive Tola. I found new delight in this thought.
I needed money a little, but determined in spite of that to
arrange all at the earliest. I could not sleep in the night,
for I had my head full of dresses, tables, cupboards, and
armchairs. Some time since I could not sleep because of
suffering; later I could not sleep from delight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next morning I visited the cabinet-maker. He understood
in a flash what I needed. He showed me various pieces
of furniture. At sight of these I saw tangibly my
future life with Tola, just as if I had known it all, but my
heart began to palpitate. The cabinet-maker advised me
to paint the walls, as paper would need a long time to dry.
The active man promised to undertake that task for a
proper reward.</p>

<p>From his place I went to two intimate comrades to invite
them as best men; of my own family I had not a
living soul. Their congratulations and embraces were
mingled with other impressions in my head, and roused
there a genuine chaos.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I found Tola in the drawing-room. I had barely kissed
her hands when she came to my ear on tiptoe and whispered
one sentence,
<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"They have permitted!"</p>

<p>The last shadow on my happiness vanished. Tola was
as radiant with delight as a burning candle is with fire.
We walked hand in hand through the room and conversed.
She told me how everything had happened.</p>

<p>"At first mamma said that that was impossible, and
then she said: 'Thou dost not even understand how
very unbecoming it is for a young lady to hasten her
wedding.' Then I answered that we were both hastening
it. Mamma raised her eyes to the ceiling, and shrugged
her shoulders. Papa laughed, embraced me, kissed me
on the forehead, and even on the hand. 'Thou hast
always a weakness for her,' said mamma; 'but one must
consider society a little.'</p>

<p>"'Society! society!' said papa. 'Society will not give
them happiness; they must find happiness for themselves;
and as we have done everything just the opposite of
society, let it be the same to the end. It is Lent now;
but immediately after Easter they can marry, and the
wedding outfit may be finished afterward.'</p>

<p>"Mamma yielded, for papa always insists on his point.
(I suppose you will be like him too.) Then I embraced
mamma; I did not let her speak a word. Only later
could she say, 'All is done in mad fashion.' But I carried
my point at last. Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>I had been so much in love, or so timid, that I had
never gone so far as to take her in my arms. Then for
the first time I wanted to embrace her; but she put me
away gently, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is so nice to walk arm in arm, like good children."</p>

<p>And so we walked on. I told her that I had thought
of our house, and had given orders to paint the walls, not
in oil, for that was very costly, but in some color which
dries quickly, and is exactly like oil. Tola repeated,
<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
"Which dries quickly;" and it is unknown why we
both began to laugh, likely for the reason that our mutual
delight and happiness could not find room in us. We
decided that the little drawing-room should be red, for
though that color is common, heads appear on a red background
perfectly. The dining-room was to be in bright
green tiles, the adjoining room in faience; of others we
did not talk, for Tola's shoestring was loose, and she
went to the next room to tie it.</p>

<p>After a while she returned with her father, who called
me a water-burner and a Tartar; but at the same time he
promised that the ceremony should take place on Tuesday
after the holidays.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the first days our love was all emotion and had
ceaseless tears in its eyes; but afterward it bloomed out
in gladness, like a flower in spring, and we laughed then
whole days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Because of the lateness of the holidays, spring was in
the world. The trees were in bud. Before Holy Week
Tola and I, with her parents, made visits. People looked
at us curiously everywhere; at times this was annoying.
Some older ladies put glasses on their eyes at sight of me;
but I had to pass the ordeal. Tola, joyous and fresh as
a bird, rewarded me a hundredfold for those irksome
visits.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I looked myself to the painting of the rooms. Because
of the weather everything dried in a twinkle. The bedroom
I had painted in rose-color.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My love increased daily. I was sure now that even
were Tola to change, were she even to grow ugly, I should
<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
say to myself, "Misfortune has touched <i>me</i>;" but I
would not cease to love her. A man in that state yields
himself up so completely that he knows not where his
own <i>I</i> ceases.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We amused ourselves often like children; at times we
teased each other. When, for example, I came in the
morning and found her alone, I looked through the room,
as if not observing her; I looked for her, and asked, "Is
there no one here who is loved?" She searched in the
corners, shook her bright head, and answered, "No! it
seems not."&mdash; "But that young lady?"&mdash; "Oh, perhaps
she is a little!" Then after a while she added in a
whisper, "And perhaps greatly."</p>

<p>At that time a new feeling involved itself in my love.
Not only did I love Tola, but I liked her beyond everything.
I was dying for her companionship. I could
pass whole hours with her talking about anything. At
times we talked deeply and seriously touching our future,
though in general I avoided all discussions and theories
on the theme of what marriage should be; for I thought
why must I enclose in prearranged formulas that which
should develop spontaneously from love itself. There is
no need to lay before flowers theories of how they should
bloom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Good Friday passed silently, gloomily. On the streets
there was mist, and a light rain was falling. We and
Tola's parents went to the cemetery; we put each what
we chose on the plates of beggars. Tola, dressed in black,
serene, calm, and dignified, appeared beautiful as never
before. At moments, in the gloom of the church, or in
the light of the candles, her face was perfectly angelic.
That day she caught a slight cold; and I raced through
<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
all the cellars, looking for old Malaga, which some one
had advised her to drink.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I passed Easter at the house of Tola's parents. Not
having any one of my own family, I understood for the
first time what it is to have persons dear to one, and to be
dear to some one else. The next Sunday there was perfect
spring.</p>

<p>Before Easter I had brought some sort of order into
our house. The garden had begun to grow green, and the
old cherry-trees were in blossom.</p>

<p>Just before the holidays, too, came from the press my
doctoral essay about the Neoplatonists. Tola undertook
to read it. Poor thing! she blinked, broke her little head,
but read from a feeling of duty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now memories of the wedding&mdash;no, rather,
pictures of it&mdash;crowd into my head, confused, in disorder,
filled with single impressions, somewhat feverish.
I see the whole place full of flowers; on the stairs, and
in the rooms. There is a hurrying in the house, the
arrival of guests, a multitude of strange or little known
faces. Tola in the drawing-room, arrayed in a white
robe, with a veil, was as beautiful as a vision, but somehow
different from what she was usually; she appeared more
dignified, as it were, less near. The feeling of a certain
haste and movement remained with me. Everything
that happened after entering the church seems indefinite:
the church, the altar, the candles on the altar, at the
sides brilliant toilets of ladies, curious eyes, whispers.
Tola and I kneeling before the altar took each the other's
hand, as if in greeting; and after a time our voices were
heard, sounding like strange voices, "I take thee to myself,"
etc. I hear till this moment the organ and the
<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
mighty, resonant hymn, "<i>Veni Creator</i>," which broke
forth in the choir, as suddenly as a cloud-burst. I have
no recollection whatever of leaving the church; of the
wedding there is left in my mind the blessing of her
parents, and the supper. Tola sat at my side; and I
remember that from moment to moment she raised her
hands to her cheeks, which were burning. Through the
bouquets on the table I saw various faces, which I should
not recognize now. Our health was drunk with applause
and great clinking of glasses. About midnight I took
my wife home.</p>

<p>Of the road there will always remain in my mind the
memory of her head resting on my shoulder, and her
white veil with the odor of violets.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next morning I waited for her at tea in the dining-room;
meanwhile she, after dressing, went by another
door to the garden, for I saw her through the window
against the background of the cherry-tree. I ran to her
immediately; she turned, pushed her head toward the
tree, as if wishing to hide from me.</p>

<p>I thought that she was jesting; so creeping up quietly,
I caught her by the waist, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-morning. But who is hiding from her husband?
What art thou doing here?"</p>

<p>Then I saw that she was blushing, that she was avoiding
my eyes and turning away from me really.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with thee, Tola?" asked I.</p>

<p>"See," answered she, confused, "the wind is shaking
the blossoms from the cherry-trees."</p>

<p>"Let it take them," said I, "if only thou wilt stay
with me."</p>

<p>And I bent her head toward mine; but she whispered
with closed eyes,
<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not look at me; go away&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at the same time her lips pushed toward me
almost passionately, and I met them with delight.</p>

<p>The breeze began really to cast white blossoms on our
heads.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I woke and saw the naked walls of my room.</p>

<p>I had had typhus,&mdash;and a very bad typhus; I had
lain two weeks unconscious in fever.</p>

<p>But even a fever is sometimes the mercy of God.</p>

<p>When I regained consciousness I learned that Panna
Antonina's parents had taken her to Venice.</p>

<p>But I, lonely as before, finish my confession, which is
strange, perhaps. I was so immensely happy in my
visions that I wrote them down at once, so that life's
irony might not be lost. I conclude the above reminiscences
without sorrow, and with my former faith, that
among all sources of happiness, that from which I drank
during the fever is the clearest and best.</p>

<p>A life which love has not visited, even in a dream, is
worse than mine.</p>

<h2>CHARCOAL SKETCHES.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="topnote">IN WHICH WE MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE HEROES,
AND BEGIN TO HOPE THAT SOMETHING WILL FOLLOW.</p>

<p class="dropcap">IN Barania-Glova, in the chancery of the village-mayor,
it was as calm as in time of sowing poppy-seed.
The mayor, a peasant no longer young, whose
name was Frantsishek Burak, was sitting at the table,
and scribbling something on paper with strained attention;
the secretary of the Commune, Pan Zolzik, young
and full of hope, was standing at the window defending
himself from flies.</p>

<p>There were as many flies in the chancery as in a cowhouse.
All the walls were spotted from them, and had
lost their original color. Spotted in like manner were the
glass on the image hanging over the table, the paper, the
seal, the crucifix, and the mayor's official books.</p>

<p>The flies lighted on the mayor too, as on an ordinary
councilman; but they were attracted particularly by
Pan Zolzik's head, which was pomaded, and also perfumed
with violet. Over his head a whole swarm was
circling; they sat at the parting of his hair and formed
black, living, movable spots. Pan Zolzik from time to
time raised his hand warily, and then brought it down
quickly on his head; the slap of his palm was heard,
<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
the swarm flew upward, buzzing, and Pan Zolzik, seizing
his hair, picked out the corpses and threw them on the
floor.</p>

<p>The hour was four in the afternoon. Silence reigned
in the whole village, for the people were at work in the
fields; but outside the chancery window a cow was
scratching herself against the wall, and at times she
showed her puffing nostrils through the window, with
saliva hanging from her muzzle.</p>

<p>At moments she threw her heavy head against her back
to drive away flies; at moments she grazed the wall with
her horn; then Pan Zolzik looked out through the window,
and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aa! hei! May the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he looked at himself in the glass hanging there at
the window, and arranged his hair.</p>

<p>At last the mayor broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Pan Zolzik," said he, with a Mazovian accent, "write
that <i>rapurt</i>; it is somehow awkward for me. Besides,
you are the writer [secretary]."</p>

<p>But Pan Zolzik was in bad humor, and whenever he
was in bad humor the mayor had to do everything
himself.</p>

<p>"Well, what if I am the secretary?" replied he, with
contempt. "The secretary is here for the purpose of writing
to the chief and the commissioner; but to such a
mayor as you are, write yourself." Then he added with
majestic contempt, "But what is a mayor to me? What?
A peasant, and that is the end of it! Do what you like
with a peasant, he will always be a peasant!"</p>

<p>Then he arranged his hair, and looked again in the glass.</p>

<p>The mayor felt touched, and answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But see here! Haven't I drunk tea with the
marshal?"
<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>
</p>

<p>"A great deal I care about your tea!" said Zolzik,
carelessly. "And besides without arrack, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"That is not true! for it was with arrack."</p>

<p>"Well, let it be with arrack; but still I will not write
the report!"</p>

<p>"If the gentleman is of such delicate make-up, why
did he ask to be secretary?" answered the mayor, in
anger.</p>

<p>"But who asked you? I am secretary only through
acquaintance with the chief&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, great acquaintance, when he comes here you
won't let a breath out of your lips!"</p>

<p>"Burak! Burak! I give warning that you are letting
your tongue out too much. Your peasant bones are
sticking in my throat, together with your office of secretary.
A man of education can only grow common among
you. If I get angry, I will throw the secretaryship, and
you, to the devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you! And what will become of you, then?"</p>

<p>"What? Shall I go to gnawing the rafters without
this office? A man with education will take care of himself.
Have no fear about a man with education! Only
yesterday Stolbitski, the inspector, said to me, 'Ei,
Zolzik! thou wouldst be a devil, not a sub-inspector,
for thou knowest how grass grows.' Talk to the fool!
For me your secretaryship is a thing to be spat upon. A
man with education&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but the world will not come to an end if you
leave us!"</p>

<p>"The world will not come to an end, but you will dip
a dishcloth in a tar bucket, and write in the books with
it. It will be pleasant for you till you feel the stick
through your velvet."</p>

<p>The mayor began to scratch his head.
<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>
</p>

<p>"If anything is said you are on your hind-legs right
away."</p>

<p>"Well, don't open your lips too much&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There it is, there it is!"</p>

<p>Again there was silence, except that the mayor's pen
was squeaking slowly on paper. At last the mayor
straightened himself, wiped his pen on his coat, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, now! I have done it, with the help of God."</p>

<p>"Read what you have tacked together."</p>

<p>"What had I to tack? I have written out accurately
everything that is needed."</p>

<p>"Read it over, I say."</p>

<p>The mayor took the paper in both hands and began to
read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"To the Mayor of the Commune of Lipa. In the name
of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen. The chief
commanded that the soldier lists be ready after the Mother
of God, and the registers with you in the parish with the
priest, and also our men go to you to harvest; do you
understand? That they be written out, and the harvesters
too, to send before the Mother of God, as eighteen years
are finished; for if you do not do this you will catch it on
the head, which I wish to myself and you. Amen."</p></blockquote>

<p>The worthy mayor heard every Sunday how the priest
ended his sermon with Amen, so the ending seemed to
him as final as it was appropriate to all the demands of
polite style; but Zolzik began to laugh. "How is that?"
inquired he.</p>

<p>"Well, write better you."</p>

<p>"Certainly I will write, because I blush for all Barania-Glova."</p>

<p>Zolzik sat down, took the pen in his hand, made a
<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
number of circles with it, as if to acquire impetus, and
then fell to writing rapidly.</p>

<p>The notice was soon ready; the author straightened
his hair, and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Mayor of the Commune of Barania-Glova to the
Mayor of the Commune of Lipa. As the recruiting lists
are to be ready at command of superior authority on such
and such a day of such and such a year, the Mayor of the
Commune of Lipa is notified that the register of those
peasants of Barania-Glova, which is in the chancery of his
parish, is to be taken by him from that chancery and sent
at the very earliest date to the Commune of Barania-Glova.
The peasants of the Commune of Barania-Glova who are at
work in Lipa are to be presented in Barania-Glova on the
same day as the register."</p></blockquote>

<p>The mayor caught those sounds with eager ear; and
his face expressed an occupation and a concentration of
spirit that was well-nigh religious. How beautiful and
solemn all that seemed to him; how thoroughly official it
was! Take, for example, even that beginning: "As the
recruiting lists, etc." The mayor adored that "as;" but
he never could learn it, or rather he knew how to begin
with it, but not a word farther could he go. From
Zolzik's hand that flowed just like water; so that even
in the chancery of the district no one wrote better. Next
he blackened the seal, struck it on the paper so that the
table quivered, and all was there finished!</p>

<p>"Well, that is a head for you, that is a head!" said the
mayor.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Zolzik, mollified; "but then a writer
[secretary] is one who writes books&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you write books too?"</p>

<p>"You ask as if you did not know; but the chancery
books, who writes them?"
<span class="pagenum">[296]</span>
</p>

<p>"True," said the mayor, who added, after a while,
"The lists will come now with the speed of a thunderbolt."</p>

<p>"But next do you see to ridding the village of useless
people."</p>

<p>"How are you to get rid of them?"</p>

<p>"I tell you that the chief has complained that the
people in Barania-Glova are not as they should be. They
are always drinking, says he. 'Burak,' says he, 'does not
look after the people; so the matter will be ground out
on him.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," answered the mayor; "that all is
ground out on me. When Rozalka Kovaliha was brought
to bed, the court decided to give her twenty-five, so that
a second time she should remember. 'Because,' said the
court, 'that is not nice for a girl.' Who commanded?
Was it I? Not I, but the court. What had I to do
with that. Let them all be brought to bed for themselves,
if they like. The court directed, and then laid
the blame on me."</p>

<p>At this juncture the cow struck the wall with such
force that the chancery trembled. The mayor cried out,
with a voice full of bitterness,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aa! hei! may all the&mdash;"</p>

<p>The secretary, who was sitting at the table, began to
look again in the glass.</p>

<p>"Serves you right," said he; "why don't you look out?
It will be the same story with this drinking. One mangy
sheep will lead a whole flock astray, and he attracts
people to the dram-shop."</p>

<p>"Of course, that is well known; but as to drinking,
there is need of drink when people have worked in the
field."</p>

<p>"But I tell you only this, get rid of Repa, and all will
be well."
<span class="pagenum">[297]</span>
</p>

<p>"What! shall I take his head off?"</p>

<p>"You will not take his head off; but now that they
are making the army lists, inscribe him in the list; let
him draw the lot, and that is enough."</p>

<p>"But he is married and has a son a year old."</p>

<p>"Who among the higher authorities knows that? He
will not go to make a complaint, and if he goes, they
will not listen to him. In time of recruiting no one
has leisure."</p>

<p>"Oh, lord writer, it must be that for you the question
is not of drinking, but of Repa's wife; and that is nothing
but a sin against God."</p>

<p>"What is that to you? This is what you will do; you
will look out for your son, who is nineteen years of age,
and he as well as others must draw."</p>

<p>"I know that; but I won't give him. If there is no
other way, I will ransom him."</p>

<p>"Oh! if you are such a rich man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Lord God has a little copper money in my
hands; not much; but perhaps it will hold out."</p>

<p>"You will pay eight hundred rubles of copper
money?"</p>

<p>"And if I say that I will pay, I will pay even in
copper, and afterward, if the Lord God permits me to
remain mayor, with His supreme assistance, the money
may come back to me in a couple of years."</p>

<p>"It will come back, or it will not come back. I need
some too; I will not give you all. A man with education
has always more outgoes than one who is ignorant; if we
should enroll Repa in place of your son, it would be a
sparing for you; you cannot find eight hundred rubles
on the road."</p>

<p>The hope of saving such a large sum began to tickle
Burak, and smile at him agreeably.
<span class="pagenum">[298]</span>
</p>

<p>"Ba!" said he at last, "that is always a very dangerous
thing."</p>

<p>"Well, it is not on your head."</p>

<p>"That is just what I am afraid of, that the thing will
be done by your head, and ground out on mine."</p>

<p>"As you like; then pay eight hundred rubles."</p>

<p>"I do not say that I am not sorry for the money."</p>

<p>"But since you think that it will come back to you,
why are you sorry? Do not count too much on your
mayorship, though; they don't know everything about
you yet; if they only knew what I know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You take more chancery money than I do."</p>

<p>"I am not speaking of the chancery now, but of times
a little earlier."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not afraid! I did what was commanded."</p>

<p>"Well, you will explain that somewhere else."</p>

<p>After he had said this, the secretary took his cap and
went out of the chancery. The sun was very low;
people were returning from the field. First, the secretary
met five mowers with scythes on their shoulders;
they bowed to him, saying, "Praised." The lord secretary
nodded to them with his pomaded head, but did not
answer, "For the ages," since he judged that it did not
become a man with education to do so. That Pan Zolzik
had education, all knew; and only those might doubt
who were either malicious, or in general of evil thought,&mdash;people
to whom every personality raising its head above
the common level was as salt in the eye, and would not
let them sleep.</p>

<p>If we had proper biographies of all our celebrated
people, we should read in the life of this uncommon man,
that he gained his first knowledge at Oslovitsi, the capital
city of the district of Oslovitski, in which district Barania-Glova
also is situated. In the seventeenth year of his
<span class="pagenum">[299]</span>
life, this young Zolzik had advanced as far as the second
class; and would have gone higher as promptly, had it
not been that, on a sudden, stormy times came, which
interrupted forever his career in the exact sciences.
Carried away by the usual enthusiasm of youth, Pan
Zolzik, who moreover had been persecuted still earlier by
unjust professors, stood at the head of the more actively
watchful of his colleagues, made cats' music for his persecutors,
tore his books, broke his rule and pens, and,
rejecting Minerva, entered on a new career. In this new
career he arrived at the office of communal secretary;
and as we have heard already, was even dreaming of becoming
sub-inspector. He did not succeed badly as secretary.
Accurate knowledge rouses respect at all times;
and since, as I have remarked, my sympathetic hero knew
something about almost every inhabitant in the district,
all felt for him respect, mingled with a certain caution,
lest they might in any way offend an individuality so uncommon.
Even persons of "intelligence" bowed to him,
and peasants took off their caps at a distance, saying,
"Praised."</p>

<p>Here I see, however, that I must explain more clearly
why Pan Zolzik did not answer to the "Praised," with
the usual "For the ages of ages." I have mentioned already
that he considered that as unbecoming in a man of
education; but there were other reasons also. Faculties
which are thoroughly self-acting are generally bold and
radical. Pan Zolzik had arrived at the conviction that
"the soul is a breath; and that is the end of the question."
Moreover, the secretary was reading "Isabella of
Spain, or the Secrets of the Court of Madrid," just then
in course of publication by the Warsaw publishing house
of Pan Breslauer. This novel, remarkable in every regard,
pleased him so much and penetrated him so deeply that
<span class="pagenum">[300]</span>
on a time he had even a plan to leave all and go to Spain.
"Marfori succeeded," thought he; "why should not I
also succeed?" He might have gone, indeed, for he was
of the opinion that "in his stupid country a man was
merely going to loss;" but happily he was detained by
circumstances which this <i>epopaea</i> will mention further on.</p>

<p>In fact, as a result of reading that "Isabella of Spain,"
which was issued periodically, to the greater glory of literature,
by Pan Breslauer, Pan Zolzik looked very sceptically
at the clergy, and therefore at everything connected
directly or indirectly with the clergy. This was the reason
why he did not give the mowers the usual answer,
"For the ages of ages," but went on; he went on and on,
till he met girls coming home from the harvest field
with sickles on their shoulders. They were just passing
a great pool, and went, one after another, goose fashion,
raising their skirts behind, and exposing their red legs.
Then Pan Zolzik said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How are ye, titmice?" And he stopped on the very
path; when any girl passed, he caught her around the
waist, kissed her, and then pushed her into the puddle.
But that was just for sport, and the girls cried, "Oi!
oi!" laughing till their back teeth could be seen.
Afterwards, when they had passed, the secretary heard,
not without pleasure, how they said, one to another,
"But that is a nice cavalier; he is our secretary!" "And
he is as blooming as an apple!" The third one said,
"And his head has the smell of a rose; so that when he
catches you around the waist your head is just dizzy!"</p>

<p>The secretary went forward, full of pleasant thoughts.
But farther on, near a cottage, he heard a conversation
about himself; and he halted behind the fence. Beyond
the fence was a dense cherry orchard, in the orchard
bees, and not far from the beehives two women were
<span class="pagenum">[301]</span>
talking. One had potatoes in her apron, and was peeling
them with a small knife, while the other was saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oi! my Stahova, I am so afraid that they will take
my Franek and make a soldier of him, that my flesh
creeps."</p>

<p>"You must go to the secretary," answered the other.
"If he cannot help you, no one can help you."</p>

<p>"And what can I take him, my Stahova? It is not
possible to go with empty hands to him. The mayor
is better; you can take him white crawfish, or butter,
or linen under your arm, or a hen; he will take anything
without grumbling. But the secretary won't look. Oh,
he is terribly proud! For him you must just open your
handkerchief, and out with a ruble!"</p>

<p>"Ye'll not wait," muttered the secretary to himself,
"till I take eggs or a hen from you. Am I some kind of
a bribe-snatcher? But go with your hen to the mayor."</p>

<p>Thus thinking, he pushed apart the branches of the
cherry-tree and was going to call to the women, when he
heard all at once the sound of a brichka behind him.
The secretary turned and looked. In the brichka was
sitting Pan Victor, a young student, with his cap on the
side of his head, and a cigarette between his teeth; the
brichka was driven by that Franek of whom the women
were talking a moment before.</p>

<p>The student bent over the side of the brichka, saw
Pan Zolzik, waved his hand to him, and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How art thou, Pan Zolzik? What news in the village?
Dost thou always pomade thy hair two inches deep?"</p>

<p>"The servant of my lord benefactor!" said Zolzik,
bowing low. But when the brichka had gone a short
distance, he muttered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"May thy neck break before the end of the journey!"
<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
</p>

<p>The secretary could not endure that student. He
was a cousin of the Skorabevskis, and came to visit
them every summer. Zolzik not only could not endure
the young man, but feared him like fire, for he was
always jesting; a great rogue, he made a fool of Zolzik
as if purposely, and was the only man in the whole place
who made no account of him. Once even Pan Victor
had happened in during a session of the communal
council, and told Zolzik explicitly that he was an idiot,
and the peasants that they had no need to obey him.
Zolzik would have been glad to take revenge; but&mdash;what
could he do to the student? As to others, he knew
even something of each one, but of Pan Victor he knew
nothing.</p>

<p>The arrival of that student was not to his liking;
therefore Pan Zolzik went on with a cloudy brow, and
did not halt till he came to a cottage standing a little
way in from the road. When he saw it, his forehead
grew bright again. That was a cottage poorer, perhaps,
than others, but it had a neat look. The space in front
was swept clean, and sweet-flag was scattered in the yard.
Near the fence lay pieces of wood; in one of them was
sticking an axe with its handle erect. A little farther
was a barn with open doors; near it a building which
was both a shed and a cowhouse; still farther was a
field in which a horse was nipping grass, and moving
about with fettered feet. Before the shed was a large
manure heap on which two pigs were lying. Near this
ducks were walking along. Close to the pieces of wood
a cock was scratching the ground among chips, and whenever
he found a grain, or a worm, he called "Koh! koh!
koh!" The hens flew to the call, in hot haste, and seized
the dainty, pulling it from one another.</p>

<p>By the door of the cottage a woman was scutching
<span class="pagenum">[303]</span>
hemp, and singing, "Oi ta dada! Oi ta dada! da-da-na!"
Near her lay a dog with his forelegs stretched out;
he was snapping at flies which were lighting on his
cut ear.</p>

<p>The woman was young, perhaps twenty, and remarkably
handsome.</p>

<p>She wore a white shirt drawn together with red strings,
and on her head was the ordinary peasant cap. She
was as healthy as a mushroom; she was broad in the
shoulders and hips, slender in the waist, active,&mdash;in one
word, a deer. She had delicate features, a head not
large, and a complexion perhaps even pale, but somewhat
gilded by sun-rays, very dark eyes, brows as if
painted, a small delicate nose, and lips like cherries.
Her fine dark hair was dropping out from under
the cap.</p>

<p>When the secretary approached, the dog lying near
the scutching-bench rose, thrust his tail under him, and
began to growl, showing his teeth from moment to moment
as if he were laughing.</p>

<p>"Kruchek!" cried the woman, with a thin, resonant
voice, "wilt thou lie down! May the worms bite thee!"</p>

<p>"Good-evening," began Zolzik.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, lord secretary!" answered the woman,
not ceasing to work.</p>

<p>"Is yours at home?"</p>

<p>"He is at work in the woods."</p>

<p>"But that is too bad; I have an affair with him from
the commune."</p>

<p>An affair with the commune for common people always
means something evil. The woman stopped working,
looked with alarm at the secretary, and inquired with
concern,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"
<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
</p>

<p>Zolzik meanwhile passed through the gateway and
stood near her.</p>

<p>"Let us have a kiss, then I'll tell you."</p>

<p>"Keep away!" said the woman.</p>

<p>But the secretary had succeeded already in putting
his arm around her waist, and drawing her toward him.</p>

<p>"I will scream!" said she, pulling away vigorously.</p>

<p>"My pretty one,&mdash;Marysia!"</p>

<p>"Oh, this is just an offence against God! Oh!"</p>

<p>She struggled still more vigorously; but Pan Zolzik
was so strong that he did not let her go.</p>

<p>At this moment Kruchek came to her aid. He raised
the hair on his back, and with furious barking sprang
at the secretary; and, since the secretary was dressed in
a short coat, Kruchek seized his nankeen trousers, went
through the nankeen, caught the skin, went through the
skin, and when he felt fulness in his mouth, he began to
shake his head madly and tug.</p>

<p>"Jesus! Mary!" cried the lord secretary, forgetting
that he belonged to the <i>esprits forts</i>.</p>

<p>But Kruchek did not let go his hold till the secretary
seized a billet of wood and pounded him uncounted times
on the back with it; when Kruchek got a blow on his
spine, he sprang away whining piteously. But after a
while he jumped at the man again.</p>

<p>"Take off this dog! take off this devil!" cried the
secretary, brandishing the stick with desperation.</p>

<p>The woman cried to the dog, and sent him outside the
gate. Then she and the secretary gazed at each other in
silence.</p>

<p>"Oh, my misfortune! Why did you look at me?"
asked Marysia, at length, frightened by the bloody turn of
the affair.</p>

<p>"Vengeance on you!" shouted the secretary. "Vengeance
<span class="pagenum">[305]</span>
on you! Wait! Repa will be a soldier. I wanted
to save him. But now&mdash;you will come yourself to me!
Vengeance on you!"</p>

<p>The poor woman grew as pale as if some one had
struck her on the head with a hatchet; she spread out her
hands, opened her mouth, as if she wanted to say something;
but meanwhile the secretary raised his cap with
green binding from the ground, and went away quickly,
brandishing the stick in one hand, and holding his badly
torn trousers with the other.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="topnote">SOME OTHER PERSONS AND DISAGREEABLE VISIONS.</p>

<p class="dropcap">AN hour later, perhaps, Repa came home from the
woods with the carpenter Lukash, on the landlord's
wagon. Repa was a burly fellow, as tall as a poplar,
strong, just hewn out with an axe. He went to the
woods every day, for the landlord had sold to Jews all
the forest which was free of peasant privileges. Repa received
good wages, for he was a good man to work. When
he spat on his palm, seized the axe, gave a blow with a
grunt and struck, the pine-tree groaned, and chips flew
from it half an ell long. In loading timber onto wagons
he was also the first man.</p>

<p>The Jews, who went through the woods with measures
in their hands and looked at the tops of the pines, as if
hunting for crows' nests, were amazed at his strength.
Droysla, a rich merchant from Oslovitsi, said to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Repa! devil take thee! Here are six groshes
for vodka. No! here, wait; here are five groshes for
vodka!"
<span class="pagenum">[306]</span>
</p>

<p>But Repa did not care,&mdash;he just wielded his axe till
the woods thundered; sometimes for amusement he let
his voice out through the forest,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i4">
   "Hop! Hop!"
  </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>His voice flew among the trees, and came back as an
echo. And again, nothing was heard but the thunder of
Repa's axe; and sometimes the pines too began to talk
among their branches with a sound as is usual in a
forest.</p>

<p>At times, also, the wood-cutters sang; and at singing,
Repa too was the first man. One should have heard how
he thundered forth with the wood-cutters a song which
he had taught them himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>In the dramshop, too, Repa was first in everything: he
loved sivuha; and he was quick at fighting when he had
<span class="pagenum">[307]</span>
drunk anything. Once he made such a hole in the head
of the house-servant, Damaz, that Yozvova, the housekeeper,
swore that his soul could be seen through it.
Another time, but that was when he was barely seventeen
years of age, he fought in the dramshop with soldiers
on furlough. Pan Skorabevski, who was mayor at the
time, took him to the chancery, and gave him a couple of
blows on the head; but for appearance' sake only, then,
being satisfied, he inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Repa, have the fear of God! How didst thou manage
them? There were seven against thee."</p>

<p>"Well, serene heir," answered Repa, "their legs were
worn out with marching, and the moment I touched one
he fell to the floor."</p>

<p>Pan Skorabevski quashed the affair. For a long time
he had been very friendly to Repa. The peasant women
even whispered into one another's ears that Repa was his
son.</p>

<p>"That can be seen at once," said they; "he has the
courage of a noble, the dog blood!"</p>

<p>But this was not true; though everybody knew Repa's
mother, no one knew his father. Repa himself paid rent
for a cottage and three morgs of land, which became his
own afterward. He cultivated his land; and, being a good
worker, his affairs went on well. He married, and met
such a wife that a better could not be found with a
candle; and surely he would have been prosperous, had
it not been that he liked vodka a little too well.</p>

<p>But what could be done? If any one mentioned the
matter, he answered right off,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I drink from my own money, and what's that to
you?"</p>

<p>He feared no one in the village; before the secretary
alone had he manners. When he saw from a distance
<span class="pagenum">[308]</span>
the green cap, the stuck-up nose and goatee walking in
high boots along the road slowly, he caught at his cap.
The secretary knew also some things against Repa. During
the insurrection certain papers were given Repa to
carry, and he carried them.</p>

<p>When he came that day from the woods to his cottage,
Marysia ran to him with great crying, and began
to call out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, poor man, my eyes will not look long on thee;
oh, I shall not weave clothes for thee, nor cook food long
for thee! Thou wilt go to the ends of the earth, poor
unfortunate!"</p>

<p>Repa was astonished.</p>

<p>"Hast eaten madwort, woman, or has some beast bitten
thee?"</p>

<p>"I haven't eaten madwort, and no beast has bitten me;
but the secretary was here, and he said that there was
no way for thee to escape from the army. Oi! thou wilt
go, thou wilt go to the edge of the world!"</p>

<p>Then he began to question her: how, what?&mdash;and she
told him everything, only she concealed the tricks of
Pan Zolzik; for she was afraid that Repa would say something
foolish to the secretary, or, which God keep away!
he would attack him, and harm himself in that way.</p>

<p>"Thou foolish woman!" said Repa, at last, "why art
thou crying? They will not take me to the army, for
I am beyond the years; besides, I have a house, I have
land, I have thee, stupid woman, and I have that tormented
lobster there too."</p>

<p>While saying that he pointed to the cradle where the
"tormented lobster," a sturdy boy a year old, was kicking
and screaming to make a man's ears split.</p>

<p>The woman wiped her eyes with her apron, and
said,
<span class="pagenum">[309]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"What does this all mean, then? Or does he know of
the papers which thou wert carrying from forest to
forest?"</p>

<p>Repa began now to scratch his head. "He does indeed!"
After a while he added, "I will go and talk with
him. Maybe it is nothing terrible."</p>

<p>"Go, go!" said Marysia, "and take a ruble with thee.
Don't go near him without a ruble."</p>

<p>Repa took a ruble out of the box, and went to the
secretary.</p>

<p>The secretary was a single man, so he had no separate
housekeeping, but lived in the house of four tenements
standing at the dam,&mdash;the so-called "brick house."
There he had two rooms, with a separate entrance. In
the first room there was nothing but some straw and a pair
of gaiters; the second was both a reception and a sleeping
room. There was a bed in it, almost never made
up; on the bed two pillows without cases, from these
pillows feathers were dropping continually; near by
was a table, on it an inkstand, pens, chancery books,
a few numbers of "Isabella of Spain," published by Pan
Breslauer, two dirty collars of English make, a bottle
of pomade, paper for cigarettes, and finally a candle
in a tin candlestick, with a reddish wick and a fly
drowned in the tallow close to the wick.</p>

<p>By the window hung a large looking-glass; opposite the
window stood a bureau on which were the very exquisite
toilet articles of the secretary,&mdash;jackets, vests of fabulous
colors, cravats, gloves, patent-leather shoes, and even
a cylinder hat which the lord secretary wore whenever
he had to visit the district capital of Oslovitsi.</p>

<p>Besides this, at the moment of which we are writing,
in an armchair near the bed rested the nankeen trousers
of the lord secretary; the lord secretary himself was
<span class="pagenum">[310]</span>
lying on the bed and reading a number of "Isabella of
Spain," published by Pan Breslauer.</p>

<p>His position, not the position of Pan Breslauer, but
the secretary, was dreadful, so dreadful, indeed, that one
would need the style of Victor Hugo to describe it.</p>

<p>First of all, he feels a raging pain in his wound. That
reading of "Isabella," which for him had been always
the dearest pleasure and recreation, now increases, not
only the pain, but the bitterness which torments him
after that adventure with Kruchek. He has a slight
fever, and is barely able to collect his thoughts. At
times terrible visions come to him. He has just read
how young Serrano arrived at the palace of the Escurial
covered with wounds after a brilliant victory over the
Carlists.</p>

<p>The youthful Isabella, pale with emotion, receives him.
The muslin rises in waves above her bosom.</p>

<p>"General, thou art wounded!" says she with trembling
voice to Serrano.</p>

<p>Here it seems to the unhappy Zolzik that he is really
Serrano.</p>

<p>"Oi! oi! I am wounded!" repeated he, in a stifled voice.
"Oh, queen, pardon! But may the most serene&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rest, general! Be seated. Be seated. Relate thy
heroic deeds to me."</p>

<p>"Relate them I can, but as to sitting I cannot in any
way," cries Serrano, in desperation. "Oi!&mdash;Pardon, O
queen! That cursed Kruchek! I wish to say Don Jos&eacute;&mdash;Ai,
ai! ai!"</p>

<p>Here pain drives away dreaming. Serrano looks
around; the candle is burning on the table and spluttering,
for just then it begins to burn the fly which had
dropped into the tallow; other flies are crawling along the
wall Oh! this is the house of four tenements, not the
<span class="pagenum">[311]</span>
palace of the Escurial! There is no Queen Isabella here.
Pan Zolzik recovers presence of mind. He rises in the
bed, moistens a cloth in a dish of water standing near
the bed, and changes the application on his wound.</p>

<p>Then he turns to the wall, dozes, or rather dreams
half asleep, half awake, and is going again evidently
by extra post to the Escurial.</p>

<p>"Dear Serrano! my love! I will dress thy wounds
myself," whispers Queen Isabella.</p>

<p>Then the hair stands on Serrano's head. He feels the
whole horror of his position. How is he to refuse
obedience to the queen, and how is he in this case to
yield himself to the dressing of his wound? Cold sweat
is coming out on his forehead, when suddenly&mdash;the
queen vanishes, the door opens with a rattle, and before
him stands neither more nor less than Don Jos&eacute;,
Serrano's sworn enemy.</p>

<p>"What dost thou wish? Who art thou?" shouts
Serrano.</p>

<p>"I am Repa!" answers Don Jos&eacute;, gloomily.</p>

<p>Zolzik wakes a second time; the Escurial becomes the
brick house again, the candle is burning, the fly is
crackling in the wick, and blue drops are scattered;
in the door stands Repa, and behind him&mdash;but the pen
drops from my hand&mdash;through the half-open door are
thrust in the head and shoulders of Kruchek. The
monster holds his eyes fixed on Pan Zolzik, and seems
to laugh.</p>

<p>Cold sweat in very truth is coming out on the temples
of Pan Zolzik, and through his head flies the thought,
"Repa has come to break my bones, and Kruchek to
help him."</p>

<p>"What do ye both want here?" cries he, in a terrified
voice.
<span class="pagenum">[312]</span>
</p>

<p>Repa puts the ruble on the table, and answers,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Great, mighty lord secretary! I have come about
the conscription."</p>

<p>"Out! out! out!" cries Zolzik, into whom courage
enters in one instant. And falling into a rage he rises
to spring at Repa; but at that moment his wound, received
in the Carlist war, pains him so acutely that he
drops again on the pillow, giving forth smothered groans.</p>

<p>"Oi! ye!"</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="topnote">MEDITATIONS AND EUREKA.</p>

<p class="dropcap">THE wound became inflamed.</p>

<p>I see how my fair readers will begin to drop tears
over my hero, and hence, before any of them faint, I will
hasten to add, that my hero did not die of the wound.
Long life was predestined to him. For that matter, if
he had died, I should have broken my pen and stopped
this story; but as he did not die I continue.</p>

<p>In truth, then, the wound grew inflamed, but unexpectedly
it turned to profit for the lord secretary of
the chancery of Barania-Glova, and turned in this very
simple way: The wound drew the humors from Pan
Zolzik's head, therefore he began to think more clearly,
and saw at once that, up to that time, he had been committing
pure folly. For just listen: The secretary had a
design, as they say in Warsaw, on Repa's wife, and that
is not to be wondered at, for she was a woman whose
equal was not to be found in the whole district of Oslovitsi,
therefore he wanted to get rid of Repa. If once
they took Repa into the army, Pan Zolzik might say to
<span class="pagenum">[313]</span>
himself, "Now frolic, my soul, with thy coat off." But
it was not so easy to substitute Repa for the mayor's son.
A secretary is a power. Zolzik was a power among secretaries;
there was this misfortune, however, that he was
not the last resort in recruiting. In this case, one had to
do with the district police, with the military commissioner,
with the chief of the district, with the commander
of the guard. Not all at least of these were
interested in presenting the army and the State with Repa
instead of Burak. "To inscribe him in the recruiting
list, and what further?" asked my sympathetic hero.
"They will verify the list, and it must be compared with
the parish record; and since it will be hard to muzzle
Repa's mouth, they will give a reprimand, and perhaps
throw the secretary out of his office, and thus finish the
matter."</p>

<p>The greatest men have committed follies under the influence
of passion, but just in this is their greatness, that
they open their eyes in proper season. Zolzik said to
himself that in promising Burak to inscribe Repa in the
list of recruits he had committed his first stupidity; in
going to Repa's wife and attacking her at the hemp, he
had committed the second; when he frightened her and
her husband with the enrolment, he committed the third
stupidity. Oh, lofty moment! in which a man truly
great says to himself, "I am an ass!" thou didst come
to Barania-Glova, thou didst descend, as if on wings, from
that region where the lofty rests on the sublime, for
Zolzik said to himself plainly, "I am an ass!"</p>

<p>But was he to reject the plan now, when he had shed
his own blood for it (in his enthusiasm he had said, the
blood of his own breast)? Was he to reject the plan when
he had sanctified it by a new pair of trousers, for which
he had not paid Srul, the tailor, and a pair of nankeens,
<span class="pagenum">[314]</span>
he did not know himself whether he had worn them
twice?&mdash;No, and never! On the contrary now, when
to his projects against Repa's wife was added a desire
for vengeance against both, and Kruchek with them,
Zolzik swore to himself that he would be a fool unless he
poured tallow into Repa's skin.</p>

<p>He meditated over methods the first day, while changing
poultices; he meditated the second day, while changing
poultices; he meditated the third day, while changing
poultices; and do you know what he thought out? Well,
he didn't think out anything!</p>

<p>On the fourth day, the guard brought him diachylum
from the apothecary in Oslovitsi; Zolzik spread it on a
cloth, applied it, and how wonderful were the effects of
this medicament! Almost simultaneously he cried out,
"I have found it!" In fact, he had found something.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="topnote">WHICH MAY BE ENTITLED: THE BEAST IN THE SNARE.</p>

<p class="dropcap">A FEW days later, I do not know well whether five or
six, in a private room of the public-house in Barania-Glova
sat Burak the mayor, the councilman Gomula,
and young Repa. The mayor took his glass,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You might stop quarrelling, when there is nothing to
quarrel about."</p>

<p>"But I say that the Frenchman will not give up to the
Prussian," replied Gomula, striking the table with his fist.</p>

<p>"The Prussian is cunning, the dog blood!" answered
Repa.</p>

<p>"What good is it that he is cunning? The Turk will
help the Frenchman, and the Turk is the strongest."
<span class="pagenum">[315]</span>
</p>

<p>"What do ye know! The strongest is Harubanda
[Garibalda]."</p>

<p>"You must have got out of bed shoulders first. But
where did you pull out Harubanda?"</p>

<p>"What need had I to pull him out? Haven't people said
that he sailed down the Vistula in boats with a great
army? But the beer in Warsaw didn't please him, for
generally it is better at home, so he went back."</p>

<p>"Don't lie for nothing. Every Schwab
 <a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a>
 <a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
 is a Jew."
</p>

<p>"But Harubanda is no Schwab."</p>

<p>"What is he?"</p>

<p>"Well what? He must be C&aelig;sar and that's the end of
it!"</p>

<p>"You are terribly wise!"</p>

<p>"You are not wiser."</p>

<p>"But if you are so wise, then tell what was the surname
of our first father?"</p>

<p>"How? Yadam, of course."</p>

<p>"That is a Christian name; but his surname?"</p>

<p>"Do I know?"</p>

<p>"See there! But I do. His surname was Skrushyla."</p>

<p>"You must have the pip."</p>

<p>"If you don't believe, then listen:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, and isn't it Skrushyla?"</p>

<p>"You are right this time."</p>

<p>"You had better take another drink," said the mayor.</p>

<p>"Your healths, gossips!"</p>

<p>"Your health!"</p>

<p>"Haim!"</p>

<p>"Siulim!"</p>

<p>"God give happiness!"</p>

<p>All three drank; but since that was at the time of the
Franco-German War, Councilman Gomula returned again
to politics.</p>

<p>"Well, drink again!" said Burak, after a while.</p>

<p>"The Lord God give happiness!"</p>

<p>"The Lord God reward!"</p>

<p>"Well, to your health!"</p>

<p>They drank again, and, since they drank arrack, Repa
struck his empty glass on the table, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ei! that was good! good!"</p>

<p>"Well, have another?" asked Burak.</p>

<p>"Pour it out!"</p>

<p>Repa grew still redder; Burak kept filling his glass.</p>

<p>"But you," said he at last to Repa, "though you are
able to throw a korzets of peas on your shoulder with
one hand, would be afraid to go to the war."</p>

<p>"Why should I be afraid? If to fight, then, fight."</p>

<p>"One man is small, but very brave; another is strong,
but cowardly," said Gomula.</p>

<p>"That is not true!" answered Repa. "I am not
cowardly."</p>

<p>"Who knows what you are?"</p>

<p>"But I will go," said Repa, showing his fist, which was
as big as a loaf of bread. "If I should go into one of
you with this fist, you would fly apart like an old
barrel."
<span class="pagenum">[317]</span>
</p>

<p>"But I might not."</p>

<p>"Do you want to try?"</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" interrupted the mayor. "Are you going
to fight or what? Let us drink again."</p>

<p>They drank again; but Burak and Gomula merely
moistened their lips. Repa emptied a whole glass of
arrack, so that his eyes were white.</p>

<p>"Let us kiss now," said the mayor.</p>

<p>Repa burst into tears at the embraces and kisses, which
was a sign that he was well drunk; then he fell to complaining,
lamenting bitterly over the blue calf which had
died two weeks before in his cowhouse at night.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a calf that was which the Lord God took
from me!" cried he, piteously.</p>

<p>"Well, don't mourn aver the calf!" said Burak. "A
writing has come to the secretary from the government,
that the landlord's forests will go to the cottagers."</p>

<p>"And in justice!" answered Repa. "Was it the landlord
who planted the forest?"</p>

<p>Then again he began to lament,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oi! what a calf that was! When he bunted the cow
with his head while sucking, her hind part flew up to
the crossbeam."</p>

<p>"The secretary said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is the secretary to me?" asked Repa, angrily.
"The secretary is no more for me,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i10">
   "'He is no more for me
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   Than Ignatsi&mdash;'"
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>"Let us drink again!"</p>

<p>They drank again. Repa grew calm somehow, and sat
down on the bench; that moment the door opened, and
on the threshold appeared the green cap, the upturned
nose, and the goatee of the secretary.
<span class="pagenum">[318]</span>
</p>

<p>Repa, who had his cap pushed to the back of his head,
threw it at once on the floor, stood up and bellowed out:</p>

<p>"Be praised."</p>

<p>"Is the mayor here?" asked the secretary.</p>

<p>"He is!" answered three voices.</p>

<p>The secretary approached, and at the same moment
flew up Shmul, the shopkeeper, with a glass of arrack.
Zolzik sniffed it, made a wry face, and sat down at the
table.</p>

<p>Silence reigned for a moment. At last Gomula began,</p>

<p>"Lord secretary?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Is that true about this forest?"</p>

<p>"True. But you must write a petition as a whole
commune."</p>

<p>"I will not subscribe," said Repa, who had the general
peasant aversion to subscribing his name.</p>

<p>"No one will beg of thee. If thou wilt not subscribe,
thou wilt not receive. Thy will."</p>

<p>Repa fell to scratching his head; the secretary, turning
to the mayor and the councilman, said in an official
tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is true about the forest; but each one must surround
his own part with a fence to avoid disputes."</p>

<p>"That's it; the fence will cost more than the forest is
worth," put in Repa.</p>

<p>The secretary paid no attention to him.</p>

<p>"To pay for the fence," said he to the mayor and the
councilman, "the government sends money. Every one
will receive profit even, for there will be fifty rubles to
each man."</p>

<p>Repa's eyes just flashed, though he was drunk.</p>

<p>"If that is so, I will subscribe. But where is the
money?"
<span class="pagenum">[319]</span>
</p>

<p>"I have the money," said the secretary. "And here is
the document."</p>

<p>So saying, he took out a paper folded in four, and read
something which the peasants did not understand, though
they were greatly delighted; but if Repa had been more
sober, he would have seen how the mayor muttered to
the councilman.</p>

<p>Then, O wonder! The secretary, taking out the money,
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, who will write first?"</p>

<p>All subscribed in turn; when Repa took the pen, Zolzik
took away the document, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps thou are not willing? All this is of free
will."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I be willing?"</p>

<p>"Shmul!" called the secretary.</p>

<p>Shmul appeared in the door. "Well, what does the
lord secretary wish?"</p>

<p>"Come here as a witness that everything is of free
will." Then, turning to Repa, he said, "Perhaps thou
art not willing?"</p>

<p>But Repa had subscribed already, and fixed on the
paper a jew
<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
no worse than Shmul; then he took the
money from Zolzik, fifty whole rubles, and, putting them
away in his bosom, cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now give us some more arrack!"</p>

<p>Shmul brought it. They drank once and a second
time; then Repa planted his fists on his knees and began
to doze. He nodded once, nodded a second time; at last
he dropped from the bench, muttering, "God be merciful
to me a sinner," and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Repa's wife did not come for him; she knew that if he
were drunk he would abuse her, perhaps. He used to do
so.
<span class="pagenum">[320]</span>
The next day he would beg her pardon, and kiss her
hands. When he was sober, he never said an evil word
to the woman; but sometimes he attacked her when he
was drunk.</p>

<p>So Repa slept all night in the public house. Next
morning he woke at sunrise. He looked, stared, saw
that it was not his cottage, but the dram-shop, and not
the room in which they were sitting the evening before,
but the general room, where the counter was.</p>

<p>"In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!"</p>

<p>He looked still more carefully; the sun was rising and
shining in through the colored window-panes, and at the
window was Shmul, dressed in a shroud with a head-band
and plate on his forehead; he was standing, nodding
and praying aloud.</p>

<p>"Shmul, dog faith!" cried Repa.</p>

<p>But Shmul made no answer. He swayed backward
and forward, prayed on.</p>

<p>Then Repa began to feel of himself, as every peasant
does who has slept a night in a drinking-house. He felt
the money.</p>

<p>"Jesus, Mary! but what is this?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Shmul had finished praying; he removed
the shroud and cap, put them away in the room, then
returned with slow step, important and calm.</p>

<p>"Shmul!"</p>

<p>"Well, what dost thou want?"</p>

<p>"What money is this that I have here?"</p>

<p>"Knowest not, stupid fellow? Thou didst agree last
night with the mayor to take the place of his son; thou
didst take the money and sign an agreement."</p>

<p>Repa became as pale as a white wall; then he threw
his cap on the floor, dropped onto it, and roared till the
window-panes rattled.
<span class="pagenum">[321]</span>
</p>

<p>"Now go out, thou soldier!" said Shmul, phlegmatically.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Repa was approaching his cottage;
his wife, who was cooking breakfast just then, heard him
when the gate squeaked, and ran straight from the fire to
meet him; she was very angry.</p>

<p>"Thou drunkard!" began she.</p>

<p>But when she looked at the man, she was frightened,
for she hardly knew him.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with thee?"</p>

<p>Repa went into the cottage, and at first could not
say a word; he only sat on the bench and looked at the
floor.</p>

<p>But Marysia began to inquire, and got everything out
of him finally.</p>

<p>"They sold me," said he.</p>

<p>Then she in her turn broke into a great lament; he
after her; the child in the cradle began to roar; Kruchek,
the dog, outside the door howled so piteously that women
with spoons in their hands ran among other cottages and
inquired one of another,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What has happened there at Repa's?"</p>

<p>"It must be that he is beating her, or something."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Repa's wife was lamenting still more than
Repa himself, for she loved him, poor woman, above
everything in the world.

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="topnote">IN WHICH WE BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE JUDICIAL
BODY OF BARANIA-GLOVA AND ITS CHIEF REPRESENTATIVES.</p>

<p class="dropcap">NEXT morning there was a session of the communal
court. Members from the whole place were assembled,
with the exception of the lords, or nobles.
Though a few nobles in the district were members, those
few, not wishing to differ from their peers, adhered to the
policy known in England as non-intervention, a policy so
much lauded by that renowned statesman John Bright.
This abstention did not exclude, however, the direct influence
of the "intelligence" on the fate of the commune.
For if any man of the "intelligence" had a case, he invited
Pan Zolzik to his house on the eve of the session
of the court, vodka was brought to the room of the representative
of the "intelligence," and cigars were given;
after that the affair was discussed easily, then followed
dinner, to which Pan Zolzik was invited with the cordial
words, "Well, sit down, Pan Zolzik, sit down!"</p>

<p>Pan Zolzik sat down; and next day he said carelessly
to the mayor, "Yesterday I dined with the
Zarembas, the Skorabevskis, or the Dovbors. Hm! There
is a daughter in the house; we understand what that
means!"</p>

<p>During dinner Pan Zolzik tried to maintain good manners,
to eat of various problematical dishes in the way
that he saw others eat of them, and tried, moreover, not
to show that that intimacy with the mansion gave him
too much pleasure.
<span class="pagenum">[323]</span>
</p>

<p>He was a man filled with tact, who knew how to conduct
himself everywhere; therefore, not only did he not
lose courage on such occasions, but he pushed himself
into the conversation, mentioning meanwhile this "honorable
commissioner" or that "excellent chief," with
whom yesterday, or some other day, he had played a
small game at a copeck a point. In one word, he endeavored
to show that he was on a footing of close intimacy
with the first powers in the district. He noticed,
it is true, that during his narratives the company looked
somehow strangely into their plates; but he judged that
that was the fashion. After dinner it astonished him
also more than once, that the noble, without waiting for
him to say farewell, clapped him on the shoulder and
said, "Well, be in good health, Pan Zolzik;" but again
he judged that that was the way in good society. Then,
while pressing the host's hand in farewell, he felt in it
something that rustled; he bent his fingers, and, pressing
the noble's palm, he gathered to himself that something
"that rustled," not forgetting to add, however, "Oh, my
benefactor! there is no need of this between us. As to
your case, you may be at rest, my benefactor."</p>

<p>With such energetic management, and with the native
gifts of Pan Zolzik, the affairs of the village would have
been conducted in the best manner surely, had it not
been for one misfortune; namely, this one, that only in
certain cases did Pan Zolzik raise his voice and explain
to the court how it should consider an affair from the
legal point of view. Other affairs, those not preceded by
anything that rustled, were left to the independent
action of the court, and during the course of this action
he remained speechless, to the great distress of the judges,
who then felt simply without a head.</p>

<p>Of the nobles, or more precisely of the lords, only one,
<span class="pagenum">[324]</span>
Pan Floss, the tenant of Maly Postempovitsi, sat at first
as a judge in the village sessions; and he declared that
the "intelligence" should take part in them. But this
declaration was received ill everywhere. The nobles said
that Pan Floss must be a "red," which for that matter
was shown by his name. The peasants, with a democratic
feeling of their own separateness, contended that
it did not become a lord to sit on a bench with peasants,
the best proof of which was contained in this statement,
"Those lords do not do that." In general, the peasants
reproached Pan Floss with not being a lord among lords.
Pan Zolzik, too, did not like him; for Pan Floss had not
tried to win his friendship with anything that rustled,
and once at a sitting Pan Floss had, as judge, even ordered
him to be silent. Discontent with Pan Floss was universal;
the result of which was that on a certain fine
morning, in the presence of the whole assembly, he heard
from the mouth of a judge sitting near him the following,
"You are not a lord! Pan Dovbor is a lord; Pan
Skorabevski is a lord; but you are not a lord, you are
an upstart." Upon hearing this, Pan Floss, who was just
about buying Kruha Volya, spat on everything, and left
the village to its own devices, as he had formerly left
the city. But the nobility said that "he was played
out," adding, meanwhile, in defence of the principle of
non-intervention, one of those proverbs which form the
wisdom of nations; this proverb went to prove that it
is not possible to improve peasants. Now the council,
untroubled by participation of the "intelligence," deliberated
on their own affairs unaided by the superior element,
and by means of Barania-Glova reason alone,
which, moreover, should suffice, in virtue of the principle
that the reason of Paris suffices Paris. Finally, it
is certain that practical judgment, or, in other words,
<span class="pagenum">[325]</span>
the so-called "sound peasant sense," is worth more than
any intelligence of another element, and that the inhabitants
of a country brought its sound sense by birth into
said country. This, it strikes me, needs no demonstration.</p>

<p>And this became evident at once in the village of
Barania-Glova, when at the above-mentioned session the
question from the government was read, whether the
council would repair, at its own cost, the highway in
front of the communal land, which highway led to Oslovitsi.
In general, the project was exceedingly disagreeable
to the assembled <i>patres conscripti</i>; therefore one of
the local senators gave utterance to the brilliant idea that
there was no need to improve the road, for they could go
through Pan Skorabevski's meadow. If Pan Skorabevski
had been present at the session, he would no doubt have
found something to say against this <i>pro bono publico</i>
amendment; but he was not there, for he adhered to
the principle of non-intervention. The project of going
through the meadow would have been accepted unanimously
had Pan Zolzik not dined at Pan Skorabevski's
the day before. During the dinner he related to Panna
Yadviga the scene of stifling two Spanish generals in
Madrid, which he had read in "Isabella of Spain," published
by Pan Breslauer. After dinner, while pressing
the hand of Pan Skorabevski, he felt in his palm something
that rustled. Now the secretary, instead of recording
the decision, laid down his pen, which always meant
that he wanted to say something.</p>

<p>"The lord secretary wants to say something," said
voices in the assembly.</p>

<p>"I want to say that ye are fools!" answered the lord
secretary, phlegmatically.</p>

<p>The power of real parliamentary eloquence, even when
concise, is so great that after the above statement, which
<span class="pagenum">[326]</span>
was a protest against the meadow amendment, and in
general against administrative management by the Barania-Glova
body, that same body began to look around
with disquiet, and to scratch itself on its noble organ of
thought, which with that body was an unerring indication
of entering into business more profoundly.</p>

<p>At last, after a considerable interval of silence, one of
its representatives answered in a tone of inquiry,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why are we fools?"</p>

<p>"Because ye are fools."</p>

<p>"It must be so," said one voice.</p>

<p>"A meadow is a meadow," added a second.</p>

<p>"We cannot pass without it, in spring," finished a
third.</p>

<p>To wind up, the amendment proposing Pan Skorabevski's
meadow was lost, the official project was accepted,
and they apportioned to each man his part in the
expense of improving the road according to the estimate
sent in. Justice was rooted to that degree in the minds
of the legislative body, that it did not occur to any one
to wriggle out, with the exception of the mayor and
councilman Gomula, who, to make up, took on themselves
the burden of seeing that everything was done as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p>It should be confessed, however, that such a disinterested
sacrifice on the part of the mayor and the councilman,
like every virtue which goes beyond the ordinary
limit, roused a certain jealousy in the other councillors,
and even called forth one voice of protest which sounded
angrily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But why do ye not pay?"</p>

<p>"Why should we give money when what ye pay is
enough?" answered Gomula.</p>

<p>This was an argument which I hope not only the
<span class="pagenum">[327]</span>
sound sense of Barania-Glova, but of every one would
have found unanswerable. The voice of the protester
was silent for a time, then it said in a tone of conviction,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is true!"</p>

<p>The affair was settled thoroughly, and they would
have proceeded without delay to the decision of others,
had it not been for the sudden and unexpected invasion
of the legislative chamber by two young pigs, which,
rushing in as if mad, through the open door, began
without any reasonable cause to fly through the room,
running between the men's legs, and squealing in sky-piercing
voices.</p>

<p>Of course deliberation was interrupted; the legislative
body rushed in pursuit of the intruders; and for a time
the deputies, with rare unanimity, cried, "Ah sik! ah
tsiu!" "May the paralysis take you!" and the like.
Meanwhile the pigs ran between Pan Zolzik's legs, and
stained, with some green stuff, his sand-colored trousers;
this greenness could not be rubbed off, even though Pan
Zolzik washed it with glycerine soap and rubbed it with
his own toothbrush.</p>

<p>But, thanks to the resolution and energy which never
deserted the representatives of the commune, and did not
desert them at that time, the pigs were seized by the
hind-legs and, in spite of their most vigorous protests,
thrown out through the doorway. After this, it was
possible to pass to the order of the day.</p>

<p>In this order was found an action brought by a villager
named Sroda against Pan Floss. It happened that
Sroda's oxen, having filled themselves in the night with
Pan Floss's clover, toward morning left this vale of
tears and misery, and transferred themselves to a
better and an ox world. Sroda, in despair, brought the
<span class="pagenum">[328]</span>
whole sad case before the court, and implored justice and
deliverance.</p>

<p>The court penetrated to the depth of the subject, and,
with a quickness peculiar to itself, came to the conviction
that, though Sroda had let his cattle into Pan Floss's
field intentionally, still, if on that field there had been
growing, for example, grass or wheat, not that "vile
clover," the oxen would have enjoyed to that moment the
best and most desirable health, and certainly would not
have experienced those sad attacks of inflation to which
they had fallen victims.</p>

<p>Starting from this major premise, and passing by a
road, as logical as it was legal, to the minor premise, the
court decided that in every case, not Sroda had caused
the death of the oxen, but Pan Floss; therefore Pan
Floss should pay Sroda for his oxen, and, as a warning
for the future, he was to pay into the village treasury
five rubles for the support of the chancery. The above-mentioned
sum, in case the defendant refused payment,
was to be taken from his dairy farmer, Itska Zweinos.</p>

<p>Next were decided several cases of a civil nature, all
of which, in so far as they did not touch nearly or remotely
the genial Zolzik, were decided with entire independence,
and on the scales of pure justice hung on
sound Barania-Glova reason.</p>

<p>Thanks, therefore, to the English principle of non-intervention,
which was adhered to by the afore-mentioned
"intelligence," the general harmony and unanimity
was disturbed only by passing remarks touching paralysis,
the decaying of intestines, and the plague, which
were uttered in the form of wishes by the litigating
parties as well as by the judges themselves.</p>

<p>I consider that, thanks also to this priceless principle
of non-intervention, all disputes could be decided in this
<span class="pagenum">[329]</span>
way, that the side gaining, as well as the side losing, paid
always a certain sum, relatively rather large, "to the
chancery." This insured indirectly that which is so
desirable in village institutions, the independence of the
mayor and the secretary, and had the virtue to wean the
people from litigiousness, and raise the morality of
Barania-Glova to a level of which eighteenth-century
philosophers dreamed in vain. This also is worthy of
attention (we refrain from expressing praise or blame),
that Pan Zolzik always entered in his books only one
half of the sum destined for the chancery, the other half
was set aside for "unforeseen circumstances," in which
the secretary, the mayor, and councilman Gomula might
find themselves.</p>

<p>Finally, the court proceeded to judge criminal cases; in
consequence of this they ordered the village policeman to
bring in the prisoners and place them in presence of the
court. I need not add that in Barania-Glova the newest
system of imprisonment was adopted,&mdash;the system most
consistent with the demands of civilization, namely, solitary
confinement. This cannot be put in doubt by evil
tongues. To-day any one may convince himself that in
the mayor's pen at Barania-Glova there are as many as
four divisions. The prisoners sit in these separately, in
company with animals of which a certain zoology, for
the use of youth, states, "The pig, an animal justly so
called because of its uncleanness, etc.," and to which
nature has denied horns absolutely, which may also serve
as a proof of its wisdom. Here prisoners sat in apartments
only with companions, which, as is known, could
not hinder them from yielding themselves to reflection,
thinking over the evil they had done, and undertaking a
change of life.</p>

<p>The policeman went without delay to that prison of
<span class="pagenum">[330]</span>
cells, and from those cells brought before the face of the
court, not two male criminals, but a man and a woman;
from this the reader may infer easily how delicate was
the nature, and how psychologically involved were the
cases which the court of Barania-Glova had to decide at
times. In truth, this affair was very delicate,&mdash;</p>

<p>A certain Romeo, otherwise named Vah Rehnio, and a
certain Juliet, otherwise called Baska Jabianka, worked
together with an agriculturist, one as a serving-man, the
other as a maid-servant. And, what is the use of concealment,
they fell in love, being unable to live without
each other, just as Nevazendeh
<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
could not live without Bezevandeha.
<a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
Soon, however, jealousy crept in between
Romeo and Juliet; for the latter once saw Romeo stopping
too long with Yagna of the mansion-house. Thenceforth,
the unfortunate Juliet was merely waiting for her opportunity.
So on a certain day, when Romeo came from
the field too early, according to Juliet's thinking, and
asked for his supper with insistence, matters came to an
outburst and explanations on both sides, whereby there
was an interchange of some dozens of blows of the fist
and of a pot-ladle. The traces of these blows were to be
seen in blue spots on the ideal face of Juliet, as well as
on the cut forehead of Romeo, which was full of manly
pride. The court had to declare on whose side was justice,
and which was to pay the other five zlotys, or,
speaking more correctly, seventy copecks silver, in compensation
for deceit in love, and the results of the
outburst.</p>

<p>The corrupt breath of the West had not been able yet
to embrace the sound mental character of the court;
hence, disgusted to the bottom of their souls with emancipation
<span class="pagenum">[331]</span>
of woman, as a thing hostile, and revolting to
the more ideal disposition of the Slavs, the judges gave
the right of speech, first, to Romeo, who, holding his cut
forehead, began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Great, mighty court! But that pig ear has given me
no peace this long time. I came home, like any good
man, to supper, and she made at me. 'Thou chestnut
dog,' says she, 'the master is in the field yet, and thou
come now to the house! Thou wilt put thyself behind
the stove, and blink at me.' I never scolded her; but
when she saw me with Yagna of the mansion, as I helped
the girl to draw water out of the well, from that moment
she was raging at me. She threw my plate on the table
so the food almost flew from it, and then she wouldn't
let me eat it; she gave out her mind at me in this way,
'Thou son of a pagan, thou traitor, thou geometer, thou
suffragan!' When she said suffragan, and only then, I
gave it to her on the snout, and only so from temper;
but she at me then with a pot-ladle on the forehead."</p>

<p>Here the ideal Juliet could not restrain herself; but,
clinching her fist and shoving it under Romeo's nose, she
cried, with shrieking voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not true! not true! not true! Thou liest like a
dog!"</p>

<p>Then she burst into weeping with her whole overflowing
heart, and, turning to the court, cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Great, mighty court! I am an unfortunate orphan.
Oh, help me, for God's sake! It was not at the well I saw
him with Yagna; may they be blind! 'Libertine!' says
I, 'are the times few that thou didst say that thy love for
me was such that thou didst wish to put a fist under my
rib?' May he melt; may his tongue become a stake!
Not a pot-ladle should he get on the head, but a maple
club. The sun was still high, but he comes from the
<span class="pagenum">[332]</span>
field and calls for something to put in his stomach. I
talk to him as if to some good man, politely, 'Thou scoundrel's
picture,' says I, 'the master is in the field yet, and
thou art at the house!' But I didn't call him a suffragan;
as the Lord God is good to me, I did not! But
may he&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this point the mayor called the defendant to order,
making a remark to her in the form of a question,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou plague, wilt thou shut that snout of thine?"</p>

<p>A moment of silence followed; the judges began to
meditate over the sentence; and what a delicate feeling
of the situation! They did not adjudge five zlotys to
either side; but, to preserve their own dignity merely, and
for a warning to every loving couple in all Barania-Glova,
they condemned the two to sit twenty-four hours longer
in prison, and to pay a ruble each to the chancery.</p>

<p>"From Vah Rehnio and Baska Jabianka, fifty copecks
each for the chancery," noted down Pan Zolzik.</p>

<p>Then the sitting of the court was ended. Pan Zolzik
rose; he drew his sand-colored trousers up, and his violet-colored
vest down. The councillors, with the intention
of separating, had already taken their caps and whips,
when all at once the door, which had been closed after
the invasion of the pigs, opened half-way, and in it
appeared Repa, gloomy as night, and after him his wife,
and the dog Kruchek.</p>

<p>The woman was as pale as linen; her comely, delicate
features expressed grief and humility, and in her
large eyes were tears which afterward flowed down her
cheeks.</p>

<p>Repa was going in boldly, with head thrown back; but
when he saw the whole court, he lost his attitude at once,
and, in rather a low voice, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"May He be praised!"
<span class="pagenum">[333]</span>
</p>

<p>"For the ages of ages!" answered the councilmen, in a
chorus.</p>

<p>"And what are ye here for?" asked the mayor, threateningly.
The mayor was confused at first, but he recovered
himself, "What business have ye? Have ye been
fighting, or what?"</p>

<p>"Great, mighty court," began Repa. "But let the
most serene&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be quiet! be quiet!" interrupted the woman; "let
me speak, and do thou sit quietly."</p>

<p>Then she wiped the tears and her nose with her apron,
and began to tell the whole story, with a trembling voice.
Ah! but to whom had she come? She had come with a
complaint against the mayor and the secretary, to the
mayor and the secretary.</p>

<p>"They took him," said she; "they promised him timber
if he would write his name; then he wrote his name.
They gave him fifty rubles; but he was drunk, and he
didn't know that he was selling his life and mine and
the little boy's. He was drunk, great, mighty court, as
drunk as if he were not a creature of God," continued she,
now in tears. "Of course a drunken man does not know
what he is doing; so in the court, if any one writes anything
when he is drunk, they spare him, for they say
that he did not know what he was doing. In God's name,
mercy! A sober man would not sell his life for fifty
rubles! Have pity on me, and on him, and on the innocent
child! What will become of me, the unfortunate,
alone, and alone in the world, without him, without my
poor fellow! God give you happiness for this, and
reward you in the name of the unfortunate!"</p>

<p>Here sobbing interrupted her words. Repa cried, too,
and from time to time wiped his nose with his finger.
The faces of the councilmen grew long; they looked one
<span class="pagenum">[334]</span>
at another, and then at the secretary and the mayor,
without knowing what to do, until the woman recovered
her voice, and began to speak again,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The man goes about as if poisoned. 'Thee I will
kill,' says he. 'I will destroy the child; I will burn the
house; but,' says he, 'I will not go, and I will not go.'
How am I to blame, poor woman, or the little boy? He
is no longer in the field, at the scythe, or the axe; but he
sits in the house and sighs and sighs. But I wait for
judgment; so do you men have God in your hearts,
and do not let injustice be done. Jesus of Nazareth!
O Chenstohova Mother of God! intercede for us,
intercede!"</p>

<p>For a time nothing was audible but the sobbing of
the woman; at last one old councilman muttered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is not well to make a man drunk, and then sell
him."</p>

<p>"No; it is not well," answered others.</p>

<p>"May God and His Most Holy Mother bless you!"
cried the woman, falling on her knees at the threshold.</p>

<p>The mayor was put to shame; no less troubled was
the councilman Gomula; so both looked at the secretary,
who was silent; but when Repa's wife had finished, he
said to the grumbling councilmen,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ye are fools!"</p>

<p>There was silence as when poppy-seed falls.</p>

<p>"It is written expressly," continued the secretary,
"that if any one meddles in a voluntary contract he will
be judged by a marine court. And do ye know, ye fools,
what a marine court is? Ye do not, ye fools; a marine
court is&mdash;" Here he took out his handkerchief and
wiped his nose; then, with a cold and official voice, he
continued his speech, "Whichever fool of you doesn't
know what a marine court is, let him stick his nose into
<span class="pagenum">[335]</span>
the dish, and he will know what a marine court is till
his seventh skin smarts. When a volunteer is found for
a man who is conscripted, let one and another of you be
careful not to meddle with them. The contract is signed;
there are witnesses; and that is the end of the matter!
This is understood in jurisprudence; and if any one
doesn't believe, let him look at procedure and precedents.
And if they drink besides, what of that? But don't ye
drink, ye fools, always and everywhere?"</p>

<p>If Justice herself, with scales in one hand, and a drawn
sword in the other, had stepped out from behind the
mayor's stove, and stood suddenly among the councilmen,
she would not have frightened them more than that
marine court, procedure, and precedents. For a while,
there was deep silence; only after a time did Gomula
speak in a low voice; all looked around at him, as if
astonished at his boldness.</p>

<p>"That is true! A man sells a horse, he drinks; the
same if he sells an ox, a pig too. That's the custom."</p>

<p>"That's it; we drink, but according to custom," put
in the mayor.</p>

<p>Then the councilmen turned more boldly to Repa,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, if thou hast brewed beer, drink it."</p>

<p>"Or, art thou six years old, or knowest not what thou
art doing?"</p>

<p>"Besides they will not take off thy head."</p>

<p>"And when thou goest to the army, thou canst hire
a man; he will take thy place in the house, and with
the woman."</p>

<p>Joyfulness began to possess the whole assembly.</p>

<p>All at once the secretary opened his mouth again; all
was still.</p>

<p>"But ye do not know," said he, "where to interfere,
and what ye shouldn't touch. That Repa threatened
<span class="pagenum">[336]</span>
his wife and child, that he promised to burn his own
house, with that ye can meddle, and not let such a thing
go unpunished. Since the woman has come with a
complaint, let her not go away from this court without
justice."</p>

<p>"Not true, not true!" cried the woman, in despair.
"I have never suffered any wrong from him. O Jesus!
O dear wounds of the living God!&mdash;has the world come
to an end?"</p>

<p>But the court acted, and the direct result was, that
Repa and his wife not only effected nothing, but the
court, in proper anxiety for the safety of the woman,
decided to secure her by confining Repa in the pen for
two days. And lest such thoughts should come to his
head in future, it was decided also that he should pay
two rubles and a half to the chancery.</p>

<p>Repa sprang up like a madman, and shouted that he
would not go to the pen, and as to the chancery fine, he
would give not two rubles, but the fifty rubles received
from the mayor; and he threw them on the floor,
crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let the man take them who wishes!"</p>

<p>A terrible uproar began. The policeman ran in and
fell to dragging Repa; Repa at him with his fist, he
at Repa's hair. She screamed till one of the councilmen
took her by the neck and pushed her through the doorway,
giving her a fist in the back to help her out; others
helped the policeman to drag Repa to the pen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the secretary wrote down, "From Vavron
Repa one ruble and twenty-five copecks for the chancery."</p>

<p>Repa's wife went to her empty house almost out of
her senses. She saw nothing in front of her, and
stumbled against every stone, wringing her hands above
her head and crying, "Ooo! oo! oo!"
<span class="pagenum">[337]</span>
</p>

<p>The mayor had a good heart, therefore, while going
slowly with Gomula toward the inn, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am a little sorry for that woman. Shall I give
them a quarter of peas, or something?"</p>

<p class="dropcap">HERE I hope that the reader has understood sufficiently
and estimated the genial plan of my
sympathetic hero. Pan Zolzik had, as has been said,
checkmated Repa and his wife. To inscribe Repa on the
list would have led to nothing. But to make him drunk,
and bring it about that he should sign the agreement
himself, and take the money, that involved the affair
somewhat, and was a clever trick which showed that
in a concourse of circumstances Pan Zolzik might play
a famous r&ocirc;le. The mayor, who was ready to ransom
his son with eight hundred rubles, that was surely all
his "copper," agreed to the plan with delight; all the
more since Pan Zolzik was as moderate as he was
genial, taking only twenty-five rubles for his part in the
affair. But even this money he took without greed,
just as he gave part of the chancery money also without
greed to Burak. I have to confess that Pan Zolzik was
always in debt to Srul, the tailor from Oslovitsi, who
furnished the whole region about with "pure Parisian"
garments.</p>

<p>And now, since I have come out into the road of confession,
I will not conceal the reason why Pan Zolzik
dressed so carefully. It flowed, no doubt, from &aelig;sthetic
causes; but there was also another motive, the following:
<span class="pagenum">[338]</span>
Pan Zolzik was in love. Do not think, however, that
it was with Repa's wife. He had for the woman, as he
expressed himself once, a "little appetite," and that was
all. Besides this, Pan Zolzik was capable of a feeling
which reached higher and was very complicated. My
male, if not female, readers surely divine that the object
of these feelings could be no other than Panna Yadviga
Skorabevski. More than once when the silver moon had
mounted the sky, Pan Zolzik took his harmonium, on
which instrument he played with skill, sat on the bench
before the house of four tenements, and, looking toward
the mansion, sang with melancholy, and sometimes with
sighing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i10">
   "But from the very dawn,
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   Till late night, I shed tears;
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   In the night I breathe heavy sighs;
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   I have lost every hope."
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The voice went toward the mansion, amid the poetic
stillness of summer nights; and Pan Zolzik added, after
a while,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i2">
   "O people, O people, people unfeeling,
  </p>
  <p class="i2">
   Why have ye poisoned the life of the young man?"
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>If any man condemns Pan Zolzik for sentimentality, I
will answer that he is mistaken. Too sober was the
mind of this great official to be sentimental. In his
dreams, Panna Yadviga took the place of Isabella of
Spain, and he that of Serrano or Marfori. But as
reality did not answer to his dreams, this iron personage
betrayed himself once in his feelings; namely, when
toward evening, he saw, near the woodshed, petticoats
drying on a clothes-line; and by the letters Y. S., with a
crown near the seam, he recognized that they belonged
to Panna Yadviga.
<span class="pagenum">[339]</span>
</p>

<p>Then tell us, benefactor, who could restrain himself?
Pan Zolzik did not restrain himself; he approached and
fell to kissing one of these petticoats fervently. Malgoska,
the housemaid, seeing this, flew at once to the
mansion with her tongue and news that, "The lord
secretary was wiping his nose on the young lady's petticoat."
Happily, however, no one believed this, and
the feelings of the lord secretary were revealed to no
person.</p>

<p>But had he hope? Do not take it ill, my benefactors,
that he had. As often as he went to the mansion, a certain
inner voice, weak it is true, but increasing, whispered
in his ear,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well now, Panna Yadviga will press thy foot under
the table during dinner to-day." "Hm! never mind the
polish," added he, with that grandeur of soul which is
peculiar to persons in love.</p>

<p>The reading of books published by Pan Breslauer gave
him faith in the possibility of various pressings. But
Panna Yadviga not only did not press his foot&mdash;who can
understand woman?&mdash;she looked on him as she would
on a fence, or a cat, or a plate, or any such thing. How
much he suffered, poor man, to turn her attention to
himself! More than once when tying a cravat of unheard
of colors, or while putting on some new trousers
with fabulous stripes, he thought, "This time she will
notice me!" Srul himself, when bringing him the new
suit, said, "Well, in such trousers, one might go with proposals
even to a countess!"</p>

<p>Of what use is all that to him? He is at the dinner;
Panna Yadviga enters, haughty, spotless, serene as a sovereign;
her robe rustles with its folds, big and little; she
sits down, takes a spoon in her slender fingers, and does
not look at him.
<span class="pagenum">[340]</span>
</p>

<p>"Does she not understand that this is costly!" thought
Zolzik, in despair.</p>

<p>Still he did not lose hope.</p>

<p>"If I could only become sub-inspector!" thought he.
"A man need not put a foot out of doors. From sub-inspector
to inspector is not far; a man would have then
a yellow carriage, a pair of horses, and if even then she
would press one's hand under the table&mdash;" Pan Zolzik
permitted himself to go still further into immeasurably
remote consequences of this pressure of the hand; but
we will not betray his thoughts, since they were too
secretly heartfelt.</p>

<p>What a rich nature, however, Pan Zolzik's was is
shown by the ease with which, at the side of this ideal
feeling for Panna Yadviga, which moreover answered to
the aristocratic tendencies of the young man, a place was
found in him for the equally important "little appetite,"
his feeling for Repa's wife. True, Repa's wife was what
is called a handsome woman; still it is sure that this
Don Juan of Barania-Glova would not have devoted so
many steps to her had it not been for the wonderful
stubbornness of the woman, which deserved punishment.
Stubbornness in a simple woman, and against him, seemed
to Pan Zolzik so insolent, so unheard of, that not only
did the woman take at once in his eyes the charm of
forbidden fruit, but he determined to teach her the lesson
which she deserved. The affair with the dog, Kruchek,
fixed him still more in his purpose. He knew that the
victim would defend herself; hence he invented that
voluntary contract of Repa's with the mayor, which gave,
at least in appearance, to his mercy, or his enmity, Repa
himself and his entire family.</p>

<p>But Repa's wife did not give up the affair as lost after
the interview at the mayor's. The next day was Sunday,
<span class="pagenum">[341]</span>
and she resolved to go as usual to Lipa, and take counsel
at once with the priest. There were two priests in Lipa;
one the parish priest, Canon Ulanovski, so old that his
eyes stared like those of a fish, and his head moved continually,
swaying from side to side; not to him did
Marysia decide to go, but to the curate, Father Chyzik,
who was a very holy man and wise; therefore he could
give her good counsel and console her. She wished to
go early and talk with him before mass; but she had to
do her own work and her husband's also, for he was confined
in the pen. Before she had swept the cottage, fed
the horse, the pigs, the cow, cooked the breakfast, and
carried it to Repa in the pen, the sun was high, and she
saw that she could not talk to the priest before mass.</p>

<p>In fact, when she came services had begun. Women,
dressed in green jackets, were sitting in the graveyard,
and putting on hastily the shoes which they had brought
in their hands. Marysia did the same, and went straight
into the church.</p>

<p>Father Chyzik was preaching; the canon, wearing his
cap, was sitting in an armchair at the side of the altar,
his eyes staring and his head shaking as usual. The
Gospel had been read. Father Chyzik was preaching, I
know not for what reason, of the Albigensian heresy in
the Middle Ages, and was explaining to his parishioners
in what manner alone they were to consider that heresy,
as well as the bull <i>ex stercore</i> which was issued against
it. Then very eloquently, and with great impressiveness,
he warned his flock, as simple people, lowly, like birds
of the air, hence dear to God, not to listen to various
false sages, and in general to people blinded with Satanic
pride who sow tares instead of wheat, or they would
gather tears and sin. Here, in passing, he mentioned
Condillac, Voltaire, Rousseau, and Ohorovich, without
<span class="pagenum">[342]</span>
making any distinction between them; and at last he
came to a minute description of the various unpleasantnesses
to which the damned would be exposed in
the next world. And another spirit entered into Repa's
wife; for though she did not understand what Father
Chyzik was saying, she thought, "He must be speaking
beautifully, since he shouts so that he is all in a sweat,
and the people are sighing, as if the last breath were
going out of them."</p>

<p>The sermon ended and mass continued. Ei! Repa's
wife prayed; she prayed as never before in her life; she
felt too that it was easier and lighter at her heart.</p>

<p>Finally the solemn moment came. The canon, white
as a dove, brought out the most holy sacrament from
the ciborium, then turned to the people and holding in
his hand the monstrance, which was like the sun, holding
it there, with trembling hands, near his face, he
remained for a while with closed eyes and inclined head,
as if collecting breath; at last he intoned, "Before so
great a sacrament!"</p>

<p>The people in a hundred voices roared in response
immediately,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i2">
   "We fall on our faces,
  </p>
  <p class="i2">
   Let the old law with the testament
  </p>
  <p class="i2">
   Give place to the new;
  </p>
  <p class="i2">
   Faith will be the supplement
  </p>
  <p class="i2">
   To that which agrees not with the senses."
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The hymn thundered till the window-panes rattled;
the organ groaned; the bells great and small rang; before
the church a drum thundered; the censers gave out
blue smoke; the sun entered in through the window and
illuminated in rainbow tints those rolls of smoke. In
the midst of this noise, incense, smoke, and sun-rays, the
<span class="pagenum">[343]</span>
most holy sacrament glittered on high for an instant,
then the priest lowered it, and again he raised it, and
that white old man with the monstrance seemed like
some heavenly vision, half concealed by the mist of
incense, and radiant, from whom came grace and consolation
which fell upon all hearts and all pious souls.
That grace and that great peace took under the wings of
God the suffering soul of Repa's wife also.</p>

<p>"O Jesus, concealed in the most holy sacrament! O
Jesus!" cried the unhappy woman, "do not desert me,
unfortunate!" And from her eyes flowed tears; they
were not such tears as she had shed at the mayor's, but
in some sort pleasant tears, though large as Calcutta pearls,
yet sweet and peaceful.</p>

<p>The woman fell before the majesty of God, with her
face to the floor, and then she knew not what happened.
It seemed to her that angels raised her, like a slender
leaf, from the earth and bore her to heaven, to eternal
happiness, where she saw neither Pan Zolzik, nor the
mayor, nor recruiting lists, nothing but brightness, and
in that brightness the throne of God, around which was
such glory that she had to close her eyes, and whole clouds
of angels were there, like birds with white wings.</p>

<p>Repa's wife lay so long that when she rose mass was
over; the church was deserted; the incense had risen to
the roof; the last of the people were at the door; and at
the altar an old man was quenching the candles,&mdash;so
she rose up and went to the priest's house to speak to
the curate.</p>

<p>Father Chyzik was just eating dinner; but he went out
at once, when they told him that some weeping woman
wished to see him. He was still a young man; his face
was pale and serene; he had a white, lofty forehead, and
a pleasant smile.
<span class="pagenum">[344]</span>
</p>

<p>"What do you wish, my woman?" asked he, in a low,
but clear voice.</p>

<p>She seized his feet, and then told him the whole story,
crying meanwhile and kissing his hand; at last, raising
to him humbly her black eyes, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, advice, benefactor! advice! I have come to seek
advice of you."</p>

<p>"And you are not mistaken, my woman," answered
Father Chyzik, mildly. "But I have only one advice,
and it is this: Offer to God all your sufferings. God
tries His faithful. He tries them as severely as Job,
whose wounds were licked by his own dogs, or Azarias,
on whom God sent blindness. But God knows what
He does, and He will reward those who are faithful.
Consider the misfortune which has happened to your
husband as a punishment for his grievous sin of drunkenness,
and thank God that punishing him during life
He may pardon him after death."</p>

<p>The woman looked at the priest with her dark eyes,
rose up and went out in silence, without saying one
word. But along the road she felt as though something
were choking her. She wanted to cry, but she could
not.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">ABOUT five o'clock in the afternoon, on the main
road between the cottages, gleamed in the distance
a blue parasol, a yellow straw hat with blue ribbons, and
an almond-colored dress trimmed with blue; that was
Panna Yadviga, who had gone out to walk after dinner;
at her side was her cousin, Pan Victor.</p>

<p>Panna Yadviga was what is called a pretty young
<span class="pagenum">[345]</span>
lady; she had black hair, blue eyes, a complexion like
milk, and besides wore a dress made with wonderful
care, neat and exquisite; light came from it and added to
her beauty. Her maiden form was outlined charmingly,
as if floating along in the air. In one hand she held a
parasol, in the other her dress, from under which was
visible the edge of her white petticoat and her shapely,
small feet, enclosed in Hungarian boots.</p>

<p>Pan Victor, who walked at her side, though he had
an immense curling forelock of light color, and a
beard which he was just letting out, looked also like a
picture.</p>

<p>This couple were radiant with youth, health, gladness,
happiness; and besides there was evident in both that
higher, holiday life, a life of winged flights, not only in
the external world, but in the world of thought, the
world of broader desires, as well as broader ideas, and at
times in the golden and shining paths of imagination.</p>

<p>Among those cabins, and compared with children of
the village peasants, and all that common surrounding,
they seemed like beings from another planet. It was
even pleasant to think that there was no bond, at least
no spiritual bond, between that splendid, that developed
and poetical couple, and the prosaic life of the village,
full of gray reality, and half animal.</p>

<p>They passed on, side by side, and conversed of poetry
and literature as ordinarily a polite cavalier and a polite
lady do. Those people in homespun, those peasants, those
women, did not understand even their words and their
language. It was dear to think of it!&mdash;confess that to
me, O ye petty nobility!</p>

<p>In the conversation of this splendid couple there was
nothing which had not been heard a hundred times before.
They flitted from book to book, as butterflies flit from
<span class="pagenum">[346]</span>
one flower to another. But such a conversation does not
seem empty and commonplace when one is speaking with
a dear little soul; when the conversation is simply the
canvas on which that soul fastens the golden flowers of
its own thoughts and feelings, and when, from time to
time, its interior is disclosed, like the opening interior of
a white rose. And, besides, such a conversation flies up
in every case, like a bird in the air, to cerulean spheres,
attaches itself to the world of mind, and rises like a
climbing plant on a pole. There in the village inn, rude
people were drinking and talking in peasant words of
peasant things; but that couple were sailing in another
region, and on a ship which had, as Gounod's song
says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i10">
   "Masts of ivory
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   With a banner of satin,
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
  A rudder of pure ruddy gold."
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Moreover, it is proper to add that Panna Yadviga had,
for purposes of self-training, turned the head of her
cousin. In these conditions poetry is more frequently
mentioned.</p>

<p>"Have you read the last edition of Eli?" asked the
cavalier.</p>

<p>"You know, Pan Victor, that I am dying about Eli.
When I read him, it seems to me that I hear music; and
involuntarily I apply to myself that verse of Uyeiski,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i10">
   "'I lie on a cloud,
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   Melted in calm,
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   With a dreamy tear in my eye:
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   I hear no breath.
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   A sea of violet odor
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   Surrounds me;
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   With palm placed in palm,
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   I sail&mdash;I fly&mdash;'
   <span class="pagenum">[347]</span>
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed she, suddenly, "if I knew him, I am
sure that I should be in love with him. We should
understand each other to a certainty."</p>

<p>"Happily he is married," answered Pan Victor, dryly.</p>

<p>Panna Yadviga inclined her head a little, repressed
a half smile on her lips, till the dimples appeared in her
cheeks, and, looking askance at Pan Victor, she inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why do you say, happily?"</p>

<p>"Happily for all those for whom life would have no
attraction in the case you have just mentioned."</p>

<p>When he said this, Pan Victor was very tragic.</p>

<p>"Oh, you attribute too much to me!"</p>

<p>Pan Victor passed into lyric poetry, "You are an
angel&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, that is all well enough&mdash;but let us talk of
something else."</p>

<p>"Then you do not like Eli?"</p>

<p>"A moment ago I began to hate him."</p>

<p>"Oh, you put on ugly faces! I ask you to become
serene, and tell me your favorite poet."</p>

<p>"Sovinski," muttered Pan Victor, gloomily.</p>

<p>"But I simply fear him. Irony, blood, fire&mdash;wild
outbursts."</p>

<p>"Such things do not terrify me at all," said Pan Victor;
then he looked so valiant, that a dog, which had run
out from a cottage, hid its tail under its belly and
withdrew in fright.</p>

<p>Now they arrived at the house of four tenements;
in the window appeared an upturned nose, a goatee,
and a bright-green cravat; they halted before a pretty
cottage covered with wild grapevines, and looking with
its rear windows on a pond.</p>

<p>"You see what a nice little house this is; it is the only
poetical place in Barania-Glova."
<span class="pagenum">[348]</span>
</p>

<p>"What house is it?"</p>

<p>"Formerly, it was an asylum. Here village children
learned to read, when their parents were in the field.
Papa had this house built purposely."</p>

<p>"And what is in it now?"</p>

<p>"Now, kegs of brandy are in it&mdash;"</p>

<p>But they did not finish their thoughts, for they came
to a great puddle in which lay a number of pigs, "justly
so-called for their filth." To pass around that puddle,
they had to go near Repa's cottage; so they turned in
that direction.</p>

<p>Repa's wife was sitting on a log before the gate, with
her elbows on her knees, and her chin on one hand.
Her face was pale, and, as it were, turned to stone; her
eyes were red; her look dull, and fixed on the distance
without thought. She had not even heard the passers-by;
but the young woman saw her, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-evening!"</p>

<p>Marysia stood up, and, approaching, seized the feet of
Panna Yadviga and Pan Victor, and began to weep in
silence.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked the young lady.</p>

<p>"Oh, thou my golden berry, my dawn! perhaps God has
sent thee to me! Take thou my part, our consolation!"</p>

<p>Here the woman narrated the whole affair, interrupting
the story with kissing the young lady's hands, or
rather her gloves, which she stained with tears; the
young lady became greatly confused; anxiety was clearly
evident on her pretty, important little face, and she
knew not what to say; but at last she said, with
hesitation,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What can I advise you, my woman? I am very sorry
for you. Indeed&mdash;what can I advise?&mdash;go to papa&mdash;maybe
papa&mdash; But farewell."
<span class="pagenum">[349]</span>
</p>

<p>Then Panna Yadviga raised her almond-colored robe
till the stripes of her blue-and-white stockings were
visible above her boots; and she and Pan Victor
passed on.</p>

<p>"May God bless thee, most beautiful flower!" called
Repa's wife, after her.</p>

<p>Panna Yadviga grew sad; and it seemed to Pan Victor
that he saw tears in her eyes; so, to drive away sadness,
he began to talk of Krashevski and other smaller fish in
the literary sea; and in that conversation, which became
gradually more lively, both of them soon forgot that
"disagreeable incident."</p>

<p>"To the mansion!" said Repa's wife, meanwhile.
"And that is where I ought to have gone first. Ei! I
am a stupid woman!"</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE mansion had a porch covered with grapevines,
and a view on the yard as well as on a road
lined with poplars. In summer Pan and Pani Skorabevski
drank coffee on this porch after dinner. They
were sitting there now, and with them Father Ulanovski,
Father Chyzik, and Stolbitski, the inspector of mines.
Pan Skorabevski was a man of rather full habit, and
ruddy, with large mustaches. He sat in an armchair,
smoking a pipe; Pani Skorabevski was pouring tea; the
inspector, who was a sceptic, was jesting with the old
canon.</p>

<p>"Now, reverend benefactor, just tell us of that famous
battle," said he.</p>

<p>The canon put his hand to his ear, and inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hei?"
<span class="pagenum">[350]</span>
</p>

<p>"Of the battle!" repeated the inspector, more distinctly.</p>

<p>"Ah! of the battle?" said the canon; and, as it were,
meditating, he began to whisper to himself, and to
gaze upward as though recalling something. The inspector
arranged his face ready for laughter; all awaited the
narrative, though they had heard it a hundred times; for
they always enticed the old man to repeat it.</p>

<p>"Well," began the canon, "I was still a curate, and the
parish priest was Father Gladysh&mdash;I am right, Father
Gladysh. It was he who built over the vestry. But,
eternal light to him!&mdash;well, once after mass, I say,
'Father Gladysh?' and he asks, 'What?' 'It seems
to me that something will come of this,' I say. And he
says, 'It seems to me, too, that something will come of
it.' We look; from behind the wind-mill come out some
men on horses, some on foot, and next banners and
cannon. Then at once I think to myself, Oh! from the
opposite side I think, sheep are coming? but they are not
sheep, only cavalry. The moment these saw those: Stop!
and the other side too: Stop! The minute the cavalry
rushed out of the woods, these to the right, those to the
left, these to the left, those after them. Then they see:
Difficult! then on to them. When they began to fire beyond
the mountain, something flashed again. 'Do you
see, Father Gladysh?' I say, and he says, 'I see.' And
there they were, just thundering from cannon and guns;
those to the river, these won't let them cross; this that
one, that the other one! Then these for a while have the
best, again the others have. Roar! smoke! And then to
the bayonets! All at once, I think, these are weakening.
'Father Gladysh,' I say, 'those are winning!' And he
says, 'It seems to me, too, that they are winning.' The
words were hardly out of my mouth when these to their
legs! those after them. Then drown, kill, take captive,
<span class="pagenum">[351]</span>
and I think, 'It is finishing&mdash;' But what finish! that&mdash;I
say, just, but!&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the old man waved his hand, and, settling himself
more deeply into the chair, fell, as it were, into meditation;
but his head shook more than usual, and his eyes stared
more.</p>

<p>The inspector was crying from laughter.</p>

<p>"Father Benefactor, who was fighting with whom;
where was it, and when?"</p>

<p>The canon put his hand to his ear and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hei?"</p>

<p>"I am just dying from laughter," remarked the inspector
to Pani Skorabevski.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a cigar?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps coffee?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot, from laughter."</p>

<p>The Skorabevskis laughed through politeness toward
the inspector, though they had to listen to that narrative
every Sunday. The joyousness was general; when it was
interrupted by a low, timid voice from outside the porch,
which said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"May He be praised!"</p>

<p>Pan Skorabevski rose at once, passed along the porch,
and inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But who is there?"</p>

<p>"It is I, Repa's wife?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>The woman bent as low as she could with the child,
and seized his feet.</p>

<p>"I came for salvation, serene heir, and for mercy."</p>

<p>"My dear woman give me peace, even on a Sunday!"
interrupted Pan Skorabevski with as good faith as if the
woman had been attacking him every week day. "You
see, besides, that I have guests. So I shall not leave them
for you."
<span class="pagenum">[352]</span>
</p>

<p>"I will wait."</p>

<p>"Well, wait, then. Besides, I shall not be broken in
two."</p>

<p>Then Pan Skorabevski pushed his bulk back into the
porch; the woman withdrew to the garden fence, and
stood there in humility. But she had to wait long
enough. The lord and lady amused themselves with
conversation; and to her ears flew from time to time
glad laughter, which gripped her heart wonderfully, for
she was not inclined to laughter, poor thing. Later Panna
Yadviga and Pan Victor came home; and all entered the
house. The sun inclined gradually to its setting. To
the porch came out the lackey Yasek, whom Pan Skorabevski
always called "one another," and began to lay the
table for tea. He changed the cloth, set glasses on the
table, and put spoons into them with a rattle. Marysia
waited and waited. It came to her head to go back to her
cottage and return later; but she was afraid that it might
be too late then; so she sat down on the grass near the
fence and gave her breast to the child. The child suckled
and went to sleep, but with an unhealthy sleep, for since
morning he was weak, somehow. She too felt that heat
and cold ran through her from foot to head.</p>

<p>At times yawning seized her; but she did not mind
that, she just waited patiently. By degrees it grew
dark, and the moon rose on the dome of the sky. The
table was set for tea; lamps were burning on the porch;
but the company did not come out, for the young lady
was playing on the piano.</p>

<p>Repa's wife repeated the "Angel of the Lord," at the
paling; and then she thought how Pan Skorabevski
would save her. She did not know well how; she did not
understand that he, from his position, was acquainted with
the commissioner and with the chief of the district; that
<span class="pagenum">[353]</span>
if he would only say a word, all would be well, and with
God's help the evil would be turned aside. Meanwhile she
thought that if Zolzik or the mayor opposed, he would
know where to go for justice. "The young lord has
always been kind and good to people," thought she, "so
he will not desert me." And she was not mistaken, for
Pan Skorabevski was really a humane man. She remembered
that he had always been kind to Repa; further,
that her late mother had nursed Panna Yadviga: so consolation
entered her heart. That she had been waiting
already a couple of hours seemed so natural that she
did not stop to think over it.</p>

<p>Now the company returned to the porch. Marysia
saw through the grapevine leaves that the young lady
was pouring tea from a silver tea-pot, and, as her mother
used to say, such odoriferous water that thou art sweet
the whole day from it. All drank tea, conversed and
laughed joyously. Only then did it come to Marysia's
head that in the condition of lords there is always more
happiness than in that of simple people; and she herself
did not know why the tears flowed again down her face.
But those tears soon gave way to another impression.
"One another" brought out steaming dishes; and then
she remembered that she was hungry, for she had been
unable to take dinner into her mouth, and in the morning
she had only drunk a little milk.</p>

<p>"Oh, if they would give me even bones to gnaw!"
and she knew they would surely give, not bones alone;
but she dared not ask lest she might offend, and intrude
before guests; for this Pan Skorabevski might
be angry.</p>

<p>At last supper was over; the inspector went away immediately;
half an hour later the two priests took their
places in the mansion carriage. Marysia saw Pan Skorabevski
<span class="pagenum">[354]</span>
seat the canon; then she judged that the moment
had come, and she drew near the porch.</p>

<p>The carriage moved away; Pan Skorabevski cried to
the driver, "If thou turn over the carriage on the embankment,
I will turn thee over!" Afterward he looked
at the sky wishing to see what kind of weather there
would be on the morrow, then he noticed the white shift
of the woman in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>"Repa's wife."</p>

<p>"Ah, that is you! Tell me quickly what is needed,
for it is late."</p>

<p>She repeated everything again; he listened, puffing his
pipe all the time, and then said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear, I would help you willingly if I could; but
I have promised myself not to mix up in the affairs of
the village."</p>

<p>"I know, serene heir," said Marysia, with a quivering
voice; "but I thought that perhaps you, serene heir, would
take pity on me&mdash;" Her voice broke on a sudden.</p>

<p>"All this is very good," answered Pan Skorabevski;
"but what can I do? I cannot break my word for you;
and to the chief I will not go on your account, for as it
is, he says that I annoy him with my own affairs all the
time. You have your commune, and if the commune
cannot help you, you know the way to the chief of the
district as well as I do. What did I wish to say? But
go with God, my woman."</p>

<p>"The Lord reward," said Repa's wife, in a dull voice,
seizing the feet of the heir.

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">REPA on leaving the pig-pen went, not straight to
his cottage, but to the inn. It is known that in
trouble the peasant takes to drink. From the inn, led
by the same thought as his wife, he went to Pan Skorabevski's
and committed folly.</p>

<p>A man who is not sober knows not what he says.
So Repa was stubborn; and when he heard the same
thing that his wife had about the principle of non-intervention,
he answered rudely; not only did he not understand
that lofty diplomatic principle because of the
mental dulness innate in peasants, but he answered
with that rudeness which is also special to them, and
was thrown out of doors.</p>

<p>When he returned to the cottage, he told his wife himself,
"I was at the mansion."</p>

<p>"And thou didst receive nothing."</p>

<p>He struck the table with his fist, "To set fire to them,
the dog faiths!"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, thou wretch. What did Pan Skorabevski
say?"</p>

<p>"He sent me to the chief of the district. May he
be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is it; we must go to Oslovitsi."</p>

<p>"I will go there," said Repa. "I will show him that
I can do without him."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt not go, poor man, thou wilt not go, my
dear; but I will go. Thou wouldst drink, become insolent,
and only increase the misfortune."</p>

<p>Repa did not wish to give way at first; but in the afternoon
<span class="pagenum">[356]</span>
he went to the inn to drown the worm, next day
the same; his wife inquired no more about anything,
she left all to the will of God, and on Wednesday took
the child and started for Oslovitsi.</p>

<p>The horse was needed for field work, so she went on
foot, and at daylight, for it was fifteen solid miles to
Oslovitsi. She thought that perhaps she might meet
good people on the road, who would let her sit even on
the side of a wagon; but she met no one. About nine
in the morning, while sitting wearied at the edge of a
forest, she ate a piece of bread and a couple of eggs
which she had with her in a basket; then she went on.
The sun began to burn; so when she met Hershek, the
tenant of Lipa, who was taking geese to the city, she
asked him to let her sit in his wagon.</p>

<p>"With God, my woman," said Hershek; "but there is
so much sand here that the horse is hardly able to draw
me alone. Give a zloty and I'll take you."</p>

<p>Then Marysia remembered that she had only one
cheski (three copecks) tied up in a handkerchief. She
was ready to give that to the Jew and offered it; but he
answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"A cheski? But thou wilt not find a cheski on the
ground; a cheski is money, keep it!"</p>

<p>So saying, he lashed his horse and drove on. It became
hotter in the world, and sweat flowed in a stream from
the woman; but she walked with all her might, and an
hour later she was entering Oslovitsi.</p>

<p>Whoever knows geography properly, knows that a person
entering Oslovitsi from the direction of Barania-Glova
must pass a church built before the Reformation. In
this church long ago there was a miracle-working image of
the Mother of God; before this church, to the present time,
a whole street of beggars sit every Sunday, and call for
<span class="pagenum">[357]</span>
alms in heaven-piercing voices. Since it was a week-day,
there was only one beggar at the paling; but he, stretching
from beneath his rags a naked foot without toes, held
in his hand the cover of a box of shoe-polish, and sang:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i10">
   "Holy, heavenly,
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   Angelic lady!"
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Seeing some one passing, he stopped singing, and pushing
his foot out still more, began to cry, as if some one were
flaying him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, compassionate people! A poor cripple begs
charity! May the Lord God, the Merciful, give you
every good thing on earth!"</p>

<p>When Repa's wife saw him, she untied the handkerchief,
took the cheski, and approaching him said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you five groshes?"</p>

<p>She wanted to give him only one grosh; but when the
beggar felt the six groshes in his fingers he began to
abuse her, "You grudge a cheski to the Lord God, and
the Lord God will grudge you assistance. Go to the
paralysis, while I am in good humor."</p>

<p>Then the woman said to herself, "Let it be to the
glory of God," and went on. When she came to the
market square, she was frightened. It was easy to find
Oslovitsi; but to go astray in Oslovitsi was still easier,
and indeed that place was no joke. Go to a new village,
and thou wilt have to inquire where this or that person
lives; but what must it be in a place like Oslovitsi!</p>

<p>"I shall go astray here, as in a forest," thought
Marysia.</p>

<p>There was no help for it but to inquire of people. It
was easy to inquire about the commissioner; but when
she went to his house she learned that he had gone to
the capital. As to the chief of the district, they told her
<span class="pagenum">[358]</span>
that she must look for him at his office. But where was
the office? Ei! stupid, stupid woman, it is in Oslovitsi,
and nowhere else!</p>

<p>She looked and looked in Oslovitsi for the office; at
last she saw a kind of palace, so big that it was a terror,
and before it numberless wagons, carriages, and Jewish
carts. It seemed to Marysia that there was some kind of
festival. "But where here is the office?" asked she of
some one in a frock-coat, seizing him by the leg.</p>

<p>"Thou art standing in front of it, woman."</p>

<p>She plucked up courage, and entered the palace. She
looked again. It was full of corridors, on the right a
door, on the left a door, farther on doors and doors, and
on each letters of some kind. She made the sign of the
cross, and, opening silently and timidly the first door,
found herself in a great room divided into stalls, like a
church. Behind one stall sat a man in a frock-coat with
gilt buttons, a pen over his ear; before the stalls stood a
great number of all sorts of people. The men were paying
and paying, and he of the frock-coat was smoking a
cigarette and writing receipts which he gave to the men.
Whoever took a receipt went out. Then Marysia thought
that it was needful to pay there, and she was sorry for
her cheski, so she walked up with great timidity to the
barrier.</p>

<p>But no one even looked at her. She stood there, stood;
about an hour passed, some came in, others went out;
the clock ticked behind the barrier, and still she stood
there. At last the number decreased somehow, and
finally there was no one. The official sat at the table
and began to write. Then she grew bold to speak,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jesus Christ be praised!"</p>

<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>"Serene chief&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum">[359]</span>
</p>

<p>"This is the money department."</p>

<p>"Serene chief!"</p>

<p>"This is the money department, I tell you."</p>

<p>"But where is the chief?"</p>

<p>The official pointed with his pen to a door.</p>

<p>"There!"</p>

<p>She went out again into the corridor. There? but
where? There were doors everywhere without number;
into which was she to enter? At last she saw, among
the various people who were going hither and thither, a
peasant standing with a whip in his hand, so she went
straight to him.</p>

<p>"Father."</p>

<p>"But what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"From Lipa; but why?"</p>

<p>"Where is the chief here?"</p>

<p>"Do I know?"</p>

<p>Then she asked some one with gilt buttons, but not in
a frock-coat, and with holes in his elbows. He would
not even listen, he merely answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've no time!"</p>

<p>Again the woman went into the first door that she
came to; she did not see, poor thing, that there was a
notice, "Persons not belonging to the service are forbidden
to enter." She did not belong to the service; the
notice she did not see, as is said.</p>

<p>The moment she entered she saw an empty room,
under the window a bench, on the bench some one sitting
and dozing. Farther on a door to another room, in which
she saw men walking, they were in frock-coats and in
uniforms.</p>

<p>She approached the man who was dozing on the
bench; she had some courage in his presence, for he
<span class="pagenum">[360]</span>
seemed a peasant, and on the feet stretched out in front
of him were boots with holes in them. She pushed
his arm.</p>

<p>He woke, looked at her, and then shouted,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is forbidden!"</p>

<p>The poor woman took to her legs, and he slammed the
door behind her.</p>

<p>She found herself for the third time in the corridor.
She sat down near some door, and, with a patience truly
peasant-like, determined to sit there even to the end of
time. "And, besides, some one may ask," thought she.
She did not cry; she just rubbed her eyes, for they were
itching, and she felt that the whole corridor, with all its
doors, was beginning to whirl around her.</p>

<p>There were people near her, one to the right, another
to the left. Doors slam! slam! and the people were talking
one to another; she could hear, "Haru! haru!" just
as at a fair.</p>

<p>But at last God had pity on her. Out of the door
near where she sat came a stately nobleman whom she
had seen in the church at Lipa; he stumbled against
her, and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why are you sitting here, woman?"</p>

<p>"Waiting for the chief."</p>

<p>"Here is the sheriff, not the chief."</p>

<p>The nobleman pointed to a door down the corridor,
"There, where the green tablet is. But do not go to him,
for he is occupied. Wait here; he must pass."</p>

<p>And the noble went on; but Marysia looked after him
with a glance such as she would give to her guardian
angel Still she had to wait long enough. At last the
door with the green tablet opened with a clatter; out of
it came a military man no longer young, and he walked
along the corridor hastening greatly. Oi! you could
<span class="pagenum">[361]</span>
know at once that he was the chief, for after him flew
a number of petitioners, running up now from the right,
now from the left, and to Marysia's ears came the exclamations:
"One short word, lord chief!" "Gracious
chief!"</p>

<p>But he did not listen, and went on. It grew dark in
the woman's eyes at sight of him. "Let the will of
God be done," shot through her head; she rushed to the
middle of the corridor, and, kneeling with upraised hands,
barred the way.</p>

<p>He saw her, and stopped; the whole procession
halted.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" inquired he.</p>

<p>"Most holy chief!" And she could go no further;
she was so frightened that the voice broke in her throat:
her tongue became a stake of wood.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! according to the list&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is that? Do they want you in the army?
Hei?" asked the chief.</p>

<p>The petitioners immediately fell to laughing in a
chorus, to uphold the good humor of the chief; but he
said at once to those courtiers,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I pray you! I pray you be silent!"</p>

<p>Then he said impatiently to the woman,&mdash;</p>

<p>"More quickly! What is it?&mdash;for I have no time."</p>

<p>But she had lost her head altogether from the laughter
of the audience, and blurted out disconnectedly: "Burak,
Repa! Repa! Burak, O!"</p>

<p>"She must be drunk," said one of those nearer.</p>

<p>"She left her tongue in the cottage," added another.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked the chief, still more
impatiently. "Are you drunk, or what?"</p>

<p>"O Jesus! Mary!" cried the woman, feeling that the
<span class="pagenum">[362]</span>
last plank of salvation was going from her hands.
"Most sacred chief&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he was really very much occupied, for the levy
had begun already, and there was much business in the
district; besides he could not talk with the woman, so he
waved his hand, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vodka! vodka! And the woman is young and good-looking."</p>

<p>Then he turned to her with such a voice that she
came near sinking through the floor,&mdash;</p>

<p>"When thou art sober, lay the affair before the commune,
and let the commune lay it before me."</p>

<p>He went on hurriedly, and the petitioners after him,
repeating, "One short word, lord chief!" "Gracious
chief!"</p>

<p>The corridor was deserted; it was silent there; only
her little boy began to cry. She woke then as if from
sleep, stood up, raised the child, and began to sing in a
voice which seemed not her own.</p>

<p>She went out of the building. The sky was covered
with clouds; on the horizon it was thundering. The air
was sultry.</p>

<p>What was taking place in the woman's soul, as she
passed the old church a second time in returning to
Barania-Glova, I will not undertake to describe. Ah!
if Panna Yadviga had found herself in a similar position,
I might write a sensational novel, in which I would
undertake to convince the most obdurate positivist that
there are ideal beings in this world yet. But in Panna
Yadviga every impression would have risen to self-consciousness;
despairing struggles of the soul would have
expressed themselves in no less despairing, and therefore
very dramatic, words and thoughts. That vicious
circle, that deep and painful feeling of helplessness,
<span class="pagenum">[363]</span>
weakness, and overpowering opposition, that r&ocirc;le of a
leaf in a storm, the dull knowledge that there is no
salvation from any side, neither from earth, nor from
heaven, would surely have inspired Panna Yadviga with
a monologue no less intense than the terror of her position;
this I should need merely to write down to make a
reputation.</p>

<p>But Repa's wife? Peasants when they suffer merely
suffer, nothing more. This woman in the strong hand of
misfortune was simply like a bird tormented by a vicious
child. She went forward; the wind drove her; sweat
flowed from her forehead; and that was the whole history.
At times when the child, who was sick, opened his
mouth and began to pant, as if ready to die, she called
to him, "Yasek, O Yasek, my heart!" And she pressed
her lips of a mother to the heated forehead of the little
one. She passed the pre-Reformation church, and went
on into the field, till she stopped on a sudden; a drunken
peasant was coming toward her.</p>

<p>Clouds were rolling on in the sky, denser and denser,
and in them something like a storm was preparing;
from time to time there was a flash of lightning; but the
peasant did not inquire, he let his coat-skirt to the
wind, pulled his cap over his ears, and reeled along,
now to the right, now to the left, singing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i10">
   "To the garden went Dodo,

  </p>

<p>Seeing Repa's wife, he stopped, opened his eyes, and
cried,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i10">
   "Oh, let us go to the wheat,
  </p>

<p class="noin">
<span class="pagenum">[364]</span>
And he tried to seize her by the waist. Frightened
for herself and the child, she sprang to one side, the
man after her; but, being drunk, he fell. He rose at
once, it is true, though he did not pursue her; he only
picked up a stone and threw it after the woman with
such force that the air whistled.</p>

<p>She felt a pain in her head; it grew dark before her at
once; and she knelt down. She remembered only one
thing, "the child," and began to flee farther. She
stopped under the cross, and, looking around, saw that
the man was half a verst distant, staggering along toward
the town.</p>

<p>At this moment she felt a certain strange warmth on
her neck; she put her hand there, and, looking at her
fingers, saw blood.</p>

<p>It grew dark in her eyes; she lost consciousness.</p>

<p>When she recovered, her shoulders were resting against
the cross; in the distance a carriage from Dovborko was
approaching, and in it young Pan Dovbor, with a governess
from the mansion.</p>

<p>Pan Dovbor did not know Repa's wife; but she knew
who he was, she had seen him at church; she thought
then to hurry to the carriage and beg him, for God's
mercy, to take even the child before the storm came;
she rose to her feet, but could not advance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young man had driven up; and, seeing
an unknown woman standing at the cross, he called,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Woman! woman! take a seat."</p>

<p>"May the Lord God&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But on the ground, on the ground."</p>

<p>That young Dovbor was a jester known in the whole
region about; he attacked every one on the road in this
fashion, trifled with them, as in this case, and then
drove on farther. His laughter and that of the governess
<span class="pagenum">[365]</span>
came to the ears of Repa's wife; then she saw
how they began to kiss, and soon after they disappeared
with the carriage in the dark distance.</p>

<p>Repa's wife was left alone. But it is not in vain that
people say, "Women and toads thou wilt not kill, even
with a scythe." After an hour or so she dragged on
again, though the legs were bending under her.</p>

<p>"What is the little child guilty of, the golden fish,
O Lord God!" repeated she, cuddling the sick Yasek to
her bosom.</p>

<p>And then fever seized her, for she began to mutter,
as if drunk.</p>

<p>"In the cottage is an empty cradle, and mine has gone
to the war with his gun."</p>

<p>The wind swept the cap from her head; her beautiful
hair fell to her shoulders and waved in the wind.
All at once lightning flashed; the thunderbolt came so
near that the smell of sulphur surrounded her, and she
crouched. This brought her to herself, and she cried,
"But the Word became flesh!"</p>

<p>She looked at the sky, which was storming, merciless,
raging, and she began to sing in a trembling voice,
"Whoso puts himself under the care!" A certain ominous,
metallic flash fell from the clouds to the earth.
She went to a forest at the roadside; but there it was
still darker and more terrible. From moment to moment
a noise was heard, as if the terrified trees were
whispering to one another in an immense whisper,
"What will happen! Oh! for God's sake!" Then
came silence. Again from the forest depth was heard
some voice. Shudders passed through the woman; she
thought that perhaps the "evil one" was laughing at
the wood devils, or perhaps the host would pass by in
a terrible dance at any moment.
<span class="pagenum">[366]</span>
</p>

<p>"If only out of the forest, if only out of the forest!"
thought she; "and there ahead beyond the forest is the
mill and the cabin of Yagodzinski's miller." She ran on
with the last of her strength, catching at the air with
parched lips. Meanwhile the sluices of heaven were
opened above her head; rain, mixed with hail, fell as
if from a bucket; the wind struck, and with such force
that the trees were bent to the earth; the forest was
filled with mist, with steam, with waves of rain; the
road was not to be seen; trees were bending along the
earth and roaring and splitting; around was the breaking
of limbs, and then came darkness.</p>

<p>The woman felt weak. "Save me, O people!" cried
she, in a faint voice; but no one could hear her. The
wind blew the voice back into her throat. Then she
understood that she could not go farther.</p>

<p>She took off her head-kerchief, her apron, stripped herself
almost to her shift, and wrapped up the child; then,
seeing a weeping birch near, she crawled to it almost on
her hands and knees, and, putting down the child under
the branches, fell herself by his side.</p>

<p>"O God, receive my soul!" cried she, and she closed
her eyes.</p>

<p>The storm raged for some time yet, and at last fell
away. But night had come; through the intervals between
the clouds the stars began to shine. Under the
birch was the white, motionless form of the woman.</p>

<p>"Now!" said some voice in the darkness. After a
while the noise of a wagon and the splashing of horses'
feet in the pools was heard at a distance.</p>

<p>This was Hershek, the cow farmer of Lipa, who had
sold his geese in Oslovitsi, and was coming home. Seeing
Repa's wife, he came down from his wagon.
<span class="pagenum">[367]</span>
</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="topnote">THE VICTORY OF GENIUS.</p>

<p class="dropcap">HERSHEK took the woman from under the birch,
and would have taken her to Barania-Glova; but
on the road he met Repa, who, seeing that a storm was
coming, took his wagon and went to meet his wife. She
lay all night and the next day in bed; but the following
day she got up, for the little boy was sick. Her gossips
came and incensed the child with consecrated garlands;
and then old Tsisova, the blacksmith's wife, conjured the
disease with a sieve in her hands and a black hen. In
fact, it helped the child immediately; but the trouble
was greater with Repa, who filled himself with vodka
beyond measure; it was not possible to agree with him
on any point.</p>

<p>Strange thing, when Marysia came to herself and inquired
for the child, instead of showing her tenderness,
he said gloomily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou wilt fly through towns, and the devil will take
the child. I would have given it thee, hadst thou lost
him!" Only then did the woman feel great pain, at
such ingratitude, and with a voice straight from the
heart she tried to reproach him; but she could go no
further than to cry out, "Vavron!"</p>

<p>And she looked at him through her tears. Repa
almost sprang from the trunk on which he was sitting.
For a time he was silent, and then said, in a changed
voice, "My Marysia, forgive me those words, for I see
that I have wronged thee." Then he roared with a great
voice, and began to kiss her feet; and she accompanied
him with tears. He felt that he was not worthy of
<span class="pagenum">[368]</span>
such a wife. But that concord did not last long. The
grief, which was festering like a wound, began at once
to inflame them against each other. When Repa
came home, either drunk or sober, he did not speak a
word to his wife, but sat on the box and looked at the
ground with a wolfish face. He would sit that way
whole hours, as if turned into stone. The woman was
busy around the room, worked as before, but was silent
also. Later, when one wished to speak to the other, it
was somehow awkward. So they lived as if in great
feeling of offence, and deathlike silence reigned in the
cottage. And what had they to say, since both knew
that there was no help for them, that their fortune had
ended? After a number of days, some evil thoughts
began to come to the man's head. He went to confession
to Father Chyzik; the priest would not give him
absolution, and commanded him to come next day; but
on the morrow, Repa, instead of going to the church,
went to the inn.</p>

<p>People heard him say, when drunk, that if the Lord
God would not help him, he would sell his soul to the
devil; and they began to shun him. A curse, as it
were, was hanging over the cottage. People scattered
reports sharp as beggars' whips, and said that the mayor
and the secretary did well, for such a rascal would bring
only God's vengeance on all Barania-Glova. And against
the woman old gossips began to say uncreated things.</p>

<p>It came about that Repa's well dried up. So Marysia
went for water to the well in front of the inn; and on the
way she heard boys say to one another, "There goes the
soldier's wife!" "Not the soldier's wife, but the devil's
wife!"</p>

<p>She went on without speaking a word; but she saw
how they made the sign of the cross. She took the jug
<span class="pagenum">[369]</span>
to go home, and there, before the inn, stood Shmul.
When he saw her, he took out the porcelain pipe which
hung at his beard, and called to her.</p>

<p>"Marysia!"</p>

<p>She stopped and inquired, "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Were you at the village court?" asked he.</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"You were with the priest?"</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"Were you at the mansion?"</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"Did you go to the chief?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"And you got nothing?"</p>

<p>She merely sighed, and Shmul continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, you are such fools that in all Barania-Glova
there is nothing more foolish. And what did you go
for?"</p>

<p>"Where was I to go?"</p>

<p>"Where?" answered the Jew, "and on what is the
contract? On paper; if there is no paper, there is no
contract; tear the paper, and that is enough."</p>

<p>"Oh, how you talk!" said she, "if I could have got
at that paper I should have torn it long ago."</p>

<p>"But don't you know that the secretary has the paper?
Well! I know that you can do much with him; he said
to me himself, 'Let Repa's wife come and ask me, and I,'
said he, 'will tear the paper, and that's the end of it.'"</p>

<p>Marysia said nothing, but took the jug by the ear and
went toward the brick house; meanwhile it had grown
dark out of doors.

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="topnote">ENDED MISFORTUNE.</p>

<p class="dropcap">THE Great Bear had gone down already, and the
triangle had risen, when the door squeaked in
Repa's cottage; his wife came in quietly. She entered
and stood as if fixed to the floor, for she thought that her
husband would be sleeping as usual in the inn; but he
was sitting on the box at the wall, with his fists resting
on his knees, and looking at the floor. The coals were
burning out in the chimney.</p>

<p>"Where hast thou been?" inquired Repa, gloomily.</p>

<p>Instead of answering, she fell on the floor, and lay before
his feet, with great weeping and sobbing. "Vavron!
Vavron!" cried she, "for thee it was that I yielded myself
to shame. He deceived me, then abused and put me
out. Vavron, have pity on me, at least thou, my heart!
Vavron! Vavron!"</p>

<p>Repa took his axe out of the box.</p>

<p>"No," said he, with a calm voice; "thy end has come
at last, poor woman. Take leave of this world now, for
thou shalt see it no more; thou wilt not sit in the cottage
any longer, poor woman; thou wilt lie in the churchyard&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked at him with terror.</p>

<p>"Dost wish to kill me?"</p>

<p>"Well, Marysia," said he, "do not lose time for nothing;
make the sign of the cross, and then will be the end;
thou wilt not even feel it, poor thing."</p>

<p>"Vavron, wilt thou, indeed?"
<span class="pagenum">[371]</span>
</p>

<p>"Lay thy head on the box."</p>

<p>"Vavron!"</p>

<p>"Lay thy head on the box!" cried he, with foam on
his lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake, save me! People! sa&mdash;"</p>

<p>A dull blow was heard, then a groan, and the blow of
a head against the floor; then a second blow, a fainter
groan; then a third, a fourth, a fifth, and a sixth blow.
On the floor gushed a stream of blood; the coals in the
chimney were quenched. A quiver passed through the
woman from head to foot; then her body stretched, and
was motionless.</p>

<p>Soon after a broad, bloody conflagration rent the darkness;
the buildings of the mansion were blazing.</p>

<p>EPILOGUE.</p>

<p>And now I will whisper something in your ear, reader.
They would not have taken Repa to the army. An
agreement like the one in the inn was not sufficient. But
you see peasants do not know these things; the "intelligence,"
thanks to neutrality also, not much! therefore Pan
Zolzik, who knew a little of this, calculated that in every
case the affair would drag on, and fear would throw the
woman into his arms.</p>

<p>And that great man was not mistaken. You ask what
happened to him? Repa, when he had set fire to the
buildings of the mansion, was going to take vengeance on
him, but at the cry of "Fire!" the whole village was up,
and Zolzik escaped.</p>

<p>He continues in his office of secretary in Barania-Glova,
and at present he has the hope of being chosen judge.
<span class="pagenum">[372]</span>
He has just finished reading "Barbara Ubryk," and hopes
that Panna Yadviga may press his hand any day under
the table.</p>

<p>Whether those hopes of the judgeship and the pressure
will be justified, the future will show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE ORGANIST OF PONIKLA.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">THE snow was dry, squeaking, and not over deep;
but Klen had long legs, therefore he walked briskly
over the road from Zagrabie to Ponikla. He went the
more briskly because a good frost was coming, and he
was dressed scantily in a short coat and a still shorter
sheepskin overcoat above it, in black trousers and thin,
patched boots. Besides, he had a hautboy in his hand; on
his head a cap lined with the wind; in his stomach a
couple of glasses of arrack; in his heart delight; and in
his soul many causes for the delight.</p>

<p>That morning he had signed a contract with Canon
Krayevski, as the future organist of Ponikla. Up to
that time he had strolled about like any wretched gypsy,
from inn to inn, from wedding to wedding, from fair to
fair, from festival to festival, seeking profit with his hautboy,
or on the organ, which he played better than any
organist in that region. Now he was to settle down at
last and have a fixed life beneath his own roof. A house,
a garden, a hundred and fifty rubles a year, other earnings
on occasions, a personal position, almost half spiritual, an
occupation in the service of God,&mdash;who would not respect
such a station?</p>

<p>Not long since any Matsek in Zagrabie, or Ponikla, if
settled on a few morgs of land, looked on Pan Klen as
a nobody; now people would take off their hats to him.
An organist and, moreover, in such an immense parish&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum">[376]</span>
was not a bundle of straw! Klen had been
sighing this long time for that position; but while old
Melnitski lived, it was not to be thought of. The old
man's fingers were stiff, and he played badly; but the
canon would not send him away for anything, since he
had been twenty years with him.</p>

<p>But when the "lysa" struck the old man so badly in
the pit of the heart that in three days he died, Pan Klen
did not hesitate to ask for the position, and the canon did
not hesitate to give it, for a better organist could not be
found in that region.</p>

<p>How such skill came to Pan Klen on the hautboy, the
organ, and various other instruments which he understood,
it was difficult to discover. He had not received
the gift from his father, for his father, a man of
Zagrabie, served during youth in the army, and did not
work in his old age at music; he twisted hemp ropes,
and played on no instrument beyond a tobacco-pipe,
which was always between his mustaches.</p>

<p>From childhood Klen did nothing but listen wherever
there was music. While a stripling, he went to "blow
the bellows" for Melnitski at Ponikla. Afterward, when
certain musicians came to Zagrabie, he ran away with
them. He strolled about whole years with that company.
God knows where he played, surely wherever it happened:
at fairs, weddings, and in churches; only when the company
broke up, or died, did he return to Zagrabie, as poor
as a church mouse, haggard, and living like a bird on a
branch. He continued to play, sometimes for the public,
sometimes for the Lord God.</p>

<p>And, though people reproached him with want of stability,
he became famous. They said of him in Zagrabie
and in Ponikla, "Klen, just Klen. But when he begins
to play it is no offence to the Lord, and it is a delight to
<span class="pagenum">[377]</span>
man!" Others said to him, "Fear God, Pan Klen, what
devil is sitting within thee?"</p>

<p>And in real fact some sort of devil was sitting in that
thin wretch with long legs. During the life of Melnitski,
whenever he took the old organist's place on great holidays
and festivals, he sometimes forgot himself thoroughly
at the organ. This would happen, especially in the
middle of mass, when people in the church were absorbed
in prayer, when the censers had sent incense
over the whole nave, and everything living was singing,
when Klen had let himself out, and the service, with the
ringing of great and little bells, with the odor of myrrh,
amber, and fragrant plants, with the gleaming of lights
and the glitter of the monstrance, had so elevated every
soul that the whole church seemed flying off on wings to
the sky. The canon, now raising, now lowering the
monstrance, closed his eyes in ecstasy, and Pan Klen did
the same in the choir; and it seemed to him that the
organ itself was playing; that voices from the tin pipes
rose like waves, flowed like rivers, rushed like torrents,
gushed like fountains, poured like rain; that they were
filling the whole church; that they were under the dome,
and before the altar, in the rolls of incense, in the light
of the sun, and in the souls of the people,&mdash;some awful
and majestic like thunder, others like the singing of
people, speaking in living words, still others sweet, fine,
like falling beads, or the trilling of nightingales. And
after mass, Pan Klen came down from the choir dazed,
with eyes staring, as if after sleep; but as a simple
man, he said, and thought, that he had tired himself
out. The canon in the sacristy put some money in
his hand, and some praise in his ear; then he went out
among the people, who were thronged around the church;
and there they raised their hats to him, though he
<span class="pagenum">[378]</span>
lived as a lodger in Zagrabie; and they admired him
beyond measure.</p>

<p>But Pan Klen went in front of the church not to hear,
"Hei! See! There goes Klen!" But he went to see
that which was dearest to him in Zagrabie, in Ponikla,
and in the whole world, Panna Olka, the daughter of the
tile-maker of Zagrabie. She fastened into his heart like
a wood-tick, with her eyes, which were like star-thistles,
with her bright face, and her lips red as cherries.</p>

<p>Pan Klen himself, during the rare moments in which
be looked on this world with sound judgment, and in
which seeing that the tile-maker would not give him his
daughter, thought that it would be better to let her go;
but he felt, with terror, that he could not let her go;
and with great alarm he repeated to himself, "Hei! she
has got in! Thou wilt not pull her out with pincers!"</p>

<p>For her it was surely that he stopped wandering about,
for her he lived; and when he played on the organ he
thought that she was listening, and therefore he played
better.</p>

<p>And she loving, to begin with, his "talent" for music,
loved him afterward for himself; and that Pan Klen
was for her the dearest of all, though he had a strange,
dark face, eyes that were looking somewhere else, a scant
coat, a still scanter overcoat, and legs as long and as
slim as the legs of a stork.</p>

<p>But "the father," the tile-maker, though he, too, carried
air in his pockets for the most part, was unwilling to
give Olka to Klen. "Any one will look at the girl," said
he; "why should such a fellow as Klen fix her fate?"
and he hardly let the man into the house, and sometimes
he would not let him in.</p>

<p>But when old Melnitski died, everything changed right
away.
<span class="pagenum">[379]</span>
</p>

<p>Klen, after signing the contract, went with all speed
to the tile-maker's.</p>

<p>"I do not say," said the tile-maker to him, "that something
must surely happen right away; but an organist
is not a tramp." And, inviting him into the house, he
treated him to arrack, and feasted him as a guest. And
when Olka came in, the father rejoiced with the young
people because Klen had become a man; he would have
his house, garden, and, next to the canon, would be the
great person in Ponikla.</p>

<p>So Klen had sat with them from midday till evening,
to his own great delight and to Olka's; and now he was
returning by the road to Ponikla, on squeaking snow
and in twilight.</p>

<p>It was preparing for frost; but what cared Pan Klen?
He merely went faster and faster; and, while going, he
thought of that day, thought of Olka, and he was warm.
A happier day in his life there had never been.</p>

<p>After an empty, treeless road, through frozen meadows
covered with snow, now red and now blue beneath the
sky, he carried his gladness like a lantern which he had
to light him in the dark. He remembered again and
again all that had happened: his conversation with
the canon; the signing of the contract; every word with
the tile-maker and Panna Olka. When they were alone
for a while she said to him, "It was all one to me! I
would have gone with you, Anton, without that, even beyond
the sea; but for father it is better in this way!"
He kissed her on the elbow with great gratitude, saying,
"God reward thee, Olka, for the ages of ages, amen!"
And now, when he recalled it, he was a little ashamed
of himself, for having kissed her on the elbow, and
for having said too little to her; for he felt that if
the tile-maker would have permitted, she would have
<span class="pagenum">[380]</span>
gone with him to the edge of the world. Such an honest
girl! And then she would have gone with him if necessary
along that empty road in the snow. "Oh, thou, my
pure gold!" thought Pan Klen, "since it is so, thou wilt
be a lady." Then he went still more swiftly, and the
snow squeaked more loudly.</p>

<p>Soon he began to think, "Such a woman will not
deceive a man." Then great gratitude mastered him.
And indeed if Olka had been there with him, he would
not have held out; he would have thrown his hautboy
on the ground, and pressed her to his bosom with all
the strength in his bones. He ought not to have acted
differently an hour earlier; but it is always so: wherever
a man has to do anything or say anything from the heart,
he "becomes a fool, and has a wooden tongue." It is
easier to play on the organ.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the golden and red stripes which were
shining on the western sky changed gradually into
golden ribbons and golden knots, and finally they vanished.
Darkness came; and the stars twinkled in the
heavens, looking sharply and dryly on the earth, as is
usual in winter. The frost grew severe, and began to
bite the ears of the future organist of Ponikla; so, knowing
the road perfectly, Pan Klen decided to cut across
the field, and reach his own house the more quickly.</p>

<p>After a while he seemed black on the level, snowy espanse,&mdash;tall,
sticking up ridiculously. It occurred to him
that to kill time he might play a little before his fingers
got stiff; and as he thought so he did. His voice sounded
strangely in the night and on that waste, as if he were
frightened a little by that white, melancholy plain; and
it sounded all the more strangely that Klen played the
most joyous things. He recollected that he had begun
to play and sing, after one and another glass at the tile-maker's,
<span class="pagenum">[381]</span>
that Olka accompanied him gladly with her
thin little voice. He wished now to play those same
songs, so he began with that with which she had begun:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i4">
   "Level, O God, the mountains with the valleys,
  </p>
  <p class="i4">
   Let them be very level!
  </p>
  <p class="i4">
   Bring, O God, my love,
  </p>
  <p class="i4">
   Bring him early!"
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But the song did not please the tile-maker, for it seemed
to him a "peasant song," and he commanded Klen to
sing a "noble song." Then they took up another, which
Olka had learned in Zagrabie:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i2">
   "Pan Ludwig went a hunting,
  </p>
  <p class="i2">
   He left Helunia like a picture.
  </p>
  <p class="i2">
   Pan Ludwig came home, the music was playing.
  </p>
  <p class="i2">
   The trumpeters trumpeting, Helunia was sleeping."
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>This was more to the taste of the tile-maker. But when
pleasure seized them they laughed most at the "Green
Pitcher." The lady in that song, before she laughed at
the end, cried and sang piteously for her broken pitcher:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i10">
   "My green pitcher,
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   Oh, the Pan broke it!"
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But the Pan falls to consoling her:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i6">
  "Quiet, Panna, weep not,
  </p>
  <p class="i6">
   I will pay thee for thy pitcher!"
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Olka prolonged as much as possible, "My gre-e-e-en
pitcher," and then laughed. Klen took his lips from
the hautboy, and answered her as the Pan, with a great
flourish:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i10">
   "Quiet, Panna, weep not&mdash;"
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And now, remembering in the night that gladness of
the daytime, he played to himself "My Green Pitcher,"
and smiled in addition, as much as his lips would allow,
<span class="pagenum">[382]</span>
employed as they were in blowing the hautboy. But
as the frost was violent, and his lips were freezing to
the mouthpiece of the instrument, and his fingers were
stiff going over the keys, he ceased to play and went on,
somewhat panting, and with his face in a mist which
rose from his breath.</p>

<p>After a time he got tired, for he had not counted on
this, that in fields snow lies more deeply than on a
beaten road, and that it is not easy to draw one's legs
out of it. Besides, in meadows in some places there are
hollows, made even by drifts through which one must
wade to the knee. Klen began to regret then that he
had left the road, for some wagon might have come along
on the way to Ponikla.</p>

<p>The stars twinkled more and more sharply; the frost
became more severe, but Pan Klen even sweated; still,
when the wind rose at moments, and blew toward the
river, he became very cold. He tried to play again, but
as he had to keep his mouth closed he tortured himself
all the more.</p>

<p>At last a feeling of loneliness seized him. Round
about it was so empty, silent, and remote that he was
wonder-stricken. In Ponikla a warm house was waiting
for him; but he preferred to think of Zagrabie, and said
to himself, "Olka is going to sleep; but there, praise be
to God, it is warm in the house." And at the thought
that it was warm and bright there for Olka, Pan Klen's
honest heart rejoiced all the more, the colder and darker
the way was for him.</p>

<p>The meadows ended at last, and then began pastures
grown over here and there with juniper. Pan Klen was
so tired now that a great desire seized him to sit down,
with his hautboy, under the first sheltered bush, and rest.
"But I shall freeze if I do so," thought he, and went on.
<span class="pagenum">[383]</span>
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, among junipers, as along fences, snow-drifts
form sometimes. Klen passed through a number
of these, and became so exhausted that finally he said to
himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will sit down. Unless I fall asleep I shall not
freeze; and to keep from sleeping, I will play again, 'My
Green Pitcher.'"</p>

<p>He sat down, played again, again the vanishing voice
of the hautboy was heard in the silence of night, and
over the snow. But Klen's eyelids stuck together more
and more, and the notes of the "Green Pitcher," growing
weaker, and gradually growing silent, were silent altogether
at last. Still he struggled against sleep; he was
conscious yet; he was thinking still of Olka; but at
the same time he felt himself in a greater desert, more
and more alone, as if forgotten; and wonderment seized
him that she was not there with him in that loneliness
and that night.</p>

<p>He murmured, "Olka! where art thou?"</p>

<p>And once more he spoke as if calling her,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Olka!"</p>

<p>The hautboy dropped from his stiffened hands.</p>

<p>Next morning the dawn shone on his sitting figure,
with the hautboy near his long legs, and his face was
blue, astonished as it were, and at the same time fixed in
listening to the last note of the song, "My Green
Pitcher."</p>

<h2>LUX IN TENEBRIS LUCET<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></h2>

<p class="dropcap">SOMETIMES in the autumn, especially in November,
such wet and gloomy days come that life becomes
repulsive even to a healthy man. From the time that
Kamionka had fallen ill and stopped work on his statue
of "Compassion," bad weather had caused him more suffering
than sickness itself. Every morning, when he
had dragged his body out of bed, he rubbed the great
sweating window of his studio and looked upward, in the
hope that he would see some little strip of blue sky; but
every morning disappointment awaited him. An oppressive
lead-colored mist hung over the earth; rain was not
falling, still the paving stones in the yard looked like
sponges soaked in liquid; everything was wet, slippery,
penetrated through and through with water, single drops
of which falling from the eave-troughs sounded with a
peculiar and desperate monotony, as if measuring that
sluggish time of sadness.</p>

<p>The window of the studio looked out on a courtyard,
which was bounded by a garden. The grass beyond the
paling was green yet with a sort of sickly greenness, in
which were death and decay; but the trees with their
yellow leaves, and their branches black from dampness
and also effaced by the mist somewhat, seemed dead altogether.
From among those trees came every evening the
<span class="pagenum">[388]</span>
cawing of crows, which had flown in from the forests and
fields to the city for winter quarters, and which, with a
great clattering of wings, settled down for the night
on the branches.</p>

<p>The studio in days like this was as gloomy as the
place for bones in a cemetery. Marble and plaster of
Paris need azure. In that leaden light the whiteness
had something sad in it; figures in dark terra-cotta lost
all precision of lines and changed into indefinite forms
almost terrible.</p>

<p>Dirt and disorder increased the gloom of the studio.
On the floor was a thick layer of dust, formed from pieces
of dry terra-cotta ground fine from trampling; to this was
added mud from the street. The naked walls were
merely ornamented here and there with models of hands
and feet in plaster of Paris; near the window hung a
small mirror, above it a horse skull, and a bouquet of
artificial flowers quite black from dust.</p>

<p>In the corner was a bed covered with a quilt, old and
rumpled; near the bed a commode; on this an iron candlestick.</p>

<p>Kamionka, through reasons of economy, kept no separate
lodging-place; he slept in the studio. Usually the
bed was concealed by a screen, but the screen had been
removed to let the sick man look out more easily through
the window near the foot of his bed, and see if the weather
were clearing. Another and larger window placed in the
ceiling of the studio was covered with dust on the outside
to such a degree that even on bright days a gray and
gloomy light passed in through it.</p>

<p>But the weather did not clear. After a number of
days of darkness the clouds settled down thoroughly, the
air was penetrated to the last degree with a watery, heavy
mist, and became still darker. Kamionka, who so far had
<span class="pagenum">[389]</span>
lain on the bed in his clothing, felt worse, so he undressed
and lay down for good.</p>

<p>Speaking precisely, he was not so much sick with any
definite disease as he was bowed down, dissatisfied,
exhausted, and sad in general. His weakness cut the
feet from beneath him. He had no wish to die; but
neither did he feel strength to live.</p>

<p>The long hours of the dismal day seemed longer because
he had no one for company. His wife had been dead
twenty years; his relatives lived in another part of the
country; and he did not live with his colleagues. In
recent years every acquaintance had withdrawn from him
because of his ever-increasing sorrow. At first, his disposition
amused people; but later, when he grew stranger
and stranger, when every jest roused a permanent feeling
of offence in him, even those nearest the man broke off
all relations with him.</p>

<p>People took it ill of him also that with age he had
grown devout, and his sincerity was suspected. Malicious
tongues said that he sat in church only to receive orders
from churches through his relations with priests. This
was not true. His piety did not flow from deep and
calm faith, perhaps, but it was unselfish.</p>

<p>What, however, lent a show of truth to the critics, was
the penuriousness which increased more and more in
Kamionka. For a number of years he had lived in his
studio to lessen expenses; he lived God knows on what
food, and injured his health so much that at last his face
was as yellow and transparent as if moulded from wax.
He avoided people also for this, lest some one might
ask of him sometime a favor.</p>

<p>In general, he was a man of broken character, embittered
and uncommonly unhappy. Still his was not a
common nature at bottom, for even his faults had artistic
<span class="pagenum">[390]</span>
traits which were special to him. Those who judged that
with his penuriousness he must have collected a considerable
property were mistaken. In truth, Kamionka was
poor; for all that he owned he had spent on engravings of
which he had whole portfolios at the bottom of his bureau;
these, from time to time, he counted with the greed and
the care of a usurer counting his money. He concealed
this taste the more carefully, perhaps, because it had grown
on the basis of great misfortune and deep feeling.</p>

<p>On a time, a year more or less after the death of his
wife, he saw in an antiquarian's collection an old engraving,
representing Armida. In the face of this Armida he
detected a likeness to the face of his dead one. He
bought the engraving immediately, and from that time
on he sought copperplates, those at first representing
only Armida, then, as the fancy increased, every other.</p>

<p>Those who have lost persons much loved by them
are forced to attach life to something, or they could not
exist. As to Kamionka, no one would have thought that
this rather aged original and egotist had ever loved his
wife more than he loved his existence. It is likely,
moreover, that had she not died, life would have flowed
on for him more broadly, more calmly, and more in human
fashion. Be that as it may, love in Kamionka survived
his happy days, his youth, and even his talent.</p>

<p>His piety, which in the course of years turned into
a custom resting on the preservation of external forms,
flowed from this love of his also. Kamionka, without
being a man of deep faith, began after the death of his
wife to pray for the dead one, since this seemed to him
the only thing he could do for her, and thus a kind of
thread kept them together.</p>

<p>Natures apparently cold are often able to love with
great power and persistently. After the death of his wife,
<span class="pagenum">[391]</span>
Kamionka's whole life and all the thoughts that he had,
entwined themselves around her memory, and drew food
from it, just as plant parasites draw food from the tree on
which they are growing. But from memories of that sort
the human plant can gain nothing but poisonous juices
made up of sorrow and enormous vexation, hence
Kamionka too poisoned himself, grew distorted, went to
nothing.</p>

<p>Had he not been an artist, he would not have survived,
perhaps, but he was saved by his calling. After the
death of his wife, he began to make a monument to
her. It is useless for the living to say that it is all one
to the dead in what graves they are lying. Kamionka
wished that it should be beautiful there for his Zosia, and
he worked with his heart no less than his hands. This
was why he did not become insane the first half year, but
grew inured to despair.</p>

<p>The man was out of joint and unhappy; but art saved
the artist. From that moment, Kamionka existed by
virtue of his calling. People who look at statues and
images in galleries do not divine that artists may serve
their art honestly or dishonestly. In this regard,
Kamionka was without reproach. He had no wings at
his shoulders,&mdash;he possessed only talent somewhat above
the common, and perhaps, therefore, art could not fill out
his life, or give him recompense for all losses; but he
respected it deeply, and was ever sincere with regard to it.
During the long years of his labor, he had never tempted
it, and had never committed injustice regarding it, either in
view of fame, profit, praise, or blame. He always did that
which he felt. During his happy years, when he lived
like other men, he was able to say things touching art
which were quite uncommon, and after that, when people
began to turn aside from him, he thought frequently of
<span class="pagenum">[392]</span>
this art in his lonely studio, in a manner which was lofty
and honest.</p>

<p>He felt greatly abandoned; but in this there was no
cause for wonder. People's relations must have a certain
medium measure in virtue of which the exceptionally
unhappy are cut off from life. For that very reason,
they are covered with as much strangeness and as many
faults as a stone thrown up from a torrent is covered with
moss, when it ceases to rub against others. Now when
Kamionka was ill, no living soul looked into his studio,
with the exception of a servant-woman, who came twice
a day to make tea for him, and serve it. At every visit,
her advice was to call in a doctor; but he, fearing the
outlay, would not give his consent to this.</p>

<p>At last he became very weak; perhaps for the reason
that he took nothing into his mouth except tea. But he
had no desire then for anything, either for eating, or
work, or life. His thoughts were as if withered like
those leaves on which he looked through the window;
and those thoughts of his answered perfectly to that
autumn, to that drizzle, to that leaden darkness. There
are no worse moments in life than those in which a man
feels that he has accomplished what he had to accomplish,
that he has outlived that which he had to outlive; and that
nothing more in this world belongs to him. Kamionka
had lived almost fifteen years in continual dread that his
talent would exhaust itself; now he was sure that it had,
and he thought with bitterness that even art was deserting
him. He felt therewith weariness and exhaustion in
every bone of his body. He did not expect a sudden
death; but he did not believe in a return to health. In
general, there was not one spark of hope in him.</p>

<p>If he wished for anything it was only that the weather
would brighten, that the sun would shine into his studio.
<span class="pagenum">[393]</span>
For he thought that in that case he might gain consolation.
He had always been specially sensitive to
slush and to darkness; such days had always deepened
his sadness and depression, and what must it now be
when that "hopeless time," as Kamionka called it, was
joined to his sickness!</p>

<p>Every evening when the servant brought tea he inquired:
"Is it not clearing on the edge of the sky
somewhere?"</p>

<p>"There is such a mist," answered she, "that one man
cannot see another."</p>

<p>Kamionka, hearing this answer, closed his eyes and
lay motionless a long time.</p>

<p>In the yard it was always quiet save that drops of rain
pattered evenly and monotonously in the gutters.</p>

<p>About three o'clock one afternoon it was so dark that
Kamionka was forced to light a candle. And he was so
weak that he did this with no little difficulty. Before he
reached for a match he meditated a long time; then he
extended his arm lazily; the thinness of this arm, evident
through the shirt sleeve, filled him, as a sculptor, with
repugnance and bitterness. When he had lighted the
candle he rested again, without moving, till the evening
arrival of the servant, listening with closed eyes to the
drops sounding in the gutter.</p>

<p>His studio looked strange then. The flame of the candle
lighted the bed with Kamionka lying on it, and came
to a focus in a shining point on his forehead with its skin
dry and yellow as if polished. The rest of the room was
sunk in darkness, which grew denser each moment. But
as it grew dark outside the statues became more rosy and
acquired life. The flame of the candle now sank, now
rose, and in that quivering light the statues too seemed
to sink and rise exactly as if they were rising on tiptoe
<span class="pagenum">[394]</span>
to gain a better look at the face of the sculptor, and be
convinced that their creator was living.</p>

<p>And indeed there was a certain immobility of death in
that countenance. But at times the blue lips of the sick
man stirred with a slight movement, as if in prayer, or as
if he were cursing his loneliness and those dreadful drops
of moisture which measured with even monotony the
hours of his sickness.</p>

<p>One evening the woman came a little drunk, therefore
more talkative than usual.</p>

<p>"There is so much work on my head that I can barely
look in twice a day," said she; "if you would call a religious,
a sister of charity costs nothing, and she would
be better for a sick man."</p>

<p>This advice pleased Kamionka, but he, like others who
are afflicted, had the habit of always opposing whatever
advice people gave him; so he would not agree.</p>

<p>But after the woman had gone he began to think thus:
"A sister of charity costs nothing, but what aid she
might give, and what comfort!" Kamionka, like every
sick man left to himself, experienced much suffering and
struggled with a thousand petty miseries, which annoyed
him as much as they made him impatient. More than
once he lay for whole hours with a crooked neck before
he would move to arrange his own pillow. Often in the
night he was cold and would have given God knows
what for a cup of tea; but if it was difficult to light a
candle, how was he to think of making tea? A sister of
charity would do all this with the mild readiness usual to
those sisters. Oh, how much easier to be sick if one had
their assistance!</p>

<p>The poor man came at last to think of sickness under
such conditions as something desirable and pleasant, and
he wondered in his soul if the like happiness were accessible
to him even.
<span class="pagenum">[395]</span>
</p>

<p>It seemed, too, that if a sister were to come and bring
with her a little joyousness and solace to the studio, perhaps
the weather would clear up outside, and the sounding
drops of water cease to pursue him.</p>

<p>He regretted at last that he had not accepted the advice
of the woman immediately. Night was approaching,
long and gloomy, and the woman was to look in at him
only next morning. He understood now that that night
would be for him more grievous than all the nights which
had ever preceded it.</p>

<p>Then he thought what a Lazarus he was&mdash;and in distinction
to his present wretchedness his former happy
years stood before his eyes as if living. And as a moment
before the thought of the sister of charity, so now the
remembrance of those years joined itself in the same wonderful
manner in his weakened brain, with the understanding
of sun and light and fair weather.</p>

<p>He began to think of his dead one, and to speak with
her, as he had the habit of doing when he was ill. At
last he wearied himself, felt that he was growing weak,
and fell asleep.</p>

<p>The candle was burning slowly. Its flame from being
rosy was blue, then it gleamed brightly a number of
times, and died. Deep darkness embraced the studio.</p>

<p>But meanwhile in the yard drops of rain fell as evenly
and gloomily as if by means of them darkness and grief
were distilled through all nature.</p>

<p>Kamionka slept long and lightly, but all at once he
woke with a certain wonderful impression that something
uncommon was happening in the studio. The
morning dawn was in the world. The marbles and
plasters of Paris began to grow white. The broad Venetian
window opposite his bed was penetrated more and
more with pale light.
<span class="pagenum">[396]</span>
</p>

<p>In this light Kamionka saw a figure sitting at his
bedside.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes widely and looked at the figure: it
was that of a sister of charity.</p>

<p>She was sitting motionless, turned slightly toward the
window, with her head inclined. Her hands were laid
on her knees,&mdash;and she seemed to be praying. The
sick man could not see her face, but he saw plainly her
white head-dress and the dark outline of her rather frail
shoulders.</p>

<p>His heart began to beat somewhat nervously, and these
questions flew through his head,&mdash;</p>

<p>"When could the servant have brought in this sister
of charity; and how did she enter?"</p>

<p>Next he thought that perhaps something seemed to
him thus because he was weak, then he closed his eyes.
But after a while he opened them again.</p>

<p>The sister of charity was sitting on the same spot,
motionless as if sunk in prayer.</p>

<p>A wonderful feeling composed of fear and delight
began to raise the hair on the head of the sick man.
Something attracted his eyes with incomprehensible
power to that figure. It seemed to him that he had
seen it somewhere, but where and when he could not
remember. An irresistible desire to see her face seized
him, but the white head-dress concealed it. Kamionka,
without knowing why, did not dare to speak or to move,
or hardly to breathe. He felt only that the sensation
of fear and delight was possessing him more and more
powerfully, and he asked with astonishment, "What is
this?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was perfect day. And what a marvellous
morning that must be outside! Suddenly without
any transition there came into the studio a light as
<span class="pagenum">[397]</span>
powerful, bright, and joyous as if it were springtime and
May.</p>

<p>Waves of golden glitter, rising like a flood, began to
fill the room, to overflow it so mightily that the marbles
were drowned and dissolved in that brightness; the walls
were covered with it and then disappeared altogether.
Kamionka found himself as it were in some bright
space without boundary.</p>

<p>Then he noticed that the covering on the head of the
sister began to lose its white stiffness, that it trembled at
the edges, melted, dissolved like clear mist, and changed
into light.</p>

<p>The sister turned her face slowly toward the sick man,
and then the deserted sufferer saw in the bright aureole
the well-known hundred times beloved features of his
dead wife.</p>

<p>He sprang from the bed, and from his breast came a
cry, in which all his years of sorrow, tears, suffering, and
despair were united,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Zosia! Zosia!"</p>

<p>And seizing her, he drew her to him; she threw her
arms around his neck.</p>

<p>More and more light came into the room.</p>

<p>"Thou didst not forget me," said she at last, "hence I
have come. I obtained an easy death for thee."</p>

<p>Kamionka held her in his arms all the time, as if in
fear that the blessed vision would vanish from him
together with the light.</p>

<p>"I am ready to die," answered he, "if thou wilt stay
with me."</p>

<p>She smiled at him with her angelic smile, and taking
one arm from his neck she pointed downward, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou art dead already. Look!"
<span class="pagenum">[398]</span>
</p>

<p>He looked in the direction of her hand, and behold,
under their feet, he saw through the window in the ceiling
of his own gloomy and lonely studio, and there on
the bed lay his own corpse, with widely opened mouth,
which in the yellow face seemed a dark hole as it were.</p>

<p>And he looked on that emaciated body as something
foreign. But after a while all began to vanish from his
eyes, for that surrounding brightness, as if urged by a
wind from beyond this world, went off somewhere into
infinity.</p>

<h2>ON THE BRIGHT SHORE.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE artist was sitting beside Pani Elzen in an open
carriage; on the front seat were her sons the twin
brothers, Romulus and Remus. He was partly conversing
with the lady, partly thinking of a question which
required prompt decision, and partly looking at the sea.
There was something to look at. They were driving from
Nice toward Monte Carlo by the so-called Old Cornice;
that is, by a road along impending cliffs, high above the
water. On the left, the view was hidden by naked towering
rocks, which were gray, with a rosy pearl tinge;
on the right was the blue Mediterranean, which appeared
to lie immensely low down, thus producing the
effect of an abyss and of boundlessness. From the height
on which they were moving, the small fishing boats
seemed like white spots, so that frequently it was difficult
to distinguish a distant sail from a seamew circling
above the water.</p>

<p>Pani Elzen had placed her hand on Svirski's arm; her
face was that of a woman delighted and forgetful of
what she is doing; she gazed with dreamy eyes over the
mirror of the sea.</p>

<p>Svirski felt the touch; a quiver of delight ran through
him, and he thought that if at that moment Romulus and
Remus had not been in front of them, he might have
<span class="pagenum">[402]</span>
placed his arm around the young woman, perhaps, and
pressed her to his bosom.</p>

<p>But straightway a certain fear seized him at the thought
that hesitation would then have an end, and the question
be settled.</p>

<p>"Stop the carriage, please," said Pani Elzen.</p>

<p>Svirski stopped the carriage, and they were silent
a moment.</p>

<p>"How quiet it is here after the bustle of Monte Carlo!"
said the young widow.</p>

<p>"I hear only music," answered the artist; "perhaps the
bands are playing on the iron-clads in Villa Franca."</p>

<p>In fact, from below came at intervals muffled sounds of
music, borne thither by the same breeze which brought
the odor of orange-blossoms and heliotropes. Beneath
them were visible the roofs of villas, dotting the shore,
and almost hidden in groves of eucalyptus, while round
about were large white spots formed by blossoming
almond-trees, and rosy spots made by peach blossoms.
Lower down was the dark-blue sunlit bay of Villa Franca,
with crowds of great ships.</p>

<p>The life seething there presented a marvellous contrast
to the deep deadness of the naked, barren mountains,
above which extended the sky, cloudless and so transparent
that it was monotonous and glassy. Everything
was dimmed and belittled amid that calm greatness;
the carriage with its occupants seemed, as it were, a kind
of beetle, clinging to the cliffs along which it was
climbing to the summit with insolence.</p>

<p>"Here life ends altogether," said Svirski, looking at
the naked cliffs.</p>

<p>Pani Elzen leaned more heavily on his shoulder and
answered with a drowsy, drawling voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But it seems to me that here life begins."
<span class="pagenum">[403]</span>
</p>

<p>After a moment Svirski answered with a certain emotion,
"Perhaps you are right."</p>

<p>And he looked with an inquiring glance at her. Pani
Elzen raised her eyes to him in answer, but dropped them
quickly, as if confused, and, though her two sons were
sitting on the front seat of the carriage, she looked at
that moment like a maiden whose eyes could not endure
the first ray of love. After that, both were silent;
while from below came snatches of music.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, far away at sea, at the very entrance to the
bay, appeared a dark pillar of smoke, and the quiet of
the company was broken by Remus, who sprang up,
and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tiens! le 'Fohmidable'!"</p>

<p>Pani Elzen cast a glance of displeasure at her younger
son. She knew the value of that moment, in which every
next word might weigh in her fate decisively.</p>

<p>"Remus," said she, "will you be quiet?"</p>

<p>"But, mamma, it is the 'Fohmidable'!"
<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
</p>

<p>"What an unendurable boy!"</p>

<p>"Pouhquoi?"
<a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
</p>

<p>"He is a duhen
<a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
[duren, a simpleton]; but this time he is
right," called out Romulus, quickly; "yesterday we were
at Villa Franca,"&mdash;here he turned to Svirski. "You saw
us go on velocipedes; they told us there that the whole
squadron had arrived except the 'Fohmidable,' which was
due to-day."</p>

<p>To this Remus answered with a strong accent on every
last syllable,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou art a duhen,
<a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
thyself!"</p>

<p>The boys fell to punching each other with their elbows.
<span class="pagenum">[404]</span>
Pani Elzen, knowing how Svirski disliked her sons' style
of speech, and generally the manner in which they were
reared, commanded them to be silent.</p>

<p>"I have told you and Pan Kresovich," said she, "not
to speak among yourselves in any language but Polish."</p>

<p>Kresovich was a student from Z&uuml;rich, with incipient
lung disease; Pani Elzen had found him on the Riviera,
and engaged him as tutor for her sons, after her acquaintance
with Svirski, and especially after a public declaration
of the malicious and wealthy Pan Vyadrovski, that
respectable houses had ceased to rear their sons as commercial
travellers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the unlucky "Formidable" had spoiled the
temper of the sensitive artist. After a time, the carriage,
gritting along the stones, moved on.</p>

<p>"You took their part, and I brought them," said Pani
Elzen, with a sweet voice; "you are too kind to the boys.
But one should be here during moonlight. Would you
like to come to-night?"</p>

<p>"I like to come always; but to-night there will be no
moon, and of course your dinner will end late."</p>

<p>"That is true; but let me know when the next full
moon comes. It is a pity that I did not ask you alone to
this dinner&mdash; With a full moon, it must be beautiful
here, though on these heights I have always a throbbing
of the heart. If you could see how it throbs at this
moment; but look at my pulse, you can see it even
through the glove."</p>

<p>She turned her palm, which was confined so tightly in
the Danish glove as to be turned almost into a tube, and
stretched it to Svirski. He took the hand in both of his,
and looked at it.</p>

<p>"No," said he; "I cannot see the pulse clearly, but
perhaps I can hear it."
<span class="pagenum">[405]</span>
</p>

<p>And, inclining his head, he put his ear to the buttons of
her glove; for a moment he pressed the glove firmly to his
face, then touched it lightly with his lips, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"In years of childhood I was able sometimes to catch
a bird, and its heart beat just this way. The beating
here is just as in a captured bird!"</p>

<p>She laughed, almost with melancholy, and repeated,
"'As in a captured bird.' But what did you do with the
captured birds?"</p>

<p>"I grew attached to them, immensely. But they
always flew away."</p>

<p>"Bad birds."</p>

<p>"And thus my life arranged itself," continued the
artist, with emotion; "I have sought in vain for something
which would consent to stay with me, till at last
I have lost even hope."</p>

<p>"Do not lose that; have confidence," answered Pani
Elzen.</p>

<p>Svirski thought then to himself, that, since the affair
had begun so long before, there was need to end it, and
let that come which God permits. He felt at the moment
like a man who closes his eyes and ears with his fingers;
but he felt also that it was needful to act thus, and that
there was no time for hesitation.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be better for you to walk a little,"
said he. "The carriage will follow, and, besides, we shall
be able to speak more in freedom."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered Pani Elzen, with a resigned
voice.</p>

<p>Svirski punched the driver with his cane; the carriage
halted; and they stepped out. Romulus and Remus ran
forward at once, and only stopped, when some tens of
yards ahead, to look from above at the houses in Eze, and
roll stones into the olive-groves growing below. Svirski
<span class="pagenum">[406]</span>
and Pani Elzen were left alone; but that day some fatality
seemed to weigh on them, for before they could use the
moment they saw that a horseman, coming from the
direction of Monaco, had stopped near Romulus and
Remus. Behind him was a groom dressed in the
English manner.</p>

<p>"That is De Sinten," said Pani Elzen, with impatience.</p>

<p>"Yes, I recognize him."</p>

<p>In fact, they saw next moment before them a horse's
head, and above it the equine face of young De Sinten.
He hesitated whether or not to salute and go on, but
considering evidently that if they had wanted to be alone
they would not have brought the boys, he sprang from
the horse, and, beckoning to the groom, began to greet
them.</p>

<p>"Good-day," answered Pani Elzen, somewhat dryly.
"Is this your hour?"</p>

<p>"It is. Mornings, I shoot at pigeons with Wilkis Bey,
so I cannot ride lest I disturb my pulse. I am now seven
pigeons ahead of him. Do you know that the 'Formidable'
comes to Villa Franca to-day, and to-morrow the
admiral will give a ball on deck?"</p>

<p>"We saw it arrive."</p>

<p>"I was just going to Villa Franca to see one of the
officers whom I know, but it is late. If you permit, I will
go with you to Monte Carlo."</p>

<p>Pani Elzen nodded, and they went on together. De
Sinten, since he was a horseman by nature, began at
once to speak of the "hunter," on which he had come.</p>

<p>"I bought him from Waxdorf," said he. "Waxdorf
lost at <i>trente et quarante</i>, and needed money. He bet
<i>inverse</i>, and hit on a lucky series, but afterward fortune
changed." Here he turned to the horse. "He is of pure
Irish blood, and I will give my neck that there is not a
<span class="pagenum">[407]</span>
better hunter on the whole Cornice; but it is difficult to
mount him."</p>

<p>"Is he vicious?" inquired Svirski.</p>

<p>"Once you are in the saddle, he is like a child. He
is used to me; but you, for instance, could not mount
him."</p>

<p>At this Svirski, who in matters of sport was childishly
vain, asked at once,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"Do not try, especially here above the precipice!"
cried Pani Elzen.</p>

<p>But Svirski had his hand on the horse's shoulder
already, and a twinkle later was in the saddle, without
the least resistance from the horse; perhaps the beast
was not at all vicious, and understood, too, that on the
edge of a cliff above a precipice it was better not to
indulge in pranks.</p>

<p>The rider and the horse disappeared at a slow gallop
along the turn of the road.</p>

<p>"He rides very well," said De Sinten; "but he will
spoil my horse's feet. There is no road here for riding."</p>

<p>"The horse has turned out perfectly gentle," said
Pani Elzen.</p>

<p>"I am greatly pleased at this, for here an accident
happens easily&mdash;and I was a little afraid."</p>

<p>On his face, however, there was a certain concern;
first, because what he had said about the horse's stubbornness
at mounting seemed like untruth, and, second,
because there existed a secret dislike between him and
Svirski. De Sinten had not, it is true, at any time
serious designs touching Pani Elzen; but he would have
preferred that no one should oppose him in such designs
as he had. Besides, some weeks before, he and Svirski
had engaged in a rather lively talk. De Sinten, who
<span class="pagenum">[408]</span>
was an irrepressible aristocrat, had declared, during a
dinner at Pani Elzen's, that to his thinking man begins
only at the baron. To this Svirski, in a moment of
ill-humor, answered with an inquiry,&mdash;</p>

<p>"In what direction?" (up or down).</p>

<p>De Sinten took this reply so seriously that he sought
advice of Vyadrovski and Councillor Kladzki as to how
he ought to act, and learned, with genuine astonishment,
that Svirski had a coronet on his shield. A
knowledge of the artist's uncommon strength, and his
skill in shooting, had a soothing effect, perhaps, on the
baron's nerves; it suffices that the negotiation had no
result, except to leave in the hearts of both men an
indefinite dislike. From the time that Pani Elzen
seemed to incline decidedly toward Svirski, the dislike
had become quite Platonic.</p>

<p>But this dislike was more decided in the artist than
in De Sinten. No one had supposed that the affair of the
widow and the artist could end in marriage; but among
their acquaintances people had begun to speak of
Svirski's feelings toward Pani Elzen, and he had a suspicion
that De Sinten and his party were ridiculing him
as a man of simple mind. They, it is true, did not
betray themselves by the slightest word on any occasion;
but in Svirski the conviction was glimmering that his
suspicion was justified, and this pained him, specially out
of regard for Pani Elzen.</p>

<p>He was glad, therefore, that on this occasion, thanks
to the horse's gentleness, De Sinten seemed a person
who, without reason, told things which were untrue;
hence he said, on returning,&mdash;</p>

<p>"A good horse, and specially good because he is as
tame as a sheep."</p>

<p>He dismounted, and they walked on together, three of
<span class="pagenum">[409]</span>
them, and even five, for Romulus and Remus followed
closely. Pani Elzen, to spite De Sinten, and perhaps
from a wish to be rid of him, turned the conversation to
pictures and art in general, of which the young sportsman
had not the faintest idea. But he began to retail gossip
from the Casino, and congratulated the young woman on
her luck of yesterday; she listened with constraint, being
ashamed, in presence of Svirski, of having taken part in
play. Her vexation was increased when Romulus called
out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mamma, but did you not tell us that you never
play; will you give us a louis d'or for that?"</p>

<p>"I sought Councillor Kladzki, wishing to invite him
to dinner to-day; when I found him he and I played a
little," answered she, as if speaking to no one in particular.</p>

<p>"Give us a louis d'or apiece," repeated Romulus.</p>

<p>"Or buy us a little roulette table," added Remus.</p>

<p>"Do not annoy me! Let us go to the carriage," said
she, turning to Svirski. Then she took farewell of De
Sinten.</p>

<p>"At seven, did you say?" inquired he.</p>

<p>"At seven."</p>

<p>They parted; and after a while Svirski found himself
again at the side of the beautiful widow. This time
they occupied the front seat, since they wished to look at
the setting sun.</p>

<p>"People say that Monte Carlo is more sheltered than
Mentone," remarked the widow; "but, oh, how it bores
me at times! That endless noise, that movement, those
acquaintances which one must make, willingly or unwillingly.
Sometimes I wish to rush away and spend the
rest of the winter in some quiet corner where I should
see only those whom I see with pleasure&mdash; What place
do you like best?"
<span class="pagenum">[410]</span>
</p>

<p>"I like San Raphael greatly; the pines there go down
to the sea."</p>

<p>"True, but it is far from Nice," answered she, in a low
voice; "and your studio is in Nice."</p>

<p>A moment of silence followed, after which Pani
Elzen inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But Antibes?"</p>

<p>"True! I forgot Antibes."</p>

<p>"Besides, it is so near Nice. After dinner you will
stop with me a little and talk of a place where one might
escape from society."</p>

<p>"Do you wish really to flee from people?"</p>

<p>"Let us talk sincerely; I detect doubt in your question.
You suspect me of speaking as I do so as to appear
better, or at least less shallow, than I am&mdash; And you
have a right to your suspicion, since you see me always
in the whirl of society. But my answer is this: We
move frequently with a force not our own, because once
we were impelled in a given direction, and endure now
in spite of us the results of previous life. As to me, it
may be that this is because of the weakness of woman,
who has not strength to free herself without the aid
of another&mdash;I confess this&mdash; But that fact does not
save one from yearning greatly and sincerely for some
quiet corner and a calmer life. Let people say what
they choose, we women are like climbing plants, which
creep along the ground when they cannot grow upward.
For this reason, people are often mistaken, thinking that
we creep of our own choice. By creeping, I understand
empty society life, without lofty thought. But how am
I, for example, to defend myself against this! Some
one begs permission to present an acquaintance; the
man presented makes a visit, after that a second, a
third, and a tenth&mdash;what am I to do? Not permit
<span class="pagenum">[411]</span>
the presentation? Of course I permit it; even for this
reason, that the more people I receive, the more indifferent
I am to each, and the more each is prevented from
occupying an exceptional position."</p>

<p>"You are right," said Svirski.</p>

<p>"But do you see that in this way is created that
current of social life from which I cannot tear myself
with my own strength, and which wearies and tortures
me to such a degree that at times I could scream out
from pain."</p>

<p>"I believe you."</p>

<p>"You ought to believe me; but believe also that I
am better and less vain than I seem. When doubts
come to you, or when people speak ill of me, think
to yourself: She must have her good side. If you
will not think thus, I shall be very unhappy."</p>

<p>"I give you my word, that I wish always to think
the best of you."</p>

<p>"And you should think so," said she, with a soft
voice; "for though everything which is good in me
were more stifled than it is, it would bloom out afresh
were I near you, so much depends on those with whom
one associates&mdash; I should like to say something; but
I am afraid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say it."</p>

<p>"You will not think me fanciful, or even worse? I am
not fanciful; I talk like a sober-minded woman who states
only that which is real, and looks at things coolly. At
your side, for example, I should regain my former spirit,
as calm and collected as when I was a girl; and now I
am almost a grandmother&mdash;thirty-five years of age."</p>

<p>Svirski looked at her with a clear face, very nearly
in love; then he raised her hand slowly to his lips, and
said,
<span class="pagenum">[412]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! In comparison with me you are really a child.
Forty-eight is my age&mdash;and that is my picture!" said
he, pointing to the setting sun.</p>

<p>She began to gaze at that light which was reflected in
her shining eyes, and said, in a low voice, as if to
herself, "Great, marvellous, beloved sun!"</p>

<p>Then silence followed. The calm ruddy light was
falling on the faces of both. The sun was setting in
genuine majesty and grandeur. Beneath it, slender clouds,
recently blown asunder, took on the forms of palm lilies,
and were gleaming like gold. The sea along the shore
was sunk in shadow; farther out, in open spaces, lay
a boundless light. In the valley, the motionless cypress-trees
were outlined sharply on the lily-colored background
of the sky.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE guests invited by Pani Elzen assembled at the
H&ocirc;tel de Paris at seven o'clock. A separate room
and also a smaller one adjoining, in which coffee was to
be served, had been assigned for the dinner. The lady
had issued invitations to a dinner "without ceremony;"
but the gentlemen, knowing what to understand by this,
came in dress-coats and white neckties. Pani Elzen
appeared in a pale rose-colored, low-necked dress with a
great fold in the back extending from the top of the
bodice to the bottom of the skirt. She looked fresh
and young. She had a finely cut face, and a small head,
by which principally she had charmed Svirski at the
beginning of their more intimate acquaintance. Her
plump shoulders had, especially at the edge of the dress,
the appearance and transparency of mother-of-pearl; but
<span class="pagenum">[413]</span>
her arms from the elbow to the wrist were slightly reddened,
seemingly rough; that, however, merely heightened
the impression of their nakedness. In general, she was
radiant with gladness, good-humor, and that brilliancy
which women have when they are happy.</p>

<p>Among the invited guests, besides Svirski and De
Sinten, came the old councillor, Kladzki, with his nephew
Sigismund, a young man of no great social experience,
but forward, whose eyes gleamed at Pani Elzen too expressively,
and who did not know how to conceal what he
felt; next, was Prince Valerian Porzetski, a man forty
years of age, bald, with a large head coming to a point
at the top like that of an Aztec; Pan Vyadrovski, rich
and sarcastic, the owner of oil wells in Galicia, a lover
of art and a dilettante; finally, Kresovich, a student, the
temporary tutor of Romulus and Remus, a man whom
Pani Elzen invited because Svirski liked his fanatical
face.</p>

<p>The point with the lady was always, and more especially
on that day, to have an "intellectual" salon, as
she expressed it. She could not, however, turn the conversation
at first from local gossip and the happenings of
the Casino, which Vyadrovski called the "Slav world,"&mdash;more
of Slav speech was heard there, he said, than any
other. Vyadrovski's life in Monte Carlo was spent
generally in ridiculing his fellow-countrymen and the
younger Slav brothers. That was a hobby which he
mounted gladly, and galloped without rest. So he began
at once to relate how, two days before, there remained
in the "Cercle de la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e," at six in the morning,
seven persons, all of Slav blood.</p>

<p>"We are born thus," said he, turning to the hostess.
"In other countries people count: Nine, ten, eleven,
twelve, etc.; but every real Slav says, in spite of himself:
<span class="pagenum">[414]</span>
Nine, ten, knave, queen, king&mdash; Yes; to the Cornice
comes the cream of our society, and here they make
cheese of it."</p>

<p>Prince Valerian, of peaked head, announced now, in
the tone of a man who is discovering new truths, that
every passion which exceeds the measure is ruinous,
but that to the "Cercle de la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e" belonged
many foreigners of distinction with whom it was useful
and worth while to make acquaintance. It was possible
to serve one's country everywhere. For instance, he had
met there three days before an Englishman, a friend of
Chamberlain, who had inquired of him touching our
country; and he described on a visiting-card the economic
and political condition in general, and the social aspirations
in particular. Beyond doubt, the card would go,
if not to Chamberlain, who is not here, to Salisbury, and
that would be better. Probably, also, he would meet
Salisbury at the ball which the French admiral is to
give, and during which the whole "Formidable" would
be illuminated <i>&agrave; giorno</i> by electricity.</p>

<p>Kresovich, who was not only a consumptive, but a
man of another style of thought, a man who hated that
society in which he was forced to appear as the tutor of
Romulus and Remus, snorted ironically and as venomously
as a hyena when he heard of this visiting-card.
Pani Elzen, wishing to turn attention from him,
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But here people are putting forward the wonders of
electricity. I have heard that the whole road from Nice
to Marseilles will be lighted by electricity."</p>

<p>"An engineer, Ducloz, drew up such a plan," said
Svirski; "but he died two months ago. He was such
a fanatical electrician that very likely he desired in
his will to have his grave lighted by electricity."
<span class="pagenum">[415]</span>
</p>

<p>"Then," said Vyadrovski, "he should have on his
tomb the inscription, O Lord, grant him eternal rest, and
may electric light shine on him for the ages of ages.
Amen!"</p>

<p>But Kladzki, the old councillor, attacked Vyadrovski,
and said that he was trifling with grave subjects which
were beyond witticism; then he attacked the whole Riviera.
"All," said he, "from people to things, is simply
a show and a jest. Everywhere they pretend to be
'marquises, counts, and viscounts;' but they are really
on the watch to snatch away handkerchiefs. As to
comfort, it is the same. In my office at Veprkoviski,
five rooms could be put, each as large as the little den
which they have given me in the hotel. The doctors
have sent me to Nice for fresh air; but, as God lives, that
<i>Promenade des Anglais</i> has the vile odor of a lodging-house
in Cracow; my nephew Sigismund can testify to
this."</p>

<p>But Sigismund's eyes were crawling out of his head as
he looked at Pani Elzen's arms; and he did not hear what
his uncle was saying.</p>

<p>"Remove to Bordighieri," said Svirski. "Italian dirt
is artistic at least; while French dirt is vile."</p>

<p>"Still you are living in Nice?"</p>

<p>"I am, because I could not find a studio beyond Ventimiglia.
Were I to move, I should prefer Antibes, on
the other side."</p>

<p>When he had said this, he looked at Pani Elzen. At
the corners of her mouth a faint smile appeared, and
she dropped her eyes. Next moment, however, wishing,
as it seemed, to turn conversation toward art, she spoke
of Rumpelmayer's exhibition, and of the new pictures
which she had seen two days before, and which the
French journalist, Krauss, called impressionist-decadent.
<span class="pagenum">[416]</span>
At this Vyadrovski raised his fork, and inquired, in the
tones of a Pyrrho,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are the decadents in general?"</p>

<p>"From a certain point of view, they are people who ask
of art itself the various sauces with which it is served,"
answered Svirski.</p>

<p>Prince Valerian, however, felt wounded by what old
Kladzki had said of "marquises, counts, and viscounts."</p>

<p>"Even the adventurers who come here," said he,
"are high-class adventurers, and are not satisfied with
snatching the handkerchief from your nose. Here one
meets corsairs of grand style. But besides them come
all who are richest, or most exquisite in the world.
Here financial magnates meet people of high blood on
equal footing; this is especially good, for let the world
refine itself! Pan Kladzki should read such a book
as the 'Idylle Tragique,' and be convinced that, in addition
to suspected people, the highest social spheres
come here also&mdash;precisely such as we shall meet on the
'Formidable,' which for that occasion is to be lighted
<i>&agrave; giorno</i> by electricity."</p>

<p>Prince Valerian forgot evidently that he had given information
already about the lighting of the "Formidable."
In fact, it was not the subject of conversation just then;
and immediately they began to talk of the "Idylle Tragique."
Young Kladzki, mentioning the hero of that
novel, said: "It was good enough for such a fellow, since
he was dunce enough to give up a woman for a friend; he,
Kladzki, would not do that for ten friends, he would not
for his born brother, since that was his property, and his
own." But Vyadrovski interrupted him; for French
novels, with which he was carried away, were another
hobby of his on which he cultivated a higher school of
galloping over authors and their productions.
<span class="pagenum">[417]</span>
</p>

<p>"But what enrages me to the utmost," said he, "is
this sale of painted foxes for foxes of genuine color. If
those gentlemen are realists, let them write the truth.
Have you turned attention to their heroines? A tragedy
begins, very well! the lady struggles with herself,
'wrestles dreadfully' through half a volume; but, as God
lives, I know from the first page what will be, how all
will end. What a bore, and how often has it happened
before this! I accept those heroines, and their place in
literature too; but let no one sell them to me for tragic
vestals. What is the tragedy for me, when I know that
such rent souls have had lovers before the tragedy, and
will have others after it! They will 'struggle' again as
they have done already, and everything will end in the
same fashion. What a lie, what a loss of moral sense,
of truth, what a turning of heads! And to think that
among us this stuff is read, this merchandise accepted as
genuine; that these drawing-room farces are taken as
tragedies, and received as important! In this way, all
difference between an honest woman and a harlot is
effaced; and a society position is created for puppets
without a nest of their own. This French gilding
suits our puppets, and they exhibit themselves under
the authority of such and such authors. There is no
principle in it, no character, no feeling of duty, no moral
sense; there is nothing in it but false aspirations, and
false posing for a psychological riddle."</p>

<p>Vyadrovski was too intelligent not to understand that
by speaking in this fashion he was throwing stones at Pani
Elzen; but, being thoroughly malevolent, he spoke so
purposely. Pani Elzen listened to his words with all
the greater vexation, because there was truth in them.
Svirski was burning with a wish to answer rudely; but
he knew that he could not take Vyadrovski's words as
<span class="pagenum">[418]</span>
having any application, so he chose to give a new turn
to the conversation.</p>

<p>"In French novels, something else has always struck
me," said he; "namely, this, that it is a world of barren
women. In other countries, when two people fall
in love, either according to law or outside of it, the
result is a child; but in French novels, no one has children.
How strange this is! It does not seem to occur
to those gentlemen who write novels that love cannot
remain without results."</p>

<p>"As the society, so the literature," said old Kladzki.
"It is known that in France population is decreasing.
In the upper society a child&mdash;is an exception!"</p>

<p>"Mais c'est plus commode et plus el&eacute;gant," answered
De Sinten.</p>

<p>"The literature of sated idlers who must disappear
with it," said Kresovich, who had snorted previously.</p>

<p>"What do you say?" inquired De Sinten.</p>

<p>The student turned his resolute face to the baron, "I
say the literature of sated idlers!"</p>

<p>Prince Valerian discovered America a second time.
"Every class has its beauties and its pleasures," said he.
"I have two passions: politics and photography."</p>

<p>But the dinner was nearing its end; a quarter of an
hour later all passed into the adjoining room for coffee.
It seemed to Pani Elzen that a certain negligence ought
to please Svirski, as he was an artist and somewhat of
a gypsy, so she lighted a very slender cigarette, and,
leaning on the arm of her easy-chair, crossed her legs.
But, being of comparatively low stature, and a trifle
broad in the hips, she raised her dress too high by this
posture. Young Kladzki dropped his match immediately,
and looked for it so long that his uncle punched
him slightly in the side, and whispered angrily,
<span class="pagenum">[419]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of; where are you?"</p>

<p>The young man straightened himself and said in a
whisper, "That is what I do not know."</p>

<p>Pani Elzen knew from experience that even well-bred
men, when they can take some advantage, become rude
in presence of women, especially if those women are unprotected.
This time she had not observed young
Kladzki's movement; but when she saw the unrestrained
and almost cynical smile with which he answered his
uncle, she felt convinced that he was talking of her.
And in her heart she had a contempt for all that society
except Svirski and Kresovich, the tutor, whom she suspected
of being in love with her, notwithstanding his
hatred for women of her circle.</p>

<p>But that evening Vyadrovski brought her almost to
a nervous attack; for it seemed as though for what he
had eaten and drunk, he had undertaken to poison every
spoonful of her coffee, and every moment of her time.
He spoke generally, and as it were objectively, of women,
without crossing the bounds of politeness, but at the
bottom of his words there was not only cynicism, but a
completeness of allusion to Pani Elzen's character and
social position, which was simply offensive, and to her,
immensely disagreeable, especially before Svirski, who
both suffered and was impatient.</p>

<p>A stone fell from her heart, therefore, when at last the
guests went away and only the artist remained.</p>

<p>"Aa!" exclaimed she, breathing deeply, "I feel the
beginning of neuralgia, and I know not myself what is
happening to me."</p>

<p>"They tormented you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;and more than tormented!"</p>

<p>"Why do you invite them?"</p>

<p>She approached him feverishly, as if losing control of
her nerves, and said,
<span class="pagenum">[420]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sit quietly, do not move! I cannot tell&mdash;perhaps
I destroy myself in your eyes; but I need this as a medicine.
Oh, yes! To remain a moment in this way at the
side of an honest man&mdash;a moment in this way!"</p>

<p>All at once her eyelids were bedewed abundantly; but
she put her finger to her lips time after time as a sign
not to speak, and to let her remain silent.</p>

<p>But Svirski was moved, since he had always grown soft
as wax at sight of woman's tears. The confidence which
she showed him, conquered the man and filled his heart
with tenderness. He understood that the decisive moment
had come, so, putting his arm around her, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stay with me forever; give me a right to yourself."</p>

<p>Pani Elzen made no answer; great tears were flowing
from her eyes, but they were silent tears.</p>

<p>"Be mine," repeated Svirski.</p>

<p>She put her hand on his other shoulder, and nestled up
to him as a child to its mother.</p>

<p>Svirski, bending over, kissed her forehead, then he fell
to kissing tears from her eyes, and gradually the flame
seized him; in a moment he caught her in his athletic
arms, pressed her with all his strength to his breast, and
sought her lips with his lips. But she defended herself.</p>

<p>"No! no!" said she, with panting voice. "Thou art
not like others&mdash;later! No! no! Have pity!"</p>

<p>Svirski held her in his embrace; she bent backward;
at that moment he was just like other men; happily
for Pani Elzen, there was a knock at the door. They
sprang apart.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" inquired Pani Elzen, impatiently.</p>

<p>The gloomy head of Kresovich appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said he, in a broken voice. "Romulus is
coughing, and perhaps he has a fever; I thought it
necessary to inform you."
<span class="pagenum">[421]</span>
</p>

<p>Svirski stood up.</p>

<p>"Should you not send for a doctor?"</p>

<p>Pani Elzen had recovered her usual self-possession
already.</p>

<p>"I thank you," said she; "if necessary, we will send
from the hotel; but first I must see the boy. Thank
you! but I must go&mdash;so till to-morrow! Thank you!"</p>

<p>And she stretched her hand to him, which Svirski
raised to his lips.</p>

<p>"Till to-morrow&mdash;and every day. Till we meet
again!"</p>

<p>Pani Elzen, when alone with Kresovich, looked at him
inquiringly, and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is the trouble with Romulus?"</p>

<p>The student grew paler than usual, and answered almost
rudely,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" asked she, with a frown.</p>

<p>"It means&mdash;dismiss me, otherwise&mdash;I shall go
mad!" And turning he walked out. Pani Elzen stood
for a moment with flashes of anger in her eyes and with
wrinkled brows; but her forehead smoothed gradually.
She was thirty-five years of age, it is true, but here was
a fresh proof that no man had thus far been able to
resist her. Next moment she went to the mirror as if
to seek in it confirmation of that thought.</p>

<p>Svirski returned to Nice in a car without other passengers;
he raised to his face from moment to moment a
hand which retained the odor of heliotrope. He felt disturbed,
but also happy; and the blood was rushing to his
head, for his nostrils were inhaling Pani Elzen's favorite
perfume.

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">NEXT morning the artist woke with a heavy head, as
if after a night spent in drinking, and, moreover,
with great alarm in his heart. When light falls in the
daytime on theatrical decorations, that which seemed
magic the night before looks a daub. In life, the
same thing takes place. Nothing unexpected had happened
to Svirski. He knew that he had been going
toward this, that he must go to it; but now, when the
latch had fallen, he had a feeling of incomprehensible
fear. He understood that as late as yesterday he might
have withdrawn; and regret took possession of him. In
vain did he repeat to himself that it was not the time
for reasoning. Various reproaches which formerly he
had made to himself regarding Pani Elzen, and above all
regarding marriage with her, returned to him with renewed
force. The voice which formerly had whispered
unceasingly in his ear, "Do not be a fool!" began to cry,
"Thou art a fool!" And he could not put down this
voice either by arguments, or by repeating, "It has happened!"
for reason told him that the folly had become a
fact, and that the cause lay in his own weakness.</p>

<p>At that thought shame possessed him. For had he
been young, he would have had youth as his excuse.
Had he made the acquaintance of that lady on the
Riviera, had he heard nothing of her before, his ignorance
of her character and her past would have justified
him; but he had met her before. He had seen her
rarely, it is true; but he had heard enough, when people
in Warsaw spoke more of her than of any one else. She
was called there the "Wonder woman," and humorists
<span class="pagenum">[423]</span>
had sharpened their wits on her, as a knife is sharpened
on a grindstone; this, however, had not prevented men
from crowding to her salon. Women, though less favorable,
received her also out of regard for the remoter or
nearer relationship which connected her with the society
of the city. Some, especially those whose interest it was
that opinion in general should not be too strict, even
rose in defence of the beautiful widow. Others, less
yielding, still did not dare to close their doors against
her, for the reason that they had not courage to take
this course earlier than others. Once a local comedy
writer, on hearing some one reckon Pani Elzen among
the "demi-monde," answered, "She is neither the half
world nor the whole world, she is rather three-quarters."</p>

<p>But since everything in great cities is effaced, Pani
Elzen's position was effaced in time. Her friends said,
"We cannot, of course, ask too much of Helena; but
she has her own really good traits." And, without
noting it, they conceded greater freedom to her than
to other women. At one time it was stated by some one
that for a period before the death of her husband, she
had not lived with him; at another it was whispered
that she was rearing Romulus and Remus like jesters, or
that she had no thought for them of any kind; but to
such malevolent statements attention would have been
turned only if Pani Elzen had been a woman of less
beauty and less wealth, or had kept a less hospitable
house. Among themselves, men had not been backward
in speaking of the "Wonder woman,"&mdash;not even those
who were in love with her; they talked of her through
jealousy; only those were silent who, at the given
moment, were fortunate, or who wished to pass as more
fortunate than others. In general, malice was such that
<span class="pagenum">[424]</span>
according to report Pani Helena had one man for the
winter in the city, and another for the summer.</p>

<p>Svirski knew all this. He knew it better than other
men, for an acquaintance of his in Warsaw, a certain
Pani Bronich, a near relative of the beautiful widow,
told him of an event painful to Pani Elzen, which ended
in a grievous illness. "What that poor Helena suffered,
God alone knows; but perhaps in His mercy He brought
it about before the time, so as to save her from greater
moral suffering." Svirski, however, admitted that this
"event before the time" might be a pure invention; still
it was less possible for him than for others to be deceived
as to Pani Elzen's past, and least of all was it possible for
him to believe that she was a woman to whom he could
confide his peace with safety.</p>

<p>Still, all these facts roused his curiosity, and drew him
to her specially. When he heard of her presence at
Monte Carlo, he desired, with intentions not entirely
honest, perhaps, to approach her and know her better.
He wanted also, as an artist, to analyze the charm exercised
on men by that woman, who was talked of everywhere.</p>

<p>But he met only disenchantment from the first. She
was beautiful and physically attractive; but he saw that
she lacked goodness and kindness toward people. In her
eyes a man was of value only in so far as he was useful
to her in some way. Beyond that, she was as indifferent
as a stone. Svirski did not note in her either any
feeling for mental life, art, or literature. She took from
them what she needed, giving nothing in return. He,
as an artist and a man of thought, understood perfectly
that such a relation betrays at the basis of things a
nature which, despite all elegant semblances, is vain, rude,
and barbarous. But to him women of that kind had
<span class="pagenum">[425]</span>
been known from of old. He knew that they impose on
the world by a certain force which position and a mighty
merciless egotism confers. Of that sort of creature, it
had been said often in his presence, "A cold, but clever
woman." He had always thought of such persons without
respect and with contempt. They were to his mind
devoid not only of lofty spiritual finish, but of intellect.
Beasts have the mind which snatches everything for
itself, and leaves nothing to others.</p>

<p>In Pani Elzen, as in Romulus and Remus, he saw a
type in which there is no culture below the surface; beneath
is an unknown plebeian depth. Beyond that, he
was struck by her cosmopolitan character. She was like
a coin, so worn that one could hardly discover to what
country it belonged. And he was penetrated by disgust,
not only as a man of qualities opposite to hers, but also
as a man of a society really higher, and who knew that in
England, for instance, or France or Italy, people would
not deny the soil from which they had grown and would
look with contempt on cosmopolitan twigs without a
root.</p>

<p>Vyadrovski was right when he said that Romulus and
Remus were reared like commercial travellers, or like
porters in a great hotel. It was known universally that
Pani Elzen's father possessed a title, that was true; but
her grandfather was the manager of an estate; and Svirski,
who had a high sense of humor, thought it ridiculous
that these great-grandsons of a farm bailiff not only did
not know Polish well, but like genuine Parisians could
not pronounce <i>r</i>. They offended him too in his character
of an artist. The boys were good-looking, even beautiful;
Svirski, however, felt, with his subtle artistic sense,
that in those two bird skulls, which resembled each other,
and in those faces, the beauty was not inherited through a
<span class="pagenum">[426]</span>
series of generations, but was as if by accident, by
physical chance, which had come from their twinship.
In vain did he say to himself that their mother too was
beautiful; the feeling adhered to him always that that
beauty did not belong to the mother or the sons, and that
in this, as in the question of property, they were parvenus.
It was only after long intercourse with them that this
impression was weakened.</p>

<p>Pani Elzen, from the beginning of their acquaintance,
commenced to prefer Svirski and to attract him. He
was of more value to her than the rest of her acquaintances;
he bore a good family name; he had considerable
property and a great reputation. He lacked youth, it is
true; but Pani Elzen herself was thirty-five years of age,
and his form of a Hercules might take the place of
youth. Finally, for a woman who had been mentioned
without respect, to marry him meant the recovery of
honor and position. She might suspect him of other
inclinations and a fickle disposition; but he possessed
kindness and&mdash;like every artist&mdash;a certain basis of
simplicity in his soul; hence, Pani Elzen thought herself
able to bend him to her will. In the end of ends she was
influenced not by calculation only, but by this too, that
as he let himself be attracted, he attracted her. At last
she said to herself that she loved him, and she even
believed that she did.</p>

<p>With him that happened which happens to many, even
perfectly intelligent people. His reason ceased to act
when his inclinations were roused, or, worse still, it entered
their service; instead of striving to conquer, it
undertook to find arguments to justify them. In this
fashion Svirski, who knew and understood every weak
point, began to make excuses, twisting, mollifying, explaining.
"It is true," thought he, "that neither her nature
<span class="pagenum">[427]</span>
nor her conduct, so far, give guarantees; but who can say
that she is not tortured by her present life, that she is not
yearning with all her soul for another? In her action
there is undoubtedly much coquetry; but again who will
say that she has not developed that coquetry because she
has fallen in love with me sincerely? To imagine that a
person, even filled with faults and failings, has no good
side, is childish. What a medley is the human soul!
There is merely need of proper conditions to develop the
good side, and the bad will disappear. Pani Elzen has
passed her first youth. What stupidity to suppose that
no voice in her is calling for calm, rest, honor, and healing.
And just for these reasons perhaps a woman like her
values more than others an honest man, who would make
her feel certain of all things." This last thought seemed
to him uncommonly profound and appropriate. Formerly
sound judgment had declared that Pani Elzen wanted to
catch him, but now he answered, "She is right; we may
say of any woman, even one of the most ideal character,
who wishes to unite herself to a man whom she loves, that
she wants to catch him." As to the future, the hope also
of children quieted him. He thought that he would have
something to love, and she would be obliged to break
with vain, social life, for she would not have time for it;
and before children could grow up, her youth would
have passed; after that her house would attract her more
than society. Finally, he said, "In every case life must
arrange itself; before old age comes I shall live a number
of years with an interesting and beautiful woman, near
whom every week day will seem a festival."</p>

<p>And those "few years" became in fact the main charm
for him. There was something humiliating for Pani Elzen
in this, that he feared no extraordinary event for the single
reason that her youth, and therefore possibilities, must
<span class="pagenum">[428]</span>
soon pass. He did not confess this to himself, though
it was the basis of his consolation; and he deceived
himself, as is ever the case with people in whom reason
has become the pander of their wishes.</p>

<p>And now, after the event of the previous evening, he
woke up with immense alarm and disgust. He could not
avoid thinking of two things: first, that if any man had
told him a month before that he would propose to Pani
Elzen, he would have thought that man an idiot;
second, that the charm of relations with her which lay in
uncertainty, in unfinished words, in the mutual divining
of glances and thoughts, in the deferred confessions and in
mutual attractions, was greater than that which flowed
from the present condition. For Svirski it had been
more agreeable to prepare the engagement than to be
engaged; now he was thinking that if in the same
proportion it would be less agreeable to become a husband
than to be an affianced, deuce take his fate. At
moments the feeling that he was bound, that he had
no escape, that, whether he wished or not, he must take
Pani Elzen with Romulus and Remus into his life-boat
seemed to him simply unendurable. Not wishing then
as a man of honor to curse Pani Elzen, he cursed Romulus
and Remus, with their lisping, their bird-like, narrow
heads and bird-like skulls.</p>

<p>"I have had my cares, but really I have been as
free as a bird, and I could put my whole soul into my
pictures," said he to himself; "now, Satan knows how it
will be!" And the cares of an artist, which he felt at
that moment, spoiled his good-humor, though they turned
his thoughts in another direction. Pani Elzen and the
whole marriage question receded into the second place;
and into the first came his picture, "Sleep and Death,"
on which he had been working for a number of months,
<span class="pagenum">[429]</span>
and to which he attributed immense importance. This
picture was a protest against the accepted idea of death.
Frequently, while talking with artists, Svirski had been
indignant at Christianity because it had brought into life
and art the representation of death as a skeleton. That
seemed to him the greatest injustice. The Greeks had
imagined Thanatos
<a name="FNanchor_1_14" id="FNanchor_1_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
as a winged genius; that was correct.
What can be more disgusting and frightful than a
skeleton? If death be represented in that way, it should
not be by Christians, who conceive death as a return to
new life. According to Svirski, the present idea was born
in the gloomy German soul which created Gothic architecture,&mdash;solemn
and majestic, but as gloomy as if the
church were a passage, not to the glories of heaven, but to
underground gulfs. Svirski had marvelled always that
the Renaissance had not recreated the symbol of death.
Indeed, if Death had not always been silent, and had desired
to complain, it would have said, "Why do people
depict me as a skeleton? A skeleton is just what I have
no wish to be, and will not be!" In Svirski's picture the
genius of Sleep was delivering, mildly and quietly, the body
of a maiden to the genius of Death, who, bending down,
extinguished in silence the flame of a lamp burning at
her head.</p>

<p>Svirski when painting had said to himself, "Oh, what
wonderful silence there is here!" and he wanted that
silence to appear from the lines, the form, the expression,
and the color. He thought also that if he could convey
that feeling, and if the picture could interpret itself, the
work would be both new and uncommon. He had another
object also: following the general current of the time, he
had convinced himself that painting should avoid literary
ideas; but he understood that there was an immense
<span class="pagenum">[430]</span>
difference between renouncing literary ideas, and a passionless
reflection of the external world as is shown in photographic
plates. Form, color, stain&mdash;and nothing more!
as if the duty of an artist were to destroy in himself the
thinking essence! He recollected that whenever he had
seen pictures by English artists, for example, he had been
impressed, first of all, by the mental elevation of those
artists. It was evident from their canvases that they
were masters of a lofty mental culture, greatly developed
intellects, thinking deeply, often even learned. In Poles,
on the contrary, he saw always something which was
directly the opposite. With the exception of a few, or
at best of a small number, the generality was composed
of men capable, but lacking thought, men of uncommonly
small development, and devoid of all culture. They lived,
nourished somewhat by crumbs of doctrines falling from
the French table, and crumbs which had lost much of their
savor. These artists did not admit for a moment that it
was possible to think out anything original touching art,
and especially to produce original creations in a Polish
style. To Svirski, it was clear, also, that a doctrine which
enjoins absence of thought must please their hearts. To
bear the title of artist, and at the same time be mentally a
minor, is convenient. To read, know, think&mdash;deuce take
such toil!</p>

<p>Svirski thought that if even a landscape is simply a
state of soul, that soul should be capable not only of the
moods of a Matsek (a peasant), but should be subtle, sensitive,
developed, and espanded. He had quarrelled about
this with his comrades, and had discussed with them
passionately. "I do not require you," said he, "to paint
as well as the French, the English, or the Spanish&mdash; I
demand that you paint better! Above all, that you paint
in your own style; whoso does not strive for this should
<span class="pagenum">[431]</span>
make copper kettles." He showed, therefore, that if a
picture represents a stack of hay, or hens scratching in a
yard, or a potato field, or horses at pasture, or a corner
of sleeping water in a pond, there should, above all, be a
soul in it; hence he put into his pictures as much of his
own self as he could, and besides he "confessed himself"
in other pictures, the last of which was to be Hypnos and
Thanatos (Sleep and Death).</p>

<p>The two geniuses were almost finished; but he had no
success with the head of the maiden. Svirski understood
that she must be not only beautiful, but possess great individuality.
Models came who were really good, but not
sufficiently individual. Madame Lageat, at whose house
the artist had taken his studio, and who was an old acquaintance,
had promised to find him one, but the work
advanced slowly. Some new model was to appear that
morning; but she had not come, though it was eleven
o'clock.</p>

<p>All this, combined with his yesterday's proposal, caused
Svirski to be in doubt touching not only his own peace of
mind, but his artistic future in general, and his picture
in particular. Hypnos seemed to him at that moment
somewhat heavy, Thanatos somewhat stupid. Finally,
he thought that since he could not work, he would better
stroll to the shore, where a sight of the sea might clear
mind and soul.</p>

<p>Just at the moment when he was ready to go, the bell
sounded in the entrance, and next appeared in the studio
two Scottish plaids, two heads of hair, and the two bird
faces of Romulus and Remus; after them came Kresovich,
paler than usual and gloomier than ever.</p>

<p>"Good-day, sir! Good-day, sir!" cried the two boys.
"Mamma sends these roses and invites you to lunch."</p>

<p>While speaking, they shook bunches of tea and moss
<span class="pagenum">[432]</span>
roses, then handed them to Svirski, and began to run
about and look at the studio. They wondered especially
at the sketches representing naked bodies, and were
stopped by them, for they stood before these sketches,
and, punching each other with their elbows, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tiens!"</p>

<p>"Regarde!"</p>

<p>Svirski, who was angered by this, looked at his watch
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we are to be in time for lunch, we must go at once."
He took his hat, and they went out. There were no carriages
near the studio, so they walked. The artist passed
on with Kresovich, and inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, how are your pupils?"</p>

<p>Kresovich, turning to him his malignant, sneering face,
answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My pupils? Oh, nothing! They are as healthy as
fish, and are comfortable in their Scottish dresses. There
will be fun with them; but not for me."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"Because I am going to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked Svirski, with astonishment. "I
knew nothing of this; no one mentioned it. I am sorry!"</p>

<p>"They are not sorry," answered Kresovich.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they do not understand."</p>

<p>"They will never understand. Neither to-day, nor at
any time in their lives! Never!"</p>

<p>"I hope that you are mistaken," said Svirski, dryly;
"but in every case it is unpleasant for me to hear this."</p>

<p>"Yes!" continued the student, as if speaking to himself.
"A pity, but a pity for time lost. What do they
care for me, or I for them? It is even better that they
should be as they will be. A man who wishes to sow
wheat must plough in the grass; and the weaker it is, the
<span class="pagenum">[433]</span>
easier it is to plough it in. Much might be said of this
matter; but it is not worth while, especially not for me.
The microbes are eating me, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Consumption has never threatened you. Before Pani
Elzen asked you to teach, she questioned the doctor about
your health&mdash;and you should not wonder at that, for she
was anxious about her children. The doctor assured her
that there was no danger."</p>

<p>"Of course not. I have discovered a certain remedy
against microbes."</p>

<p>"What is the remedy?"</p>

<p>"It will be announced in the papers. Such discoveries
as that are never hidden under a bushel."</p>

<p>Svirski glanced at Kresovich, as if to convince himself
that the man was not speaking in a fever; meanwhile
they reached the station, which was swarming with
people.</p>

<p>The visitors at Nice were going as usual in the morning
to Monte Carlo. At the moment when Svirski was buying
a ticket, Vyadrovski saw him.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said he, coming up; "you are going
to the Mountain?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Have you a ticket?"</p>

<p>"I have a monthly one. The train will be crowded."</p>

<p>"We can stand in a passage."</p>

<p>"This is a genuine Exodus, is it not? And each
one carries his mite to the widow. Good-morning, Pan
Kresovich! What say you of life in this place? Make
some remark from the point of view of your party."</p>

<p>Kresovich blinked as if unable to understand what was
asked of him, then answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I enroll myself in the party of the silent."</p>

<p>"I know, I know!&mdash;a strong party: it is either silent
or explosive," and he laughed.
<span class="pagenum">[434]</span>
</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bell rang, and there was need of
haste. From the platform came the call, "En voiture!
en voiture!" The next moment Svirski, Kresovich,
Vyadrovski, and the two boys were in the passage of a
car.</p>

<p>"With my sciatica this is pleasant!" said Vyadrovski.
"See what is going on. Useless to think of a seat. A
regular migration of nations!"</p>

<p>Not only the seats, but the passages were crowded
with people of every nationality. Poles, Russians, English,
French, Germans, all going with a rush to break the
bank, which daily repulsed and broke them, as a cliff
jutting out from the shore breaks a wave of the sea.
Women were crowding up to the windows,&mdash;women from
whom came the odor of iris and heliotrope. The sun shone
on the artificial flowers in their hats, on satin, on lace, on
false and genuine diamond ear-rings, on jet glittering like
armor on projecting bosoms increased with india-rubber,
on blackened brows, and on faces covered with powder or
rouge, and excited with the hope of amusement and play.
The most practised eye could not distinguish the demi-monde
who pretended to be women of society, from
women of society who pretended to be of the demi-monde.
Men with violets in their buttonholes examined that
crowd of women with inquiring and insolent gaze, inspecting
their dresses, their faces, their arms, and their
hips, with as cool minuteness as if they were inspecting,
for example, objects set out for sale. There was in that
throng a kind of disorder of the market-place, and a
species of haste. One moment the train rushed into the
darkness of tunnels, again the sun glittered in the windows,
the sky, the sea, palm groves, olive groves, villas, the
white almond-trees, and a moment later night embraced
all again. Station appeared after station. New crowds
<span class="pagenum">[435]</span>
thronged into the cars, elegant, exquisite, hurrying on, as
it were, to a great, glad festival.</p>

<p>"What a true picture of a breakneck life!" said
Vyadrovski.</p>

<p>"What is this true picture?"</p>

<p>"This train. I might philosophize till lunch-time; but
since I prefer to philosophize after lunch, perhaps you
would consent to lunch with me?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," answered Svirski; "I am invited by Pani
Elzen."</p>

<p>"In that case I withdraw!" And he smiled.</p>

<p>The supposition that Svirski was to marry Pani Elzen
had not entered his head for an instant. He felt even
certain that the artist was concerned in the same way as
others; but being an admirer of artists in general, and of
Svirski in particular, he felt glad that Svirski was beating
his opponents.</p>

<p>"I represent property," thought he; "Prince Valerian
a title; young Kladzki youth; and De Sinten the world
of fashionable fools. All these, especially here, possess
no small value, and still the Wonder woman took Svirski.
She is surely a person of taste." And looking at the
artist he began to mutter, "Jo triumpe, tu moraris aureos
currus&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you say?" inquired Svirski, who had not
heard because of the noise of the train.</p>

<p>"Nothing! A hiccough from Horace. I will say that
since you refuse me, I will give a breakfast of condolence
to myself, De Sinten, Prince Valerian, and Kladzki."</p>

<p>"Indeed! why do you wish to condole?" asked Svirski,
pushing forward suddenly, and looking into his eyes
almost threateningly.</p>

<p>"For the loss of your society," answered Vyadrovski,
coolly. "But, my dear sir, what cause have you in mind?"
<span class="pagenum">[436]</span>
</p>

<p>Svirski shut his lips and gave no answer; but he
thought, "His cap burns the head of a criminal. Were
I to marry any ordinary girl of the country, the idea
would never have come to my head that any man could
have me in mind when speaking with irony and malice."</p>

<p>Pani Elzen, freshened, young, and comely, was waiting
for them at the station. It was evident that she had
come only the moment before, for she breathed hurriedly,
and there was a flush on her face which might
be taken for emotion. When she gave Svirski both
hands at greeting, Vyadrovski thought,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, he has beaten us all by seven lengths. She
seems really in love."</p>

<p>And he glanced at her almost favorably. In a white
flannel robe, with sailor collar, and with gleaming eyes,
she seemed to him, in spite of slight traces of powder on
her face, younger and more enchanting than ever. For a
moment he was sorry that he was not the happy man
whom she had come to greet, and he thought that the
method by which he had sought her favor, through relying
on the utterance of stinging words, was stupid.
But he comforted himself with the thought of how he
would sneer at De Sinten and the other "distanced men."</p>

<p>After the greeting, Svirski thanked her for the roses;
and she listened with a certain vexation, glancing momentarily
at Vyadrovski, as if ashamed that he was a witness
of those thanks.</p>

<p>On his part, Vyadrovski understood that he would do
better to leave them. But all went together again in a
lift up the mountain on which was the Casino and the
garden. On the way, Pani Elzen recovered self-control
thoroughly.</p>

<p>"To lunch at once! to lunch!" said she, joyously. "I
have an appetite like a whale!"
<span class="pagenum">[437]</span>
</p>

<p>Vyadrovski muttered to himself that he would like,
God knows, to be Jonah; but he did not say this aloud,
thinking that were Svirski to take him by the collar and
throw him out of the lift, as he deserved for his joke, he
would fall too far.</p>

<p>In the garden he took leave of them at once, and went
his way; but he looked around and saw Pani Elzen lean
on Svirski's arm and whisper something in his ear.</p>

<p>"They are talking of the dessert after lunch," thought he.</p>

<p>But he was mistaken, for, turning her charming head
to the artist, she whispered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Does Vyadrovski know?"</p>

<p>"He does not," answered Svirski. "I met him only at
the train."</p>

<p>When he had said this he felt a certain fear at the
thought that Pani Elzen mentioned the betrothal as a
fixed fact, and that he would have to announce it to
every one; but the proximity of Pani Elzen, her beauty
and her charms, so acted on him that he grew serene and
took courage.</p>

<p>The lunch was eaten with Romulus, Remus, and Kresovich,
who, during a whole hour, said not one word. After
black coffee, Pani Elzen permitted her boys to go toward
Rocca Brune under guidance of their tutor; then she
asked Svirski,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Which do you prefer, to ride or to walk?"</p>

<p>"If you are not tired, I would rather walk," answered he.</p>

<p>"Very well. I am not tired at all. But where shall
we go? Would you look at the pigeon-shooting?"</p>

<p>"Willingly, but we shall not be alone there. De
Sinten and young Kladzki will be sure to exercise after
lunch."</p>

<p>"Yes; but they will not trouble us. When pigeons
are the question, these two young men grow deaf and
<span class="pagenum">[438]</span>
blind to all else that happens around them. For that
matter, let them see me with my great man!"</p>

<p>And, turning her head, she looked with a smile into his
eyes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Doesn't the great man wish that himself?"</p>

<p>"Of course, let them see us!" answered Svirski, raising
her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>"Then we will go down; I like well enough to see the
shooting."</p>

<p>"Let us go."</p>

<p>And after a while they were on the great steps leading
to the shooting gallery.</p>

<p>"How bright it is here! How pleasant and how happy
I am!" said Pani Elzen.</p>

<p>Then, though there was no one near them, she asked
in a whisper, "But you?"</p>

<p>"My light is with me!" answered he, pressing her
arm to his breast.</p>

<p>And they began to descend. The day was uncommonly
bright, the air golden and azure; the sea was dark
in the distance.</p>

<p>"We will stay here awhile," said Pani Elzen. "The
cages are perfectly visible from this spot."</p>

<p>Beneath them was a green half-circle covered with
grass, extending far into the sea. In this half-circle
were placed, in a curving line on the ground, cages containing
pigeons. Moment after moment, some one of
those cages was opened suddenly, and a frightened bird
rushed through the air; then a shot was heard, and the
pigeon fell to the ground, or even into the sea, where
boats were rocking with fishermen in them waiting for
their prey.</p>

<p>Sometimes it happened, however, that the shot missed.
Then the pigeon flew toward the sea, and afterward, moving
<span class="pagenum">[439]</span>
in a circle, returned to seek refuge in the cornice of
the Casino.</p>

<p>"From here we do not see the marksmen, and do not
know who fires," said Pani Elzen, joyously, "so we will
guess; if the first pigeon falls, we will remain in Monte
Carlo; if it escapes, we will go to Italy."</p>

<p>"Agreed. Let us look! Out it comes!"</p>

<p>A cage fell open that instant, but the bird, as if dazed,
remained on the spot. They frightened the pigeon by
rolling a wooden ball toward it; next a shot thundered.
The bird did not fall at once, however; it made straight
for the sea, coming down gradually to the surface, as if
wounded; but at last it vanished completely in the brightness
of the sun.</p>

<p>"Maybe it fell, maybe it did not fall! The future is
uncertain," said Svirski, laughing.</p>

<p>"It is that unendurable De Sinten," said Pani Elzen,
pouting like an angry child. "I will bet that is he!
Let us go down."</p>

<p>And they went farther down toward the shooting,
among cactuses, sunflowers, and goat grass clinging to
the walls. Pani Elzen stopped at every report of a gun,
and in her white robe, on the great steps, against the
green background, she looked like a statue.</p>

<p>"There is nothing after all which drops into such
splendid folds as flannel," said Svirski.</p>

<p>"Oh, you artist!" exclaimed the young widow. And
there was irony in her voice, for she felt a little angered
that Svirski at that moment was thinking not of her, but
of the folds into which various kinds of cloth fall.</p>

<p>"Let us go."</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were under the roof of the
shooting gallery. Of acquaintances they found only De
Sinten, who was shooting on a bet with a Hungarian
<span class="pagenum">[440]</span>
count. The two men were dressed in reddish English
costume with caps of the same material buttoned down
on the visor, and barred stockings, both very distinguished,
both with witless faces. But, as Pani Elzen
had foreseen, De Sinten was so occupied with shooting
that he did not notice the widow and the artist at first,
and only after a time did he come and greet them.</p>

<p>"How are you succeeding?" inquired the lady.</p>

<p>"I am victorious! I am almost sure of a great
winning." Here he turned to Svirski. "But do you
shoot?"</p>

<p>"Of course; but not to-day."</p>

<p>"And I," continued De Sinten, looking significantly at
Pani Elzen, "am to-day lucky in play."</p>

<p>They called him just then to the shooting.</p>

<p>"He wanted to say that he is unlucky in love," said
Svirski.</p>

<p>"Imbecile! Could it be otherwise?"</p>

<p>But in spite of these words of blame, it was evident by
the face of the beautiful lady that she was not angry that
testimony was given in presence of Svirski of how enchanting
she was, and how much desired by all,&mdash;and
that was not to be the last testimony of the day.</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you about something," said the artist,
after a moment of silence; "but I could not ask during
lunch in presence of the boys and Kresovich. Kresovich
told me on the way that he was leaving you, or, at least,
that he is the tutor of the boys for the last day. Is this
true, and why is it?"</p>

<p>"It is true. First of all, I am not sure of his health.
A few days since I sent him to the doctor. The
doctor declared again that he is not threatened with consumption,
otherwise I should not have kept him an
hour; but in every case he looks worse and worse; he is
<span class="pagenum">[441]</span>
peculiar, excitable, often he is unendurable. That is the
first reason. And, then, do you know his opinions?
They will not be accepted by Romulus and Remus.
The boys are reared in such fashion that those opinions
cannot take root in them. Besides, I do not wish them
in childhood to know of such things, to meet with such
an erratic spirit, with such ill-will toward that sphere of
society to which my sons belong. You wished them to
speak with some one in their own language; that was
sufficient for me; that was for me a command. This is
the kind of person that I am, and such shall I remain.
I understood, too, that they ought to know their own language
somewhat. At present great attention is given to
this subject, and I confess that people are right. But
even in this regard Kresovich is too erratic."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for him. There are certain wrinkles in
the corners of his eyes which show him to be a fanatic.
His face is a strange one, and really he is a curious
man."</p>

<p>"Again art is speaking through you," said Pani Elzen,
smiling. But after a moment she grew serious, and on
her face even anxiety appeared.</p>

<p>"I have another reason," said she. "It is difficult for
one to speak of it; but still I will tell you, for with
whom am I to be outspoken if not with my great man?&mdash;such
a loved one, and so honest, who is able to understand
everything. You see I have noticed that Kresovich
has lost his head, and fallen in love with me to
madness; under these conditions he could not remain
near&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How is that, and he too?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered she, with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>And she struggled to pretend that the confession
caused her pain; but just as a moment before after the
<span class="pagenum">[442]</span>
words of De Sinten, there flew across her mouth a smile
of flattered self-love and feminine vanity. Svirski took
note of that smile, and a bitter, angry feeling straitened
his heart.</p>

<p>"I have succumbed to the epidemic," said he.</p>

<p>She looked at him a moment, and asked in a low
voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Was that said by a jealous man, or by an ungrateful
one?"</p>

<p>"You are right," answered he, evasively. "If that be
the position, Kresovich should go."</p>

<p>"I will settle with him to-day, and that will be the
end."</p>

<p>They ceased talking; nothing was heard save the
shots of De Sinten and the Hungarian. Svirski, however,
could not forgive her that smile which he had
caught on the wing. He said to himself, it is true, that
Pani Elzen was obliged to act with Kresovich as she
had acted, that there was nothing over which to be
angry&mdash;still he felt rising vexation in his soul. On a
time, at the beginning of his acquaintance with Pani
Elzen, he saw her riding; she was some yards ahead;
after her hurried De Sinten, young Kladzki, Prince
Valerian, Wilkis Bey, and Waxford. On Svirski, the
group produced the fatal impression at the moment,
that it was a kind of chase after a woman. At present
the picture stood in memory before him so vividly and
with such sharpness that his artistic nature suffered
really.</p>

<p>"It is absolutely true," said he to himself, "that all
are running after her, and if I had been thrown in
clearing some obstacle, the next man behind would
have caught her."</p>

<p>But further meditation was stopped by Pani Elzen,
<span class="pagenum">[443]</span>
who declared that she was growing cold in the shade,
and wished to warm herself a trifle in the sun.</p>

<p>"Let us go to your rooms, and do you get a wrap,"
said Svirski, rising.</p>

<p>They set out for the upper terrace, but halfway on
the steps she stopped all at once and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are dissatisfied with me. In what have I offended;
have I not done what was proper?"</p>

<p>Svirski, whose discontent had calmed somewhat on
the way, and who was touched by her alarm, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon an old original; I beg you to do so."</p>

<p>Pani Elzen wanted absolutely to find out what had
made him gloomy, but in no way could she get an answer.
Then, half jesting, half sad, she fell to complaining
of artists. How unendurable, how strange they
are, men whom any little thing offends, any little thing
pains; they shut themselves up at once in themselves
and then run to their lonely studios! To-day, for
instance, she had noted three times, she said, how
the artist was in him. That was bad! Let this
wicked artist as punishment stay for dinner, then stay
till evening.</p>

<p>But Svirski declared that he must return to his
studio; then he confided to her his anxieties of an
artist, his trouble in finding a model for "Sleep and
Death," and finally the hope which he connected with
that picture.</p>

<p>"I see from all this," answered the young widow,
smiling, "that I shall have one terrible, permanent rival,
art."</p>

<p>"That is not a rival," answered Svirski; "it is a divinity
which you will serve in my company."</p>

<p>At this the symmetrical brows of the beautiful lady
frowned for an instant; but meanwhile they reached the
<span class="pagenum">[444]</span>
hotel. That day Svirski became convinced that Paradise
would open to him only by marriage. And on the train
he was thankful to Pani Elzen for that conviction.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">PANI Elzen, before beginning her toilet for dinner,
summoned Kresovich so as to pay him. She
summoned him with a certain curiosity in her soul as to
what their parting would be. During life, she had seen
so many people fashioned, as it were, by a single cutter
on one common pattern, that this young original had
held her attention for some time; and now, when he was
to leave in a little while, and take a broken heart with
him, he occupied her still more. She felt sure that his
passion would betray itself in some way, and she had
even a slightly concealed wish that it should betray
itself, promising, not altogether sincerely, that she would
restrain it by one look or one word, should it dream of
surpassing a certain measure.</p>

<p>Kresovich, however, came in cool, with a face rather
ominous than loving. Pani Elzen, when she looked at
him, thought that Svirski, as an artist, could not help
noting that head, for there was in it something quite
exceptional. Those features were as if of iron,&mdash;features
in which will surpassed intelligence, giving them an
expression which to a certain degree was dull, but also
implacable. Svirski had divined long before that Kresovich
was one of those men who, once seized by a given
idea, have a faith which no breath of doubt can ever
dim. Doubt never undermines the capacity for action in
men like him, for the reason that a persistent and
<span class="pagenum">[445]</span>
powerful character is joined to a certain narrowness of
thought. Fanaticism flourishes on this soil alone. Pani
Elzen, in spite of her society understanding, was too
frivolous to grasp this. Kresovich would have attracted
her attention only had he been an exceptionally handsome
fellow; but since he was not, she met the man the
first time she saw him as she would a thing; and it was
only Svirski's unconscious teaching which brought her
to turn attention to the student. At present she received
him politely, and, after paying what she owed,
in a voice cold, it is true, and indifferent as usual, but
with words which were very polite, expressed sorrow
that her intended departure from Monte Carlo, soon to
take place, was a hindrance to further relations between
them. Kresovich, putting the money into his pocket
mechanically, answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I informed you yesterday that I could teach Romulus
and Remus no longer."</p>

<p>"It is just that which pleases me," answered she,
raising her head.</p>

<p>Evidently she wished, at least at first, to keep the
conversation in a ceremonial tone, and impose that tone
on Kresovich. But it was enough to look at him to
see that he had the unbending determination to say all
that he had resolved in his mind to say.</p>

<p>"You have paid me in genuine money," said he; "do
not then give me counterfeit coin for the road."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean this," said he, with emphasis; "that you do
not part with me because of your journey, nor have I
thanked you for the service. There is another cause,
and what that is you know as well as I do."</p>

<p>"If I know, perhaps I do not wish to hear of it, nor
to mention it," answered Pani Elzen, haughtily.
<span class="pagenum">[446]</span>
</p>

<p>He approached one step toward her, putting his hands
behind him, and rearing his head almost threateningly.</p>

<p>"But it is unavoidable," said he: "first, because in a
moment I shall go away, and, second, for other reasons
too, of which you will know to-morrow."</p>

<p>Pani Elzen rose with frowning brow and somewhat
with the theatrical posture of an offended queen.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?"</p>

<p>He drew still nearer, so that his mouth was barely a
few inches from her face, and began to speak with concentrated
energy.</p>

<p>"This means that I ought to have hated you and all
your circle; but I have fallen in love with you. This
means that for your sake I have degraded myself in my
own conscience; for this cause I shall mete out my own
punishment to myself. But precisely for this reason I
have nothing to lose, and you must pay me for my
iniquity, otherwise there will be a catastrophe!"</p>

<p>Pani Elzen was not frightened, for in general she had
no fear of men. She did not fear Kresovich's consumption
either, since the local physician had quieted
her perfectly on that point. Her astonishment alone was
real; anger and fear were merely apparent. Amazement
sprang up in her heart at once, "But he is a bird of prey,
ready to tear me to pieces." For her nature, wrapped
up as it was in corruption and fond of novelty, every
adventure, especially when it flattered her female vanity,
had an unspeakable charm. For this cause her
moral sense was astonished at nothing. If Kresovich
had implored her for one moment of delight, for the
right to kiss the hem of her garment with humility,
and on his knees, she would have given command to
throw him out of doors. But this man, terrible, almost
wild, this representative of a sect of whose tremendous
<span class="pagenum">[447]</span>
energy fabulous tales were related in her social circle,
seemed demonic, so different from all men whom she
had seen up to that time that she was seized with
ecstasy. Her nerves were greedy of novelty. She
thought, too, that in case of resistance, the adventure
might take on proportions altogether unforeseen, and
turn into a scandal; for that lunatic was really ready
for anything.</p>

<p>But Kresovich continued, covering her face with his
burning breath,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I love, and I have nothing to lose. I have lost health,
I have destroyed my future, and have demeaned myself!&mdash;I
have nothing to lose! Do you understand? To me
it is all one whether at your call ten men run in here or
a hundred; for you it is not all one! Afterward I shall
go; and the secret will be lost&mdash;I swear!"</p>

<p>Pani Elzen cared only for preserving appearances,
which the hypocritical woman always tries to preserve
and to deceive herself.</p>

<p>Turning her eyes, filled with feigned terror, to his face,
which was really like the face of a madman, she asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you want to kill me?"</p>

<p>"I want pay&mdash;not in money!" answered he, in a
stifled voice. Then growing paler yet, he seized her in
his arms; and she began to defend herself. But she did
so like a fainting woman whom terror deprives of strength
and consciousness.

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">SVIRSKI, on arriving at Villa Franca, got out and
went to the harbor; for it occurred to him that he
might return to Nice by boat. He found, just at the edge
of the harbor, a fisherman, an old acquaintance, who,
pleased at the sight of a liberal customer, undertook with
usual Ligurian boastfulness to take him "even to Corsica
though the Sirocco were to turn the sea bottom upward."</p>

<p>But the question was only of a short trip, all the
easier because there was not the slightest breeze. Svirski
took his place at the stern, and they moved over the
smooth sea. After a time, when they had passed the
luxurious private yachts, they approached ironclads, whose
calm, black immensities were outlined firmly and distinctly
in the afternoon sunlight. The deck of the "Formidable"
was garlanded already with lamps of various colors, for the
ball of the following evening, to which Svirski was to
receive an invitation. At the bulwarks were sailors, who,
seen from below, looked like pygmies when compared with
the ship. The iron walls of the vessel, the smoke-stacks,
the masts, the rigging, were reflected in the transparent
water as in a mirror. From time to time among the ironclads
pushed a boat, which from a distance seemed a black
beetle, moving its row of legs symmetrically. Beyond the
vessels began empty space, in which the sea surface, as
is usual when anything leaves the harbor, rose and fell,
though there was no wind, now raising, now letting down
Svirski's boat, with a movement at once broad and agreeable.
Soon they were approaching lofty cliffs, on the
right side of the harbor, along which extended a gray,
dusty road; lower down was a parade-ground, where
<span class="pagenum">[449]</span>
soldiers were practising on trumpets. At last, when they
had turned the promontory, against which waves were
rolling, they sailed into deep water.</p>

<p>Beyond the harbor there is always some breeze, therefore
the fisherman hoisted his sails. Svirski, instead of
steering toward Nice, turned to the open sea.</p>

<p>They went straight ahead, rocked by the swell. The
sun was lowering toward evening. The rocky cliffs and
the sea had grown purple; everything round about was
calm, quiet, and so immense that, in spite of himself,
Svirski thought how contemptible and petty life was in
view of those elements which surrounded him at that
moment. Suddenly he felt as if his own affairs, and
those of other men, had gone somewhere very far off.
Pani Elzen, Romulus, Remus, and all his acquaintances
along the shore, all that swarm of people filled with
fever, unrest, paltry ambitions, and wretched desires, were
belittled in his eyes. As a man accustomed to analyze
what happens within him, he was frightened at that
impression; for he considered that if he loved Pani
Elzen really, her portrait would not be covered by
anything, would not be dimmed, would not be decreased,
would not disappear. Such had been the case with him
formerly. Svirski remembered that when a woman
whom he loved got married, he went on a journey. At
that time he learned first to know Italy, Rome, Sicily,
and the sea, and the coast of Africa; and no impression
dimmed in his mind the memory of the beloved woman.
In the galleries of Florence and Rome, on the sea and
in the desert, she was with him; through her he received
every impression, and everywhere he said to her, as if
present, "Look at this!" The difference between those
distant years and to-day filled him with sadness.</p>

<p>But the calm of the sea acted on him in a manner that
<span class="pagenum">[450]</span>
was healing. They had sailed out so far that the shores
began to be concealed. Then the sun went down; one
star twinkled, and then another. The dolphins, which in
the evening twilight passed before the boat with the
motion of waves, disturbing the calm surface with their
sharp backs, sank in the depth, and from no point came
an echo. The surface of the water had grown so smooth
that at moments the sails became limp. Finally, the
moon rose from beyond the mountains, pouring a greenish
light over the sea and illuminating it far off to the limit
of the horizon.</p>

<p>A southern night began, as mild as it was silent.
Svirski sheltered himself in the coat lent him by the
fisherman, and meditated: "All that surrounds me is not
only beauty, but truth as well. The life of man, if it is
to be normal, should be ingrafted on the trunk of nature,
grow out of it, as a branch grows out of a tree, and exist
in virtue of those same laws. Then it will be truthful
and besides moral, for morality is at bottom nothing else
than the agreement of life with the universal law of
nature. For instance, simplicity and calm surrounds me;
I understand this, and I feel it is as an artist; but I
haven't it in myself as a man, for my life, and the life of
these people among whom I live, has departed from
nature, it has ceased to fit itself to that law, to be its
result, and has made itself a lie. Everything in us is
artificial, even the feeling of natural laws has perished in
us. Our relations are founded on falsehood. Our senses
are crooked; our souls and our impulses sick. We
deceive one another and even ourselves, till at last no
man is sure that he wishes really that toward which he
is striving, or that he will strive toward that which he
wishes."</p>

<p>And there, in presence of that night, of that infinity of
<span class="pagenum">[451]</span>
the sea, of the stars, of all nature, of its calmness, its
simplicity, its immensity, he was seized by a feeling of
the gigantic falsehood of the relations between men.
False seemed to him his love for Pani Elzen; false her
relation to him, to her children, to other men, to society;
false the life on that bright shore; false their present
and false their future. "I am encircled, as if by a net,"
thought he; "and I know not how to tear myself out of
it." And indeed that was true. For if all life is a falsehood,
what is to be done in face of that fact? Return to
nature? Begin some sort of life half savage, half peasant?
Break with people and become a reformer right away?
Svirski felt too old for this, and too sceptical. For
such a course one needs to have the dogmatism of
Kresovich, and to feel evil as a spur to battle and
reform, not as a mere impression which may grow faint
to-morrow! But another thought came to Svirski's mind
as a recompense. The man who does not feel in himself
power to reform the world, may flee from it, for a
time, at least, and draw breath. For instance, he could
go to Marseilles the next day, and a couple of days later
somewhere else, out on the open ocean, hundreds of miles
from the shore, from sickly life, from lies and deceptions.
In this way all would be settled immediately, or rather
cut off as if with a knife.</p>

<p>And in one moment he was seized by such a desire to
turn that idea into action that he gave command to
return to Nice.</p>

<p>"The wild beast, which feels itself in a net," thought
he, "tries first of all to get out. That is its first right&mdash;and
just that is in accord with nature, hence it is
moral. The net around me is not Pani Elzen alone,
but all things taken together. I feel perfectly that in
marrying her I shall marry a life of lies. That might
<span class="pagenum">[452]</span>
happen even without her fault, and through the necessity
of things&mdash;from such a complication one is always
free to escape."</p>

<p>And now he pictured other scenes to himself,&mdash;scenes
which he might see in his flight: broad deserts with
water and with sand, unknown lands and people, the
sincerity and truth of their primitive life, and finally the
variety of events, and all the difference between days to
come and the present.</p>

<p>"I ought to have done this long since," said he to
himself.</p>

<p>Then a thought entered his mind which could come
only to an artist, that if he should leave his betrothed
suddenly and go to Paris, for example, the act would
belong to "vile literature;" but should he shoot off
beyond the equator, to the land where pepper grows, the
fact of leaving her would be diminished in view of the
distance, the affair would make another impression, would
appear more original, and, for that very reason, in better
taste.</p>

<p>"But I," thought he, "will go devilish far!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile from a distance Nice rose before him in
the form of a bundle of lights. In the middle of that
bundle was the building called "Jet&eacute;e Promenade,"
which gleamed in the form of a gigantic lighthouse.
As the boat, urged by a strong breeze, approached the
harbor, every one of those lights changed, as it were, into
a pillar of fire, which quivered on the moving water near
the shore. The sight of these gleams sobered Svirski.</p>

<p>"The city!&mdash;and life!" thought he.</p>

<p>And at once his former plans began to fall apart like
dream-visions born of night and emptiness. That which
a moment earlier he thought justifiable, necessary, and
easy of accomplishment, seemed a whim devoid of the
<span class="pagenum">[453]</span>
essence of reality, and in part dishonest. "With life,
whatever it be, one must reckon. Whoso has lived
under its laws the years that I have, must feel responsible
to it. It is no great thing to say to one's self: I
used them as long as they were pleasant, but the moment
they were painful I went back to nature."</p>

<p>Then he fell to thinking more connectedly, not of
general theories, but of Pani Elzen.</p>

<p>"By what right could I leave her? If her life has
been artificial and false, if her past is not clear, I, who
knew that, might have refrained from proposing. At
present I could have the right to break with her only
in case I discovered in her evil which she concealed, or
if she committed some fault touching me. But she has
committed no fault of that sort. She has been honest
and sincere with me. Besides, there is something in
her which attracts me; if not, I should not have proposed.
At moments I feel that I love her; and because
doubt comes at times on me, must she be the sufferer?
My flight would in every case be an injustice to the
woman, and who knows that it would not be a blow."</p>

<p>He understood now, that to think of flight and permit
it are, for a decent man, two opposite poles. He
could only think of it. He could appear before the
eyes of Pani Elzen more easily, and ask her to return
his word to him; but to flee from danger was a thing
directly opposed to his personal nature and the character
of his stock, which was thoroughly civilized. Besides,
at the very thought of doing injustice to a woman,
the heart quivered in him; and Pani Elzen grew nearer
and dearer to him.</p>

<p>They had sailed almost into the harbor; and a moment
later the boat arrived. Svirski paid, and taking a seat
in a carriage, gave directions to drive to his studio. On
<span class="pagenum">[454]</span>
the street, amid the glare of lamps, the noise and the
movement, he was carried away again by a yearning for
that quiet, that endless spread of water, that calmness,
that boundless truth of God, from which he had
parted a moment before. At last, when he was near the
studio, the following idea came to his head: "It is a
marvellous thing that I, who feared women so much, and
was so distrustful of them, have in the end of ends
chosen one capable of rousing more fear than all the
others."</p>

<p>There was in that a certain fatality, as it were; and
Svirski would have found beyond doubt in that concourse
of things material for meditation during a whole evening,
had it not been that as he entered the servant gave him
two letters. In one, was an invitation to the ball of the
following day on board the "Formidable," the other was
from Pani Lageat, the owner of the house.</p>

<p>She informed him of her departure in a couple of
days for Marseilles, and at the same time told him
that she had found a model who ought to satisfy his
most extravagant taste, and who would come the next
morning.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE promised miracle came on the following morning
at nine. Svirski was dressed and waiting with
impatience and nervousness; happily his fears proved
unfounded. The first glance satisfied him. The model
was tall, slender, very graceful; she had a small head,
a delicate face, a beautiful structure of forehead, long
eyelashes, and great freshness of complexion. But, beyond
all, Svirski was charmed by this, that she had
<span class="pagenum">[455]</span>
"her own" style of face, and in her expression there
was something girl-like. "She has noble movements,"
thought he; "and if she is formed as she seems, then
'Eureka!' I will engage her for a long time, and take
her with me."</p>

<p>He was struck also by her timidity and a look, as it
were, of fright. He knew, it is true, that models sometimes
feign timidity. He admitted, however, that this
one did not.</p>

<p>"What is thy name, my child?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Maria Cervi."</p>

<p>"Art thou from Nice?"</p>

<p>"From Nice."</p>

<p>"Hast ever been a model?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Trained models know what is needed; with new ones
there is trouble. Thou hast never been a model in thy
life?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"How didst thou get the wish to be a model?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, and blushed somewhat.</p>

<p>"Pani Lageat told me that I should be able to earn
something."</p>

<p>"True, but evidently thou art afraid. What dost thou
fear? I will not eat thee! How much dost thou ask
for a sitting?"</p>

<p>"Pani Lageat told me that you would pay five francs."</p>

<p>"Pani Lageat was mistaken. I pay ten."</p>

<p>Joy gleamed in the girl's face, and her cheeks grew
still redder.</p>

<p>"When must I begin?" asked she, with a somewhat
trembling voice.</p>

<p>"To-day, immediately," answered Svirski, pointing to
the picture already begun. "There is the screen; go
<span class="pagenum">[456]</span>
behind, undress to the waist only. Thou wilt sit for
the head, the bosom, and a part of the stomach."</p>

<p>She turned to him an astonished face; her hands
dropped slowly along her dress.</p>

<p>"How is that, sir?" asked she, looking at him with
terrified eyes.</p>

<p>"My child," answered the artist, a little impatiently,
"I understand that it may be difficult the first time.
But either thou art a model, or thou art not. I need
the head, the bosom, and a part of the stomach; I need
these absolutely; dost thou understand? And be sure,
at the same time, that there is nothing bad in me; but,
first of all, think it over&mdash;and quickly; for, if thou art
not willing, I shall look for another."</p>

<p>He spoke as a man somewhat vexed; for in his mind
the point was that just she should be the model, and
that he should not have to look for another. Meanwhile
silence came. The model grew pale very evidently; still,
after a while, she went behind the screen.</p>

<p>Svirski fell to pushing the easel toward the window,
with a noise, thinking, meanwhile,&mdash;</p>

<p>"She will gain the habit, and in a week will laugh
at her scruples."</p>

<p>Next, he arranged the sofa on which the model was to
lie, took his brush, and began to grow impatient.</p>

<p>"Well, how is it? Art thou ready?"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Well, make up thy mind. What jokes are these?"</p>

<p>Just then from behind the screen came a trembling,
imploring voice, with the prayer,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have thought it over, sir. In our house there
is poverty; but still&mdash;I&mdash;cannot! If you would be
kind and take the head&mdash;for three francs, or even for
two&mdash;if you would have the kindness."
<span class="pagenum">[457]</span>
</p>

<p>And these words came with sobbing. Svirski turned
toward the screen, dropped his brush, and opened his
mouth. Unparalleled astonishment seized him, for the
model was speaking in his own native tongue.</p>

<p>"Is the lady a Pole?" asked he at last, forgetting
that a moment before he had said <i>thou</i> to her.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That is, my father was an Italian, but my
grandfather is a Pole."</p>

<p>A moment of silence ensued. Svirski recovered, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arrange your dress; I will take only your head."</p>

<p>But evidently she had not begun to undress, for she
came from behind the screen at once, confused, full of
fear yet, and with traces of tears on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I thank you," said she. "You are&mdash;I beg your
pardon; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be at rest," said Svirski. "Here is the chair; have
no fear. You will pose for your head; I had no wish
to offend you. You see that picture. I wanted a model
for this figure here. But since it is so painful to you,
the question is changed, especially as you are a Pole."</p>

<p>Tears began to flow over her cheeks again; but she
looked at him through her blue eyes with gratitude;
he found a bottle of wine, poured out half a glass, and,
giving it to her, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Drink this. I have biscuits here somewhere, but
deuce knows where they are. I ask you to drink. There,
it is all right. Your hand trembles; but there is no
danger here&mdash;I beg you to be calm."</p>

<p>And saying this he looked at her with the sympathy
of his honest eyes, and said after a while,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poor child!"</p>

<p>Then he stepped aside, and put the easel in its old
place, saying while he did so,
<span class="pagenum">[458]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is no posing to-day. You are too much excited.
To-morrow, we will begin work early; to-day, we
will talk a little. Who could guess that Maria Cervi
was a Pole! Your grandfather is a Pole then, is he
not? Is he alive?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but he has not walked for the last two years."</p>

<p>"What is his name?"</p>

<p>"Orysevich," answered she, speaking somewhat with a
foreign accent.</p>

<p>"I know that name. Has he been long in this
country?"</p>

<p>"Grandfather has been sixty-five years out of Poland.
First, he was in the Italian army, and then in the bank
of Nice."</p>

<p>"How old is he?"</p>

<p>"Nearly ninety."</p>

<p>"Your father's name was Cervi?"</p>

<p>"Yes. My father was from Nice; but he served also
in the Italian army."</p>

<p>"Then he is dead?"</p>

<p>"Five years."</p>

<p>"And your mother is alive?"</p>

<p>"She is. We live together in Old Nice."</p>

<p>"Very well. But now one more question. Does
your mother know that you want to become a model?"</p>

<p>To this the girl answered in a hesitating voice, "No,
mamma does not know. Pani Lageat told me that in
this way I could earn five francs a day; and as there is
poverty in our house,&mdash;very great poverty,&mdash;I had no
other way."</p>

<p>Svirski took in the girl from head to foot with quick
glance, and understood that he was listening to truth.
Everything testified to poverty,&mdash;her hat, her dress,
which was so worn, or rather consumed by age, that
<span class="pagenum">[459]</span>
every thread in it was visible, her gloves, darned and
faded.</p>

<p>"Go home now," said he, "and tell your mother that
there is an artist named Svirski who wishes you to sit
to him as a model for the head. Say also that this
artist will come, at recommendation of Pani Lageat, to
ask you to sit with your mother in his studio, for which
he offers you ten francs a day."</p>

<p>Panna Cervi began to thank him, without knowing
how to find speech, weeping and confusing her words,
with a voice full both of tears and delight. He saw
what was happening within her, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very well. I shall come in an hour. You seem to
me a very honest girl. Have confidence in me. I am
something of a bear, but I understand more things than
one. We shall arrange this affair, and the trouble will
pass. Ah! yes, one point more. I do not wish to give
you money at once, for you would have to explain the
matter; but in an hour I will bring all that is needed
on account. I too had troubles formerly, and know what
prompt aid means. You have nothing to give thanks
for, a trifle! Till we meet again&mdash;in an hour."</p>

<p>So, after he had asked again for her address, he conducted
the girl to the steps; and, when an hour had
passed, he took his seat in a carriage and gave directions
to drive to Old Nice.</p>

<p>All that had happened seemed to him so peculiar
that he could think of nothing else. He felt too the
delight which every honest man feels when he has acted
as he ought, and when he may become a providence
to some person.</p>

<p>"If that is not an honest and a good girl," thought he
of Panna Cervi, "I am the dullest mule in Liguria."</p>

<p>But he did not admit that anything similar could
<span class="pagenum">[460]</span>
happen. On the contrary, he felt that he had struck a
very honest woman's soul, and at the same time he was
delighted that that soul was enclosed in such a young
and beautiful body.</p>

<p>The carriage stopped at last in front of an old and
battered house near the harbor. The woman at the gate
pointed contemptuously enough to Pani Cervi's apartments.</p>

<p>"Poverty indeed!" thought the artist, as he went up
the sloping steps. After a while he knocked at the
door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" answered a voice.</p>

<p>Svirski entered. A woman about forty years of age
received him; she was dressed in black; a brunette, sad,
thin, evidently broken by life: but she had nothing
common about her. At her side stood Panna Maria.</p>

<p>"I know all, and I thank you from my soul and
heart!" said Pani Cervi; "may God reward and bless
you."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, she caught his hand and bent her head
as if to kiss it; but he withdrew the hand quickly;
anxious to drive away ceremony at the earliest, and
break the ice of first acquaintance, he turned to Panna
Maria, and, shaking his finger at her, said, with the
freedom of an old acquaintance,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, this little girl has let out the secret!"</p>

<p>Panna Maria smiled at him in answer, a little sadly,
a little perplexed. She seemed to him fair, more beautiful
than in the studio. He noticed also that she had
around her neck a narrow, lily-colored ribbon which she
had not worn before; and this touched him still more
as a proof that evidently she did not consider him an
old grandfather, since she had dressed for him. Then
Pani Cervi said,
<span class="pagenum">[461]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, Maria told everything. God watched over her,
and over us, so that she met such a man as you."</p>

<p>"Panna Maria told me of the difficult circumstances in
which you are living," answered Svirski; "but, believe
me, that even in those circumstances it is happiness to
have such a daughter."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pani Cervi, calmly.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile I owe gratitude to you; for I was looking,
and looking in vain, till at last a head fell from
heaven to me. Now I am sure of my picture. I must
only make sure that my model does not run away!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he drew out three hundred francs and
forced Pani Cervi to take them, assuring her that he
would make a great profit, for he would receive much
money, thanks to Panna Maria; and then he declared
that he would like to make the acquaintance of the
"grandfather," for he had always had a weakness for
old soldiers.</p>

<p>Hearing this, Panna Maria ran to the adjoining chamber;
soon the noise of a wheeled chair was heard, and
the grandfather was rolled into the room. Evidently the
old man had been prepared to receive the guest, for he
was in uniform, with all his orders acquired in Italy.
Svirski saw before him an old man whose face had grown
small and wrinkled; his moustaches and hair were white
as milk; his blue eyes opened widely, and looked something
like the eyes of an infant.</p>

<p>"Grandfather," said Maria, bending over him in such
fashion that the old man could see her lips, and speaking
not in a loud voice, but slowly and precisely, "this is
Pan Svirski, a fellow-countryman and an artist."</p>

<p>The old man turned his blue eyes toward the visitor,
and looked at him persistently, meanwhile blinking as
if summoning his mind.
<span class="pagenum">[462]</span>
</p>

<p>"A fellow-countryman?" repeated he. "Yes!&mdash;a fellow-countryman."</p>

<p>Then he smiled, looked at his daughter, his granddaughter,
and again at Svirski; he sought words for a
time, and asked at last, with an aged, trembling voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And what will there be in spring?"</p>

<p>Evidently there remained to him some single thought,
which had outlived all the others, but which he had
not been able to express. So, after a while, he leaned his
trembling head against the back of the chair, and began
to look at the window, smiling, however, at that thought,
and repeating,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! It will be!"</p>

<p>"Grandfather always acts that way," said Maria.</p>

<p>Svirski looked at him for a time with emotion; then
Pani Cervi began to speak of her father and her husband.
Both had taken part in the wars against Austria for
Italian independence. They had lived some time in
Florence; and only after the occupation of Rome did they
return to Nice, where Cervi's family originated. There
Orysevich gave his daughter to his young comrade in
arms. Both men found places in the bank, thanks to
relatives in Nice. All succeeded well till Cervi was
killed in a railroad accident, a few years before, and
Orysevich lost his place through old age. From that
time their trouble began, for the only capital which the
three persons had to support them was sixty lires, which
the Italian government gave the old man. That was
enough to keep them from dying, but not enough to give
them life. The two women earned a little by sewing or
teaching; but during summer, when life died away in
Nice, when it was impossible to earn anything, their
slender supplies were swallowed up. Two years before
the old soldier had lost the use of his legs altogether; he
<span class="pagenum">[463]</span>
was frequently sick, and had to be cared for; through
this their condition grew worse and worse.</p>

<p>Svirski, while listening to this narrative, made note of
two things. First, that Pani Cervi did not speak as good
Polish as her daughter. Evidently the old man, in the
years of his campaigning, could not devote himself to the
education of his daughter in the same degree as he had
afterward to the education of his granddaughter. But
the second thing was more important for Svirski. "This
granddaughter," thought he, "being such a beautiful girl,
might, especially in Nice, on that shore where idlers
squander millions every year, keep carriages, servants,
and have a drawing-room finished in satin. But she
wears a threadbare dress, and her only ornament is a
faded lily-colored ribbon. There must be some strength
which has kept her from evil. For this," said he to himself,
"two things are requisite,&mdash;pure nature and honorable
traditions; there is no doubt that I have found
both."</p>

<p>And he began to have a pleasant feeling among those
people. He noticed also that poverty had not destroyed
in the two women traces of good-breeding, a certain elegance
which comes from within and seems inborn. Both
mother and daughter had received him as a providence;
but in their words and manners one could notice more
delight at making the acquaintance of an honest man,
than at the aid which he brought them. It might be
that the three hundred francs which he left with the
mother saved the family from many cares and humiliations,
but still he felt that mother and daughter were
more thankful to him because he had acted in the studio
like a man of true and tender heart, who understood the
girl's pain, her modesty, and sacrifice. But to him the
greatest pleasure came from noting that in Panna Maria's
<span class="pagenum">[464]</span>
timidity, and in her charming glances, there was an
anxiety which a young girl might experience before a
man to whom she feels obliged with her whole soul, but
who at the same time, according to Svirski's expression,
"is not out of the current yet." He was forty-five years
of age, but, in spite of a young heart, he began at moments
to doubt himself, so that the lily-colored ribbon
and this observation caused him real pleasure. Finally,
he talked to them with the same respect and attention as
with women of the best society, and, seeing that he entertained
them more and more by this means, he felt satisfied.
At parting, he pressed the hands of both; and when
Panna Maria returned the pressure, with drooping eyelashes,
but with all the strength of her warm young
hand, he went out a little dazed, and with a head so full
of the fair model that the driver of the carriage in which
he took a seat had to ask him twice where he wished to
go.</p>

<p>On the road he thought that it would not do to put
the head of "Panna Maria" on a body naked to the
waist, and he began to persuade himself that even for the
picture it would be better to cast some light drapery over
the bosom of the sleeping maiden.</p>

<p>"When I get back, I will bring in the first model I
find, and work the picture over, so that to-morrow the
thing will be ready," said he to himself.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to him that still he would not
be able to hire such a model as Panna Cervi permanently
and take her with him; at this thought he was
sorry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the carriage stopped at the studio. Svirski
paid, and stepped out.</p>

<p>"A despatch for you," said the concierge.</p>

<p>The artist was roused as if from sleep.
<span class="pagenum">[465]</span>
</p>

<p>"Ah! Very well, give it here!" And taking the
despatch, he opened it impatiently.</p>

<p>But he had scarcely cast his eyes on it, when astonishment
and terror were reflected on his face, for the telegram
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Kresovich shot himself an hour ago. Come.</p>

<p style="text-align:right">
 <span class="smcap">Helena.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">PANI Elzen met Svirski with a troubled and excited
face; her eyes were dry, but reddened, as if from
fever, and full of impatience.</p>

<p>"Have you received no letter?" inquired she, hurriedly.</p>

<p>"No. I have received nothing but your telegram.
What a misfortune!"</p>

<p>"I thought that perhaps he had written to you."</p>

<p>"No. When did it happen?"</p>

<p>"This morning a shot was heard in his chamber. A
servant ran in and found him lifeless."</p>

<p>"Was it here in the hotel?"</p>

<p>"No. Fortunately he moved to Condamine yesterday."</p>

<p>"What was the cause?"</p>

<p>"How am I to know?" answered she, impatiently.</p>

<p>"So far as I have heard he was not given to play."</p>

<p>"No. They found money on his person."</p>

<p>"You relieved him of his duties yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but at his own request."</p>

<p>"Did he take the dismissal to heart?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," answered she, feverishly. "If he had
wished, he might have gone sooner. But he was a madman,
and this explains everything. Why did he not go
sooner?"
<span class="pagenum">[466]</span>
</p>

<p>Svirski looked at her very attentively.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself," said he.</p>

<p>But she, mistaken as to the meaning of his words,
answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is so much that for me is disagreeable in this,
and there may be so much trouble. Who knows but I
shall have to give some explanation, some evidence&mdash;can
I tell what? Oh, a fatal history!&mdash;besides there will be
people's gossip. First, Vyadrovski's&mdash; But I wanted to
beg you to tell among acquaintances, that that unfortunate
lost at play, that he lost even some of my money,
and that that was the cause of his act. Should it come
to testifying before a court, it would be better not to
say this, for it might be proved untrue; but before people,
it is necessary to talk so. If he had gone even to
Mentone, or to Nice! Besides, God only knows whether
he has not written something before his death purposely
to take revenge on me! Only let a letter of that sort
reach the papers after his death! From such persons
everything may be expected. As it was, I wished to
leave here; but now I must&mdash;"</p>

<p>Svirski looked more and more attentively at her angry
face, at her compressed lips, and said at last,&mdash;</p>

<p>"An unheard of thing!"</p>

<p>"Really unheard of! But would it not increase gossip
were we to go from here to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I do not think it would," said Svirski.</p>

<p>Then he inquired about the hotel in which Kresovich
had shot himself, and declared that he would go there,
get information from the servants, and occupy himself
with the dead man.</p>

<p>She tried to stop him with uncommon stubborness;
till at last he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madame, he is not a dog, but a man; and it is
necessary in every case to bury him."
<span class="pagenum">[467]</span>
</p>

<p>"Somebody will bury him anyhow," answered she.</p>

<p>But Svirski took leave of her and went out. On the
steps of the hotel he drew his hand across his forehead,
then covered his head with his hat and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"An unheard of thing!"</p>

<p>He knew from experience to what degree human selfishness
may go; he knew also that women in selfishness, as
well as in devotion, surpass the common measure of men;
he remembered that during life he had met typical persons
in whom, under an external crust of polish, was
hidden an animal selfishness in which all moral sense
ended exactly where personal interest began; still, Pani
Elzen had been able to astonish him.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he to himself, "that unfortunate was the
tutor of her children; he lived under the same roof
with her; and he was in love with her. And she?
Not even one word of pity, of sympathy, of interest&mdash; Nothing
and nothing! She is angry at him for causing
her trouble, for not having gone farther away, for having
spoiled her season, for exposing her to the possibility of
appearing in court and of being subjected to the gossip
of people; but the question of what took place with that
man has not entered her head; or why he killed himself,
and if it were not for her sake. And in her vexation she
forgot even this, that she was betraying herself before me;
and if not for her heart's sake, for her reason's sake, she
ought to have appeared before me differently. But what
spiritual barbarism! Appearances, appearances, and under
that French bodice and accent, absence of soul and
a primitive African nature,&mdash;a genuine daughter of Ham.
Civilization stuck onto the skin, like powder! And this
same woman asks me to report around that he played
away her money. Tfu! May a thunderbolt split her!"</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[468]</span>With such thoughts and imprecations he reached Condamine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">where he found easily the little hotel in which the</span><br />
event had taken place. There was a doctor in Kresovich's
room, also an official of the tribunal, who rejoiced at the
artist's arrival, hoping that he would be able to give some
items concerning the dead man.</p>

<p>"The suicide," said the official, "left a letter directing
to bury him in a common ditch so as to send the money
on his person to Z&uuml;rich, to a given address. Moreover,
he has burned all papers, as is shown by traces in the
chimney."</p>

<p>Svirski looked at Kresovich, who was lying on the bed
with open, terrified eyes, and with lips pursed together, as
if to whistle.</p>

<p>"The dead man considered himself an incurable," said
the artist; "he mentioned that himself to me, and took
his life very likely for that reason. He never entered
the Casino."</p>

<p>Then he told all that he knew concerning Kresovich,
and afterward left the money needed for a separate grave,
and went out.</p>

<p>Along the road he recalled what Kresovich had said to
him in Nice about microbes, as well as his answer to
Vyadrovski, that he would enroll himself in the party of
the "silent;" and he reached the conviction that the
young student had really occupied himself for a long time
with the project of taking his own life, and that the main
cause of his act was the conviction that he was condemned
to death in every case.</p>

<p>But he understood that there might be collateral
causes, and among them his unhappy love for Pani Elzen,
and the parting with her. These thoughts filled him with
sadness. The corpse of Kresovich, with lips fixed as if for
whistling, and with the terror before death in his eyes,
did not leave the artist's mind. But he thought that
<span class="pagenum">[469]</span>
no one would sink into that terrible night without dread,
and that all life, in view of the inevitableness of death, is
one immense, tragic absurdity; and he returned to Pani
Elzen in great depression of spirit.</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath of relief when she learned that
Kresovich had left no papers. She declared that she
would send as much money as might be needed for his
funeral; and only then did she speak of him with a certain
regret. She strove in vain, however, to detain
Svirski for a couple of hours. He answered that he was
not himself that day, and must return home.</p>

<p>"Then we shall meet in the evening," said she, giving
him her hand at parting. "I intended even to drop in
at Nice and go with you."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Svirski, with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten? To the 'Formidable.'"</p>

<p>"Ah! Are you going to that ball?"</p>

<p>"If you knew how weighed down I am, especially after
such a sad event, you would weep over me. I am sorry,
too, for that poor fellow; but it is necessary&mdash;it is
necessary even for this reason, that people should not
make suppositions."</p>

<p>"Is it? Till we meet again!" said Svirski.</p>

<p>And a moment later, while sitting in the train, he
said to himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I go with you to the 'Formidable,' or any other
place, I am a dead crab!"</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">BUT next morning, he received Pani Cervi and Panna
Maria with a gladder heart. At sight of the fair,
fresh face of the girl even delight seized him.
<span class="pagenum">[470]</span>
</p>

<p>Everything had been prepared in the studio; the easel
was in its place; the sofa for the model pushed forward
and covered properly. Pani Lageat had received the
strictest command not to admit any one, not even "Queen
Victoria herself," should she come. Svirski now opened
and now closed the curtains which hid the window of
the skylight; but while drawing the cords he looked
unceasingly at his charming model.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the ladies removed their hats, and Panna
Maria inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What must I do now?"</p>

<p>"First of all, it is necessary to let down your hair,"
said Svirski.</p>

<p>He approached her, and she raised both hands to her
head. It was clear that this confused her somewhat, and
seemed strange, but also nice. Svirski gazed at her
confused face, at her drooping eyelashes, at her form bent
backward, at her exquisite outline of hips, and said to
himself that, in that great dust heap of Nice, he had
discovered a genuine double pearl.</p>

<p>The hair fell, after a moment, on her shoulders. Panna
Maria shook her head, wishing to spread her hair, which
then covered her completely.</p>

<p>"Corpo Dio!" exclaimed Svirski.</p>

<p>Then came the turn for a more difficult task,&mdash;placing
the model.</p>

<p>Svirski saw plainly that her heart was beating with
more life in the maiden, that her breast was moving
more quickly, that her cheeks were flushed, that she
had to conquer herself and overcome an instinctive
resistance, which she herself could not define, and at the
same time she was yielding with a certain alarm which
resembled an unknown delight.</p>

<p>"No! this is no common model," said Svirski to himself;
<span class="pagenum">[471]</span>
"this is something else; and I am not looking on
her merely as an artist." In fact, he also felt troubled,
and his fingers trembled a little while he was placing her
head on the pillow; but, wishing to save her and himself
from embarrassment, he spoke to her jestingly, feigning
temper.</p>

<p>"Lie quietly, in that way! Besides, we must do something
for art. Oh, the position is perfect now! In this
way the profile comes out beautifully on the red background.
If you could see it! But that cannot be.
You must not laugh! You must sleep. Now I will
paint."</p>

<p>And he began to paint; but while painting he chatted,
as his custom was, told stories, and asked Pani Cervi
of past times. He learned from her that "Maria" had
held a good position the year before as reader for a
Polish countess, the daughter of a great manufacturer
of Lodz, Atrament by name; but the position lasted only
till the countess learned that Maria's father and grandfather
had served in the Italian army. This was a great
disappointment, for the dream of mother and daughter
had been that Maria should hold such a place with some
lady who passed every winter in Nice; for in that case
they would have no need to separate.</p>

<p>The artist was roused in Svirski meanwhile. He
wrinkled his brows, concentrated his mind, looked across
the handle of the brush, and painted persistently. From
time to time he laid down the pallet, approached the
model, and, taking her lightly by the temples, corrected
the position of her head. At such movements he bent
toward her more nearly perhaps than was required by the
interest of art; and, when the warmth from her youthful
body struck him, when he looked at her long eyelashes
and her lips slightly parted, a quiver went through his
<span class="pagenum">[472]</span>
bones, his fingers began to tremble nervously, and in
spirit he called to himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold up, old man! What the deuce is this? hold up!"</p>

<p>She simply pleased him with his whole soul. Her
confusion, her blushes, her timid glances, which still
were not devoid of maiden coquettishness, made him
happy beyond expression. All this proved to Svirski
that she did not look on him as too old. He felt
that he pleased her also. The grandfather in his time
must have told her wonderful things about his countrymen;
he had roused her imagination, perhaps; and now
at last one of them had come in her way&mdash;not some
common man, but one honorable and famous, who,
besides, had appeared as in a fairy tale, at the moment
of direst need, with assistance and an honest heart.
How could she help feeling sympathy for him and
looking at him with interest and gratitude?</p>

<p>All this caused the time to pass for Svirski till midday
in such a manner that he did not even notice it. But at
midday Panna Maria was the first to declare that she
must return, for her grandfather was alone, and it was
time to think of lunch for him. Svirski then begged the
ladies to come in the afternoon. If they could not leave
the old man alone, perhaps they had an acquaintance
who would consent to stay with him for two hours.
Maybe the gatekeeper, or her husband, or some one else
of the family would do so? It was a question of the
picture. Two sittings a day would be an excellent
thing! After that there might be some new work; meanwhile,
two sittings a day would be useful for both sides.
If there should be expense in finding some one to care
for the old man, he, Svirski, would consider it a favor
if he were permitted to bear it, for first of all he was
anxious about the picture.
<span class="pagenum">[473]</span>
</p>

<p>Two sittings were really too profitable to be refused
by Pani Cervi in view of poverty at home. It was
agreed, therefore, that they would come at two in
the afternoon. Meanwhile the fortunate Svirski resolved
to conduct them home. At the gate they were met
by his hostess, who gave Svirski a bunch of moss roses,
saying that they were brought by two handsome boys
attended by a wonderfully dressed servant. The boys
wanted absolutely to enter the studio; but she, remembering
his command, did not permit them.</p>

<p>Svirski answered that she had done well, then, taking
the roses, he gave them all to Panna Maria. After a
while they were on the Promenade des Anglais. To
Svirski, Nice seemed beautiful and animated in a way
that he had never seen before. The variety and bustle
on the "Promenade," which had angered him at
other times, began now to amuse him. On the way
he saw Vyadrovski and De Sinten, who halted at sight
of him. Svirski bowed and went on, but in passing
he noted how De Sinten put a monocle to his eye to
look at Panna Cervi, and heard his "Prristi!"
<a name="FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
full of astonishment. Both even followed them awhile, but
opposite the "Jet&eacute;e Promenade" Svirski called a carriage
and took the ladies home.</p>

<p>On the way, he was seized by a desire to invite the whole
family to lunch; but he thought that there would be
trouble with the old man, and that, in view of their short
acquaintance, Pani Cervi might be surprised at such a
sudden invitation. But he promised himself that when
the grandfather had some person to care for him he
would, under pretext of saving time, arrange a lunch in
the studio. Taking leave of the mother and daughter at
the gate, he hurried into the first hotel he found and
<span class="pagenum">[474]</span>
ordered lunch. He swallowed a few kinds of food,
without knowing himself what he was, eating. Pani
Elzen, Romulus, and Remus, with the moss roses, shot
through his mind repeatedly, but in a way which was
really ghost-like. A few days before the beautiful widow
and their relations were questions of prime importance
for him, over which he had tortured his head not a
little. He recalled also that internal struggle through
which he had passed on the sea while returning to Villa
Franca. Now he said to himself, "This has ceased to
exist for me, and I will not think again of it." So he
felt not the least alarm, not the least compunction. On
the contrary, it seemed to him that a kind of oppressive
burden had dropped from his shoulders, and all his
thoughts ran to Panna Cervi. His eyes and his head
were full of her; by the power of imagination he saw
her again, with dishevelled hair and closed eyelids;
and when he thought that in an hour he would touch her
temples with his fingers, that he would bend over her
again and feel the warmth radiating from her, he felt
elated, as if by wine, and for the second time asked
himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hei, old man, what is happening thee?"</p>

<p>When he reached home, he found a telegram from Pani
Elzen, "I expect you to dinner at six." Svirski crushed
the paper and put it in his pocket; when Pani Cervi and
her daughter arrived, he had forgotten it altogether, so
that when his work was done at five he began to think
where to dine, and was angry that he had nothing to do
with himself that evening.
<span class="pagenum">[475]</span>
</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">NEXT day when Pani Lageat brought a lunch for
three persons to the studio, she stated that an hour
before the same two handsome boys had come, this time,
however, not with a strangely dressed servant, but with a
youthful and beautiful lady.</p>

<p>"The lady wanted absolutely to see you; but I told
her that you had gone to Antibes."</p>

<p>"To Toulon! to Toulon!" cried the artist, joyously.</p>

<p>Next morning there was no one to whom Pani Lageat
could give that answer, for only a letter came. Svirski
did not read it. That day it happened that while trying
to correct Panna Cervi's "position," he put his hand
under her shoulder, and raised her so that their bosoms
almost met, and her breath struck his face. Meanwhile
her face changed from emotion, and he said to himself
that if such a moment lasted longer, it would be worth
while to give life for it.</p>

<p>That evening he talked to himself as follows: "The
senses are playing in thee, but not as at other times; now
thy soul rushes forth after them, and rushes forth because
this is a child who in this 'pudridero' of Nice has remained
as pure as a tear. This is not even her merit, but
her nature; where could such another be found? This
time I am not deceiving myself, and I am not talking anything
into myself, for reality is speaking."</p>

<p>And it seemed to him that a sweet dream was taking
hold of him. Unfortunately, after sleep comes waking.
To Svirski, it came two days later in the form of one more
telegram, which, shoved in through an opening in the
<span class="pagenum">[476]</span>
door intended for letters and newspapers, fell on the floor
in presence of both women.</p>

<p>Panna Maria, while preparing to let down her hair, saw
the telegram first, and, raising the envelope, handed it to
Svirski.</p>

<p>He opened it unwillingly, looked; and confusion was
evident on his face.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, ladies," said he, after a while. "I have
received such news that I must go at once."</p>

<p>"I hope at least that it is nothing bad," said Panna
Maria, with alarm.</p>

<p>"No, no! But perhaps I shall not be able to return to
the afternoon sitting. In every case work is over for
to-day; but to-morrow I shall be calm."</p>

<p>Then he took leave of them somewhat feverishly, but
with exceeding cordiality, and next moment he was in a
carriage which, at his command, was to go straight to
Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>When he had passed the "Jet&eacute;e Promenade," he
took out the telegram and read it again. It was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I expect you this afternoon; if you do not come by the
four o'clock train, I shall know what to think, and how
to act.</p>

<p style="text-align : right"><span class="smcap">Morphine.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Svirski was simply frightened at the signature, especially
as he was under the recent impression of the event
with Kresovich. "Who knows," said he in his mind,
"to what a woman may be brought, not by genuine love,
but by wounded vanity? I should not have acted as
I have. It was easy to answer her first letter&mdash;and
break with her. It is not proper to trifle with any
one, whether good or bad. At present I must break with
<span class="pagenum">[477]</span>
her decisively; but I must go without waiting for the
four o'clock train."</p>

<p>And he urged on the driver. At moments he strengthened
himself with the hope that Pani Elzen would not, in
any case, attempt her own life. That seemed utterly
unlike her. But at moments he was possessed by doubt.
If that monstrous egotism of hers is turned into a feeling
of offence, would it not urge her to some insane
act?</p>

<p>He remembered that there was a certain stubbornness
in her character, a certain decision, and no little
courage. Regard for her children, it is true, ought to
restrain her; but did she really care for those children?
And at thought of what might happen, the hair rose
on his head. Conscience moved in him again, and a
profound internal struggle began. The picture of Panna
Cervi passed before his eyes every moment, rousing
bitter and immense regret. He repeated to himself, it
is true, that he was going to break with Pani Elzen; that
he would break with her decisively; at the bottom of his
soul, however, he felt a great fear. What would happen
if that woman, vain and malicious, as well as determined,
should say to him, "Thee, or morphine"? And meanwhile,
with the alarm and uncertainty, there was born in
his mind a disgust; for it seemed to him that the question
could be put that way only by some counterfeit
heroine belonging to "vile literature." But still what
would happen if she should put it so? In society, especially
in the society of Nice, there are many women who
belong to "vile literature."</p>

<p>In the midst of these thoughts, and in a cloud of gray
dust, he arrived finally at Monte Carlo, and ordered the
driver to stop in front of the H&ocirc;tel de Paris. But before
he had time to alight he descried Romulus and Remus
<span class="pagenum">[478]</span>
on the turf with netted clubs in their hands; throwing
up balls under the care of a Cossack whom Pani Lageat
had called the strangely dressed servant. They, when
they saw him, ran up.</p>

<p>"Good-day, sir!"</p>

<p>"Good-day."</p>

<p>"Good-day! Is mamma upstairs?"</p>

<p>"No. Mamma has gone bicycling with M. de Sinten."</p>

<p>Silence followed.</p>

<p>"Ah! mamma has gone bicycling with De Sinten?"
repeated Svirski. "Well!"</p>

<p>And after a while he added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"True! she expected me only at four o'clock."</p>

<p>Then he began to laugh.</p>

<p>"The tragedy ends in a farce. But this, however, is
the Riviera! Still what an ass I am!"</p>

<p>"Will you wait for mamma?" asked Romulus.</p>

<p>"No. Listen, my boys. Tell your mamma that I
came to say good-bye to her, and that I am sorry not to
find her, because I am going on a journey to-day."</p>

<p>Then he gave directions to return to Nice. That
evening he received one telegram more, in which there
was the single word, "Scoundrel!"</p>

<p>After reading it he fell into excellent humor, for the
telegram was not signed this time, "Morphine."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">TWO weeks later the picture "Sleep and Death" was
finished. Svirski began another which he intended
to call "Euterpe." But his work did not advance.
He said that the light was too sharp; and for
whole sittings, instead of painting, he was looking at the
<span class="pagenum">[479]</span>
bright face of Panna Cervi. He seemed to be seeking
the proper expression for Euterpe. He gazed so persistently
that the lady grew red under the influence of his
eyes; he felt in his breast an increasing disquiet. At
last, on a certain morning, he said suddenly, in a kind of
strange, altered voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I notice that you ladies love Italy immensely."</p>

<p>"We and grandfather," answered Panna Cervi.</p>

<p>"I, too. Half my life passes in Rome and in Florence.
There the light is not so sharp at present, and it would
be possible to paint whole days. Oh, yes! Who could
help loving Italy! And do you know what I think
sometimes?"</p>

<p>Panna Maria lowered her head, and, opening her lips
somewhat, began to look at him carefully, as she always
did when listening to him.</p>

<p>"I think that every man has two fatherlands: one his
own, the nearer, and the other Italy. Only think, all
culture, all art, all science, everything came from there.
Let us take, for instance, the Renaissance.... Really,
all are, if not the children, at least the grandchildren of
Italy."</p>

<p>"True," answered Panna Maria.</p>

<p>"I do not know whether I mentioned that I have a
studio in the Via Margutta in Rome, and that when the
light becomes too sharp in this studio I am yearning for
that one. Here it is&mdash;if we should all go to Rome&mdash;that
would be perfect! Afterward we could go to
Warsaw."</p>

<p>"There is no way to carry out that plan," answered
Panna Maria, with a sad smile.</p>

<p>But he approached her quickly, and, taking her two
hands, began to speak, looking at her with the greatest
tenderness in his eyes.
<span class="pagenum">[480]</span>
</p>

<p>"There is a way, dear lady, there is a way! Do you
not divine it?"</p>

<p>And when she grew pale from happiness, he pressed
both her palms to his breast, and added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give me thyself and thine&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<h2>THAT THIRD WOMAN.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE rent for that studio in which Antek Svyatetski
and I lived and painted, was unpaid, first, because
we had about five rubles joint capital, and, second, because
we felt a sincere repugnance to paying house-rent.</p>

<p>People call us artists squanderers; as for me, I would
rather drink away my money than waste it in paying a
house-owner.</p>

<p>Our house-owner was not a bad fellow though, and,
moreover, we found means of defence against him.</p>

<p>When he came to dun us, which was usually in the
morning, Antek, who slept on a straw bed on the floor,
and covered himself with a Turkish curtain used by us
as a background for portraits, would rise to a sitting posture,
and say in sepulchral tones,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is well that I see you, for I dreamed that you were
dead."</p>

<p>The house-owner, who was superstitious, and dreaded
death evidently, was confused at once and beyond measure.
Antek would throw himself back on the straw bed,
stretch his legs, fold his hands across his breast, and
continue,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You were just like this; you had white gloves on
your hands, the fingers were too long; on your feet patent-leather
<span class="pagenum">[484]</span>
boots; for the rest, you were not changed
much."</p>

<p>Then I would add, "Sometimes those dreams come
true."</p>

<p>It seems that this "sometimes" brought the man to
despair. At last he would fall into a rage, slam the door
after him; and we could hear him rush downstairs four
steps at a time, swearing by what the world stands on.
Still the honest soul did not like to send the house-bailiff
to us. In truth, there was not much to take; and he
had calculated that were he to bring other artists to
that studio, and the kitchen adjoining, the story would
be the same, or still worse.</p>

<p>Our sharp method grew dull in time, however. The
house-owner became accustomed to the thought of death.
Antek had the idea to finish three pictures in the style
of W&uuml;rtz, "Death," "Burial," and "Waking from Lethargy."
Naturally our man was to figure in all of
them.</p>

<p>Such funereal subjects became a specialty for Antek,
who, as he says himself, paints "corpses big, medium,
and small size." This is the reason, of course, why no
one buys his pictures; for, subjects aside, he has talent.
He has sent to the Paris Salon two "corpses," and as I
also sent my "Jews on the Vistula," which in the catalogue
of the Salon are christened "Jews on the Babylon,"
we were both waiting impatiently for the decision of
the <i>jury</i>.</p>

<p>Of course Antek foresaw that the worst would happen,
that the <i>jury</i> would be made up of perfect idiots,
and even if not made up of idiots, I am an idiot, he is
an idiot, our pictures are idiotic, and reward for them
would be the summit of idiocy!</p>

<p>How much blood that monkey has spoiled in me during
<span class="pagenum">[485]</span>
the two years that we have lived in one studio, I
cannot tell.</p>

<p>Antek's whole ambition is to pass for a moral "corpse."
In company he poses as a drunkard, which he is not.
He will pour down two or three tiny glasses of vodka,
and turn to see if we are looking; if not sure that we
are, he will punch one of us with his elbow frown and
say, in subterranean tones,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, how low I have fallen, that far! Is it possible?"</p>

<p>We answer that he is a fool. He falls into a rage
then; nothing can bring him into worse humor than to
show disbelief in his moral fall. Still, he is an honest
fellow to the marrow of his bones.</p>

<p>Once he and I went astray in the mountains of Salzkammergut,
near Zell am See. Since night had come it
was easy to break one's neck.</p>

<p>"Dost hear," said Antek to me, "thou hast more
talent than I, therefore life is a greater loss to thee. I
will go ahead. If I fall, thou wilt stay on the spot till
morning, and in the morning thou canst save thyself
somehow."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt not go ahead; I will go, because I can
see better."</p>

<p>"If I don't break my neck to-day," said Antek, "I'll
finish in the canal&mdash;it's all one to me."</p>

<p>We fall to disputing. Meanwhile it has become as
dark as in a cellar. In the end of ends we conclude to
go at hazard. We advance cautiously.</p>

<p>The place is wide enough at first, but afterward narrower
and narrower. As far as we can see, on the
right and left are abysses, probably bottomless.</p>

<p>The ridge grows still narrower, and, what is more,
pieces of stone, loosened by the wind, fall away from
under our feet.
<span class="pagenum">[486]</span>
</p>

<p>"I will go on my hands and knees; 'tis impossible to
go any other way!" said Antek.</p>

<p>In truth, 'tis impossible to go any other way, so
we go on our hands and knees, advancing like two
chimpanzees.</p>

<p>But soon it appears that that too is impossible. The
back of the cliff becomes as narrow as a horse's back.
Antek sits astride of it, I also, and leaning on our hands
put down before us we pushed forward with uncommon
damage to our clothing. After a certain time I hear the
voice of my comrade,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vladek?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"The ridge has come to an end."</p>

<p>"And what is there beyond?"</p>

<p>"Emptiness&mdash;there must be a precipice."</p>

<p>"Take a stone and throw it, we will listen to hear if it
is a long time falling."</p>

<p>In the darkness I hear Antek feeling to find a fragment
of crumbling rock.</p>

<p>"I am throwing," said he, "listen."</p>

<p>I open both ears.</p>

<p>Silence!</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard anything?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"We have ended up nicely! The place must be a
hundred fathoms deep."</p>

<p>"Throw once more."</p>

<p>Antek finds a larger stone, throws it.</p>

<p>No sound!</p>

<p>"What does this mean, no bottom, or what?" asked
Antek.</p>

<p>"Hard to help it! We will sit here till morning."</p>

<p>We are sitting there. Antek throws a couple of
<span class="pagenum">[487]</span>
stones more; all in vain. An hour passes, a second, at
last I hear my friend's voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vladek, but don't go to sleep&mdash;hast a cigarette?"</p>

<p>It appears that I have cigarettes, but we have used
up our matches. Despair! The hour may be one
in the morning, or not even so late. Very fine rain begins
to fall. Around us, darkness impenetrable. I come
to the conclusion that people who live in towns or in
villages have no idea of what silence is,&mdash;silence like
that which surrounds us, silence which rings in our ears.
I almost hear the blood coursing in my veins; I hear the
beating of my own heart perfectly. At first the position
interests me. To sit in the midst of the silent night on
the back of a cliff, as on a horse, and right over a bottomless
abyss, that could not be done by some shopkeeper
of the city; but soon the air becomes cold, and, to crown
everything, Antek begins to philosophize,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is life? Life is just swinishness. People talk
about art! art! May I and art be &mdash;&mdash;. Art is pure
monkeying with nature, and meanness besides. Twice
I have seen the Salon. Painters sent in so many pictures
that one might have made canvas beds of them
for all the Jews living; and what were these pictures?
The lowest possible pandering to shopkeepers' tastes,
painted for money, or the stuffing of stomachs. A chaos
of art, nothing more! Were that art, I would that paralysis
had struck it; luckily there is no real art upon
earth&mdash;there is only nature. Maybe nature is swinishness
also. The best would be to jump down here&mdash;and
end everything quickly. I would do so if I had
vodka; but as I have no vodka, I will not, for I have
made a vow not to die sober."</p>

<p>I was used to this gabbling of Antek's; still, in that
silence and bewilderment, in cold, in darkness, at the
<span class="pagenum">[488]</span>
edge of a precipice, his words made even me gloomy.
Fortunately he talked himself out and stopped. He
threw a couple of stones more, repeated a couple of
times more, "Not a sound," and then for three hours we
were silent.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that daybreak would come before
long, when suddenly we heard a calling and the sound
of wings.</p>

<p>It was dark yet, and I could see nothing; I was
certain, however, that eagles were beginning to circle
over the precipice. "Kra! kra!" was heard with greater
force above and in the darkness. It astonished me to
hear such a multitude of voices, just as if whole legions
of eagles were passing. But, happen what might, they
were heralding daylight.</p>

<p>After a while, I saw my hands resting on the rocky
edge; then Antek's shoulders were outlined in front of
me, precisely like a dark object on a ground somewhat
less dark. That ground grew paler each instant. Then
a rich, light silver tone began to shine in on the rocks
and on Antek's shoulders. This color filled the darkness
more and more, just as if into that darkness some
one were pouring a silver liquid which permeated it,
mixed with it, and from black made it gray, from gray
pearl-color. There was also a certain severity and dampness
about us; not only the cliff but the air too seemed
moist.</p>

<p>Now more light comes every moment. I am looking,
trying to fix in my mind those changes in tone, and am
painting a little in my soul, when all at once Antek's cry
interrupts me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tfu! idiots!"</p>

<p>And his shoulders vanish from my eyes.</p>

<p>"Antek!" I cry, "what are thou doing?"
<span class="pagenum">[489]</span>
</p>

<p>"Don't howl! look here!"</p>

<p>I bend over, look&mdash;what appears? I am sitting on
a rocky cliff which slopes down to a meadow, lying perhaps
a yard and a half below me. The moss deadened
the sound of the stones, for the meadow is very level;
at a distance the road is visible, and on it crows, which
I took for eagles. To walk home with the greatest comfort
it was merely necessary to take our legs off the
rock.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we had been sitting on that rock, our
teeth chattering, through the whole of God's night.</p>

<p>I know not why, but while waiting in the studio
with Antek for the house-owner, that adventure of a
year and a half before came to my mind, as if it had
happened the previous day. That recollection gave me
great solace; therefore I said at once,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dost remember, Antek, how we thought ourselves
sitting on the edge of a precipice, and it turned out
that there was a level road right before us? It may
be the same to-day. We are as poor as church mice, as
thou knowest; the house-owner wants to turn us out of
the studio; meanwhile all things may change. Let some
sluice of glory and money open out to us."</p>

<p>Antek was sitting just then on the straw bed, pulling
on his boots, grumbling the while that life was made up
of pulling boots on in the morning and pulling them
off at night; that only the man had sense who had
courage to hang himself, which, if he, Antek, had not
done hitherto, it was simply because he was not only a
supreme fool, but a low coward besides.</p>

<p>My outburst of optimism interrupted his meditation;
so he raised his fishy eyes and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou, beyond all men, hast something to rejoice at;
the other day Suslovski drove thee from his house and
<span class="pagenum">[490]</span>
the heart of his daughter; to-day the house-owner will
drive thee from the studio."</p>

<p>Alas! Antek told the truth. Three days before I was
the betrothed of Kazia Suslovski, but on Tuesday morning&mdash;yes,
on Tuesday, I received from her father the
following letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 <span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>
 ,&mdash;Our daughter, yielding to the persuasion
 of her parents, has consented to break the tie which for
 her would have been a misfortune. She may find a refuge
 at all times on the bosom of her mother and under the roof
 of her father; but it pertains specially to us, her parents,
 to avoid this extremity. Not only your material position,
 but your frivolous character, which, in spite of every effort,
 you are unable to conceal, inclines us and our daughter to
 return you your word, and to break with you further relations,
 which, however, does not change our good will toward
 you.
</p>
<p style="text-align : right; margin-right : 8em">
 With esteem,
</p>

<p style="text-align : right">
 <span class="smcap">
  Heliodor Suslovski.
 </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such was the letter; I agree more or less with this,
that out of my material position dog's boots might be
made; but what that pathetic gorilla knows of my
character I, in truth, do not understand.</p>

<p>Kazia's head brings to mind types from the time of
the Directory; and it would be finer if she would dress
her hair, not in the fashion of to-day, but of that time.
I tried even to beg her to do so, but in vain, since she
has no mind for such things. But she has a complexion
as warm as if Fortuni had painted it.</p>

<p>For that very reason I loved her sincerely; and the
first day, after receiving the letter from her father, I went
about as if poisoned. Only on the second day, and that
in the evening, did I feel a little easier, and say to myself,
"If not, then not." It helped me most to bear the
<span class="pagenum">[491]</span>
blow that I had my head filled with the Salon and with
my "Jews." I was convinced that the picture was a
good one, though Antek predicted that it would be
thrown, not only out of the Salon, but out of the antechamber.
I began the picture the year before in this
way: It is evening. I am walking alone for amusement
by the Vistula. I look; I see a basket of apples lost in
the river; street Arabs are fishing the apples out of the
water; and on the bank are sitting a whole Jewish
family in such despair that they are not even lamenting,
they are clasping their hands, and looking into the water,
as dumb as statues. There is an old Jew there, a patriarch,
a poor devil; an old Jewess; a young Jew, a colossal
creature as big as Judas Maccab&aelig;us; a maiden, freckled
somewhat, but with immense character in the outline of
her nose and mouth; finally two little Jews. Twilight
is coming; the river has a bronze reflection which is
simply miraculous. The trees on Saxon Island are all
in the light of evening; beyond the island is water,
widely spread, tones purple, ultra-marine, tones almost
steel, then again tones passing into purple and violet.
The a&euml;rial perspective, splendid! The transition from
some tones to others so subtile and marvellous that the
soul just pipes in a man; round about it is quiet, bright
calm. Melancholy over all things so that there is a
wish to weep; and that group in mourning, sitting as if
each person in it had been posing in studios.</p>

<p>In a moment the thought flashed into my head: That
is my picture!</p>

<p>I had my portfolio with me, and colors, for I never go
walking without them; I begin to sketch on the spot,
but I say to the Jews,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sit as you are, don't move!&mdash;a ruble to each one at
dark."
<span class="pagenum">[492]</span>
</p>

<p>My Jews see the point, in a twinkle, and, as it were,
grow to the ground. I sketch and sketch. The street
Arabs crawl out of the water, and soon I hear behind
me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Painter! painter! When a man steals a thing, he
says that he found it."</p>

<p>But I answer them in their jargon, and win them at
once; they even stop throwing chips at the Jews, so as
not to injure my work. But, as an offset, my group fall
unexpectedly into good humor.</p>

<p>"Jews," cry I, "be sorrowful;" but the old woman
answers,&mdash;</p>

<p>"With permission, Pan artist, how can we be sorrowful
when you promise us each one a ruble? Let him be sad
who has no profit."</p>

<p>I have to threaten them that I will not pay.</p>

<p>I sketched for two evenings; then they posed for me
two months in the studio. Let Antek say what he
pleases, the picture is good, for there is nothing cold in it;
it has pure truth and a tremendous lot of nature. I left
even the freckles on the young Jewess. The faces might
be more beautiful; but they could not be truer or have
greater character.</p>

<p>I thought so much of this picture that I bore the loss
of Kazia more easily. When Antek reminded me of her,
the subject seemed one of long ago. Meanwhile, my
comrade pulled on his other boot, and I heated the
samovar. Old Antonia came with cakes; Antek had been
persuading this woman in vain for a year to hang herself.
We sat down to tea.</p>

<p>"Why art thou so glad?" asked Antek, peevishly.</p>

<p>"Because I know that thou wilt see something of
uncommon interest to-day."</p>

<p>At this moment we hear steps approaching the studio.
<span class="pagenum">[493]</span>
</p>

<p>"Thy house-owner! There is thy 'something uncommon'!"</p>

<p>Saying this, Antek gulps down his tea, which is so hot
that tears fill his eyes. Up he springs; and since our
little kitchen is in the passage, he hides in the studio
behind the costumes, and from his hiding-place cries, with
a panting voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou! he loves thee immensely, talk thou to him."</p>

<p>"He is dying for thee!" answer I, flying to the costumes,
"talk thou to him!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the door opens, and who comes in? Not
the house-owner, but the watchman of the house in which
the Suslovskis are living.</p>

<p>We rush out from behind the costumes.</p>

<p>"I have a letter for you," says the watchman.</p>

<p>I take the letter. By Hermes! it is from Kazia! I
tear open the envelope, and read as follows,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I am certain that my parents will forgive us. Come at
once; never mind the early hour. We have just returned
from the waters in the garden.</p>

<p style="text-align : right">
 <span class="smcap">
  Kazia.
 </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea what the parents really have to forgive
me, but neither have I time to think of it, for I am
losing my head from amazement. Only after a while do
I give the letter to Antek, and say to the watchman,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friend, tell the young lady that I will come right
away&mdash;wait, I have no small money, but here are three
rubles [all I have] change the bill, take a ruble for yourself,
and bring me the rest."</p>

<p>Speaking in parenthesis, the monster took the three
rubles, and did not show himself again. He knew, the
abortion, that I would not raise a scandal at Suslovski's,
and took advantage of the position most dishonorably.
But at the time I didn't even notice it.
<span class="pagenum">[494]</span>
</p>

<p>"Well, Antek, what?" ask I.</p>

<p>"Nothing! Every calf will find its butcher."</p>

<p>The haste with which I was dressing did not permit
me to find an answer befitting this insult from Antek.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">A QUARTER of an hour later I ring at Suslovski's.
Kazia herself opens the door. She is comely;
she has about her yet the warmth of sleep, and also the
freshness of morning, which she brought from the garden
in the folds of her muslin robe, which is pale blue in color.
Her hat, just removed, has dishevelled her hair somewhat.
Her face is smiling; her eyes are smiling; her
moist lips are smiling,&mdash;she is just like the morning. I
seize her hands, kiss them, and kiss her arms to the
elbows. She bends to my ear and inquires,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But who loves better?"</p>

<p>Then she leads me by the hand to the presence of her
parents. Old Suslovski has the mien of a Roman who is
sacrificing <i>pro patria</i> the life of his only child; the
mother is dropping tears into her coffee, for both are at
coffee. But they rise at sight of us, and Papa Suslovski
speaks,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Reason and duty would command me to answer, no!
but the heart of a parent has its rights&mdash;if this is weakness,
let God judge me!"</p>

<p>Here he raises his eyes in proof that he will be ready
to answer, if the tribunal of Heaven begins to write a
protocol that moment. I had never seen anything more
Roman in my life, unless macaroni sold on the Corso.
The moment is so impressive that a hippopotamus might
<span class="pagenum">[495]</span>
burst from emotion. The solemnity is increased by Pani
Suslovski, who crosses her hands, and says in a tearful
voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My children, should you have trouble in the world at
any time take refuge here&mdash;here!"</p>

<p>While saying this, she pointed to her bosom.</p>

<p>She could not fool me! I was not to be taken for
preservation there&mdash;there! If Kazia had offered me a
similar refuge, it would have been different. Still I am
amazed at the honesty of the Suslovskis, and my heart
is filled with gratitude. I drink so many glasses of
coffee from emotion that the Suslovskis begin to cast
anxious glances at the coffee-pot and the cream. Kazia
fills my cup continually; I try at the same time to press
her foot under the table. But she draws it back always,
shaking her head meanwhile, and smiling so roguishly
that I know not how I escaped jumping out of my
skin.</p>

<p>I sit an hour and a half; but at last I must go, for in
the studio Bobus is waiting for me,&mdash;Bobus who takes
drawing-lessons, and leaves me a note each time, with a
coat of arms on it, but I lose those notes generally.
Kazia and her mother conduct me to the entrance; I am
angry at that, for I want Kazia alone to conduct me.
What a mouth she has!</p>

<p>My road leads through the city garden. It is full of
people coming from the waters. On the way I notice
that all halt at sight of me. I hear whispers, "Magorski!
Magorski! that's he&mdash;" Young ladies, dressed in
muslin of every shade under which their forms are outlined
wonderfully, cast glances at me which seem as if
wishing to say, "Enter! the dwelling is ready!" What
the devil, am I so famous, or what? I fail to understand.</p>

<p>I go on&mdash;always the same thing. At the entrance
<span class="pagenum">[496]</span>
of the studio, I come against the house-owner, as a ship
against a rock. Oh, the rent!</p>

<p>But the man approaches me and says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear sir, though I have annoyed you sometimes,
believe me, I have so much&mdash;just permit me
simply&mdash;"</p>

<p>With that he seizes me around the neck and hugs me.
Ha! I understand, Antek must have told him that I am
going to marry; and he thinks that in future I shall pay
my rent regularly. Let him think so.</p>

<p>I thunder upstairs. On the way I hear a noise in our
quarters. I rush in. The studio is dark from smoke.
There I find Yulek Rysinski, Wah Poterkevich, Franek
Tsepkovski, old Sludetski, Karminski, Voytek Mihalak,&mdash;all
amusing themselves by driving the elegant Bobus
around on a string; but seeing me, they let him go,
barely alive, in the middle of the studio; then they
raise an unearthly uproar.</p>

<p>"We congratulate! congratulate! congratulate!"</p>

<p>"Up with him!"</p>

<p>In one moment I am in their arms, and for a certain
time they hurl me up, howling meanwhile in a way
befitting a pack of wolves; at last I find myself on the
floor. I thank them as best I can, and declare that they
must all be at my wedding, especially Antek, whom I
engage in advance as my best man.</p>

<p>Antek raises his hands and says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That soap thinks that we are congratulating him on
his marriage."</p>

<p>"But on what are you congratulating me?"</p>

<p>"How is that, don't you know?" asked every voice.</p>

<p>"I know nothing; what the hangman do you want?"</p>

<p>"Give him the morning number of 'The Kite,'" cries
Poterkevich.
<span class="pagenum">[497]</span>
</p>

<p>They give me the morning number of "The Kite,"
shouting, one interrupting the other, "Look among the
despatches!"</p>

<p>I look at the despatches, and read the following,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Special telegram to the 'The Kite.' Magorski's picture,
'The Jews on the river of Babylon,' received the great
gold medal of the Salon of the present year. The critics
cannot find words to describe the genius of the master.
Albert Wolff has called the picture a revelation. Baron
Hirsch offers fifteen thousand francs for it."</p>

<p>I am fainting! Help! I have lost my senses to that
degree that I cannot utter a word. I knew that my picture
was a success, but of such a success I had not even
dreamed. The number of "The Kite" falls from my
hand. They raise it and read to me among current
comments the following notes on the despatch,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Note I. We learn from the lips of the master himself
that he intends to exhibit his picture in our garden of
sirens.</p>

<p>"Note II. In answer to a question put by the vice-president
of the Society of Fine Arts to our master, whether
he intends to exhibit his masterpiece in Warsaw, he answered:
'I would rather not sell it in Paris than not
exhibit it in Warsaw.' We hope that those words will be
read by our posterity (God grant remote) on the monument
to the master.</p>

<p>"Note III. The mother of our master, on receiving the
despatch from Paris, fell seriously ill from emotion.</p>

<p>"Note IV. We learn at the moment of going to press,
that the mother of our master is improving.</p>

<p>"Note V. Our master has received invitations to exhibit
his picture in all the European capitals."</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the excess of these monstrous lies, I return to
my senses a little. Ostrynski, the editor of "The Kite,"
<span class="pagenum">[498]</span>
and at the same time an ex-suitor of Kazia's, must have
gone mad, for this passes every measure. It is natural
that I should exhibit the picture in Warsaw; but, I.
I have not mentioned that matter to any one; II. the
vice-president of the Society of Fine Arts has made no
inquiry of me touching anything; III. I have given him
no answer; IV. my mother died nine years ago; V. I
have not received an invitation from any quarter to
exhibit my picture.</p>

<p>Worse than all, it comes to my mind in one moment
that if the despatch is as truthful as the five notes,
then farewell to everything. Ostrynski, who half a
year since, in spite of the fact that her parents were
for him, received a basket
<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
from Kazia, wished perhaps
purposely to make a fool of me; if that is the case "he
will pay me with his head, or something else," as says
the libretto of a certain opera. My colleagues pacify me,
however, by saying that Ostrynski might fabricate the
notes, but the despatch must be genuine.</p>

<p>At the same time Stah Klosovich comes with a morning
number of "The Courier." The despatch is in "The
Courier." I recover breath.</p>

<p>Now congratulations in detail begin. Old Sludetski,
false to the core, but in manner sweet as syrup, shakes
my hand and says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Beloved God! I have always believed in the genius
of my colleague, and I have always defended him [I know
that he used to call me an ass]; but&mdash;Beloved God, perhaps
my colleague does not wish that such a <i>fa-presto</i> as
I should call my colleague, colleague; in that event let my
colleague forgive an old habit, Beloved God!"</p>

<p>In my soul I wish him hanged; but I cannot answer,
<span class="pagenum">[499]</span>
for at that moment Karminski draws me aside and tells
me in an undertone, but so that all hear him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Maybe my colleague needs money, if he does, let him
say the word, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Karminski is known among us for his professed willingness
to oblige. Time after time he says to some of
us, "If my colleague needs aid, let him say the word;
and then&mdash;till we meet again!" In truth, he has
money. I answer that if I do not find it elsewhere, I
will apply to him. Meanwhile other men come, true
as gold; and they squeeze me till my sides ache. At
last Antek appears; I see that he is moved, but he conceals
his emotion, and says roughly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Though thou art becoming a Jew, as I see, I
congratulate thee!"</p>

<p>"Though thou art becoming a fool, as I see, I thank
thee," and we embrace with all our strength. Poterkevich
mentions that it is dry in his throat. I haven't
a copper; but Antek has two rubles; others have as
much. A contribution follows, and punch. They drink
my health, throw me up again; and because I tell them
that the affair with the Suslovskis is settled, they drink
Kazia's health also. With that Antek comes to me and
says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dost think, youthful idiot, that they hadn't read the
despatch before the young woman wrote to thee?"</p>

<p>Oh, the monkey! how gladly I would give him a club
on the head. On one side the horizon was growing
bright for me; on the other, the devil was darkening it.
Anything might be expected of the Suslovskis; but that
Kazik
<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
should be capable of such calculation!</p>

<p>Still it was very likely that they had read the despatch
at the waters in the morning, and invited me straightway.
<span class="pagenum">[500]</span>
At the first moment I want to fly to the Suslovskis, and
stand before their eyes. But I cannot leave my company.
Meanwhile Ostrynski comes, elegant, cold, self-confident,
gloved as usual. Shrewdness is shining from
him, as light from a fire, for he is a rogue in full armor.
From the threshold he begins to wave his cane protectingly,
and says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Congratulations to the master; <i>I</i> too congratulate."</p>

<p>He uttered that "I" with an emphasis, as if congratulation
from him meant more than from any other man.
Perhaps it did really.</p>

<p>"How much you have invented!" cried I; "as truly
as you see me here, I learned all about myself in 'The
Kite.'"</p>

<p>"How does that concern me?" asked Ostrynski.</p>

<p>"I said nothing about exhibiting the picture either."</p>

<p>"But now you do," answered he, phlegmatically.</p>

<p>"And he has no mother, so his mother has not grown
weak!" cried Voytek Mihalak.</p>

<p>"That concerns me little," repeated Ostrynski, with
dignity taking off his second glove.</p>

<p>"But is the despatch true?"</p>

<p>"True."</p>

<p>That assurance pacifies me thoroughly. Through
thankfulness I pour out punch for him. He puts his lips
to the edge of the glass, drinks a sip, and says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"First to your health, and a second draught I drink
you know to whom. I congratulate you doubly."</p>

<p>"Where do you get your information?"</p>

<p>Ostrynski shrugs his shoulders. "Suslovski was in the
editorial rooms before eight o'clock this morning."</p>

<p>Antek begins to mutter something about mean people
in general; I can restrain myself no longer; I seize my
hat. Ostrynski follows me out; but I leave him on the
<span class="pagenum">[501]</span>
street; and a couple of minutes later I am ringing at Suslovski's
for the second time. Kazia opens the door; her
parents are not at home.</p>

<p>"Kazia!" ask I, severely, "didst thou know of the
despatch?"</p>

<p>"I knew," answered she, calmly.</p>

<p>"But, Kazik!"</p>

<p>"What was to be done, my dear? Do not wonder at
my parents; they must of course have some reasonable
cause to accept thee."</p>

<p>"But thou, Kazia?"</p>

<p>"I seized the first opportunity; dost take that ill of
me, Vladek?"</p>

<p>The question grows clear, and it seems to me that
Kazia is perfectly right. Speaking plainly, why did I
rush hither like a madman? Kazia comes up and rests
her head on my shoulder. I put my arm around her
waist; she drops her face toward my arm, closes her eyes,
pushes up her rosy mouth and whispers,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no, Vladek! not now&mdash;only after marriage, I
implore thee."</p>

<p>In view of that request, I press her lips to mine, and
we remain in that way as long as the process of breathing
permits. Kazia's eyes become languishing. At last,
she screens them with her arm, and says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I begged thee not to&mdash;"</p>

<p>The reproach and the look melt me to such a degree
that I kiss her a second time. When you love some one,
you have naturally a greater desire to give a kiss than a
blow to that person. And I love Kazia beyond measure
and wit, during life till death, after death! She, or none,
and that's the end of it!</p>

<p>Kazia, with panting voice, expresses the fear that I
have lost respect for her. Dearest creature, what nonsense
<span class="pagenum">[502]</span>
she utters! I pacify her as best I can, and we
begin to talk reasonably.</p>

<p>An agreement is made between us that if the parents
pretend that they heard of the despatch only after my
coming, I am not to let them know that I am aware how
affairs stand. I bid farewell then to Kazia, promising to
come in the evening.</p>

<p>In fact, I must rush to the office of the Society for Promoting
Fine Arts; through it I can communicate most
easily with the secretary of the Salon.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">I SEND a despatch stating that I accept Baron Hirsch's
price; but stipulate, first, to exhibit the picture in
Warsaw, etc.</p>

<p>For the sending of despatches and other needs I borrow
money in the institution. It is given without hesitation.
Everything goes as if on oil.</p>

<p>In "The Kite" and "The Courier" appears my biography,
in which, however, there is not one word of truth;
but as Ostrynski says, "How can that concern me?" I
have received also a request from two illustrated papers;
they wish to publish my portrait and reproduce my
picture. Let them do so. Money will be as abundant as
water.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">A WEEK later I receive the earnest money from Baron
Hirsch. The remainder will be paid when the purchaser
obtains possession of the canvas. Meanwhile, the
Bank of Commerce fires onto the table for me five thousand
<span class="pagenum">[503]</span>
francs in louis d'or. In life I have not seen so
much money. I come home laden down like a mule.</p>

<p>There is an assembly in the studio. I throw my coin
on the floor; and since I have never wallowed in gold, I
begin to wallow in it. After me Antek wallows. The
house-owner comes in, and thinks that we have lost our
senses. We amuse ourselves like cannibals.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">ONE day Ostrynski informs me that he feels happy
that he got a basket from Kazia, for prospects are
opening before him of which I cannot have the least idea.</p>

<p>I am very glad of this, or rather, it is all one to me;
I believe meanwhile that Ostrynski will take care of himself
in this life. When he was trying for Kazia, her
parents were on his side, especially Father Suslovski;
Ostrynski had even a complete preponderance over him,
pushed to the degree that that Roman lost his statuesqueness
in presence of this suitor. Kazia, however, could
not endure him from the first moment of their acquaintance.
It was some unconscious repugnance; as to other
things I am perfectly sure that he did not offend her
with that with which he offends me, and all who know
his nature thoroughly. He is a wonderful man, or rather
a wonderful man of letters. There are, of course, not
only among us, but in all the greater centres of literature
and art, men of whom, when you think, you ask involuntarily,
Whence comes their importance? To this
category belongs my friend of "The Kite." Who would
believe that the secret of Ostrynski's significance and the
reason of his mental position is this, that he does not love
and does not respect talents,&mdash;especially literary talents,&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum">[504]</span>
that he simply lives by disregarding them? He has
for them the contempt of a man to whom regularity of
life, a certain incisive quickness and great shrewdness
secure in society permanent victories over them.</p>

<p>One should see him at sessions, at artistic and literary
meetings, at jubilee dinners; with what condescending
irony he treats men who in the region of creativeness
have ten times more power than he; how he pushes
them to the wall; how he confuses them with his logic,
with his judgment; how he overwhelms them with his
literary importance!</p>

<p>Whenever Antek thinks of this, he calls for a slat
from the bedstead with which to crack Ostrynski's skull;
but Ostrynski's preponderance does not astonish me.
People of genuine talent are frequently awkward, timid,
devoid of marked quickness and mental equilibrium. It
is only when genuine talent is alone with itself that
wings grow out on its shoulders; Ostrynski in such a
position could only go to sleep, for he has absolutely
nothing to say to himself.</p>

<p>The future brings order, gives rank, and assigns to each
man his own proper place. Ostrynski is too clever not to
know this; but in his soul he laughs at it. For him, 'tis
enough that at present he has greater significance than
others, and that people count more with him than with
men better than he.</p>

<p>We painters stand less in his way. Still he advertises
the talents of writers at times, but only when urged by
the interest of "The Kite" and in opposition to "The
Courier." For the rest, he is a good comrade, an agreeable
person. I can say that I like the man; but&mdash;devil
take him!&mdash;we've had enough of Ostrynski.
<span class="pagenum">[505]</span>
</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THEY will make me slam the door some day.</p>

<p>What a comedy! Since I have won reputation and
money, Suslovski, in spite of my forethought, treats me
simply with contempt; his wife, all Kazia's relatives,
male and female, meet me frigidly.</p>

<p>On the first evening Suslovski announces that if I
suppose that my new position has influenced their action,
or if I suppose&mdash;which for that matter is evident in me&mdash;that
I am doing them a favor, I am mistaken. Though
ready to sacrifice much for the happiness of their child,
still even that only child cannot ask them to sacrifice
their human dignity. The mother adds, that, in case of
need, the child will know where to seek refuge. The
honest Kazia defends me at moments very angrily; but
they are in wait for every word of mine.</p>

<p>Barely do I open my mouth when Suslovski bites his
lips, looks at his wife and nods, as if to say, "I knew
that it would come to this." Such a saw have they fixed
for me from morning till evening.</p>

<p>And to think that all this is hypocrisy, that its special
service is to keep me in their net, that at the bottom of
the question they are after my fifteen thousand francs,
and that they are as anxious for them as I am, though
our motives are different.</p>

<p>It is time to finish.</p>

<p>They have brought me to this that I seem to myself to
have committed really some scoundrelism in getting the
gold medal and the fifteen thousand francs for my picture.
<span class="pagenum">[506]</span>
</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE day of my betrothal is drawing near. I buy a
beautiful ring in the style of Louis XV. which does
not please the Suslovskis, nor even Kazia, for in that
whole house there is no one who has an idea of real art.</p>

<p>I must work much yet over Kazia to destroy in her
vulgar preferences and teach her to feel artistically; but
since she loves me, I am hopeful.</p>

<p>I invited no one to the betrothal except Antek. I
wanted him to visit the Suslovskis as a preliminary; but
he declared, that though physically and morally bankrupt,
he has not become so degraded yet as to go
visiting. It cannot be helped! I forewarn the Suslovskis
that my friend is an original beyond compare, but a
painter of genius and the most honest man in the world.</p>

<p>Suslovski, learning that my friend paints "corpses,"
raises his brows, declaring that hitherto he has had to do
with decent people, that his whole official career is unspotted,
and that he hopes my friend will respect the
manners prevailing in an honorable and decorous house.</p>

<p>I confess to myself that I am not free from fears
touching Antek, and from the morning hours I am at
war with him. He insists on wearing leggings. I persuade,
I implore, I entreat.</p>

<p>At last he gives way, declaring that he sees no reason
decisively why he should not remain a fool. It is a pity
that his shoes remind one of explorers in Central Africa;
for no blacking has touched them since they were brought
from the shoemaker's on credit!</p>

<p>Still worse, Antek's head looks like the summit of the
Carpathian Mountains, covered with forests, torn by
<span class="pagenum">[507]</span>
columns of wind. I must put up with this, for there is no
comb on earth which could conquer that forelock;
but I force him to put on a frock coat, instead of the
blouse which he wears every day. He does this, but has
the look of one of his corpses, and falls into sepulchral
humor.</p>

<p>On the street people turn to look at his knotty stick
and his immense tattered hat; but I am accustomed to
this.</p>

<p>We ring; we enter.</p>

<p>In the antechamber, the voice of Cousin Yachkovich
reaches me; he is discoursing on overpopulation. Cousin
Yachkovich is always discoursing on overpopulation; that
is his hobby. Kazia looks in her muslin like a cloud, and
pretty. Suslovski is in a dress-coat; the relatives are in
dress-coats; the old aunts are in silk gowns.</p>

<p>Antek's entrance makes an impression. They look at
him with a certain disquiet. He looks around gloomily,
and informs Suslovski that in truth he would not have
come "unless Vladek were getting married, or something
of that sort."</p>

<p>This "something of that sort" is received most fatally.
Suslovski straightens himself with dignity, and inquires
what is meant by "something of that sort." Antek
answers that it is all one to him; but "for Vladek" he
might even knock his heels off, especially if he knew
that Pan Suslovski cared anything about the matter.
My future father-in-law looks at his wife, at me, at
Kazia, with a look in which amazement is struggling with
mortification.</p>

<p>Happily I save the position, and, with presence of mind
rare with me, beg my future father-in-law to present me
to those members of his family with whom I am still
unacquainted.
<span class="pagenum">[508]</span>
</p>

<p>The presentation follows; then we sit down. Kazia
sits near me, and lets her hand stay in mine. The room
is full of people; but all are stiff and silent. The atmosphere
is heavy.</p>

<p>Cousin Yachkovich begins again at his talk on overpopulation.
My Antek looks under the table. In the
silence the voice of Yachkovich is heard with increasing
shrillness; not having a front tooth, whenever he has to
pronounce sz, he utters a prolonged hiss.</p>

<p>"The most dreadful catastrophe may arise from this for
all Europe," said Yachkovich.</p>

<p>"Emigration," put in some one from aside.</p>

<p>"Statistics show, that emigration will not prevent overpopulation."</p>

<p>Suddenly Antek raises his head and turns his fishy
eyes toward the speaker. "Then Chinese customs should
be introduced among us," says he, with a gloomy bass.</p>

<p>"With permission,&mdash;what Chinese customs?"</p>

<p>"In China parents have the right to smother imbecile
children. Well, then, with us, children should have the
right to kill imbecile parents."</p>

<p>It has come! The bolt has struck; the sofa groans
under the aunts; and I am lost. Suslovski closes his
eyes, and loses speech for a season.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Then is heard the voice of my coming father-in-law,
trembling with terror,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear sir, I hope, that as a Christian&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why must I be a Christian?" interrupts Antek,
shaking his head ominously.</p>

<p>Another thunderbolt!</p>

<p>The sofa with the aunts begins to tremble as if in a
fever; it vanishes from my sight; I feel the earth opening
beneath me. All is lost; all hope is vain.
<span class="pagenum">[509]</span>
</p>

<p>Suddenly Kazia's laughter rings out, resonant as a bell;
then Yachkovich bursts into laughter, not knowing why;
after Yachkovich, I laugh, also not knowing why.</p>

<p>"Father!" cries Kazia, "Vladek forewarned father, that
Pan Svyatetski [Antek] is an original. Pan Svyatetski is
joking; he has a mother, I know that, and he is the best
of sons to her."</p>

<p>A rogue, not a maiden, that Kazia!&mdash;not only does she
invent, but she divines. In fact, Antek has a mother, and
he is a good son to her.</p>

<p>Kazia's words make a certain diversion. The entrance
of a servant with wine and cake makes a still greater
diversion. That servant is the watchman who took my
last three rubles; but now he is arrayed in a dress-coat,
and comes out with the dignity of a waiting-man. He
keeps his eyes fixed on the tray; the glasses rattle, and he
moves forward as slowly as if he were carrying glasses
filled with water. I begin to fear that he will drop them
all to the floor; fortunately my fear proves barren.</p>

<p>After a while the glasses are filled. We proceed to the
act of betrothal.</p>

<p>A little cousin holds a porcelain plate on which two
rings are lying. The eyes are creeping out of her head
with curiosity, and the whole ceremony causes her such
evident pleasure that she is dancing together with the
plate and rings. Suslovski rises; all rise; the noise of the
chairs is heard as they are pushed back.</p>

<p>Silence follows. I hear one of the matrons remark in
a whisper, how she had hoped that my ring "would be
better." In spite of this remark there is such solemnity
of feeling that flies are dropping from the wall.</p>

<p>Suslovski begins to speak,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My children, receive the blessing of your parents."</p>

<p>Kazia kneels; I kneel as well.
<span class="pagenum">[510]</span>
</p>

<p>What a physiognomy Antek must have at this moment,
what a face! I dare not look at him; I look at Kazia's
muslin robe, which, on the faded red sofa, makes a very
nice spot. The hands of Suslovski and of Pani Suslovski
rest on our heads; then my future father-in-law says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My daughter, thou hast had the best example at
home of what a wife should be to a husband, therefore I
need not teach thee thy duties, which moreover thy husband
will indicate to thee." (I hope so.) "But I turn
to thee, Pan Vladislav&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here begins a speech during which I count to one
hundred, and having counted to a hundred, I begin again
at one. Suslovski the citizen, Suslovski the official,
Suslovski the father, Suslovski the Roman, had the opportunity
of showing all his grandeur of soul. The words:
child, parents, duties, future, blessing, thorns, pure conscience,
buzz around my ears like a swarm of wasps, sit
on my head, sting me on the above-mentioned ears as
well as on my neck and forehead.</p>

<p>It must be that I tied my cravat too tightly, for it is
suffocating me. I hear the weeping of Pani Suslovski,
which affects me, for at heart she is an honest woman;
I hear the sound of the rings, held on the plate by the
dancing little cousin. O Lord Christ, what a face that
Antek must have!</p>

<p>At last we rise. The little cousin thrusts the plate
under my very eyes. Kazia and I exchange rings.</p>

<p>Uf! I am betrothed! I suppose this to be the end;
but no, Suslovski calls us to go and beg a blessing of all
the aunts.</p>

<p>We go. I kiss five hands which are like the feet of
storks. All the aunts hope that I will not deceive their
confidence.</p>

<p>What the devil confidence can they have in me?
<span class="pagenum">[511]</span>
Cousin Yachkovich seizes me in his embraces. Absolutely
I must have tied my cravat too tightly.</p>

<p>But the worst is over. Tea is brought in. I sit near
Kazia, and it seems to me all the time that I do not see
Antek. The monkey, he frightens me once more; when
the question whether he will have rum in his tea is
asked, he answers that he drinks rum only by the bottle.
At last the evening is ended successfully.</p>

<p>We go out. I draw in the air with full breast. Indeed,
my cravat was too tight.</p>

<p>Antek and I walk on in silence. The silence begins to
weigh on me and soon becomes unendurable. I feel that
I must talk to Antek, tell him something of my happiness,
how handsomely all has passed, how I love Kazia&mdash;</p>

<p>I prepare, but it is of no use! At last when just near
the studio I say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Own up, Antek, that life is still beautiful."</p>

<p>Antek halts, casts a frowning glance at me, and says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poodle!"</p>

<p>That night we conversed no more with each other.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">A WEEK after the evening of betrothal my "Jews"
arrive for exhibition. The picture is placed in a
separate hall, and a special fee is charged for admission.
One half of the net proceeds is for me. At the exhibition
there is probably a throng from morning till evening.</p>

<p>I see it only once; but as people look at me more than
at the picture, I shall not go again, for why should I be
angry for nothing. If my picture were a masterpiece,
such as has never been seen in the world till this day,
people would rather satisfy that curiosity in virtue of
<span class="pagenum">[512]</span>
which they go to see "Krao" or the Hottentot who eats
live pigeons.</p>

<p>Such a Hottentot am I at this moment. I should be
satisfied were I really a poodle; but I am too much of a
painter not to be enraged by such degradation of art before
a fashionable peculiarity.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THREE weeks ago few persons knew of my existence,
but now I begin to receive tens of letters, for the
greater part love-letters. I may wager that of five four
begin with these words: "It may be that when you have
read this letter, you will despise the woman who, etc.&mdash;"
I will not despise the woman, on condition that she will
keep away from me.</p>

<p>Were it not for Kazia, perhaps, to tell the truth, I
shouldn't shrug my shoulders so much at such a torrent
of feeling.</p>

<p>How can such an "unknown" hope that a man who
has never seen her will answer the invitation of an invisible
woman? This makes me specially indignant.
Remove first the curtain, O fair unknown! and when I
behold thee, I will say to thee&mdash;Oi! I will say nothing,
because of Kazia.</p>

<p>I receive also an anonymous missive, from some gray-haired
friend<i>ess</i>, in which I am called master, and Kazia
a little goose.</p>

<p>"Oh, master, is she a wife for thee?" inquires my gray-haired
friend<i>ess</i>. "Is that a choice worthy of him on
whom the eyes of the whole country are turned? Thou
art a victim of intrigue, etc."
<span class="pagenum">[513]</span>
</p>

<p>A wonderful supposition, and a still more wonderful
demand, that I should marry not to please my heart but
the public! And poor Kazia is already in their way!</p>

<p>There are greater crimes surely than anonymous letters,
but there is no greater&mdash;how can I express myself justly?
But never mind!</p>

<p>The end of my betrothal is not fixed yet, but it will
come before long. Meanwhile I shall tell Kazia to array
herself famously, and I will escort her to the exhibition.
Let the world see us together.</p>

<p>Antek's two corpses have come also from Paris. The
picture is called "The Last Meeting," and represents a
young man and a young woman lying on the dissecting-table.
At the first glance the idea is interpreted perfectly.
It is clear that those two dead ones loved each
other in life, that misery separated and death united
them.</p>

<p>The students bending over the corpses have come out
in the picture somewhat rigid; there are faults in the
perspective of the dissecting-room; but the "corpses" are
painted superbly. Such corpses that icy cold comes from
them! The picture did not receive even mention, perhaps
for the reason that the subject is wonderfully unpleasant;
but critics praised it.</p>

<p>Among our "painters" there are beyond doubt many
talents. For instance, at the side of Antek's corpses
Franek Tsepkovski exhibited "The Death of Koretski."
Immense strength in it, and immense individuality.</p>

<p>Antek calls Franek an idiot: first, because Franek has
a forelock, and wears his beard wedge-form; second, because
he dresses according to the latest fashion; and,
third, because he is terribly well-bred and ceremonious,
and mentions rather frequently his high-born relatives.
But Antek is mistaken. Talent is a bird that builds its
<span class="pagenum">[514]</span>
nest where it pleases, at one time in a wild desert, at
another in a trimmed garden.</p>

<p>I have seen, in Monachium and Paris, painters who
looked like laborers in a brewery, then others like barbers
or dandies, you would not give three coppers for
the men; still one and the other beast of them had in
his soul such exaltation, such uncommon feeling of
forms and colors, and such a power of projecting that
feeling out of himself onto canvas! Ostrynski, who has
a trite phrase for everything, would have written in
mentioning them in his "Kite," <i>spiritus flat ubi vult</i> (the
spirit bloweth where it listeth).</p>

<p>In Antek's opinion, historical painting is "obscure
barbarism." I do not paint historical subjects, and personally
the question is all one to me, but I hear this
opinion on every side as being progressive. People have
made a saw of it, and it begins to annoy me.</p>

<p>Our Polish painters have one defect: they become
wedded to certain doctrines touching art, live under
their slippers, look at everything with the eyes of these
doctrines, force art to them, and are rather apostles than
painters. In contrast to painters mentioned above (in
connection with Monachium and Paris), I have known
others whose lips were worn off in talking of what art
is, and what it should be; but when it came to the brush
they could not do anything.</p>

<p>More than once I have thought that a theory of art
should be framed by philosophers, and if they framed
nonsense&mdash;let them answer; but painters should paint
what the heart dictates to each man, and to know how
to paint is the main thing. To my thinking, the most
wretched talent is worth more than the most splendid
doctrine, and the most splendid doctrine is not worthy
to clean the boots of freedom.

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">I WAS with Kazia and the Suslovskis at the exhibition.</p>

<p>There are crowds before my picture at all times.
They began to whisper the moment we entered; and this
time they looked mostly, not at the picture, and not at
me, but at Kazia. The women especially did not take
their eyes from her. I saw that she was pleased with
this fabulously; but I did not take it ill of her. I take
it worse that she said of Antek's corpses, "that is not a
decent picture." Suslovski declared that she had taken
the words out of his mouth; but I was raging. To think
that Kazia too should have such a view of art!</p>

<p>From anger I took farewell of them at once, on pretence
that I must see Ostrynski. I went to his office, it
is true, but to induce him to dine with me.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">I SAW a miracle, and that's the end of it.</p>

<p>Now for the first time I understand why a man
has eyes.</p>

<p><i>Corpo di Bacco</i>; what beauty!</p>

<p>I am walking with Ostrynski; I see on a sudden at
the corner of Willow Street some woman passing
quickly. I stand as if fixed to the earth; I become oak;
I become stone; I stare; I lose consciousness; without
knowing it I seize Ostrynski by the cravat; I loosen his
cravat&mdash;and&mdash;save me, or I die!</p>

<p>What that she has perfect features? It is not the
features, she is simply an artist's ideal, a masterpiece as
<span class="pagenum">[516]</span>
outline, a masterpiece as coloring, a masterpiece as sentiment.
Greuze would have risen from the dead in her
presence, and hanged himself then for having painted so
much ugliness.</p>

<p>I gaze and gaze. She is walking alone,&mdash;how alone?
Poetry is walking with her; music, spring, splendor, and
love are walking with her. I know not whether I should
prefer to paint her immediately; I should rather kneel
before her and kiss her feet, because such a woman was
born. Finally, do I know what I would do?</p>

<p>She passes us as serenely as a summer day. Ostrynski
bows to her; but she does not see him. I wake from
my amazement and cry,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us follow her!"</p>

<p>"No," answers Ostrynski; "have you gone mad? I
must tie my cravat. Give me peace! that is an acquaintance
of mine."</p>

<p>"An acquaintance of yours? Present me."</p>

<p>"I do not think of it; look to your own betrothed."</p>

<p>I hurl a curse at Ostrynski and his posterity to the
ninth generation; then I wish to fly after the unknown.
To my misfortune, she has entered an open carriage.
Only from a distance do I see her straw hat and red
parasol.</p>

<p>"Do you know her really?" ask I of Ostrynski.</p>

<p>"I know all people."</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Pani Helena Kolchanovski of the house of Turno,
otherwise Panna Vdova [Miss Widow], so called."</p>

<p>"Why Miss Widow?"</p>

<p>"Because her husband died at their wedding supper.
If you have recovered, I will tell you her history. There
was a rich, childless bachelor, Kolchanovski de Kolchanovo,
a noble of the Ukraine. He had immensely honorable
<span class="pagenum">[517]</span>
relatives who hoped to be his heirs, and an immeasurably
short neck, which gave the greater hopes to
the heirs. I knew those heirs. They were in truth perfectly
honorable people; but what's to be done? The
most honorable and the least interested of them could
not refrain from looking at Kolchanovski's neck. This
annoyed the old man so intensely that out of spite to
the family he paid court to a neighbor's daughter, drew
up a document, conveyed to her all his property, then
married her; after the ceremony there was dancing;
at the end of the dancing a supper; at the end of the
supper apoplexy killed him on the spot. In that way
Madame Helena Kolchanovski became Miss Widow."</p>

<p>"Was that long ago?"</p>

<p>"Three years. At that time she was twenty-two
years of age. Since then she might have married
twenty-two times; but she doesn't want to marry. People
supposed that she was waiting for a prince. It turned
out that that was not true; for she fired a prince out
a little while ago. Besides I know well that she has no
pretensions; the best proof of which is that Pani Kolchanovski
lives to this time in close friendship with our
well-known, sympathetic, gifted, etc., Eva Adami, who
was a friend of hers in the boarding-school."</p>

<p>Hearing this, I just jumped from joy. If that is
true, no more of Ostrynski. My beloved, honest Evusia
<a name="FNanchor_1_18" id="FNanchor_1_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
will smooth the way for my acquaintance with Pani
Helena.</p>

<p>"Well, then you won't take me to her?" asked I of
Ostrynski.</p>

<p>"Decidedly not; if any man wishes to make the acquaintance
of any one in the city, why, he will make it,"
answered Ostrynski; "but because you put me out with
<span class="pagenum">[518]</span>
Kazia, I do not wish people to say in the present case
that I caused&mdash; Do I know? Be in good health!"
<a name="FNanchor_1_19" id="FNanchor_1_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">I WAS to dine with the Suslovskis, but I wrote them
that I couldn't come.</p>

<p>My teeth have never ached, it is true, but then they
might ache.</p>

<p>Helena did not go from my eyes all day; for what sort
of a painter would he be, who would not think of such
a face? I painted in my soul ten portraits of her. To
my mind came the idea of a picture, in which such a
face as Helena's would make a splendid impression. It
was only necessary to see her a couple of times more. I
flew to Eva Adami's, but did not find her. In the evening
I receive a card from Kazia with an invitation for
the morning to waters in the garden, and then to coffee.
Those waters and that coffee are a regular saw!</p>

<p>I cannot go; for if I do not find Eva at home in the
morning, I shall not catch her all day.</p>

<p>Eva Adami (that is her stage appellation; her real
name is Anna Yedlinski) is an exceptional maiden. I
have enjoyed her friendship this long time, and we say
"thou" to each other. This is her ninth year on the
stage, and she has remained pure in the full sense of the
word. In theatres, there are, it is true, plenty of women
who are innocent physically; but if their corsets could
betray all the desires of those women, I suppose that
the most shameless baboon, on hearing the story, might
blush at all points not covered with hair. The theatre
spoils souls, especially female souls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[519]</span>
It is difficult even to ask that in a woman, who every
evening feigns love, fidelity, nobleness, and similar qualities,
there should not be developed at last an instinctive
feeling that all these virtues belong to the drama, but
have no connection with life. The immense difference
between art and reality confirms her in this feeling;
rivalry and envy roused by applause poison the heart's
noblest impulses.</p>

<p>Continual contact with people so spoiled as actors
excites lower instincts. There is not a white Angora cat
which would not be soiled in such an environment.
This environment can be conquered only by great genius,
which purifies itself in the fire of art; or a nature so
thoroughly &aelig;sthetic that evil does not pass through it,
as water does not pass through the feathers of a swan.
Of such impermeable natures is Eva Adami.</p>

<p>At night, at tea, and the pipe more than once, I have
talked with my colleagues about people belonging to the
world of art, beginning with the highest, that is, poets,
and ending with the lowest, that is, actors.</p>

<p>A being who has imagination developed beyond ordinary
mortals, a being impressionable beyond others, sensuous,
passionate, a being who, in the domain of happiness
and delight, knows everything, and desires with unheard
of intensity,&mdash;that is an artist. He should have three
times the character and will-power of others to conquer
temptation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as there is no reason why a flower, beautiful
beyond others, should have greater strength to resist
wind, there is no reason why an artist should have
more character than an ordinary person. On the contrary,
there is reason why, as a rule, he has less, for his
vital energy is wasted in that gulf which divides the
world of art from the world of every-day reality.
<span class="pagenum">[520]</span>
</p>

<p>He is simply a sick bird, in a continual fever,&mdash;a bird
which at times vanishes from the eye beneath the clouds,
and at times drags its wearied wings in the dust and the
mire. Art gives him a disgust for dust and mire; but
life takes strength of flight from him. Hence that discord
which is so frequent between the external and the
internal life of artists.</p>

<p>The world, when it asks more from artists than from
others, and when it condemns them, is right perhaps; but
Christ, too, will be right when He saves them.</p>

<p>Ostrynski maintains, it is true, that actors belong to
the artistic world as much as clarionets and French
horns belong to it.</p>

<p>But that is not true; the best proof is Eva Adami, who
is a thorough artist, both by gifts and that feeling which
has preserved her from evil as a mother would. In spite
of all the friendship which I have for Eva, I had not
seen her for a long time; when she saw me then, she
was very glad, though she had a certain astonished look,
which I could not explain.</p>

<p>"How art thou, Vladzio?"
<a name="FNanchor_1_20" id="FNanchor_1_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
asked she. "For a wonder I see thee."</p>

<p>I was delighted to find her. She wore a Turkish
morning gown with split sleeves; it had red palm-leaves
on a cream-colored ground, and was bordered with wide
embroidery in old gold. The rich embroidery was reflected
with special beauty in her pale face and violet
eyes. I told her so, and she was greatly pleased. I
came to the point then at once.</p>

<p>"My golden diva! thou knowest Pani Kolchanovski,
that wonderful lady of the Ukraine?"</p>

<p>"I do; she was my schoolmate."</p>

<p>"Take me to her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[521]</span>
Eva shook her head.</p>

<p>"My golden, my good one, as thou lovest me!"</p>

<p>"No, Vladek, I will not take thee!"</p>

<p>"See how bad thou art; but at one time I was almost
in love with thee."</p>

<p>What a mimosa that Eva is! When she hears this,
she changes, puts her elbow on the table (a miracle, not
an elbow), puts her pale face on her palm and asks,&mdash;</p>

<p>"When was that?"</p>

<p>I was in a hurry to speak of Helena; but since on a
time I had in truth almost fallen in love with Eva, and
since I wish now to bring her into good humor, I begin
the narrative,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We were going once, after the theatre, to the botanical
garden. Dost thou remember what a wonderful
night that was? We were sitting on a bench near the
fountain; thou hadst just said, 'I should like to hear
a nightingale.' I was sad for some reason, and took off
my cap, for my head was aching; and thou, going to the
fountain, moistened a handkerchief, and put it on my
forehead with thy hand. Thou didst seem simply as
good as an angel, and I thought to myself: If I take that
hand and put my lips to it, all will be over! I shall be
in love to the death."</p>

<p>"And then what?" asks Eva, in an undertone.</p>

<p>"Thou didst step aside quickly, as if divining
something."</p>

<p>Eva sat a while in thought, then woke from it and
said with nervous haste, "Let us not speak of this matter,
I pray thee."</p>

<p>"Well, let us not speak of it. Dost thou know, Eva,
I like thee too well to fall in love with thee? One feeling
excludes the other. From the time that I made thy
acquaintance, I have had for thee a real genuine feeling."
<span class="pagenum">[522]</span>
</p>

<p>"But," said Eva, as if following her own thoughts, "is
it true that thou art betrothed?"</p>

<p>"True."</p>

<p>"Why hast thou not told me of it?"</p>

<p>"Because the engagement was broken, and then rearranged
not long since. But if thou tell me that as
betrothed I should not become acquainted with Pani
Helena, I will answer, that I was a painter before I was
betrothed. However, thou hast no fear for her?"</p>

<p>"Do not imagine that. I will not take thee to her, for
I do not wish to expose her to people's tongues. They
say that for some weeks half Warsaw is in love with
thee; they relate uncreated things of thy conduct. No
longer back than yesterday, I heard a witticism, that
thou hast made the ten commandments of God into one
for thy own use. Knowest thou into what one?"</p>

<p>"What one?"</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife&mdash;in vain."</p>

<p>"Thou, O God, seest my suffering! but the witticism
is good."</p>

<p>"And surely pointed."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Evus;
<a name="FNanchor_1_21" id="FNanchor_1_21"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
art thou willing to hear the
whole truth? I have ever been timid, awkward: I have
not had, and have not now success with women. People
imagine, God knows what; and meanwhile they do not
suspect how much truth there is in the cry, Thou, O
God, seest my suffering!"</p>

<p>"Povero maestro!"</p>

<p>"Give peace to thy Italian; take me to Pani Helena."</p>

<p>"My Vladek, I cannot; the more thou art thought a
Don Juan, the less does it beseem me, an actress, to take
thee to a lone woman who attracts the attention that
Hela
<a name="FNanchor_2_22" id="FNanchor_2_22"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
does."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[523]</span>
"Then why dost thou receive me?"</p>

<p>"I am different. I am an actress, and can apply to
myself the words of Shakespeare, 'Be thou as chaste as
ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.'"</p>

<p>"It is possible to lose one's senses in such a case. Every
one may know her, may be at her house, may look at her;
but I may not! And why? Because I have painted a
good picture and have made some reputation."</p>

<p>"From thy point of view, thou art right," said Eva,
smiling. "Thou dost not suspect that I knew beforehand
why thou hast come to me. Ostrynski was here,
and he persuaded me that it was 'better' not to take
thee to Hela."</p>

<p>"Ha, I understand!&mdash;and thou hast promised him?"</p>

<p>"I have not; I was even angry; still I think it is
'better' not to take thee. Let us talk now of thy
picture."</p>

<p>"Do not torment me with the picture and painting.
But since things are so, let them be so! This is what I
will tell thee: in the course of three days I will make
the acquaintance of Pani Kolchanovski, even if I have to
go in disguise to her."</p>

<p>"Dress up as gardener and take her a bouquet&mdash;from
Ostrynski."</p>

<p>But at that moment an idea altogether different comes
to me; this idea seems so splendid that I strike my
forehead, forget my anger and the offence which a
moment before I felt that Eva had committed, and
say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give thy word not to betray me."</p>

<p>"I give it," says the curious Eva.</p>

<p>"Know, then, that I shall disguise myself as an old
minstrel. I have a whole costume and a lyre; I have
been in the Ukraine, and know how to sing songs. Pani
<span class="pagenum">[524]</span>
Helena is from the Ukraine; she will be sure to receive
me. Dost thou understand now?"</p>

<p>"What an original idea!" cried Eva.</p>

<p>Eva is artistic to such a degree that the idea cannot
but please her; besides, she has given her word not to
betray me, and she has no objection to make.</p>

<p>"What an original idea!" repeats she. "Hela so loves
her Ukraine that she will just sob when she sees a minstrel
in Warsaw; but what wilt thou tell her? How
wilt thou explain thy coming to the Vistula?"</p>

<p>My enthusiasm is communicated to Eva in spite of her.
For a time we sit and conspire in the best fashion possible.
We agree that I am to put on the disguise; and Eva
is to take me in a carriage to avoid the curiosity of onlookers.
Pani Hela is to know nothing till Eva betrays
the secret herself, when she chooses. Eva and I amuse
ourselves with this plan, perfectly; then I fall to kissing
her hands, and she keeps me for lunch.</p>

<p>I spend the evening at the Suslovskis. Kazia is a little
gloomy because I did not come in the morning; but I
endure her humors like an angel, besides, I am thinking
of my adventure of the morrow and&mdash;of Hela.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">ELEVEN o'clock in the forenoon.</p>

<p>Only somehow Eva is not visible.</p>

<p>I am wearing a coarse linen shirt, open at the breast,
a coat somewhat worn, but fairly good, a girdle, boots,
everything that is needed. The hair of a gray wig falls
in my eyes; and he would have been a keen man who
could have recognized that as a wig; my beard was a
masterpiece of patience. From eight o'clock in the
<span class="pagenum">[525]</span>
morning I had been fastening, by means of isinglass, white
hair among my own, and I had become gray in such
fashion that in old age I shall not grow gray more naturally;
diluted sepia gave me swarthiness; and Antek
made wrinkles with the power of a genius. I seemed to
be seventy years old.</p>

<p>Antek insists that, instead of painting, I could earn my
bread as a model, which would in truth be with greater
profit to art.</p>

<p>Half-past eleven&mdash;Eva is coming.</p>

<p>I send to the carriage a bundle containing my usual
clothing, since, for aught I know, I may be obliged to
change costume; I take the lyre then, and go down; at
the door of the carriage I cry,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Slava Bogu!"
<a name="FNanchor_1_23" id="FNanchor_1_23"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
</p>

<p>Eva is astonished and enchanted.</p>

<p>"A wonderful beekeeper, a wonderful grandfather!"
repeats she, laughing. "Such a thing could only come
to the head of an artist!"</p>

<p>Speaking in parenthesis, she herself looks like a summer
morning. She is in a robe of raw silk and a straw
hat with poppies. I cannot take my eyes from her.
She came in an open carriage. Therefore people begin
at once to surround us; but what does she care for
that!</p>

<p>At last the carriage moves on; my heart beats with
more animation; in a quarter of an hour I shall see the
Helena dreamed of.</p>

<p>We have not driven a hundred yards when I see
Ostrynski at a distance coming toward us. That man
must be omnipresent! Seeing us, he halts, bows to Eva,
then looks quickly at both of us, especially at me. I do
not admit that he recognizes me; still, after we pass him
<span class="pagenum">[526]</span>
I look around, and see that he is standing there all the
time, following us with his eyes. Only at the turn do
we lose him from sight. The carriage moves on rather
swiftly; still it seems to me that the ride lasts an age.
At length we stop in the alley of Belvedere.</p>

<p>We are before Hela's house.</p>

<p>I fly to the door as if shot at it.</p>

<p>Eva runs after me, crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a hateful old grandfather!"</p>

<p>The servant, in a very showy livery, opens the door; and
the next instant opens his eyes very widely at sight of me.
Eva allays his astonishment, saying that the grandfather
came with her, and we go upstairs.</p>

<p>The waiting-maid appears in a moment, declares that
the lady is dressing in the next chamber, and vanishes.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Hela!" cries Eva.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Evus!" answers a wonderful, a fresh voice,
"right away! right away! I shall be ready in a
moment."</p>

<p>"Hela, thou knowest not what is waiting for thee, nor
whom thou wilt see. I have brought thee a 'grandfather,'&mdash;the
most genuine 'grandfather-minstrel' that has ever
walked over the steppes of the Ukraine."</p>

<p>A cry of joy is heard in the chamber; the door opens
suddenly, and in rushes Hela, in her corsets, her hair
hanging down.</p>

<p>"A grandfather! a blind grandfather! here in Warsaw!"</p>

<p>"He is not blind; he sees!" cried Eva, hurriedly, not
wishing to carry the jest too far.</p>

<p>But it was late, for that instant I throw myself at
Hela's feet, and cry,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cherub of the Lord!"</p>

<p>I embrace her feet with both hands, raising my eyes
the while; I see a little more than the form of those
<span class="pagenum">[527]</span>
feet. Nations kneel down! People come with censers!
A Venus of Milo! a perfect one!</p>

<p>"Cherub!" I repeat, with genuine ecstasy.</p>

<p>My minstrel enthusiasm was explained by this, that
after long wandering I had met the first Ukraine soul.
Notwithstanding that, Hela withdraws her feet from my
hands and hurries away. I see her bare shoulders during
the twinkle of an eye, and her neck, which reminds me
of Psyche in the Neapolitan Museum. She vanishes
then through the doorway; but I remain kneeling in the
middle of the room.</p>

<p>Eva threatens me with her parasol, and laughs, hiding
her rosy face in a bouquet of reseda.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a dialogue is begun through the door in the
most beautiful dialect ever spoken from the Pripet to
Chertomelik.</p>

<p>I had prepared myself for every possible query, therefore
I lie as if from notes. "I am a beekeeper, from near
Chigirin. My daughter wandered after a Pole to Warsaw;
and I, old man, was grieving, grieving on the beefarm,
till I wandered on after her. Good people give me
coppers for singing&mdash;and now what? I shall see my
dear child, give her my blessing, then return home,
because I yearn for Mother Ukraine. There I am to die
among the beehives. Every man must die; and it is time
for old Philip this long while."</p>

<p>What a thing the actor nature is! Evus knows who I
am; but she is affected so much by my r&ocirc;le that she begins
to nod her beautiful head in a melancholy manner,
and looks at me with sympathy. Hela's voice quivers
from the other room, also with emotion.</p>

<p>The door opens a little; a wonderfully white arm
appears through the opening; and, unexpectedly, I find
myself in possession of three rubles, which I receive; I
<span class="pagenum">[528]</span>
cannot do otherwise, and what is more, I pour out on
Hela's head a torrent of blessings in the names of all the
saints.</p>

<p>I am interrupted by the waiting-maid with the announcement
that Pan Ostrynski is downstairs, and
inquires if the lady will receive him.</p>

<p>"Don't let him in, my dear!" cries Eva, in alarm.</p>

<p>Hela declares that of course she will not receive him.
She even expresses astonishment at such an early visit.
I, to tell the truth, also do not understand how Ostrynski,
who boasts, and is celebrated for his knowledge of social
forms, should come at that hour.</p>

<p>"There is something in this," says Eva.</p>

<p>But time fails for further explanations, since Hela
appears at that moment already dressed, and breakfast is
announced.</p>

<p>Both ladies pass into the dining-room. Hela wishes to
seat me at the table; but I refuse, and sit with my lyre
at the threshold. Soon I receive a plate so filled with
food that if six grandfathers of the Ukraine were to eat
all of it, they might have a fit of indigestion. But I eat,
for I am hungry, and while eating I look at Hela.</p>

<p>In truth, a more beautiful head there is not in any gallery
on earth. As I live, I have not seen such transparent
eyes; it is simply possible to see all thoughts through
them, just as the bottom of a clear stream is seen. Those
eyes possess this power also, that they begin to laugh before
the mouth; by this the face is brightened, as if a sun-ray
had fallen on it. What incomparable sweetness in the
form of the mouth! That is a head somewhat in the
style of Carlo Dolce, though the outline of the brows and
the eyes bring to mind Raphael in his noblest type.</p>

<p>At last I cease to eat; I gaze and gaze; I would gaze
till death.
<span class="pagenum">[529]</span>
</p>

<p>"Thou wert not here yesterday," says Hela to Eva.
"I hoped all the afternoon to see thee run in."</p>

<p>"In the morning I had a rehearsal, and in the afternoon
I wanted to see Magorski's picture."</p>

<p>"Didst see it?"</p>

<p>"Not well, for there was a crowd&mdash;and thou?"</p>

<p>"I went in the morning. What a poet!&mdash;one wishes
to weep with those Jews."</p>

<p>Eva looks at me, and my soul rises.</p>

<p>"I will go again, and as often as I can," says Hela.
"Let us go together; maybe we can go to-day? It was so
agreeable to me not only to look at that picture, but to
think that such power appeared among us."</p>

<p>And people do not glorify that woman!</p>

<p>Then I hear further,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a pity that such strange things are told of that
Magorski. I confess that I am dying of curiosity to
know him."</p>

<p>"Ah!" says Eva, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Thou knowest him, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I can assure thee that he loses much on closer
acquaintance; presumptuous, vain, oh, how vain!"</p>

<p>I have such a desire to show Eva my tongue that I can
barely restrain myself; she turns her roguish violet eyes
toward me, and says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Somehow thou hast lost appetite, grandfather?"</p>

<p>I'll show her my tongue; I can't restrain myself!</p>

<p>But she spoke again to Hela,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, Magorski is much worthier of admiration than of
acquaintance. Ostrynski has described him as a genius in
the body of a 'barber.'"</p>

<p>I should cut off Ostrynski's ears if he had said anything
similar; I knew that Eva has the devil at her collar; but
in truth she is exceeding the measure. Fortunately,
<span class="pagenum">[530]</span>
breakfast comes to an end. We go out to the grounds,
where I am to give my songs. This annoys me somewhat,
and I should rather be with Hela as a painter than
a minstrel. But it is hard to escape! I sit at the wall in
the shade of chestnut-trees, through the leaves of which
the sun penetrates, forming on the ground a multitude of
bright spots. Those spots quiver and twinkle, vanish and
shine out anew, just as the leaves move. The garden is
very deep, so the sound of the city barely reaches it,
especially since it is dulled by the noise of fountains in
the garden. The heat is great. Among the thick leaves,
the twittering of sparrows is heard; but it is faint and,
as it were, drowsy. At last there is silence.</p>

<p>I see that a perfectly harmonious picture is forming:
A garden, a background of trees, spots of sunlight, fountains,
those two women with uncommonly beautiful faces
one of them leaning against the other; and I see an old
minstrel sitting with a lyre at the wall,&mdash;all this has its
own charm which affects me as a painter. Meanwhile I
remember my r&ocirc;le, and begin to sing with feeling,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i10">
   "People say that I am happy;
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   I laugh at their saying,
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   For they know not how often
  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   I am covered with tears!
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i10">
   "I was born in misfortune,

  </p>
  <p class="i10">
   In that evil hour?"
  </p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Eva is affected, for she is an artist; Hela because she is
from the Ukraine; and I&mdash;because both are so beautiful
that the sight of them enchants me.</p>

<p>Hela listens without exaggerated attention, without
false enthusiasm; but in her transparent eyes I see that
the listening gives her pure, genuine pleasure.
<span class="pagenum">[531]</span>
</p>

<p>How different from those Ukraine women who come to
Warsaw for the carnival, and during a contra-dance annoy
partners with tales of homesickness for the Ukraine;
while, in fact, as an acquaintance of mine puts it, no
power could draw one of them with hooks from Warsaw
and the carnival to her Ukraine!</p>

<p>Hela listens, keeps time with her exquisite head; at
moments she says to Eva, "I know that," and sings with
me; I surpass myself. I cast forth from my bosom and
memory a whole stock of material from the steppe, beginning
with hetmans, knights, and Cossacks, and ending
with falcons, Sonyas, Marusyas, steppes, grave-mounds,
and God knows what! I am astonished myself, whence
so much comes to me.</p>

<p>Time passes as in a dream.</p>

<p>I return a trifle weary, but enchanted.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">IN the studio I find, most unexpectedly, the Suslovskis
and Kazia. They have come to give me a surprise.</p>

<p>Why did Antek tell them that surely I should be
back soon?</p>

<p>Neither Kazia nor the Suslovskis know me, because I
am disguised. I approach Kazia and take her hand; she
draws back, somewhat frightened.</p>

<p>"Kazia, dost thou not know me?" And laughter
seizes me at sight of her astonishment.</p>

<p>"But it is Vladek," says Antek.</p>

<p>Kazia looks at me more carefully; at last she cries,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tfu! what an ugly grandfather!"</p>

<p>I an ugly grandfather! I am curious to know where
she saw a handsomer. But for poor Kazia, reared in the
<span class="pagenum">[532]</span>
ascetic principles of her father, of course every minstrel
is ugly!</p>

<p>I withdraw to our kitchen, and after a few minutes
reappear in my natural form. Kazia and her parents inquire
what this masquerade means.</p>

<p>"A very simple thing. You see, sometimes we painters
render one another a friendly service, and pose to one
another for pictures. As Antek, who posed to me for an
old Jew. You didn't know him, Kazia, did you, in the
picture? I am posing for Tsepkovski. Such is the custom
among painters, especially as there is a lack of
models in Warsaw."</p>

<p>"We have come to give thee a surprise," said Kazia;
"besides, I have never visited a studio in my life. Oh,
what disorder! Is it this way with all painters?"</p>

<p>"More or less, more or less."</p>

<p>Pan Suslovski declares that he would rather find a
little more system; and in this respect he hopes for a
change in the future. I want to break his head with my
lyre. Meanwhile Kazia smiles with coquettishness, and
says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is one painter, a great good-for-nothing, with
whom it will be different; only let me take the matter
in hand, all will be put in order, arranged, cleaned,
fumigated."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, she raises her nose, which is in the air,
looks at the festoons of spider-webs adorning the corners
of our studio, and adds,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Such disorder might discourage a merchant even.
Some one will come, and immediately find himself, as it
were, in an old clothes shop. For example, look at that
armor; terrible how rusty it is! Still, all that is needed
is to call a servant, tell her to crush a little brick; and
all will begin to shine like a new samovar."
<span class="pagenum">[533]</span>
</p>

<p>Jesus Mary! She talks of merchants, and wants to
clean with brick-dust my armor dug out of a tomb&mdash;O
Kazia, Kazia!</p>

<p>Suslovski, now happy, kisses her on the forehead; and
Antek gives out certain ominous sounds which call to
mind the grunting of a wild boar.</p>

<p>Kazia threatens me with forefinger on her nose, and
talks on,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg thee to remember that all will be changed."
Then she concludes, "And if a certain gentleman will
not come to us this evening, he will be bad, and people
will not love him."</p>

<p>So saying, she closes her eyes. I cannot say that there
was not much charm in those tricks of hers. I promise
to come; and I conduct my future family to the groundfloor.</p>

<p>Returning, I find Antek looking awry and distrustfully
on a whole package of hundred ruble notes which are
lying on the table.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Dost know what has happened?"</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>"I, like a common thief, robbed a man."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I sold him my corpses."</p>

<p>"And is that the money?"</p>

<p>"It is; I am a low usurer."</p>

<p>I embrace Antek; I congratulate him from my whole
heart; he begins to relate how it happened,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I sit here after your departure, till some gentleman
comes and asks if I am Svyatetski. I answer, 'I am
curious to know why I should not be Svyatetski!' Then
he says, 'I saw your picture and I want to buy it.' I
say, 'You are free to do so; but permit me to say that a
<span class="pagenum">[534]</span>
man must be an idiot to buy a wretched picture!' 'I am
not an idiot,' says he; 'but I have a fancy to buy pictures
painted by idiots.' 'If that is so, very well,' I answer.
He asks the price. I say, 'What is that to me?' 'I will
give you so much and so much?' 'That is well! if you
will give that price, then give it.' He gave it, and went
away. He left his card with the name Byalkovski,
M. D. I am a low usurer, and that's the end of the
matter!"</p>

<p>"Long life to the corpses! Antek, get married."</p>

<p>"I would rather hang myself; I am a low usurer, nothing
more."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">IN the evening I am at the Suslovskis; Kazia and I are
in the niche in which there is a small sofa. Pani
Suslovski is sitting at a table lighted by a lamp, and is
sewing on something for Kazia's trousseau. Pan Suslovski
sits at a table reading, with dignity, the evening
number of "The Kite."</p>

<p>Somehow I am not myself; I wish to dissipate that
feeling by pushing up very near Kazia.</p>

<p>In the salon silence is supreme; it is interrupted only
by Kazia's whisper. I beg to embrace her; she whispers,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vladek, papa will see us."</p>

<p>With that "papa" begins to read aloud, "The picture
of our well-known artist, Svyatetski, 'The Last Meeting,'
was bought to-day by Dr. Byalkovski for fifteen hundred
rubles."</p>

<p>"That is true," I add. "Antek sold it this morning."</p>

<p>Then I try to embrace Kazia, and again I hear her
whisper,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Papa will see us&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum">[535]</span>
</p>

<p>My eyes turn involuntarily to Pan Suslovski. I see
on a sudden that his face is changing; he shades his eyes
with his hands and bends over "The Kite."</p>

<p>What the devil can he find there of such interest?</p>

<p>"Father, what is the matter?" asks Pani Suslovski.</p>

<p>He rises, advances two steps toward us, then halts,
transfixes me with a glance, and, clasping his hands
begins to nod his head.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" I ask.</p>

<p>"See how falsehood and crime come always to the
surface," answers Suslovski, pathetically. "My dear sir,
read to the end, if shame will permit."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he makes a movement as if to wrap
himself in his toga, and gives me "The Kite." I take
the number, and my glance falls on an announcement
entitled: "A Minstrel of the Ukraine." I am confused
somewhat, and read hurriedly the following,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Some days since a rare guest came to our city in the
person of a decrepit minstrel who visits Ukraine families
resident among us, begging them for alms, and singing
songs in return. It is said that our well-known and sympathetic
actress, Eva Adami, is particularly occupied with
him; he was seen with her in a carriage no longer ago
than this morning. In the first days of the appearance of
this guest from a distance, a wonderful report rose that
under the coat of the minstrel is hidden one of the most
famous of our artists, who, in this manner, without arresting
the attention of husbands and guardians, finds easy
access to boudoirs. We are convinced that this report has
no foundation, even for this reason alone, that our diva
would never consent to further an undertaking of that
kind. The old man, according to our information, has
wandered in here straight from the Ukraine. His intelligence
is dulled somewhat; but his memory is perfect."</p></blockquote><p>
<span class="pagenum">[536]</span>
</p>

<p>"Hell!"</p>

<p>Suslovski is so enraged that he cannot recover his
voice; at last he casts forth his superabundance of
indignation,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What new falsehood, what excuse will you find to
justify your conduct? Have we not seen you to-day in
that shameful disguise? Who is that minstrel?"</p>

<p>"I am that minstrel," I answer; "but I do not understand
why you find that disguise shameful."</p>

<p>At that moment Kazia snatches "The Kite" from my
hand and begins to read. Suslovski wraps himself still
more closely in the toga of indignation and continues,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Scarcely have you passed the threshold of an honest
house when you bring with you corruption; and before
you are the husband of that unfortunate child, you, in
company with women of light character, betray her; you
trample already on her confidence and ours; you break
your plighted word&mdash;and for whom? For a hetaira of
the theatre!"</p>

<p>Anger carries me off at last.</p>

<p>"My dear sir," say I, "enough of those commonplaces.
That hetaira is worth ten such false Catos as you. You
are nothing to me yet; and know this, that you annoy
me! I have enough of you with your pathos, with
your&mdash;" Here words fail me; but I have no further
need of them, for Suslovski is opening his waistcoat, as if
wishing to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Strike! spare not, here is my breast!"</p>

<p>But I have no thought of striking; I declare simply
that I am going, lest I might say something more to Pan
Suslovski.</p>

<p>In fact, I leave without saying farewell to any one.</p>

<p>The fresh breeze cools my heated head. Nine o'clock
in the evening, and the night is very calm. I must walk
<span class="pagenum">[537]</span>
to regain my composure, therefore I fly to the Alley of
the Belvedere.</p>

<p>The windows in Hela's villa are dark. Evidently she
is not at home. I know not myself why that causes me
immense disappointment.</p>

<p>If I could see even her shadow on the window-pane,
I should grow calm; but as it is, anger bears me away
again.</p>

<p>What I shall do with that Ostrynski at the first meeting&mdash;I
know not. Fortunately, he is not a man who
withdraws before responsibility.</p>

<p>But speaking precisely, what claim have I against
him? The article is written with infernal dexterity.
Ostrynski denies that the minstrel is a disguised painter;
he stands up, as it were, for Eva; but at the same time
betrays the whole secret to Hela. Evidently he is trying
to compromise Eva in the opinion of Hela; he takes
vengeance on me for Kazia, and covers me besides with
ridicule.</p>

<p>If only he hadn't said that my intelligence is blunted!
The deed is done. In Hela's eyes I am covered with
ridicule. She reads "The Kite."</p>

<p>Oh, what a dish of hash, and what bitterness for Eva!
How that Ostrynski must triumph! Surely I must do
something; but if I know what, may I become a reporter
for "The Kite"!</p>

<p>It occurs to me to take counsel with Eva. She plays
to-day; I will fly to the theatre and see her after the
play.</p>

<p>There is time yet.</p>

<p>Half an hour later I am in her dressing-room.</p>

<p>Eva will finish directly; meanwhile, I look around.</p>

<p>Our theatres are not distinguished, as is known, for
luxury of furnishing. A chamber with white walls; two
<span class="pagenum">[538]</span>
jets of gas quivering from the draught; a mirror; a washstand;
a number of chairs; and in one corner, a long chair,
probably the private property of the diva,&mdash;this is her
dressing-room. Before the mirror a multitude of toilet
articles, a cup of black coffee partly drunk, boxes with
rouge and white, lead for the brows, a number of pairs of
gloves, still retaining the form of the hand, and among
them two false tresses; at the side walls bunches of
costumes, white, rose-colored, dark, light, and heavy; on
the floor are two baskets full of things pertaining to female
costumes. The room is full of odor of toilet powder.
What a medley everywhere; how everything has been
cast about in a hurry! How many colors and reflections;
what shadows; what a play of light from the quivering
gas-jets!</p>

<p>That is a picture of its own kind; there is character in
it. Of course there is nothing here more than in an
ordinary dressing-room of a woman, still there is something
which causes that chamber to seem, not a dressing-room,
but a sanctuary of some kind; there is a certain
spell and charm there. Above this disorder, this medley
and hurry, between these scratched walls, hovers the
inspiration of art.</p>

<p>A thunder of applause is heard. Ha! it is finished.
Through the walls come to my ears the sound of calling;
"Adami! Adami!" A quarter of an hour passes; they
are shouting yet.</p>

<p>At last Eva rushes in; she is in the character of
"Theodora." She has a crown on her head; her eyes
blackened underneath; on her cheeks a blush of rouge;
her dishevelled hair falls like a storm on her naked
neck and shoulders. She is feverish and exhausted
to that degree that she speaks to me in a whisper
barely audible.
<span class="pagenum">[539]</span>
</p>

<p>"How art thou, Vladek?" and removing her crown
hurriedly, she throws herself in her regal robes on the
long chair. Evidently she cannot utter words; for she
looks at me silently, like a suffering bird. I sit near
her, place my hand on her head, and think only of
her.</p>

<p>I see in those blackened eyes the flame of unquenched
ecstasy; I see on that forehead simply the stigma of art.
I see that the woman brings to the altar of that theatrical
Moloch her health, blood, and life, that breath is lacking
in her breast at that moment. Such pity embraces
me, such sorrow, such sympathy, that I know not what
to do.</p>

<p>We sit some time in silence; at last Eva points to a
number of "The Kite" lying on the toilet table, and
whispers,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a vexation, what a vexation!"</p>

<p>Suddenly she bursts into nervous weeping, and trembles
like a leaf.</p>

<p>I know that she is weeping from weariness, not because
of "The Kite," for that article is buffoonery which
every one will forget to-morrow; and the whole of
Ostrynski is not worth one tear from Eva; still my heart
is straitened the more. I seize her hands and cover them
with kisses. I take her; I press her to my breast. My
heart begins to beat with growing violence; something
amazing takes place in me. I kneel down at Eva's knees,
not knowing myself what I am doing; a cloud covers my
eyes; suddenly I seize her in my arms, without thinking
what I do.</p>

<p>"Vladek, Vladek, pity!" whispers Eva.</p>

<p>But I press her to my stormy breast; I know nothing
of anything. I have lost my wits! I kiss her on the
forehead, mouth, eyes; I can only say,
<span class="pagenum">[540]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"I love thee! I love&mdash;"</p>

<p>With that Eva's head drops back; her arms enclose my
neck feverishly, and I hear the whisper,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have loved thee this long time."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">IF for me there is a dearer creature on earth, I am a
pickled herring.</p>

<p>They say that we artists do everything under the first
impression of the moment; that is not true! for it seems
that I loved Eva long ago, only I was ass enough not to
see it. God alone knows what took place in me while
I attended her home that evening. We went hand in
hand, without speaking. From moment to moment I
pressed Eva's arm to my side, and she pressed mine. I
felt that she loved me with all her power.</p>

<p>I conducted her upstairs, and when we were in her
little drawing-room, the position became in some way so
awkward for us that we didn't dare to look into each
other's eyes. But when Eva covered her face with her
hands, I removed them gently and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Evus, thou art mine, is it not true?"</p>

<p>And she nestled up to me.</p>

<p>"I am, I am."</p>

<p>She was so beautiful, her eyes were drowsy, and at the
same time gleaming, there was such a sweet weariness
in her whole posture that I could not break away from
her.</p>

<p>And in truth she could not break from me; she wished,
as it were, to reward herself for continued silence, and for
such a long-concealed feeling.</p>

<p>I returned home late. Antek was not sleeping yet;
<span class="pagenum">[541]</span>
he was drawing by lamplight, on wood, for one of the
illustrated papers.</p>

<p>"There is a letter here for you," said he, without raising
his eyes from his work.</p>

<p>I take a letter from the table and feel a ring through
the envelope. Good! that ring will do for to-morrow.
I open the letter, and read as follows,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I know that the return of this ring will cause pleasure,
for you had this in view evidently. As to me, I do not
think of rivalling actresses.</p>

<p style="text-align : right">
 <span class="smcap">
  Kazia.
 </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least it is brief. From this letter anger alone is
looking forth, nothing more. If any shade of charm
surrounded Kazia in my eyes hitherto, that shade is
blown away now beyond return.</p>

<p>A wonderful thing! all supposed that Eva was the
cause of my disguise and of all those adventures; and
in truth the cause of what follows will be Eva.</p>

<p>I crush the letter, put it in my pocket, and go to bed.</p>

<p>Antek raises his eyes from his work, and looks in
expectation that I will say something; but I am silent.</p>

<p>"That scoundrel Ostrynski was here this evening after
the theatre," said Antek.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">IN the morning about ten o'clock I wish to fly to Eva;
but I cannot, for I have guests.</p>

<p>Baron Kartofler comes and engages a duplicate of my
"Jews." He offers me fifteen hundred rubles; I want
two thousand. The bargain is made at that price.
After his departure I receive an order for two portraits
<span class="pagenum">[542]</span>
from Tanzenberg. Antek, who is an Anti-Semite, reviles
me as a Jewish painter; but I am curious to know who
would buy productions of art, if not the "finance." If
the "finance" is afraid of Antek's corpses, the fault is not
mine.</p>

<p>I am with Eva at one o'clock. I give her the ring,
and declare that we shall go to Rome after our marriage.</p>

<p>Eva consents with delight. We are as much given to
talking to-day as we were to silence last evening. I tell
her of the order which I have received, and we rejoice
together. I must finish the portraits before our departure;
but "the Jews" for Kartofler I will paint in Rome.
When we return to Warsaw, I will fit up a studio, and we
will live as in heaven.</p>

<p>While forming these projects, I tell Eva that we will
keep the anniversary of yesterday as a holiday all our
lives.</p>

<p>She hides her face on my shoulder, and begs me not
to mention it. Then she winds the split sleeves of her
gown round my neck, and calls me her great man. She
is paler than usual; her eyes are more violet than usual,
but they are beaming with gladness.</p>

<p>Ah! what an ass, that having near me such a woman
I was seeking for happiness elsewhere, in a circle where
I was a perfect stranger, and which was strange to me.</p>

<p>What an artistic nature that of Eva! She is my
betrothed, accepts the r&ocirc;le at once, and involuntarily
plays the part of a young and happy affianced. But
I do not take that ill of a beloved creature, after so
many years in a theatre.</p>

<p>After dinner we go to Hela Kolchanovski's.</p>

<p>From the moment that Eva can present me as her
betrothed, the minstrel trick becomes innocent and can
cause no misunderstanding between those two ladies. In
<span class="pagenum">[543]</span>
fact, when Hela heard of the engagement, she received us
with open arms, and was delighted at Eva's happiness.
We laugh like three maniacs at the "grandfather," and
at that which the "grandfather" had to hear concerning
the painter Magorski. Yesterday I wanted to put a
stiletto into Ostrynski; to-day I am astonished at his
cleverness.</p>

<p>Hela laughs so heartily that her transparent eyes are
filled with tears. Speaking in parenthesis, she is marvellous.
When she inclines her head at the end of the visit,
I cannot take my eyes from it; and Eva herself is under
its spell to such a degree that during the day she imitates
unconsciously that bending of the neck and that
look.</p>

<p>We agree that, after our return from abroad, I shall
paint a portrait of Hela; but first I shall make my Eva
in Rome, if I can reproduce those features, which are so
delicate that they are almost over-refined, and that face,
so impressionable that every emotion is reflected in it as
a cloud in clear water.</p>

<p>But I shall succeed; why shouldn't I?</p>

<p>The evening "Kite" publishes untreated tales of the
orders which have come to me; my income is reckoned
by thousands. That in a small degree is the reason,
perhaps, that next day I receive a letter from Kazia,
stating that she returned the ring under the influence
of anger and jealousy, but if I come and we fall at
the feet of her parents, they will let themselves be
implored.</p>

<p>I have enough of that falling at the feet and those
forgivenesses. I do not answer. Let him fall at Suslovski's
feet who wants to; let Kazia marry Ostrynski!
I have my Eva.</p>

<p>But my silence casts an evident panic on the Suslovski
<span class="pagenum">[544]</span>
family; for a few days later the same messenger
comes with a letter from Kazia, but this time to Antek.</p>

<p>Antek shows me the letter. Kazia prays him to come
for a moment's conversation concerning an affair on
which her whole future depends; she reckons on his
heart, on that sense of justice which from the first
glance of the eye she divined in him. She has the hope
that he will not refuse the prayer of an unhappy woman.
Antek curses, mutters something under his nose about
low Philistines, and about the necessity of hanging both
them and their posterity at the next opportunity; but he
goes.</p>

<p>I divine that they wish to influence me through him.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">ANTEK, who in reality has a soft heart, is won over
evidently. For a week he goes to the Suslovskis
regularly; for three days he walks around me, frowns,
looks at me just like a wolf.</p>

<p>At last one day at tea he inquires peevishly, "Well,
what dost thou think of doing with that girl?"</p>

<p>"With what girl?"</p>

<p>"With that Suslovski, or what is her name?"</p>

<p>"I don't think of doing anything with that Suslovski,
or what is her name."</p>

<p>A moment of silence follows, then Antek speaks
again,&mdash;</p>

<p>"She is whining whole days, till I cannot look at
her."</p>

<p>What an honest soul! At that moment too his voice
trembles with emotion; but he snorts like a rhinoceros
and adds,
<span class="pagenum">[545]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"A decent man does not act in that fashion."</p>

<p>"Antek, thou art beginning to remind me of Papa
Suslovski."</p>

<p>"I would rather remind thee of Papa Suslovski than
wrong his daughter."</p>

<p>"I beg thee to drop me."</p>

<p>"Very well! I can even not know thee at all."</p>

<p>With this, the conversation ends, and thenceforth I do
not speak to Antek.</p>

<p>We pretend not to know each other, which is the more
amusing since we live together. We drink tea together
in the morning, and it never occurs to either of us to
move out of the studio.</p>

<p>The time of my marriage is approaching. Through
the intermediary of "The Kite" all Warsaw knows of
that now. All look at us; all admire Eva. When we
were at the exhibition, they surrounded us so that we
could not push through.</p>

<p>My unknown friendess sends an anonymous letter
in which she warns me that Eva is not the wife for
a man like me.</p>

<p>"I do not believe what is said of the relations between
Panna Adami and Pan Ostrynski [writes my friend<i>ess</i>];
but thou, O master, art in need of a wife who would
devote herself altogether to thy greatness; Panna Adami
is an artist herself, and will always be drawing water
to her own mill."</p>

<p>Antek goes continually to the Suslovskis, but surely
as a comforter, for the Suslovskis must know of my
intentions.</p>

<p>I have obtained an unlimited leave of absence for Eva.
She begins to wear her hair as a village maiden; she
dresses very modestly and wears robes closed to the
neck. This becomes her very much. The scene in the
<span class="pagenum">[546]</span>
dressing-room has not been repeated. Eva does not permit
it. The utmost right I have is to kiss her hands.
That makes me greatly impatient; but I flatter myself
that it affects her in the same way.</p>

<p>She loves me madly. We spend whole days together.
I have begun to give her lessons in drawing. She is
swallowed up in those lectures, and painting in general.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THUNDER hurling Zeus; at what art thou gazing
from the summit of Olympus? Things are done
of which philosophers have never dreamed.</p>

<p>On the eve of my marriage Antek comes to me, nudges
me with his elbow, and, turning aside his dishevelled head,
says gloomily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vladek, dost thou know I have committed a crime?"</p>

<p>"Well, since thou hast mentioned it," I answer, "what
sort of a crime?"</p>

<p>Antek looks at the floor fixedly, and says, as if to
himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That such a drunkard as I, such an idiot without
talent, such a moral and physical bankrupt should marry
such a maiden as Kazia is an out-and-out crime."</p>

<p>I do not believe my ears; but I throw myself on my
friend's neck without regard to the fact that he pushes
me away.</p>

<p>His marriage will be in a couple of days.
<span class="pagenum">[547]</span>
</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">AFTER a residence of some months in Rome, Eva and
I receive a splendid card inviting us to the wedding
of Pan Ostrynski and Panna Helena Turno, primo voto,
Kolchanovski.</p>

<p>We cannot go, for Eva's health does not permit.</p>

<p>Eva paints continually, and makes immense progress.
I receive a gold medal in Pest. A certain rich Croat
bought my picture. I have entered into relations with
Goupil.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">A SON is born to me in Verona.</p>

<p>Eva herself says that she has never seen such a
child.</p>

<p>Uncommon.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">FOR some months we are in Warsaw.</p>

<p>I have fitted up a splendid studio. We visit the
Ostrynskis rather frequently. He has sold "The Kite,"
and is now "President of the Society for Distributing
Barley Grits to Laborers out of Employment." Nothing
can give an idea of his lordliness or the gratitude with
which he is surrounded. He pats me on the shoulder
and says to me: "Well, benefactor!" He patronizes
literary talents also, and receives on Wednesdays.</p>

<p>She is as beautiful as a dream. They have no children.
<span class="pagenum">[548]</span>
</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">OH, save me or I die of laughter. Antek and his wife
have come home from Paris. She poses as the wife
of an artist of golden Bohemia; he wears silk shirts, has a
forelock, and wears his beard wedge-form. I understand
all; I understand that she could overcome his habits, his
character; but how did she conquer his hair?&mdash;that remains
for me an endless puzzle.</p>

<p>Antek has not stopped painting "corpses;" but he
paints also genre pictures of village life. He has great
success. He paints portraits too; these, however, with
less result, for the carnation always recalls the "corpse."</p>

<p>I asked him, through old friendship, if he is happy with
his wife. He told me that he had never dreamed of such
happiness. I confess that Kazia has disappointed me in
a favorable sense.</p>

<p>I too should be perfectly happy, were it not that Eva
begins to be a little weak, and, besides, the poor thing
becomes peevish. I heard her crying once in the night.
I know what that means. She is pining for the theatre.
She says nothing, but she pines.</p>

<p>I have begun a portrait of Pani Ostrynski. She is
simply an incomparable woman! Regard for Ostrynski
would not restrain me, of course, and were it not that to
this hour I love Eva immensely, I know not&mdash;</p>

<p>But I love Eva immensely, immensely!</p>

<p>THE END.

<p class="h2">TRANSLATOR'S NOTES.</p>

<p>Charcoal Sketches were written in the Pico
House, Los Angeles, California, in 1878. Perhaps
the hotel is in existence yet; in that case the register
for the above year contains the signature of Sienkiewicz
and the number of his room. These Charcoal Sketches, as
the author informed me, are founded on facts observed by
him, and give a picture of life in the district where he
was born and where he spent his youth. Ignorance,
selfish class isolation, and resultant social helplessness,
are depicted in remarkable relief and unsparingly. There
is not collective intelligence and strength enough in
Barania-Glova to save Repa's wife from ruin and murder.
Pan Floss is driven from his land of "Little Progress"
and has to pay for Sroda's oxen, which the owner himself
turned in on his neighbor's clover; since Pan Floss is a
noble and Sroda a peasant, the latter thinks himself justified
in taking what he can from the noble in the night or
the daytime, by fair means or foul. Pan Skorabevski
has no wish to annoy himself in aiding peasants; if he
wants anything from them, or wishes to defend himself
against them, he calls in Pan Zolzik. The great public
forces of Barania-Glova are the vile Zolzik, and Shmul
without conscience. Father Chyzik, the priest, considering
that his whole business is with another world, has
no thought for the temporal welfare of Repa's wife.

<p>Tartar Captivity is a sketch preliminary to "With Fire
and Sword." Though it appears as a fragment of a
memoir, it is an original production written by Sienkiewicz
in the style of the seventeenth century. Here the
author uses for the first time the two main historical
elements of Polish society: nobility and the Church.
These two elements were raised to an ideal height in
the Polish mind. Zdaniborski was a noble sincere and
na&iuml;ve, who considered the position and privileges of the
nobility to be as sacred and inviolable as those of the
Church; both he believed to be the direct product of
God's will.</p>

<p>Mayors of the air, referred to in Chapter V., were men
appointed to keep alive fires which would fill the air with
a smoke disagreeable to the plague or pest, and prevent
it, or rather her, from approaching. The plague or pest
in the popular mind was represented as a female who
went around killing people.
<span class="pagenum">[551]</span>
</p>

<p>On the Bright Shore. All persons who have read
"Children of the Soil" will remember Svirski, the sympathetic
artist in that book; this same Svirski is the
hero of the present narrative.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That Third Woman. In this narrative the only character
needing explanation is, I believe, the minstrel.
In Little Russia and the Ukraine the minstrel called
"Kobzar," from kobza, the instrument on which he plays,
and also "Did" (grandfather), because he is generally
old and sometimes blind, is a prominent figure to this
day. In centuries past he played a great part by rousing
popular feeling and carrying intelligence from place to
place. At present his r&ocirc;le is to entertain people who
wish to hear either what the minstrel himself improvises,
or the ballads of that region. The Duma, or ballad of
the Ukraine, is famous.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let Us Follow Him was written somewhat earlier than
"Quo Vadis," and was a tentative sketch in a new field,
as was Tartar Captivity, which preceded "With Fire and
Sword."</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
